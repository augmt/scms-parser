[Overview]

<p>Use it at risk to your own dignity. It won't help in anything. I guess you can say it's fun to use in the NU department, but you should also laugh if it can kill at least one Pokemon in a serious battle.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is almost the best you can get, considering Murkrow cannot take ANY attack. 42 Base Defenses and 60 base HP makes Murkrow not worth it to Haze, Whirlwind or even Feather Dance for that matter. Hidden Power Ground and Drill Peck cover all but 5 Pokemon at least neutral (Zapdos, Aerodactyl, Skarmory, Solrock, and Lunatone), Shadow Ball hits two of them super effective and is also there mostly for lack of other attacks. Double-Edge is almost entirely for Zapdos (STAB Drill Peck hits everything Double-Edge hits for the same power with no recoil, except Electric-types) if you have Hidden Power Ground, and non-Zapdos Electric-types with Hidden Power Rock. Hidden Power Fighting is nice to do some more to Tyranitar, Snorlax, and friends. Steel Wing can be used with Hidden Power Rock primarily, as it hits Rock-types super effective (and also nails things like Regice if you lack Hidden Power Rock).</p>

[SET]

move 1: Mean Look
move 2: Perish Song
move 3: Protect
move 4: Substitute / Taunt
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Oh, damn, this set looks so fun to use. It will need some kind of luck to pull it off, or maybe sleeping an opponent using another member of your team. This could work wonders if used right, and I mean USING IT RIGHT. This can be used as a great Celebi counter, as well. Switch in as it Calm Minds or Leech Seeds, use Mean Look. Your opponent probably going to think, "Oh, it's Murkrow, free set up!" and proceed to Calm Mind. You Perish Song them, and then you've either killed their Celebi or forced them to Baton Pass Perish Song to another Pokemon, so you get an easy kill on whatever. As long as this Murkrow is around, Celebi will have real difficulties Baton Passing anything useful. Taunt can let Murkrow beat Skarmory, who switches in thinking it's walling a Choice Band set.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Murkrow has no other options. Sure, it has Feather Dance, Haze, Calm Mind, Feint Attack, and Whirlwind, but they won't help you at all. Feather Dance will not defeat those Pokemon with Curse or Swords Dance. Feint Attack is the only special attack Murkrow can learn, so it and Calm Mind won't work. Murkrow doesn't have the defenses to pull down those Pokemon that set up with Haze and Whirlwind. Best you can go is going physical.</p>

[EVs]

<p>No choice. Max out Attack and Speed in all of the attacking sets. You COULD give Murkrow at least 300 Speed, but what other stat can those leftover EVs help you out in? Give Murkrow some defensive capabilities for Perish Song. Max Speed is needed if you use Substitute, otherwise, it's not really that important, and you could use more Defense or Special Defense.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Hard-hitting Pokemon with any hitting attack; for example, anything.</p>
