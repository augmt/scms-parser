[Overview]

<p>Chimecho is extremely useful in NU. It can sponge, support, and definitely sweep. Definitely something to watch for on an opponent's team, because being unable to counter it can spell doom.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Calm Mind up and hit things with Psychic if you can. In NU, it actually has sweeping potential as long as you watch out for Murkrow. Hidden Power Electric is mostly to hit Murkrow but can also hit Crawdaunt. Super effective Hidden Power and neutral Psychic have almost the same power (with Hidden Power having a slight advantage), so for most other Pokemon, Psychic is good enough as far as NU goes. If you're feeling adventurous, Chimecho can use Hidden Power Dark to hit other Chimecho. However, then you can't even touch Murkrow and Crawdaunt. This thing can easily sweep with a few Calm Minds under its belt. Reflect is the standard.</p>

<p>Chimecho gets a lot of goodies to support the team with. Pick a few, throw it on your NU team as a special wall, and start rocking. Great Dustox counter as long as you don't get yourself Toxiced.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>Snatch can steal some boosts. Protect works with Toxic and Yawn nicely and can scout Choice Banders. Taunt can prevent Chimecho from getting Toxiced and prevents enemy tanks from Resting off damage. Psywave is an open option if Chimecho needs to get through a Pokemon it can't deal enough damage to.</p>

[EVs]

<p>On the special sweeper, stack some HP and Defense and a lot of Speed. Special Attack and Defense are relatively low priority because most Pokemon in Neverused have low Special Defense and because Calm Mind will be boosting those stats anyway.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Murkrow is one of the best counters, especially if Chimecho lacks Reflect, as it can hit Chimecho with super effective moves and / or use Pursuit. Hidden Power Electric and Ice can deal with it if Chimecho has set up enough however. Crawdaunt also blocks those Chimecho without Hidden Power Electric, as do strong physical attacks before it's allowed to set up.</p>
