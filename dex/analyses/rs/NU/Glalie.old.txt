[Overview]

<p>All Glalie has is Spikes, and there are so many better Spikers in the game. It is faster than and can mess with the two most popular Rapid Spinners, Claydol and Donphan, but Dusclops is ten times better at blocking Rapid Spin and has the capability to use other useful moves as well. It's tied with Roselia for worst Spiker in the game. Snorunt is an arrowhead I guess, so what is this weird-looking Pokemon? Satan's hockey-mask? It looks evil, at least.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Glalie has base 80 stats in everything, so it's kind of like a crappy Celebi. Send it out on something that will run, then lay down some Spikes because that's the only reason you are using this guy, right? Explosion is for when you're all done and their Rapid Spinner is dead. Crunch is for if your opponent switches to a Psychic-type that resists Ice, such as Grumpig, as well as hitting Hypno super effectively. Hidden Power Grass also works for Water-types, which resist Ice Beam, as well as hitting Quagsire on that 4x weakness.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Icicle Spear can be used as a sort of Ninjask counter, but it only works if Ninjask has already Substituted a few times and you've broken it with Ice Beam.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Even with base 80 Defense and HP, Glalie is not much of a Defense hound, so stick to Attack and Special Attack. Max Speed with a +Speed nature ensures that it is faster than Adamant Gligar and Kangaskhan. Split the rest between Attack and Special Attack.</p> 

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Everything that isn't slower and weak to Ice Beam. Registeel destroys this guy with resistances to Ice Beam, Explosion, and Crunch and very high defenses. Besides that, Pokemon.</p>
