[Overview]

<p>I don't know why Nintendo would give us two Dark / Water types and give them both mediocre Special Attack, but Crawdaunt and Sharpedo are both rather worthless in the standard metagame. Sharpedo tends to be better because of its superior Speed. If you want a Swords Dance sweeper, things like Blaziken and Rhydon are far better than Crawdaunt.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is probably rather self explanatory, but you Swords Dance up and then kill things with Return and Hidden Power Rock (preferred over Ancient Power due to PP reasons). Pick either Crunch or Surf if you're worried about things like Ghost-types or Skarmory switching in. Surf will also stop Ground-types like Rhydon and Donphan from coming in to ruin your fun. Hidden Power Rock will also harm Ghost-types quite a bit so whatever. This is about all Crawdaunt is good for.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Knock Off, Endeavor, Taunt. Just by looking at these you could probably make some sort of stupid set to Endeavor a Blissey and then Taunt its Soft-Boiled, but that's the only use I can think of for Taunt on Crawdaunt. Knock Off always does some harm to a team, even if it's just knocking off a Suicune's Leftovers. This matters quite a bit in stall games.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Speed for sweepers is a good idea, but honestly Crawdaunt isn't that great so regardless you won't get much. Split between Special Attack and Attack as you would for a normal mixed Swampert as your Attack will be increased by Swords Dance anyway.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Suicune will easily Roar Crawdaunt, any STAB Electric attack will murder it, and things like Snorlax will smack it around, Swords Dance or not.</p>
