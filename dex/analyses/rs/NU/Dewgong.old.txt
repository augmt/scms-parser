[Overview]

<p>Dewgong is often overlooked, but does the job of NU bulky Water-type quite well with defensive stats far exceeding most other NU Pokemon. Two powerful STAB attacks and Toxic make Dewgong more of a threat.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Dewgong is similar to other bulky Water-types. Surf and Ice Beam both get STAB, which is always great. Even with a moderate Special Attack stat, they will do high amounts of damage to many other NU Pokemon. Rest is standard on Dewgong to give it the ability to regain HP. Encore can screw up many things, forcing Pokemon that used Substitute or tried to boost up to switch out. Toxic might be a common move, but it's still great to help Dewgong stall and do more damage. If you are unsure, Sleep Talk is always a nice alternative, giving Dewgong the ability to attack when it is sleeping.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Signal Beam and Body Slam would require you to have a -Speed nature instead of -Attack. Signal Beam won't come in handy much, but can catch a random Crawdaunt off-guard. Body Slam is for paralysis and should not be used in conjunction with Toxic. Perish Song is good for when your opponent is down to his last Pokemon or you want to force something out. Swagger is dangerous to use but can pay off at times and will commonly force switches.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Dewgong can pound many common NU Pokemon with STAB attacks, so not much Special Attack is necessary; 200 is generally the most you'll need. Max out HP, as that is going to help Dewgong take attacks. Using the rest mainly in Defense with a few in Special Defense is also beneficial for defensive play.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>In NU, Kecleon beats Dewgong easily. Pelipper often carries a super effective Hidden Power Electric or Grass. Other Resting Water-types such as Wailord will counter Dewgong easily. Swalot will stall it as well.</p>
