[Overview]

<p>It has amazing moves in Hypnosis, Trick, Encore, Calm Mind, and Baton Pass, but it can't use them all at the same time. It is really unpredictable though, which is always handy. However, it has absolutely horrid stats to back up this movepool, thus relegating it to NU.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The RS Aipom, with insane movepool and NO stats to use it. Basically, Hypnosis something, Calm Mind up as fast as you can, then Baton Pass the boosts along with a Salac boost if you're lucky. Thunder Punch Skarmory / Suicune if they come to phaze Spinda; it won't do shit to Suicune, but I guess it can hurt Skarmory quite a lot if it tries to do that again / was damaged before. Snatch works so you can get a Substitute or steal from something that tries to set up.</p>

[SET]
name: TrickBand
move 1: Double-Edge
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Focus Punch
move 4: Trick
item: Choice Band
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If you want something that can TrickBand as well as use the Choice Band, Furret is still a better bet, as is Linoone. Or Kecleon. Or Volbeat. Or anything that isn't Spinda. With base 60 Attack, Spinda isn't going to do much, but your opponent probably won't bother switching against it, so you can surprise something with a STAB Choice Band Double-Edge, as well as Tricking Choice Band off to something that comes in to set up such as Skarmory.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Seismic Toss allows you to focus on those crappy Defenses. Teeter Dance can get a few turns to set up, but Hypnosis is still better. Counter is fairly useful though, as it's likely an instant KO if Spinda can survive the hit.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Max Speed and a +Speed nature (Jolly or Timid depending on your offensive move) is preferred as Spinda outspeeds Breloom this way and can Substitute before Spore. Focus on HP and Defenses on the Baton Passing set; max Attack on the Choice Band set.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Just attack it directly or predict and Substitute against its Hypnosis (it might have Snatch and outpredict you, though). Like Aipom, don't try to set up against it; this time you'll get your boosts Snatched off and Baton Passed.</p>
