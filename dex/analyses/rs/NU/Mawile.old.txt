[Overview]

<p>Mawile is great for UU Baton Pass teams and can make some passes in NU as well. It has a lot of easy switch-ins in NU thanks to its great resistances and Intimidate.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Mawile makes a good NU Baton Passer because it's easy to bring in. Pass a Swords Dance to something like Substitute Pidgeot and you may just sweep your opponent's team.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Seeing Mawile's excellent movepool, you expect a huge list here, right? But no, Mawile just doesn't have stats to pull off the majority of what it learns. You can use Counter, which works surprisingly well with Intimidate, making Mawile able to take physical hits--even STAB Earthquakes. There's also the option to use Endure with Salac Berry; passing this and Swords Dance to a physical sweeper could very well announce your victory thanks to Mawile. Use max Speed if you go this route.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Mawile needs at least 94 Speed EVs to outspeed Weezing if you use it in OU. In NU, Speed isn't as useful; you'll want more tankish EVs.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Phazers block Baton Pass sets. Special moves in general and Fire-type moves in particular will kill Mawile easily thanks to its low Special Defense stat. Mawile also has trouble taking Earthquakes, despite Intimidate and its high Defense, thanks to its low HP and weakness.</p>
