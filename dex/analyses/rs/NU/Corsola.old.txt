[Overview]

<p>Look at Corsola. Doesn't it look pretty cool? Has a pretty good movepool, right? So of course it's going to suck! Corsola is really, really bad, has a pretty bad type mix, and has crappy stats in everything but its defenses. It's weak to a lot of stuff, too. Just use it in UU matches and it's an okay utility type of Pokemon and can be an average special sweeper, but it's poor in OU play.</p>

<p>The best you're going to get. All of his movesets except a very select few should use Recover. His Special Attack is better than his Attack, so use his best STAB move, Surf, and Ice Beam for Flying- and Dragon-types, then Toxic to help wear things down. Use psychic if you want more of a pure sweeping set or Calm Mind if you think you can pull it off. Leftovers because Natural Cure takes care of status recovery. Switch out at the sight of Sceptile and Zapdos etc., but try and hit with an Ice Beam on the switch in.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Weird set, but here's how it works: Reflect will bring in a Special Attacker. Light Screen or Amnesia on the switch, then Mirror Coat the subsequent attack and get the hell out of there. Focus Band to try and survive a Grass-type attack and Mirror Coat it back. Recover is there to get your HP back when you find a safe time to switch in. Toxic because once they know what you're up to, all this can do is pseudo-pass. Not too bad of a set, and it takes advantage of Corsola's good defenses.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Ancient Power / Rock Blast / Hidden Power Rock
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Surf / Psychic
move 4: Explosion / Earthquake / Hidden Power Fighting
item: Choice Band
ability: Hustle
nature: Brave
evs: 188 HP / 252 Atk / 70 SpA
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choose your favorite Rock-type move, but remember that Hustled Rock Blast only has 64% accuracy. Explosion is powerful but extremely risky with Hustle, so you may want to go with Earthquake. Hidden Power Fighting is really just for Tyranitar, though it hits Blissey harder than anything but a Rock Blast with 4 or 5 hits. Psychic for Weezing, Surf for Skarmory, standard CB fare. Always use Hustle with this for the extra pop, though I will admit a Natural Curing CBer is interesting. Too bad he doesn't have the Attack to back it up.</p>

[SET]
name: Support
move 1: Toxic
move 2: Confuse Ray / Reflect / Light Screen
move 3: Recover
move 4: Mirror Coat / Surf
item: Leftovers
ability: Natural Cure
nature: Calm

<p>Pure support set. Toxic, either confuse the enemy or pseudo-pass Reflect or Light Screen, then Mirror Coat if you can. You can also put one of the pseudo-passing move over Mirror Coat, or use both and no Confuse Ray, but Mirror Coat is its best way to do damage. Probably won't do very much, but its worth a shot.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Not much to say here. You could try Ingrain if you are Baton Passing to it, or along with Amnesia, Barrier, and Recover or Refresh as some sort of pseudo-stalling set, but I wouldn't recommend it. Screech might force a switch or two, and Refresh is purely for stalling, as it already has Natural Cure. When the Pokemoning is over, Corsola makes an excellent hockey puck.</p>

[EVs]

<p>For the standard set, give it max Special Attack unless you are Calm Minding, and even then still give it near max and put the rest in Defenses with a Modest nature. For the Choice Band set, screw Speed, as its slow as hell anyway, and just give it max Attack and a Brave nature with the rest in HP and Special Attack. For the support and Mirror Coating set, give it max Special Defense and split the rest in HP and Defense with a Calm nature. That's it, really, but always try and take advantage of its good defenses no matter which set you are using.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Jolteon, Raikou, Sceptile, Venusaur with a Grass-type move, just about any Grass- or Electric-type Pokemon (except for the Choice Band set, maybe). Suicune will neutralize him, anything that can take a hit and OHKO or 2HKO him works; lots of stuff counters him. Just run when you know you're beat.</p>
