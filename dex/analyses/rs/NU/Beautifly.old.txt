[Overview]

<p>Don't use Beautifly. I just did this analysis because no one else would. Or you can use it on NU teams; 90 Special Attack isn't that bad. Beautifly is begging for Sleep Powder, damn Nintendo.</p>

[SET]
name: Paralyzer
move 1: Stun Spore
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Morning Sun
move 4: Hidden Power Bug / Hidden Power Flying / Giga Drain / Psychic 
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid / Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Bug-types tend to suck and Beautifly is no exception-actually, it's the third worst Bug-type Pokemon after Shuckle and Beautifly's cousin Dustox. Stun Spore something and, if you aren't dead, use Substitute until your opponent switches or is fully paralyzed or you can't use it anymore. If your opponent switches, Stun Spore the next Pokemon; otherwise, attack. This set dies pretty easily but it's the best thing Beautifly can do.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Shadow Ball can be useful for surprising Ghost-types maybe; Thief is also an option because stealing an item is more or less the best thing Beautifly can do. Silver Wind and Aerial Ace are options over Hidden Power Bug and Hidden Power Flying respectively.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Just max out Beautifly's Attack or Special Attack and Speed and give it a Timid or Jolly nature because it absolutely won't last long.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Basically every move with more than 60 Base Power not named Earthquake OHKOes Beautifly. You'll want to hit it first because it will Stun Spore you. If you have a Guts user, just switch it in.</p>
