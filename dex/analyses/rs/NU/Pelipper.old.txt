[Overview]

<p>Pelipper is generally outclassed by other Pokemon, but it's a decent wall in NU. The weakness to Rock really brings it down though.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Pelipper has a very good Defense stat, allowing it to wall Pokemon like Kingler. Hidden Power Electric can be used to hit them hard, or you can Substitute for Toxic stalling.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Pelipper has decent defenses for an NU Pokemon and can wall some non-Rock, non-Choice Band Normal Pokemon there. RestTalk helps keep it alive.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Pelipper is one of those Pokemon that lack a good movepool. You can steal items with Thief right when Pelipper might be KOed next turn.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Well, maxing out Special Attack could help a lot. Pelipper does have base 100 Defense, so choosing to give it some Defense EVs doesn't hurt at all. Still, you'll have to give some HP EVs in order to make it a defensive tank.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything faster than Pelipper is one way to take it down. The other way is anything else; it's just not a Gyarados / Mantine.</p>
