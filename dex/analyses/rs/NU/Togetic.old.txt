[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Keep using Ancient Power, hope to get the boost (20% chance with Serene Grace), beat the crap out of the Skarmory that comes to Roar / Whirlwind you. Pity Togetic doesn't get Thunderbolt or Thunder to deal with both Skarmory and Suicune. Togetic needs Fire Blast to 2HKO Skarmory, but if you absolutely hate missing, Flamethrower is still an option. You have a 33.6% chance to get one Ancient Power boost, 29.4% chance to get 2 boosts, a 14.7% chance to get 3 boosts, and a 5.52% chance to get 4 or more boosts, assuming you hit with all 8 PP.</p>

move 2: Counter
move 3: Soft-Boiled / Light Screen / Reflect

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a 2v2 set. Use this with a Pokemon with a way to set up and a good attack stat. People might use Rock Slide to hit both Pokemon, so Counter them back. Thunder Wave is a good support move, and Soft-Boiled is for healing, though Togetic can't survive many attacks in 2v2.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Charm helps against physical attackers, and Yawn can force switches.</p>

<p>Togetic learns many support moves, figure something out yourself. The above sets are just random ideas that came to mind--you can pass Wishes, Mirror Move Spikes, etc.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Togetic has excellent Special Defense and nice Defense, so boost HP and one of those stats.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any STAB Rock-type attack can KO Togetic. It is also weak offensively. You can easily Substitute against it and boost your stats or just pound it with attacks. But watch out for Thunder Wave.</p>
