[Overview]

<p>Delcatty is worse than Ledian, but try it if you want. Heal Bell in UU just doesn't work.</p>

<p>Delcatty gets Baton Pass too. Sing is used to buy some time, and Thunderbolt is for Skarmory and Suicune. You can go with Thunder and max out Special Attack to kill Skarmory in one hit. This is probably the most useful Delcatty set.</p>

<p>Being a Normal-type, Delcatty has an excellent movepool, but unfortunately, its stats are poor. Thunder Wave is the best thing Delcatty can do, and Heal Bell is also pretty good as Delcatty is fairly fast. Double-Edge and Thunderbolt are recommended because Delcatty needs an attacking move, while Wish provides healing (even though Delcatty won't last long), and Sing can immobilize one of your opponent's Pokemon. Charm is for shutting down some Pokemon by lowering their Attack.</p>

<p>Calm Mind once or twice, and if you survive, BoltBeam. Sing is also good here, as it can give you at least one turn to Calm Mind. Delcatty has to boost its stats to damage anything.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Return can be used over Double-Edge, but Delcatty can't hit anything anyway, so recoil wont hurt that much. Covet is also an option because you might steal Leftovers from something like Skarmory.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Stick to the EVs provided above.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything with a good attack can easily KO Delcatty.</p>
