[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A Choice Band set is probably the best choice for Piloswine. It can easily survive Blissey's Seismic Tosses and can Ice Beam stuff like Skarmory, Claydol, and Flygon.<p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Piloswine is one of the worst Ground-types in the game. What can you do with it? Absolutely nothing. Surprisingly, its Attack isn't horrible, so Earthquake can do damage to things. Its type is trash, giving it weaknesses to Steel and Fighting while removing a resistance to Rock--and unlike Rhydon, it doesn't resist Normal. Anyway, use Light Screen to reduce the amount of damage it will take from Surf, and Earthquake away. This set is worthless against Suicune, who will just Roar it out.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Don't you love how Piloswine learns nothing original? Icicle Spear can beat Ninjask like Roar can, and Toxic is... Toxic. Reflect is an option as well.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Mostly Attack and HP because Piloswine can't really outspeed anything or take many hits.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any Water-type--especially Suicune. Also, anything sturdy, like Regice, Celebi, etc.</p>
