[Overview]

<p>Outside of the NU metagame, there's really nothing Minun can do that can't be done better by something else. Jolteon can Baton Pass Substitutes, Pikachu and Raichu can Substitute + Encore, etc. In NU, though, Minun combines all of these and is one of the best special threats that doesn't need some kind of weather set up. It has less attacking power than Plusle though, so you might want to stick with him instead. Minun is by no means a bad NU Electric-type though.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Minun should not be venturing outside of NU, but inside that safe zone, it shines as one of the best special sweepers available. The last move is up to personal preference. Depending on the choice, Minun can Baton Pass Substitutes or Encore a Leech Seed or Toxic once safely behind one. This makes a good lead (especially the Baton Pass version) as its counters are rarely leads themselves, meaning Minun can usually get its Substitute up safely and follow its plan.</p> 

[SET]
name: Pseudo-passer
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice / Seismic Toss
move 3: Light Screen
move 4: Wish
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 80 SpA / 176 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Minun makes a decent special wall for NU. Light Screen and Wish let it take virtually any special abuse imaginable. Hidden Power Grass, as usual, hits Whiscash, Hidden Power Ice hits Grass-types, but Seismic Toss lets Minun deal with other Plusle and Minun more effectively, while still doing moderate damage to some Grass-types.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Agility can go on a Baton Pass Minun if you like. It can also hold Petaya if you want to Substitute down to get the boost and try to sweep late-game, but Plusle works better as a sweeper because of its higher Special Attack stat. Toxic and Thunder Wave are available to inflict status when you can't think of anything better to do.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Max Speed and Special Attack. Timid will allow Minun to beat Jolly Pidgeot and Adamant Raticate, but it won't be OHKOing most Whiscash with Hidden Power Grass. Modest will give it a chance with more power.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Sunflora, Parasect, and Roselia can stop the Hidden Power Grass variant. Whiscash can stop ones with Hidden Power Ice. Trapinch can survive anything Minun uses against it, but this is dangerous, as Minun can always threaten Petaya. Swalot and Kecleon will make Minun switch a few times, but both take a decent amount of damage from Thunderbolt. Wigglytuff and enemy Minun can both come in, Light Screen, and Wish themselves better.</p>
