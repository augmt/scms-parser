[Overview]

<p>Without question, Butterfree is one of the worst Pokemon in the game. It's not good enough for standard, it's not good enough for UU (Scyther outclasses it, among many others), and even amongst the NU Pokemon, there are still plenty of other choices in Ledian, Ariados, and Dustox. Its main use is using Sleep Powder and other status moves to delay opponents from hitting your other Pokemon.</p>

[SET]
name: Double Powder
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Stun Spore / Toxic
move 3: Psychic
move 4: Hidden Power Fire
item: Quick Claw / Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 Spe / 252 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Using Butterfree in standard play is automatic suicide. The best way to use this set is to come in on a Choice Banded Earthquake, a slower Earthquake, or a predicted switch to a slower Pokemon and then use Sleep Powder. If you're sure you put something to sleep that is not a Sleep Talker, either start attacking or try to inflict more status on the switch with Stun Spore or Toxic. Psychic hits Heracross and Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types. In a pinch, you can always pray for Quick Claw to activate to get that Sleep Powder in. Compound Eyes will make sure it hits.</p>

<p>The same goes for switching in when using Butterfree in UU. Sleep Talk is less common in UU, but Pokemon are more offensive in general, so it's still dangerous. Using this set in NU play is not a bad idea at all, though you may want to use other attacking moves.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Silver Wind
move 2: Aerial Ace
move 3: Sleep Powder
move 4: Hidden Power Fighting / Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Rock
item: Choice Band
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band Butterfree is decent for a Butterfree set, but Heracross, Scyther, and even Ledian do it much better in any metagame. Use it in NU play for a surprise. Sleep Powder is the only advantage Butterfree will have over them. You can use an attacking move first to hit the sleep absorber they'll likely bring in, and then save sleep for later when they think you have a pure attacking set. Shadow Ball is another option to hit Banette.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Thanks to Compound Eyes, all of Butterfree's moves are fairly accurate, so you can use Swagger and just hope your opponent hits himself in confusion all the time. Toxic is an alternative to Stun Spore, if you're into that. Thief steals some item--make sure not to attach anything to Butterfree if you're using it. Giga Drain can be used for Whiscash in NU.</p>

[EVs]

<p>You'll always want to max Speed for Butterfree to get in that Sleep Powder or Choice Banded hit. Stack an attacking stat if you're using one, or pump some HP to live through an Ice Beam.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>With weaknesses to some of the most prominent attacks in the game (Rock Slide, Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Flying-type moves) and the same capability of taking hits as a wet piece of paper, I'm sure you can find some way of beating Butterfree. Sleep Talk also negates Butterfree's main use: putting something to sleep. Generally, switch in something that can afford going to sleep, then send in anything that can hurt it or set up. In the NU environment, good bets are Whiscash (if there's no Giga Drain), Ledian, Dustox (Psychic will do little, especially with Light Screen), Murkrow, Pidgeot (beware of Stun Spore), Mawile, and Lickitung.</p>
