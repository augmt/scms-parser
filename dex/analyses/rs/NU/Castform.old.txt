[Overview]

<p>Castform is a very cool Pokemon. I didn't think so when ADV first came out, but I came around over time. It is a real shame, as is the case with most cool Pokemon, that it sadly isn't good enough to fit into the standard metagame. However, it is still fun to use against new players.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Flamethrower
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Thunder Wave
item: Leftovers
nature: Modest
evs: 129 HP/ 252 SpA / 129 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Castform actually does decently well as a special attacker, as long as they don't switch in something that doesn't have a weakness to it (any Normal-type). Its main problem is its tendency to die quickly.</p>

[SET]
name: Sunny Day
move 1: Thunderbolt / Ice Beam
move 2: Flamethrower / Weather Ball
move 3: Solar Beam
move 4: Sunny Day
item: Leftovers
nature: Modest
evs: 129 HP/ 252 SpA / 129 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Weather Ball has 5 more Base Power, but it loses the chance to burn things. Flamethrower also has 5 more PP, but Castform will never survive to use even half of Weather Ball's PP anyway. It seems to be able to 2HKO a lot of things, but it is completely ineffective against things like Blissey and Gyarados. Tyranitar could screw up this set if it catches you on a Solar Beam, especially if it has Substitute. If it's Tyraniboah, that Substitute can hurt you pretty badly. This set can actually beat Suicune head-to-head assuming Castform gets a free Sunny Day. The time I tested it though, Castform barely survived, so there is probably a good amount of luck involved. It was still cool though.</p>

[SET]
name: Rain Dance
move 1: Weather Ball
move 2: Thunder / Thunderbolt
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Rain Dance
item: Leftovers
nature: Modest
evs: 129 HP/ 252 SpA / 129 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>You can go with Thunderbolt if you don't want to rely on having Rain Dance up, although having Rain Dance up is the entire point of even using this (novelty) set. This set already relies on having Rain Dance for Weather Ball though, and you need all the power you can get. Tyranitar ruins this set.</p>

[SET]
name: Hail
move 1: Weather Ball
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Thunder Wave / Flamethrower
move 4: Hail
item: Leftovers
nature: Modest
evs: 129 HP/ 252 SpA / 129 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Even more novelty as you aren't even getting power boosts from the weather, just Leftovers negation on your opponent. This is just a worse version of the general special set.</p>

[EVs]

<p>I didn't put much in Speed when I was testing Castform. It is already so delicate that I felt it was much more important to make sure it could both withstand and dish out attacks. My EVs were pretty much 252 Attacking Stat/252 Defensive Stat/4 Speed. Nature could be either +Attack or +Defense. I tried to compensate for its lack of defenses by concentrating on only one defensive stat and using it only against Pokemon primarily of that alignment. Although it melts against attacks it isn't designed to take, this setup actually gives it decent durability. It is more vulnerable, but it is probably more effective overall. Castform really is not designed to be easy to play. If you really wanted to use mixed defenses go ahead, but I don't think it would be effective at all. I would like to see how Castform does in the UU metagame, however, which I sadly haven't played at all.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Tyranitar counters almost any Castform, except perhaps ones with HP Fighting. Almost anything can potentially counter Castform. However, Castform is pretty versatile (considering that is the whole idea of him even having Forecast and Weather Ball) and you have a decent shot at surprising your opponent and maybe even scoring a kill. I don't think most people are aware of the attack options available to Castform (as far as types go). However, you probably aren't going to hurt anyone who's on top of their game (since they are evil and will just switch a wall in), but Castform is pretty fun to use regardless.</p>
