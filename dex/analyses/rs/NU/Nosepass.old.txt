[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A magnificent Skarmory counter. Taunt its Whirlwinds, and proceed to Thunderbolt it to pieces. Drill Peck does nothing against Nosepass's base 135 Defense. Mimic is to take Spikes from Skarmory. After you kill Skarmory, Explode or something. That is the full extent of Nosepass's abilities. Fire Punch allows it to do something similar to Forretress, especially Hidden Power Ghost or Zap Cannon Forretress or any other variant that isn't running Earthquake, though even if it has Earthquake, Nosepass kills it faster with Fire Punch than it kills Nosepass with Earthquake. If Forretress lacks Earthquake, however, you can use Mimic easier.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Zap Cannon can paralyze stuff while doing a good 25% to Milotic, and Block can uh... keep Blissey from switching out while you Explode. Earthquake can beat Magneton, but Thunderbolt 2HKOes Nosepass.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Special Attack and Attack. If you lack a physical move, obviously Attack EVs are wasted, and thus 252 HP / 252 Special Attack is a good spread. Relaxed could work to boost that nice Defense stat (Bold without Attack).</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything that isn't Skarmory and sometimes Forretress.</p>
