[Overview]

<p>Torkoal has excellent Defense, but its lack of Speed and very limited movepool are why it's where it's now: very rarely, if ever, used. A bonus you might overlook in OU is that Torkoal's ability is White Smoke, so if anyone sends out Salamence or Gyarados against it, Intimidate won't lower Torkoal's Attack, so it can still fire off full power Rock Slides at them (too bad Torkoal's Attack is less than stellar, so they won't really mind the hits all that much) and its Explosion won't be weakened.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Fire Blast / Overheat
move 3: Rock Slide / Return / Hidden Power Fighting
move 4: Explosion
item: Leftovers
nature: Relaxed
evs: 252 HP / 184 Atk / 72 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is probably the best set Torkoal has to offer. Torkoal is already slower than Snorlax and Dusclops, so don't worry about Curse lowering its Speed. Its movepool isn't the greatest, but at least it gets Explosion to nearly guarantee a knockout.</p>

[SET]
name: Yawn
move 1: Yawn
move 2: Explosion
move 3: Fire Blast / Overheat
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Grass
item: Leftovers
nature: Relaxed
evs: 252 HP / 184 SpA / 72 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is usable in either OU or UU. In OU, use this in conjunction with Spikes to force switches. You then have the Hidden Power to take on either Swampert or Salamence. In UU, this set is good all around for tanking while dishing out the damage you can.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Explosion
move 2: Overheat
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Fighting / Hidden Power Bug
item: Choice Band
nature: Brave
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Torkoal is too slow to pull this off most of the time, but it could be surprising for incoming Gligar and Solrock. If you're playing NU or have a theme team, this Torkoal can do a lot more damage with paralysis support.</p>

[SET]
name: Staller
move 1: Iron Defense / Fire Blast / Flamethrower 
move 2: Amnesia
move 3: Toxic
move 4: Rest
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 176 Def / 80 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is a stalling tank with Toxic. Taking advantage of Torkoal's already high Defense, which it can boost, it boosts up its Special Defense while Resting to stay alive.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 120 SpA / 136 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Torkoal's movepool is so limited that it really doesn't mind the loss of two moveslots to Rest and Sleep Talk. Torkoal tries to use its high base Defense to its advantage so it can stick around longer. Because of it, Torkoal can switch into stuff like Choice Band Megahorn and Meteor Mash all day long.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Torkoal can use Sludge Bomb for the 30% chance to poison, but because the only type it hits super effective is Grass and Torkoal already has that covered with STAB Fire, it's not going to get much use. Other than that, there's not much Torkoal can do, as its movepool is really limited.</p>

[EVs]

<p>For any set that isn't the Choice Band set, it's ideal to always max out Torkoal's HP to give it the most defensive power possible. From there, you'll want to invest a bit in whatever attacking stat you're using and put the rest into your defenses.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>In OU, just about any Water-type walls Torkoal. In UU, it needs to be careful of Solrock, Lunatone, Gligar, and bulky Water-types such as Blastoise, Quagsire, and Walrein.</p>
