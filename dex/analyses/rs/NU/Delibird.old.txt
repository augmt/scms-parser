[Overview]

<p>Damn you're cool, Delibird. Too bad your stats blow. Oh well, you can still be used to some degree of success in the UU metagame; just predict well and you'll take out a few things if your luck with Hustle is good.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Okay, Choice Band Delibird. With near-max Attack, Choice Band, and Hustle, he can do some damage. Your main attack will be Aerial Ace, as it negates the accuracy you lose from Hustle. Ice Beam is there because it gets STAB and runs off of Delibird's above average Special Attack. Focus Punch if you manage to predict a switch (though I don't know why anyone would switch out against Delibird), Quick Attack for injured pokes/SubRevvers or EndRevvers (though watch out for its 80% accuracy), and HP Ground for Rock- and Steel-types that you can't get with Focus Punch. Purely hit and run, this thing isn't staying in vs. ANYTHING.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Pity Delibird doesn't learn Spikes anymore, he'd probably be low-tier UU then. Rapid Spin makes him only the second Pokemon able to Rapid Spin and immune to Spikes at the same time. Unfortunately, he can't take a hit worth crap. But it's an interesting choice for a UU Rapid Spinner. Counter is pretty lol, though if he does survive a hit, you can be sure he'll kill the other Pokemon.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Give him about 240 Speed, enough to outspeed Breloom and pals. Put the rest in Attack and Special Attack, and make him Lonely, Naughty, Mild, or Rash, depending on if you want more Special Attack or Attack. Putting his defenses down isn't going to make him die any worse. If you are Countering or Rapid Spinning, put more in HP and defenses, but don't hope for much.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Prediction, anything that's faster than it, Shuckle. Just about everything in the game can nullify it, and as with all Choice Band users, prediction destroys it. Please don't use it in OU matches. It'll die. Quickly.</p>
