[Overview]

<p>Pretty bad, an absolutely horrible movepool and below average stats really make it unusable outside of NU environment, and rather horrible there, as well. What did you expect from a Pokemon you can get so early on anyway?</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Hidden Power Fighting
move 3: Body Slam / Poison Fang
move 4: Iron Tail
item: Choice Band
nature: Jolly
evs: 48 HP / 252 Atk / 208 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Mightyena's only good thing is probably its trait (Intimidate), which helps him switch in, the rest is average at best. This set is your main hope of doing damage. At least Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting cannot be resisted outright. The last move is really a filler: Mightyena's movepool is worthless.</p>

[SET]
name: Howl
move 1: Howl / Snatch
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Hidden Power Fighting
move 4: Counter / Body Slam
item: Leftovers / Salac Berry
nature: Jolly
evs: 48 HP / 252 Atk / 208 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Non-Choice Band Mightyena looks like this. Howl if you can find the time (you won't), and fire away with your attacks. Intimidate and Counter work together nicely, you can try to switch on the opponent's switch to a physical Pokemon, Intimidate, and Counter its weakened hit. Or you could Body Slam and hope for paralysis. Snatch is a very hot alternative for Howl, if you can Snatch a Dragon Dance or a Swords Dance you might end up killing stuff.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>The possibilities are endless. Not. Yawn, Substitute and Thief are the only things I'd consider on him. Yawn is actually quite useful, the other two are learned by about everything but are always useful. Further you've got stuff like Sleep Talk, Toxic, Taunt, and Roar, moves Mightyena really won't do anything with. I suppose you could Taunt Skarmory to prevent Spikes and switch to any Special Pokemon not weak to Flying attacks...</p>

[EVs]

<p>Put in minimally enough for 250 Speed and max Attack for Choice Band set, and toss leftover EVs into HP. If you use Salac Berry on the second set, max out Speed and Attack. With Leftovers, either same as the first, or focus on HP and Attack, which is wise if you use Counter.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything that can take a hit from him: Skarmory, Suicune, even Cloyster and Forretress run over him. The Choice Band moveset is of course countered by hopefully playing your switches right, other variants are quite weak and faster Pokemon will usually gain the upper hand easily, especially Special ones because they avoid Intimidate and Counter.</p>
