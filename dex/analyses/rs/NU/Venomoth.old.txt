[Overview]

<p>Venomoth is not great. It doesn't even do all that well in UU, though it can work as a Baton Passer on an NU team.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Sleep Powder
move 4: Sludge Bomb / Signal Beam / Silver Wind
item: Liechi Berry / Salac Berry
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Try and come in on something that Venomoth will scare off (likely with the threat of Sleep Powder), and use Substitute. Then Baton Pass to a Pokemon that will be able to take the hit given by the enemy and still keep the Substitute up. Later in the battle, you'll want to use Sleep Powder on something to buy yourself another free turn when they think they've caught on. Your last Substitute will also activate your berry, so you can pass that boost, too.</p>

<p>Sludge Bomb has significantly more power than the Bug moves, and is generally better than Signal Beam, but if you don't like Poison's coverage, you can give Signal Beam a shot. Silver Wind is here as an option solely for the 10% chance to boost all your stats. If you can get that boost and Baton Pass it, you may have won yourself the game, depending on their team and who you pass to.</p>

<p>If you want to pass stronger Substitutes, you can lower your Speed as low as 281 in NU to still be faster than Adamant Pidgeot, and you can drop virtually all of your Attack to pump HP a bit.</p>

<p>Good luck switching this thing in. When you get it done, put one of your opponents to sleep. They will most likely switch, so paralyze or poison whatever comes in next. You have now done about everything you can with Venomoth.</p>

[SET]
name: Screech
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Screech

<p>Sleep Powder something slow, then Screech the switch to hopefully hurt something. Metagross is going to own you more than badly.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Sludge Bomb
move 2: Signal Beam
move 3: Hidden Power Rock / Hidden Power Ground
move 4: Sleep Powder
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hidden Power Rock and Hidden Power Ground both hit the rare Fire-type. Hidden Power Rock has the advantage vs. Flying Pokemon, whereas Hidden Power Ground can hit Steels somewhat. Sleep Powder can still work on this set, as it's one of the few things Venomoth does well.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>It learns some special attacks like Giga Drain and Psychic, but it's more important to stick to STAB, despite the crappy Attack. It gets some more stuff in the physical department like Aerial Ace and Double-Edge, but this stuff sucks as well. Thief is the only decent other option, to steal an item before dying.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Max Speed so you can get a sleep in. Then max Attack (or Special Attack if you use special-based moves). Venomoth dies to almost anything, so don't bother with defenses / HP, unless you're passing a Substitute.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Mawile's Intimidate can ruin Venomoth's ability to Baton Pass, and it absorbs any physical hits, even Choice Band Hidden Power Ground, with relative ease. Sudowoodo takes hits just as well (but has to watch out for the special Venomoth with Giga Drain), and has STAB Rock Slide to KO Venomoth. Murkrow is immune to Sleep Powder.</p>
