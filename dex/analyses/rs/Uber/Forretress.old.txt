<p>Forretress has a lot of useful resistances in Ubers, including Psychic, Ice, and Dragon as well as Toxic. Hidden Power Bug 2HKOes Latias, Latios, Mewtwo, and the like and OHKOes Deoxys-A. Forretress can set up Spikes and use Rapid Spin to get rid of Spikes set up by enemy Forretress and Deoxys-D. Counter lets it take a hit from the likes of Rayquaza, Groudon, and the rare Heracross and OHKO back. It also helps against physical Tyranitar. Hidden Power is also always countered, regardless of its type, so if you encounter a Hidden Power Fire Forretress, you can take the hit, survive with the Special Defense EVs (enemy Forretress needs near max Special Attack and sunlight to OHKO this Forretress spread), and OHKO it back, leaving the way clear for your Spikes to dominate. The given EVs ensure Forretress will always survive a +1 Special Attack Deoxys-A Thunder, so you're safe from anything but the rare Fire Punch on that end.</p>
