<p>A common scenario for Blissey is to be up against a Latias. Latias used Safeguard, and suddenly Blissey's efforts are rather worthless. This is no longer the case. Latias used Safeguard, in comes Blissey. Blissey uses Icy Wind twice or thrice (depending on Latias's Speed), sets up a Light Screen, and then uses Toxic as Latias fails to Safeguard in time, because it has lost 2-3 Speed levels. Then Blissey can just Soft-Boiled stall and refresh Light Screen when necessary. This set also beats Taunt Mewtwo nicely.</p>

<p>Psych Up Blissey does a good job of countering most Calm Mind users (Kyogre in particular), and Wish helps teams a lot in general. Sometimes it just falls short of beating Recovering Ubers (especially Lugia), though, and it can have trouble with Pressure as well; therefore, you can use Serene Grace and hope for a lucky freeze or paralysis. Beware of Taunt. If you run into a Taunt Mewtwo, just keep using Thunder until it's paralyzed (Serene Grace helps here boosting it to a 60% chance of paralysis), and then you can use Psych Up.</p>

[EVs]

<p>You'll need max Special Defense and a Calm nature for Blissey in Ubers that don't raise their Special Defense via Calm Mind or Psych Up. For those Blissey, Calm alone probably adds enough, giving room for more Special Attack. Don't make the mistake a lot of people make and give Blissey no Defense EVs in Ubers; Blissey can still take a Rayquaza's Choice Banded Extreme Speed and use Ice Beam or Toxic.</p>
