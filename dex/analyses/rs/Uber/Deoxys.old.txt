[Overview]

<p>Deoxys-A is generally the better pick between the two offensively based Deoxys formes as its Attack and Special Attack stats are far superior to that of this Deoxys.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Sweeper
move 1: Superpower / Calm Mind
move 2: Thunderbolt / Thunder
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Substitute
item: Petaya Berry
nature: Mild
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>You'll probably want Deoxys's HP to be divisible by four, in case of Tyranitar, so you can activate your Petaya at 1/4 instead of 1 HP. Unlike Deoxys-A, Calm Mind is a lot less of an option, because Deoxys doesn't force switches as well due to its lower Attack.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Superpower
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Fire Punch / Thunder / Ice Beam
move 4: Extreme Speed
item: Choice Band
nature: Lonely
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band Deoxys basically fails in every regard compared to Deoxys-A, but if you want to still use this Deoxys forme, it can work, but to a lesser degree.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There is virtually nothing else viable. Psycho Boost can be used, but it won't really hit anything harder than Deoxys's other moves.</p>

[EVs]

<p>360 Speed minimum, generally max. Max out Special Attack for the first set, Attack for the second. Don't even bother with defenses. This is from Deoxys-A, but basically it stands correct.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Just attack away at this thing. It has better defensive stats than Deoxys-A, but just like Deoxys-A, it can be taken down easily.</p>
