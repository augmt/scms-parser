<p>Lanturn has few purposes in Uber matches, but it accomplishes those very well. Lanturn makes a great Kyogre counter, for one. Thunder will break its Substitutes even after a Calm Mind, thanks to STAB, and Lanturn can then Toxic it when it decides that the best option is to either attack or Calm Mind again. It beats Thunder + Ice Beam Latias and Latios in the same way, except it usually doesn't need to break any Substitutes, but has Ice Beam to do a bit of damage. Boltbeaming Mewtwo and Deoxys-A also go down to Lanturn. Ice Beam also hits Groudon and Rayquaza switch-ins. Amnesia helps to stall out Pokemon once Lanturn Toxics them, so they don't get the bright idea of just Calm Minding up and doing massive damage with Surf or whatever. Protect also helps with Toxic stalling, but is useful for checking Choice Band movesets as well. Surf is Lanturn's only hope at damaging Metagross, and, to a lesser extent, Forretress outside of rain without having to rely on Thunder hitting. As Ice Beam isn't that useful, you could also go with Rest or Sleep Talk. Mimic can be used to have Lanturn learn Calm Mind.</p>
