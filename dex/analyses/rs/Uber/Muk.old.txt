[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to Sticky Hold and a Toxic immunity, Muk can come in on Deoxys-D, and it threatens everything that relies on Recover for health with its own Toxic. Cursing up shouldn't be too hard with Muk's great Special Defense. Hit Metagross and Psychic Jirachi (the latter is uncommon) on the switch with Hidden Power Ground.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>Body Slam can paralyze the opponent, and paralysis is always good. Imprison is very unorthodox and works in very rare circumstances; stay away from it until you've tried out the standard Muk. Memento can make your opponent's Pokemon harmless, so you can set up a Belly Drum user next turn. Explosion is more recommended for suicide, though. Thunder and Fire Blast are alternative options for hurting Skarmory and some other counters. Thunderbolt and Flamethrower are as well, but its generally better to take advantage of Thunder and Fire Blast's higher Base Power (as well as Thunder's higher paralysis chance). Rest, with or without Sleep Talk, makes your Muk live longer. It's really an easy switch for counters though.</p>
