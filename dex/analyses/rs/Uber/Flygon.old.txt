<p>Flygon in Uber play is interesting. It resists Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Fire-type moves, so it can counter Groudon to an extent as long as it doesn't eat Hidden Power Bug or Ghost all the time. It pretty much needs Solar Beam to hurt it decently though, and you need to be careful when using that. You do not want Kyogre to come in on Solar Beam, as it will take a turn to charge and Flygon will be stuck and Ice Beamed to death. Hidden Power Ghost is for the obvious Latios or Latias switch-in; Fire Blast is for Forretress and Skarmory mostly.</p>
