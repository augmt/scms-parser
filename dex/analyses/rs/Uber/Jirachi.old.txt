[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Jirachi has some great resistances to take advantage of in Ubers, as it is immune to Toxic and resists Dragon Claw and Ice Beam. It's one of the few usable Pokemon that resists Normal and Meteor Mash as well. Thunder takes advantage of Kyogre's rain with a 100% accurate move with a 60% chance of paralysis. Ice Punch hits Latios, Latias, Rayquaza, and Groudon hard. Psychic is not needed, as it's a very bad attack type in Ubers. This set easily beats Blissey and Deoxys-D, although Knock Off is a pain. Substitute can be used to block Knock Off and critical hits as you Calm Mind up, but Wish gives Jirachi more longevity and heals your whole team. If you ever find something you can't deal with, Jirachi can just use Thunder and most likely paralyze it, or if you're feeling really lucky or desperate, it can Ice Punch and hope for the 20% freeze. Jirachi can beat Kyogre if it gets a free Calm Mind, too.</p>
