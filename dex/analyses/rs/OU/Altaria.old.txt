<p>Dragon Dance Altaria is pretty much an inferior Salamence. Its only niche is its Natural Cure ability, which allows Altaria to heal itself with Rest and hit the road when it knows it's beaten. Put in a Fire move if you want Altaria to beat Skarmory one-on-one, but sticking with Rest is recommended as Altaria maintains the option of Resting and switching out when big bad Skarmory comes in. Fortunately, Skarmory is not in the same metagame as Altaria, who is UU, and thus won't be seen much.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pretty much anything that walls Salamence would wall Altaria; common examples are Suicune, Milotic, and Swampert. As it's weak offensively, even Snorlax and Blissey can repeatedly switch in and take next to nothing. Dragon Dance variants are stopped by Skarmory and Zapdos. Regice, Lapras and other strong Ice Beam users are more offensive ways to take care of it.</p>
