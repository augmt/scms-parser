[Overview]

<p>Aggron is pretty much limited to UU play. Nonetheless, it loves switching in on the likes of Tauros, Slaking, Skarmory, Blissey, and Snorlax though, and easily scares out Toxic stallers such as Umbreon. Furthermore, Aggron partners well with Choice Band users such as Crobat, as well as Gengar, who is immune to its greatest weaknesses.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set can wreck about anything that isn't a Ground-type. Thunder Wave cripples Water-types and random fast sweepers, and allows Aggron to fish for full paralysis by continually using Substitute. Then, use Rock Slide to probably nearly flinch them to death. Focus Punch hurts a lot from Aggron's awesome Attack. As it dents even standard walls such as Snorlax and Skarmory, the UU champions Solrock and Sandslash will naturally have a lot of trouble taking this on. 160 Speed lets Aggron outspeed Weezing. Next, maximize Attack, and put what you have left in HP.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Double-Edge
move 4: Focus Punch / Iron Tail
item: Choice Band
ability: Rock Head
nature: Adamant
evs: 140 HP / 252 Atk / 116 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is pretty straightforward. Aggron's key resistances to certain attacking types such as Rock and Normal lets it switch in easily with some prediction. Again, your opponent will probably send in a bulky Water- or Ground-type, so use prediction accordingly.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Swampert, the obvious multi-purpose Rock counter, walls anything Aggron can throw at it, as does Claydol. Metagross is a good counter to any non-Earthquake Aggron, and even with it, would 3HKO anyway without a boost from Choice Band. Lastly, Suicune and other bulky Water-types won't be taking much damage at all from Aggron's attacks. However, note that Aggron can potentially beat Skarmory or Weezing one-on-one, thanks to Substitute blocking Weezing's Will-O-Wisp, and paralysis and a 30% flinch chance possibly doing major damage to both, though this is unlikely.</p>
