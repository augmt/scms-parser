[Overview]

<p>Blaziken is a threat to many teams due the diverse ways in which it can sweep. Fire is an excellent attacking type against physical walls, while Fighting hits all common special walls super effectively, and Blaziken has the stats to go either route. However, Blaziken is hampered by its defensively poor typing, which grants it weaknesses to Surf, Earthquake, Hidden Power Flying, and Psychic, four of the most common and dangerous moves around. On the other hand, its 4x Bug resistance is incredibly handy. Blaziken has slightly above average Speed, but due to its need to split offensive EVs, it is slower than most Pokemon that invest in Speed.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Sweeper
move 1: Swords Dance / Focus Punch
move 2: Sky Uppercut
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Fire Blast / Overheat
item: Leftovers
nature: Adamant
evs: 80 HP / 232 Atk / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Switch into Blissey or Skarmory, and predict Rock Slides or Focus Punches. Once Salamence or Suicune fall, seize the opportunity to Swords Dance and sweep with your chosen Fire STAB and Sky Uppercut. Blaziken is an excellent Fire-type mainly due to the fact that it actually has a physical STAB move.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Thunder Punch
move 3: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Grass
move 4: Sky Uppercut
item: Leftovers / Salac Berry
nature: Rash
evs: 16 HP / 56 Atk / 240 SpA / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The main dilemma on this set is between Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Grass: the former covers Salamence and Flygon, while the latter nearly OHKOes Swampert. Blaziken must hit Salamence and Flygon on the switch, or on a predicted a Dragon Dance, but it can attack Swampert after it comes in, so Hidden Power Grass requires less prediction.</p>

<p>The EVs enable Blaziken to always survive Zapdos's Thunderbolt and activate Blaze. For this reason, a Salac Berry isn't such a bad idea. Special Attack is given preference to Attack. As for Speed, maximum investment is an option to surprise Salamence that don't maximize Speed, and is especially handy if running Hidden Power Ice.</p>

[SET]
name: Reversal
move 1: Substitute / Endure
move 2: Swords Dance / Hidden Power Ice
move 3: Reversal
move 4: Fire Blast
item: Salac Berry
nature: Jolly
evs: 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Blaziken has one major advantage over other users of Reversal: special STAB, which allows it to OHKO threats such as Weezing, Skarmory, and Gengar thanks to Blaze. Swords Dance is good if you can predict your opponent switching to a Pokemon such as Swampert; Blaziken can then Endure the super effective hit and OHKO with Reversal. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ice nabs a surprise OHKO on Salamence that think they can Intimidate Blaziken and survive Reversal. Just be very careful using this, as Tyranitar runs rampant everywhere.</p>

<p>Don't ever use Rock Slide on this set, as 1 HP Reversal is just as strong against Flying-types, and has no chance of missing. Focus Punch is an option if using Substitute in case your opponent tries to set up before Blaziken gets to 1 HP. Overheat has higher accuracy and more power than Fire Blast, but you can only use it once; conversely, though, Blaziken will normally only need to use it once. Flamethrower doesn't have the power to OHKO Weezing.</p>

<p>This set must hit 264 Speed; in fact, 270 isn't such a bad idea. It beats out Adamant Heracross and makes Blaziken faster than all Pokemon bar Electrode and Ninjask after a Salac boost.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Sky Uppercut
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Focus Punch
move 4: Fire Blast / Overheat
item: Choice Band
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Believe it or not, Blaziken makes a surprisingly decent Choice Band user. If you are good at prediction, this set is just as good as the specially based Blaziken set, or maybe even a tad better. It is probably one of the best ways Blaziken can take down the bulky Water-types that tend to switch in on it. The EVs are straightforward: maximum Attack and Speed let Blaziken hit as hard and as fast as possible.</p>

[SET]
name: SubPunch
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Focus Punch
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Thunder Punch
item: Leftovers / Salac Berry
nature: Mild / Rash
evs: 12 HP / 176 Atk / 68 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Predict a switch, get a Substitute up, and have fun smiting the switch-in. Focus Punch does loads of damage, Hidden Power Ice takes care of Salamence, while Thunder Punch destroys Gyarados and weakened Water-types. Salac Berry is a nice option for when you get on low health; it might even fool opponents into believing Blaziken has Reversal. Again, Hidden Power Ice variants should go for maximum Speed to catch slower Salamence off-guard.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Double Kick can be used to break the Substitutes of Tyranitar and other threats, so it deserves a mention. Fire Blast can be replaced for Flamethrower, Overheat, or Blaze Kick: Flamethrower has reliable accuracy but less power. Overheat has both more accuracy and more power than Fire Blast, but gives Blaziken a nasty Special Attack drop afterwards. Nonetheless, Blaziken doesn't mind this much as it's switching in and out all the time anyway. While not as strong as the other attacks, Blaze Kick has a higher critical hit rate that can be helpful in some situations. Brick Break can be substituted for Sky Uppercut anywhere it's listed if you hate missing; they both do roughly the same amount of damage in the long run.</p>

<p>A Salac Berry is always a good alternative to Leftovers, because Blaziken isn't going to be taking many hits anyway, and the main purpose of Leftovers is to counteract Sand Stream. Many hits from OU Pokemon, such as Zapdos's Thunderbolt and Suicune's Surf, will just barely leave Blaziken alive.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gyarados and Salamence resist both of Blaziken's STAB moves, and have Intimidate to further weaken its physical attacks. To add insult to injury, they almost always carry STAB Hidden Power Flying, which is a guaranteed OHKO, and Blaziken can't even Endure the hit and sweep with Reversal, as they resist the move and inflict an Attack drop on Blaziken. However, they do need to beware of Thunder Punch and Hidden Power Ice, respectively, as this will OHKO them. Blaziken can also be faster than Gyarados, so it needs to be especially worried.</p>

<p>Water-types such as Suicune, Slowbro, Starmie, Milotic, and Swampert all resist Fire, and thanks to either high Defense stats or handy resistances, take little damage from Blaziken's physical attacks. Even Thunder Punch variants don't do much to them. Swampert, however, has serious problems with Hidden Power Grass Blaziken, which nearly OHKOes. The Reversal set also threatens them, as a full-power Reversal does roughly 75% to Milotic and Swampert and OHKOes all of them save Slowbro after a Swords Dance.</p>
