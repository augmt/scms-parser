[Overview]

<p>Octillery is incredibly cool and has awesome attacking stats, but it just isn't very durable. It's also a pure Water-type, so it lacks physical STAB, though Sludge Bomb and Rock Blast are great moves in their own right. While it is a force to be reckoned with in UU play, don't use it in standard as it can't hold its own against most OU Pokemon.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Octillery's stats absolutely scream "mixed sweeper". In the first three moveslots are its best attacking moves along with reliable STAB: Rock Blast beats up Substitute users while Ice Beam keeps Salamence at bay, and Surf keeps Skarmory and Weezing from ruining Octillery's fun. In the last moveslot, Hidden Power Fighting hits Blissey, Snorlax, and Tyranitar, Hidden Power Ground dents Metagross, while Thunder Wave patches up Octillery's low Speed.</p>

<p>Being its main attacking option, Octillery's Attack should be maximized. Invest as much as you want into Special Attack, and put the rest in HP for optimum bulk. A Brave nature is best as Octillery is slow and will likely be able to paralyze its opponents as well.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a specially based sweeping Octillery. Thanks to Octillery's awesome Special Attack stat and STAB Surf, it is pretty effective. Use Thunder Wave if you don't feel that Octillery needs a physical move for Blissey and other special walls.</p>

<p>Again, a Quiet nature is recommended as Octillery's low Speed means it will not outrun much even with investment; furthermore, it can paralyze its opponents as well.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Octillery can use Psychic to hit Gengar, but aside from that, not much should be changed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Dugtrio can revenge kill a weakened Octillery, but a full-health Octillery can survive a Choice Band Earthquake to destroy Dugtrio with Surf. Jolteon, Raikou, and Zapdos can all scare Octillery away, but with good prediction, Octillery can paralyze them on the switch. In general, anything fast that can OHKO it will likely force it out.</p>
