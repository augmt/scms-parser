[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hidden Power Fire easily dispatches of the likes of Skarmory; even with a Defense-hindering nature and no investment, Shiftry can survive 200 Attack Skarmory's Drill Peck. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ice deals with Salamence, but note that unlike most other SunnyBeam users, Shiftry always has the option of Explosion to take out Salamence. Brick Break is useful with the popularity of Tyranitar, but the various Hidden Power attacks and Explosion are generally better options.</p>

<p>Maximize Special Attack as it is Shiftry's main offensive stat. Other than that, 92 Attack EVs is all Shiftry needs to OHKO physically defensive Blissey, while 28 Speed EVs allow it to outrun the entire metagame bar Ninjask, including positive-natured Aerodactyl and Jolteon, as well as Salac-boosted Adamant Heracross. Nonetheless, feel free to invest more in Attack and Speed if you so desire.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A Choice Band set is viable; it should run maximum Attack investment and a lot of Speed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Explosion is best played around with resistances or immunities, but beware of its sheer power; it still has 250 Base Power even if it's not very effective. Nonetheless, Shiftry's defenses aren't the best, so just hit it hard with powerful attacks. Ninjask can trouble slower Shiftry variants. Tyranitar stops the SunnyBeam set, but must watch out for Brick Break. Note also that SunnyBeam variants have to waste a turn setting up Sunny Day, which gives you a free turn. Lastly, Thunder Wave makes Shiftry rather useless outside of Explosion.</p>
