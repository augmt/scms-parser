[Overview]

<p>Hitmontop is mostly a novelty choice in standard play, but it is one of the few Pokemon who can come in on and force out any kind of Tyranitar. All in all, it is fun to use, but might not be suited for the most competitive teams.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: High Jump Kick / Brick Break
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Hidden Power Ghost / Mach Punch
item: Leftovers
nature: Adamant
evs: 144 HP / 252 Atk / 112 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Switch Hitmontop in on something that cannot do much damage to it or that it can scare off, such as Tyranitar or RestTalk Heracross, then start setting up. Brick Break and High Jump Kick both OHKO Tyranitar, while Mach Punch can be used to finish off weakened threats. Try to take down powerful special attackers on the switch with your third and fourth moves; Rock Slide hits Zapdos, Salamence, and Gyarados, while Hidden Power Ghost hurts Gengar and lets Hitmontop do some damage to Dusclops. Hitmontop makes quite a decent counter to Dragon Dance Tyranitar with Intimidate and resistance to Rock.</p>

<p>200 Speed is a good number to hit, but 222 and 244 are options to beat Adamant and Jolly Tyranitar respectively. Attack is maximized, and the rest is put into HP for optimum bulk.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: High Jump Kick / Brick Break
move 2: Hidden Power Ghost
move 3: Mach Punch
move 4: Rock Slide
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

<p>If you're decent at prediction and don't mind the loss of Leftovers recovery, you can try this one out. This set can do quite some damage as long as you pick the right move on the right turn. Choice Band ramps up High Jump Kick's power to incredible heights, but you can use Brick Break if you really hate the miss chance.</p>

[SET]
name: Endeavor
move 1: Substitute / Endure
move 2: Endeavor
move 3: Mach Punch
move 4: Hidden Power Ghost
item: Salac Berry
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a funny surprise that might screw up enemies that don't see it coming. Trigger Salac Berry by using Substitute or Endure, then Endeavor foes to that same low HP. If you can, try to Substitute as your opponent switches to a faster Pokemon. Keep up the Substitute by using it every time they attack to break the Substitute, and you should end up at low HP with both a Salac boost and a Substitute up. Now finish them off with Mach Punch or Hidden Power Ghost, and Endeavor the next switch-in.</p>

<p>Maximum Attack and Speed are standard sweeper fare, but the remaining EVs should not be put in HP so it can make four Substitutes. Note that even with maximum Speed, +1 Hitmontop cannot hope to outpace Aerodactyl, and that Tyranitar foils this strategy with Sand Stream.</p>

[SET]
name: Counter
move 1: Counter
move 2: Brick Break / High Jump Kick
move 3: Hidden Power Ghost
move 4: Endeavor / Mach Punch / Protect
item: Leftovers / Salac Berry
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 HP / 136 Atk / 112 Def / 8 Spe

<p>Hitmontop is pretty good at using Counter. With these EVs, it can switch into  Salamence's Dragon Dance, Intimidate it, survive Hidden Power Flying, then Counter for the KO. Other attacks it can successfully Counter include Heracross's Megahorn and Brick Break, Skarmory's Drill Peck, as well as Aerodactyl's Hidden Power Flying. Brick Break is better than High Jump Kick on this set; you don't want Hitmontop to lose HP to a miss as it'll need all the HP it can get for Counter. Protect allows it to scout for moves and Mach Punch to pick off weakened foes. The combination of Salac Berry and Endeavor let Hitmontop hurt one more Pokemon after Countering a nearly deadly hit, while Leftovers is the safer option.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hitmontop can Rapid Spin, but isn't any good at it. It's easily thwarted by Ghosts and loses to Skarmory more often than not. If your team really needs spin support, it's a good filler though. Triple Kick makes Hitmontop one of the best counters to Substitute Tyranitar in the game; it resists Crunch, has nice Special Defense to buffer Thunderbolt, and can weaken Rock Slide and Focus Punch with Intimidate. As Triple Kick will hit Tyranitar twice after breaking its Substitute, the only way Hitmontop will eat a Focus Punch is on the switch. Toxic and Thief are always decent filler options as well, while Substitute isn't bad on Bulk Up sets to protect against status. Revenge is amped up to a massive 120 Base Power if Hitmontop is hit first, and can be used instead of Counter to beat up special attackers.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>As previously alluded to, Hitmontop has a lot of trouble with standard Fighting resists. Zapdos, Salamence, and Gyarados all come in relatively easily on just about any move and really put a hurting on Hitmontop. Weezing can neuter Hitmontop with Will-O-Wisp and doesn't take much damage at all from any of its attacks. Skarmory can lay Spikes and hit it with super effective STAB Flying-type moves. It, along with Salamence and Gyarados, has to be wary of Counter, though. The same applies to Heracross: it can shrug off most of Hitmontop's hits and hurt it with even a resisted Megahorn, but Counter is deadly. Gengar fares well against Hitmontop as long as it doesn't take repeated Rock Slides and stays away from Hidden Power Ghost, while Dusclops can basically shrug off anything.</p>
