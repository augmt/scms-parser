[Overview]

<p>Overall, this is a bad Sceptile. However, it has the potential to force a lot of switches with Leech Seed and Encore. It is pretty useful if paired with a Spikes user.</p>

[SET]
name: SubSeed
move 1: Encore
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Sleep Powder
item: Leftovers
nature: Jolly
evs: 188 HP / 104 SpD / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A classic annoyer, this is almost useless without Spikes. Sleep Powder a foe, and set up with Substitute and Leech Seed until the opponent faints or switches out again. Encore can be used to keep foes such as Snorlax and Metagross using Curse and Earthquake respectively. The main problem with this set is that Substitute and Leech Seed each have a maximum of 16 PP, which can run out faster than you'd think. 340 Speed let Jumpluff beat Adamant Dugtrio; put the rest in HP and defenses.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive
move 1: Hidden Power Flying
move 2: Swords Dance / Substitute
move 3: Leech Seed
move 4: Sleep Powder
item: Leftovers
nature: Jolly
evs: 148 HP / 140 Atk / 220 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Same premise as the first, but you now have some sort of way to hurt Grass-types who are immune to Leech Seed. The 140 Attack EVs enable Jumpluff to OHKO Heracross and 2HKO Medicham.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Stun Spore can help scout for full paralysis, and along with Substitute, score Jumpluff some free turns. Reflect can enable Jumpluff's Substitutes to survive most physical moves not called Rock Slide or Hidden Power Flying. Jumpluff can use Toxic; combined with Leech Seed, this really piles on the ancillary damage.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Counters to Jumpluff are numerous, and include other Grass Pokemon, Hidden Power Ice variants of Jolteon and Raikou, Alakazam, and Aerodactyl. Tyranitar's Sand Stream can prevent Jumpluff from recovering as much HP, but will also let its Leech Seed be that much more effective in whittling down the health of non-immune Pokemon.</p>
