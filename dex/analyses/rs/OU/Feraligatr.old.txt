[Overview]

<p>Feraligatr is actually a pretty good Pokemon overall; it's pretty diverse and doesn't really have any bad stats. It's always an unexpected surprise, particularly as your foes will not know what the crocodile will throw at them.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While not exactly a SkarmBliss counter, this Feraligatr can do damage to both physical and special walls alike, and can even be as annoying as Gengar at times--though that's pushing it a bit.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Some people have successfully pulled off special Gyarados, and if Gyarados can do it, Feraligatr might be able to too! It is definitely unexpected; furthermore, Feraligatr's Special Attack isn't awful, and it's got a fair few special attacks there, including Crunch and Dragon Claw, so it's always worth some consideration. Feraligatr also receives Brick Break, and if you don't like Swords Dance, you can go for a Choice Band set for some immediate power. Counter is somewhat unexpected on this Pokemon, so it's a possibility. Screech at the very least forces a switch, or else lets Feraligatr totally destroy its foe.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>This big brute will survive some weaker Electric and Grass attacks, but these are still the best ways to take it down. It is a fairly balanced Pokemon overall, but strong Normal-type sweepers fare well against it especially if it lacks Brick Break, as do fast users of Sleep Powder and Will-O-Wisp, and--of course--Skarmory.</p>
