[Overview]

<p>While Ninetales is fragile, it does have its uses, specifically in providing team support in the form of sleep, burn, and Grudge. For example, it can help Raikou beat a team with Blissey in this way: Substitute down to low HP to avoid Thunder Wave, then use Grudge to remove all Blissey's Seismic Toss PP.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With some prediction, Ninetales can badly screw its opponents over. Ninetales's base 100 Special Defense is excellent, so you can expect your opponent to bring in a physical attacker, which Ninetales can burn with Will-O-Wisp. When Ninetales's end is near, Grudge is its big contribution to the team. If Ninetales uses Grudge on the turn it is KOed, the move that KOed it will be stripped of all its PP. With some smart strategizing, this can help pave the way for another Pokemon to sweep: for example, an Earthquake-less Donphan can no longer stop Dragon Dance Tyranitar.</p>

<p>The slowest Ninetales should go is a stat of 300 Speed, which requires a Timid nature and 148 Speed EVs; maximum Speed is a good option as well. Spread the rest over HP and Special Attack.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast, but the latter is recommended as Ninetales's Special Attack is quite low. Confuse Ray makes Ninetales hard to hit, but can work against it if it uses Grudge while its opponents hit themselves in confusion. Hypnosis is a gamble, though a very rewarding one; it can be used alongside Will-O-Wisp if you wish. Toxic is another alternative status ailment; however, burn is better on physical attackers. Hidden Power Ice takes a chunk of health out of Salamence and Flygon.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Starmie is the best counter to Ninetales in the game as it does not care about status, resists Fire, and is fast enough to pick Ninetales off with Surf before Ninetales can use Grudge. Most Water-types do well too; examples include Gyarados, Swampert, Suicune, Milotic, and Lanturn. However, note that the former two don't like being burned. Snorlax, Blissey, Salamence, and Flygon deserve mentions as well, but aside from Blissey, they won't like being hit by Will-O-Wisp on the switch. Houndoom is itself immune to Fire moves, and can KO Ninetales with Crunch.</p>
