[Overview]

<p>Electabuzz has very good stats and an excellent movepool to boot. In addition to being a top-notch UU Pokemon, it is also a definite Skarmory / Blissey counter, and can certainly be used effectively in the OU metagame. However, be careful not to let it take too many hits.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set works rather well as it requires no setup. With Electabuzz's bad Defense, it functions much like a Choice Band Pokemon: just hit and run. It can switch it in on almost anything, even Blissey, with the exception of Earthquake.</p>

<p>Cross Chop is recommended over Focus Punch as two hits do more damage than one Focus Punch. If Focus Punch comes just short of killing the foe, Electabuzz will be forced to switch out for fear of Earthquake from Tyranitar, Thunder Wave or Seismic Toss from Blissey, or anything from Snorlax. If running Cross Chop, however, Electabuzz will be able to hit the opponent once as it switches in, and then immediately deal the finishing blow. Cross Chop's high critical hit rate might also prove handy against the likes of Snorlax, who is 2HKOed by Cross Chop if one of them is a critical hit.</p>

<p>Electabuzz should run at least 216 EVs to reach 300 Speed minimum, or 108 EVs and a Speed-boosting nature. With more investment and a Speed-boosting nature, Electabuzz can also outpace neutral-natured Gengar, but this is largely unnecessary.</p>

<p>Thunderbolt is Electabuzz's most consistent move. Aside from that, it can pull off the SubPunch strategy: set up a Substitute on a foe that will likely switch out--such as any slow Water-type that isn't Milotic or Suicune--and then Focus Punch anything that resists Thunderbolt. Thunder Wave spreads paralysis, which works well alongside Substitute to scout for full paralysis. Alternatively, Electabuzz can run a special attack for additional type coverage; Fire Punch and Ice Punch both dent Grass-types that can mess it up. Ice Punch has the advantage of hitting Grounds, but Fire Punch stops Steelix from ruining Electabuzz's fun.</p>

<p>Thunderbolt is mandatory for reliable, powerful STAB. Next, pick a status of your choice, set up a Light Screen,  and either switch out to the Pokemon that needs to Light Screen or stay in and Counter the incoming physical attacker. A Bold nature helps Electabuzz survive attacks for Counter. Note never to try and Counter a STAB or Choice Band Earthquake; Electabuzz will die. You could use a Focus Band for this if you want, but don't.</p>

<p>Again, 216 Speed EVs let Electabuzz hit a Speed stat of 300. This Electabuzz should run an Attack-hindering nature as it isn't going mixed. A Speed-boosting nature is an option to let Electabuzz outrun neutral-natured Gengar.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Barrier could help Electabuzz survive a little longer, or even live a STAB Earthquake and Counter it back for a quick kill. Thief is an awesome move; steal Leftovers from the most annoying stall Pokemon you can find, and laugh.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Few things can really safely switch into Electabuzz without the risk of getting hit by a super effective move. However, it often doesn't hit hard enough. Raikou is probably your best bet, Celebi is also able to Recover off damage from any of Electabuzz's super effective attacks, and Blissey and Snorlax will wreck havoc barring Cross Chop. Dugtrio can easily come in and KO it as Electabuzz has a very small chance to OHKO it even with a Modest Ice Punch.</p>
