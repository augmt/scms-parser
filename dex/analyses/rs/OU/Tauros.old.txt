[Overview]

<p>Although not as devastating as it was in RBY, Tauros is still a threat to be reckoned with in ADV. With a good Attack stat and a great Speed stat, Tauros functions extremely well as a late-game cleaner on offensive teams. Intimidate, an excellent ability on any sweeper, gives Tauros more opportunities to switch in and ravage the opponent's teams. Unfortunately, Tauros's pros end here. Skarmory and Forretress, both common Pokemon in ADV, completely wall Tauros and can set up entry hazards while taking little damage from any of its moves. Additionally, Tauros has a shallow physical movepool and has to rely on Hidden Power to get past most of its checks. Don't let these faults deter you from using Tauros though, as it can easily sweep through teams once Skarmory and Forretress are eliminated.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If you're looking for an excellent late-game cleaner, look no further; Tauros runs through unprepared teams with little effort, and even prepared teams still have difficulties with it. Thanks to its base 100 Attack stat and the Choice Band boost, Tauros's STAB Return is sure to dent anything that doesn't resist it. Double-Edge serves as an alternative to Return; it hits significantly harder, but causes recoil damage. Earthquake is the secondary move of choice as it allows Tauros to combat the likes of Metagross, Tyranitar, and Jirachi, who all do not fear STAB Return or Double-Edge. Hidden Power Ghost hits Gengar, one of the most common and powerful Pokemon in ADV, for super effective damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is rather simple; maximize Attack to make Tauros hit as hard as possible and maximize Speed to ensure Tauros can outpace as many Pokemon as possible. Choice Band is easily the best option for Tauros as it hits incredibly hard with the aforementioned item. An Adamant nature is a viable alternative to a Jolly one as Tauros already outspeeds most of the ADV metagame.</p>

<p>Tauros's best teammates are Pokemon that can eliminate the likes of Forretress and Skarmory. Magneton is easily Tauros's best partner as it can not only prevent Skarmory and Forretress from switching out, but also OHKO them with Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Fire, respectively. Snorlax and Salamence with Fire Blast and Metagross with Thunder Punch or Hidden Power Fire can surprise the aforementioned Steel-types, who might expect a boosting move or a resisted STAB move.</p>

<p>Other good partners are physical attackers that can break through the defenses of Forretress and Skarmory. Choice Band Medicham can 2HKO the aforementioned Steel-types with a little bit of prior damage, which might enable Tauros to sweep later in the game. Choice Band Slaking with Focus Punch also works similarly to Medicham by breaking through Steel-types with relative ease. Additionally, powerful special attackers, such as Zapdos and Jirachi, also make quick work of Forretress and Skarmory with Thunderbolt and Fire Punch, respectively.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Unfortunately, Tauros doesn't have much of a movepool it can make use of. Iron Tail can be used for Gengar and Tyranitar, while simultaneously giving you a weapon against Aerodactyl, but the 75% accuracy is almost never worth it. Sleep Talk can make Tauros a makeshift sleep absorber. This can be particularly helpful on more offensive teams that will commonly lack a more reliable sleep absorber or cleric. A Substitute set with Leftovers could work, but Tauros is better off with Choice Band. As Tauros's physical movepool is so mediocre, it should just stick with the moves mentioned on the set. Body Slam is useful for paralyzing opponents, but Tauros doesn't really need the paralysis support as it's so fast.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>As mentioned before, Forretress and Skarmory are the most common and best checks to Tauros; they take little damage from Tauros's moves bar Fire Blast and can set up Spikes to give their team the upper hand. Jirachi and Metagross can switch in on a predicted Return and proceed to hit back with Fire Punch and Meteor Mash, respectively. Although uncommon, Regirock and Registeel take little from Return, and can set up with Curse and proceed to do a number to your opponent's team. Dusclops, a staple on many stall teams, takes little damage from any of Tauros's moves bar Hidden Power Ghost, and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp.</p>

<p>If you lack Skarmory or Forretress, it's important to switch in your Pokemon that resist Normal moves on Return and try to defeat Tauros that way. Although Tauros is somewhat bulky, it can still be revenge killed by Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, Jolteon, Gengar, and even Alakazam. Tauros is a dangerous and underrated threat so you need to perform well in order to bring it down.</p>
