[Overview]
 
<p>Ursaring is the epitome of power, with a whopping base 130 Attack and an excellent ability in Guts. However, its rather lackluster Speed and vulnerability to all forms of residual damage certainly don't do it any favors. It's also rather difficult to switch in on anything other than a predicted switch, a Ghost-type attack, or a status move. However, Ursaring can serve as a potent mid-game wallbreaker with a Swords Dance or Choice Band set and can even clean up late-game with Bulk Up. Above all, it is extremely difficult for the opponent to switch anything in on Ursaring as it deals good damage to almost everything in the metagame.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
 
<p>This set can be highly effective if used correctly. The premise is simple: switch Ursaring into a status move such as Will-O-Wisp or Toxic and predict switches accordingly. Return is a basic powerful STAB move and hits many opponents very hard. Earthquake hits Pokemon such as Metagross on the switch, while Hidden Power Ghost allows Ursaring to hit Gengar and Dusclops for good damage. Focus Punch takes a massive chunk out of Skarmory switch-ins, but if your team is desperately in need of a sleep absorber, Ursaring can use Sleep Talk in the fourth slot as Guts gives it an Attack boost while asleep. This set should be played aggressively, and a player with good prediction skills will benefit from using it.</p>
 
[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
 
<p>This set also works decently in the lead slot as it scares away threats such as Gengar, Regice, Snorlax, and many others. The EV spread allows Ursaring to outspeed Vaporeon, Umbreon, and Claydol, making it an excellent switch-in to them as they all often carry Toxic and have no real offensive presence. Ursaring can go slightly faster with an alternate spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe to outspeed all non-Agility variants of Metagross and non-Taunt Skarmory, both of which are prime counters to the bear.</p>
 
<p>Ursaring pairs excellently with Substitute + Baton Pass Zapdos, which resists the Fighting-type attacks that Ursaring doesn't enjoy, scares out Skarmory, and can pass Substitutes to Ursaring or simply dry pass on predicted switches. Like all physically attacking Normal-types, Choice Band Ursaring enjoys Magneton support to remove Skarmory and Forretress.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
 
<p>As opposed to the hit-and-run approach that the Choice Band set employs, this set aims to break down stall by boosting Attack, and it truly shines at doing so. The basic idea behind the set is to bring it in on a wall such as Blissey or Dusclops, Swords Dance on the switch (usually to Skarmory if you're playing against stall), and choose the appropriate attack. Focus Punch is the preferred move because of its ability to hit Skarmory hard before it Roars. With Guts activated and a Swords Dance boost, Ursaring will almost OHKO the metal bird with Focus Punch. However, Earthquake is also an option for its ability to hit Metagross and Tyranitar, but it leaves Ursaring completely walled by Skarmory. When playing with this set, it is important not to be afraid to stay in and take damage.</p>
 
[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
 
<p>Bulk is much more important to this set than to the Choice Band one, so that it can switch in and stay in, so a faster EV spread is a poor option. Even the bulkiest of Water-types, Suicune, does not make a safe switch-in as a +2 non-Guts Return will 2HKO it most of the time in sandstorm or with one layer of Spikes.</p>
 
<p>Due to its lack of recovery and the fact that it will probably be taking heavy damage, this set adores Wish support; Jirachi in particular forces Skarmory out and can use the free turn to pass a Wish along. Magneton is not as important a partner for this set as this Ursaring can beat Skarmory itself by Focus Punching on a predicted Roar.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
 
<p>This Ursaring plays very similarly to the wallbreaker set, but it can tank hits slightly better and also clean up balanced teams late-game to a certain extent. However, as this set does not hit as hard off the bat, it struggles with Skarmory and bulky Water-types such as Suicune, which will tank its comparatively weaker hits and phaze it away without fear. Return is a powerful STAB move, Hidden Power Ghost offers coverage against Dusclops and other Ghost-types, and Earthquake is preferred as this set does not aim to beat Skarmory itself but to clean up after it has been removed. Earthquake also allows Ursaring to stand a chance against most variations of Metagross after a Bulk Up, although it does help if the opponent's Metagross is weakened in advance. However, Focus Punch is usable if your team does not have the necessary support for the bear.</p>
 
[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
 
<p>Another issue with this set is that Ursaring is vulnerable to Spikes and sandstorm, which massively lowers its durability. Therefore, Starmie is a great partner as it beats Skarmory and can Rapid Spin away all hazards on the field to aid Ursaring's sweep. Magneton also makes an ideal partner for this set--even more so than others--due to its ability to trap and remove Skarmory and prevent it setting up the Spikes that Ursaring dislikes. Other good teammates for this set include Zapdos, and Jolteon to an extent. Ursaring has surprising mixed bulk that can be utilized with a set such as this.</p>
 
[Other Options]
 
<p>Ursaring can utilize a RestTalk set for the Guts boost while asleep, but it is inconsistent overall; Ursaring has to forgo a coverage option, doesn't have the bulk, and is walled even harder by Skarmory. Facade, Double-Edge, and Body Slam are other interesting options for an alternate STAB move, but bear in mind that sleep does not boost Facade. Ursaring also has Brick Break and Rock Slide in its movepool, but these are inadvisable as they do not provide any notable coverage; Earthquake OHKOes Tyranitar with either a Choice Band or a Guts boost, and Rock Slide's only possible use is for Aerodactyl, not to mention that it requires Ursaring to give up another coverage move. Counter can work if you try and force Skarmory to attack Ursaring with Drill Peck by showing Focus Punch, which acts as a pseudo-Taunt in that situation.</p>
 
[Checks and Counters]
 
<p>Ursaring is a Pokemon that is incredibly difficult to directly counter; its only real safe switch-ins are Skarmory and Forretress, and even then only to a slight extent. However, the Choice Band set can be defeated with superior prediction, and both boosting sets are vulnerable to simply being outpaced and revenge killed by Pokemon that can hit it adequately hard or super effectively, such as Heracross and Medicham. Choice Band Metagross is also an excellent counter because it will always OHKO in sandstorm with Meteor Mash and resists Return, Ursaring's main STAB option. Ursaring also needs to avoid Choice Band Salamence because of its Intimidate ability and the possible threat of Brick Break.</p>
