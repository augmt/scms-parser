[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The old Perish Trapper from GSC is back for more in ADV; however, it faces significant competition from Gengar. The latter's faster Taunt makes it possibly a better option, but Misdreavus's advantages lie in its slightly higher Special Defense and its lack of weakness to Psychic. Nonetheless, Perish trapping is just as--if not more--effective in ADV thanks to Taunt. Trap the foe, Protect to regain health from Leftovers, then use Perish Song or Taunt depending on who is on the field. Stall with Protect and Taunt until it falls, then switch out. Use Destiny Bond if you are sure Misdreavus isn't going to survive the three-turn setup Perish Song needs.</p>

<p>This set works best when partnered with Jirachi, who can provide Wish support. Jirachi can also take Explosion, which the opponent will likely use on the last turn of Perish Song to hit the switch-in.</p>

<p>A cool set, to tell you the truth. Taunt prevents Blissey from using Soft-Boiled and Thunder Wave. Misdreavus can then proceed to set up with Calm Mind and lay the smack down with Thunderbolt.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to its plethora of immunities, many Pokemon rely on Hidden Power to hit Misdreavus. Imprison therefore prevents them from touching it, and can prove very frustrating. With Thunder Wave on the set, Misdreavus can't be paralyzed bar Stun Spore. It also works nicely alongside Hidden Power Ice--which forces Ground-types to switch--to help spread paralysis.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Snatch can catch a nice Substitute on opponents that expect Confuse Ray or Thunder Wave. Pain Split is a decent idea for recovering HP, as Misdreavus's HP is still low even after investment.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Counters to Misdreavus include Raikou, Tyranitar, Metagross, Gengar, and Houndoom; these Pokemon are faster then Misdreavus and will do serious damage thanks to Misdreavus's below-average bulk. Conversely, Snorlax and Dusclops can easily sponge Misdreavus's attacks and hit it hard in return.</p>
