[Overview]

<p>Magmar is inferior to Typhlosion in almost every way; its only advantages are some fairly useless moves in Barrier, Cross Chop, and Confuse Ray. While it is a good option for a UU team, don't expect it to achieve much of anything in OU.</p>

[SET]

move 2: Cross Chop / Focus Punch

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Cross Chop will only 2HKO Blissey and Snorlax if it lands a critical hit or is backed up with lots of Spikes support, but it can at least negate Curse boosts and finish off weakened ones.</p>

<p>The recommended spread beats out Adamant Heracross, but if running Hidden Power Ice, use 204 Speed EVs and a Hasty nature to outspeed Salamence. Good Speed numbers to hit are 270 and 300. Aside from this, maximize Special Attack, then put the rest into Attack to power up Cross Chop or Focus Punch.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Thief and Toxic can slow down Water-types. Sunny Day also helps Magmar against the aforementioned Water-types, but is not really worth a moveslot as most Water-types still beat it without Solar Beam. The combination of Barrier + Counter can be used to surprise and KO Pokemon with Earthquake; such variants should invest heavily in HP.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Water-type Pokemon, such as Suicune, Starmie, and Milotic, are its main counters. Swampert is problematic if Magmar lacks Hidden Power Grass, Gyarados if it forgoes Thunder Punch, and Salamence and Flygon if it does not go with Hidden Power Ice.</p>
