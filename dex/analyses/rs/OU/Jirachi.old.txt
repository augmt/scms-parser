[Overview]

<p>Jirachi's typing and bulk ensure that it is going to stick around for a while. Use this time to set up with Calm Mind to sweep, or pass Wishes for teammates. Jirachi is never a bad option for any team, and is key in keeping many physical attackers in check.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Jirachi is a defensive Calm Mind user that destroys Snorlax and Blissey. Fire Punch takes out Steel-types that Jirachi's Psychic can't, such as Metagross, opposing Jirachi, and Skarmory. Its 20% chance of burn also keeps common switch-ins, such as Tyranitar, at bay, and can be used in a pinch to damage physical sweepers. It also stops Celebi from using Jirachi as setup bait. Thunderbolt still hits Steel-types for neutral damage and allows Jirachi to beat Suicune. Hidden Power Grass does the same but trades a super effective attack versus Skarmory for a way to finish off Swampert and Dugtrio. Psychic's 20% chance of lowering Special Defense isn't bad either. Wish keeps Jirachi at high health and helps it against Curse Snorlax and non-Thunder Wave Blissey.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Jirachi is a more offensively oriented Calm Mind sweeper. It still beats Blissey and Snorlax without Earthquake one-on-one, but it can't switch in as often as the Wish set can. 101 HP Substitutes let Jirachi set up against Seismic Toss users and protect it from status; Calm Mind makes it sturdier against special attacks. Thunderbolt and Psychic stop almost every common phazer. Fire Punch can be used over Thunderbolt for reasons similar to the ones listed in the Wish set. This Jirachi should aim to hit at least 300 Speed, outspeeding every neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon.</p>

<p>With the given spread, one of Jirachi's most dangerous enemies, Dugtrio, fails to OHKO with Earthquake while having a very good chance to fall to a +1 Psychic. This Jirachi doesn't need as much Defense investment as the previous set, as the lack of Wish makes it unable to stick around as long. This Jirachi focuses more on setting up and posing an immediate threat. Be wary about switching this Jirachi into Snorlax, as paralysis from Body Slam heavily cripples this set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Instead of Psychic, Ice Punch can be used for a pseudo-BoltBeam combination, threatening common switch-ins such as Salamence, Flygon, and Dugtrio with definite kills. It also stops Jirachi from being walled by Celebi. However, the lack of STAB is noticeable when attempting to damage Snorlax or Swampert, both of which can be worn down by Psychic.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Reflect helps against Dugtrio and makes Jirachi a solid answer to most physical threats. Body Slam has 60% chance of paralysis taking Serene Grace into account, but it doesn't do much damage to anything. A Choice Band set can fire off powerful Doom Desires and Body Slams, which might surprise some of Jirachi's switch-ins. However, the vulnerability to Dugtrio and other Pokemon becomes much more noticeable, especially with a lack of STAB attacks to use.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Dugtrio can be a pain if Jirachi is even slightly weakened, but most Jirachi are EVed to survive Earthquake and can OHKO Dugtrio with a Calm Mind-boosted Psychic. Superachi doesn't stand a chance, though. Swampert, Steelix, and Claydol are real pests; Earthquake Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Metagross also stop Jirachi fairly effectively. Opposing Jirachi with Fire Punch will generally fare well, but most carry an Electric-type move instead. Celebi can Calm Mind up alongside Jirachi and Baton Pass to a counter or stall it out with Calm Mind and Leech Seed. Skarmory and Forretress can set up on Jirachi lacking Fire Punch and Thunderbolt, but have to be wary of letting Jirachi set up too many Calm Minds. Houndoom is a solid answer to almost every Jirachi set, but its frailty can be a pain.</p>
