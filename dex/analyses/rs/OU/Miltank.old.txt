[Overview]

<p>Miltank is good if used correctly, which basically means not using Thunder Wave or Seismic Toss; Blissey does this far better than Miltank does. If you must use Miltank, use its natural advantages over Blissey or don't use it at all.</p>

<p>Curse is probably Miltank's best option. With Milk Drink and Curse, it can hold its own against the likes of Salamence and Blissey; however, watch out for Skarmory.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Psych Up lets Miltank steal Dragon Dance boosts from Tyranitar and Salamence, Curse boosts from Snorlax and Swampert, as well as Calm Mind boosts from Suicune.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Thunder Wave and Seismic Toss are viable moves, but as previously mentioned, Blissey uses these more effectively. Shadow Ball enables Miltank to take care of Ghost-types.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Skarmory, Choice Band Metagross, Gengar, and Celebi are all solid counters, while Snorlax, Swampert, Suicune, Milotic, and Vaporeon work against Miltank that use Seismic Toss and Thunder Wave.</p>
