[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band Banette's top two attacking moves are self-explanatory. Will-O-Wisp threatens Salamence, while Toxic can be used to wear down bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Swampert. Hyper Beam and Destiny Bond are both suicide moves. Note that Double-Edge is unnecessary as the only foes it hits harder are Normal / Flying types, who are crippled by Will-O-Wisp. Banette should run maximum Attack and an Adamant nature; it will usually also want a bit of Speed to avoid taking unnecessary hits.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Substitute completely screws up Venusaur, and can be used in conjunction with Salac Berry, especially considering Banette is immune to all forms of priority. Grudge is another suicide move worth considering. Thunderbolt easily KOes Skarmory and Gyarados. Skill Swap can mess up a foe about to use Rest; it is situational, but priceless.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Just about any bulky Water can handle Banette; Milotic can even take advantage of a burn and heal itself with Rest or Recover. Skarmory and Weezing also fare decently, but they will not like being burned at all unless they have Rest.</p>
