[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Absol plays very straightforwardly; it Baton Passes Calm Mind boosts. There is no need for Taunt here, because Skarmory and Suicune will fall to a Calm Mind-boosted Thunderbolt. In general, however, this set is inferior to the other. You can forgo one of the listed attacks for Counter, as Absol can boost its Special Defense and take one physical hit--as long as it's not super effective or boosted, sadly--and Counter back for the KO.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The Choice Band set doesn't have the benefit of STAB, but it nonetheless packs a punch thanks to Absol's base 130 Attack. Absol doesn't really have the movepool or the Speed to use a Choice Band very effectively, but it might surprise opponents. Baton Pass is a nice move that scouts your opponent's switch. If they go to Skarmory, you can bring in your Magneton, and if they bring in a slightly dented Tyranitar or Metagross, you can switch to Dugtrio. Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, and Thunder are all options to hurt Skarmory if you wish, while Aerial Ace can OHKO Heracross and Breloom and hurt other Fighting-types.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Thunder Wave is always nice when available. Curse can add some Defense to an Absol using Baton Pass or Taunt, as long as you give the final Baton Pass recipient a White Herb to negate the Speed drop. You might want to stick with Umbreon for Curse passing, however. Psych Up enables Absol to steal boosts from Curse Snorlax and Calm Mind Suicune; it can then proceed to either Taunt them or Baton Pass to another sweeper to take them out. Thief is a cool alternative and Perish Song a novel move, but they are generally overshadowed by Absol's other options. In UU, Absol can use Endure or Substitute and sweep with a Salac Berry boost, thanks to Swords Dance and its massive Attack stat.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Nearly anything. Skarmory, Weezing, and Suicune might find it hard to phaze Absol out due to its access to Taunt and Thunderbolt, but it will be hard-pressed to do much to bulky offensive Pokemon. Metagross is a good example as Absol cannot hurt it outside of a Fire-type attack, while Metagross has STAB Meteor Mash to quickly defeat Absol. Similarly, Tyranitar can use Focus Punch or Rock Slide to pick off Absol. Choice Band Salamence can outspeed Absol and do a lot of damage to it with Hidden Power Flying, Earthquake, or even Brick Break. Tauros outruns Absol as well, and hits hard with its Choice Band STAB Normal-type attacks. All in all, these Pokemon will frequently prevent Absol from surviving for more than one turn.</p>
