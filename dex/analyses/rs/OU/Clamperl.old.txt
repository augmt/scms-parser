<p>Basically you have 540 Special Attack, 35 base HP and are slower than Wobbuffet. Send Clamperl in something that can't OHKO it and won't attack you on the switch, such as Skarmory or a sleeping Pokemon, Surf and Ice Beam everything in sight, switch to the Hidden Powers when Gyarados or Swampert (or even Omastar, assuming you're using this on underused play) pops up. If you're not good at predicting, Substitute will help a little, emphasis on a little considering Clamperl's HP and lack of Leftovers recovery. Confuse Ray might help you get in a hit or two, Toxic may help because Clamperl has to switch in and out constantly, though it won't do that good against defensive waters compared to other offensive waters such as Gorebyss and Omastar, because the Hidden Powers will HURT, a CH Hidden Power Grass/Electric from this thing OHKOes Suicune for example.</p>

<p>Novelty, but Clamperl itself is novelty anyway so worth mentioning. It would be decent if not for the 35 base HP and lack of Leftovers hurts a lot, but it's quite fun if you can pull it off.</p>

[EVs]

<p>On the first set, max Special Attack and Modest, that's for sure. Then you have some options, you can give it Defense, take a Dragon Danced Salamence Hidden Power Flying (or one of a Choice Banded one that switches in to take your Surf and ruin Clamperl and the rest of your team) and Ice Beam its face back, go with Special Defense and spam "jajaja" when Omastar attempts to HP Electric/Grass you and it fails to OHKO, or you can give it Speed to outspeed something like the Regi Trio and Swampert. On the second, max HP and Special Defense with a Bold nature would do fine.</p>

[Opinion]
<p>Leave the clams alone, or even, feed it to your Grumpig or something, maybe it'll decide to grow another pearl and double its Special Attack, now THAT would be cool. But Clamperl is still pretty cool, if you're looking for a change on your UU team, go for it. 540 Special Attack is nothing to mess with, and UUs don't have good Defenses to begin with. Beware, though, UU metagame is all about offense, so don't get your clam get killed in the process.</p>

[Counters]
<p>Blissey, Snorlax, Lapras and Lanturn are the obvious ones. Other than that, you need to predict and switch something that can KO it. And nearly everything can KO it, as it's really slow and has no Leftovers recovery, so what it takes, it keeps. It can't switch in anything, as well.</p>
