[Overview]

<p>Jynx can really damage a team, but can't switch into anything or take any sort of hit; it is the definition of a glass cannon.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Sweeper
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Lovely Kiss
move 4: Substitute
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Jynx does not have many counters, and can cause trouble to very many teams by sleeping or eliminating Snorlax, Blissey and Steel-types, mainly Metagross and Jirachi. Calm Mind-boosted Ice Beam will hurt nearly everything else. It takes some support to work efficiently; saving Jynx until later on in the game can be rewarding in the end.</p>

<p>The main advantage of Substitute is so Jynx can scout out Pokemon waking up. If you tried dual coverage, such as Psychic over Substitute, Pokemon that wake up unexpectedly early can hit Jynx with a strong physical attack. With a Substitute, though, after the opponent wakes up and breaks the Substitute, Jynx will have the next turn to safely try and put them back to sleep. It also helps to block status and keeps revenge killing attempts from Dugtrio and Aerodactyl at bay.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind Trapper
move 1: Mean Look
move 2: Lovely Kiss
move 3: Calm Mind
move 4: Ice Beam
item: Lum Berry / Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is for the overwhelming number of people who switch Blissey into a sleep move and expect it to shrug it off with Natural Cure. Mean Look on the switch, use Lovely Kiss, then set up with Calm Mind for the sweep. Lum Berry is for if the opponent wakes up and paralyzes Jynx before it can sweep them off with Ice Beam. Leftovers won't be doing much anyway bar mitigating sandstorm damage.</p>

[SET]
name: Fake Tears
move 1: Lovely Kiss
move 2: Fake Tears
move 3: Psychic
move 4: Ice Beam
item: Lum Berry / Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Fake Tears their counter on the switch and fire off attacks. This set is only useful with a few layers of Spikes on the field so your opponent cannot switch without penalty. Metagross is the greatest threat to this set.</p>

[SET]
name: Perish Trapper
move 1: Mean Look
move 2: Perish Song
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Lovely Kiss
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 70 SpD / 184 Spe 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set terrorizes teams if played correctly. Substitute or Mean Look on switches, use Lovely Kiss, and Perish Song while the opponent can't touch Jynx. If they don't switch, however, Jynx is probably dead.</p>

[SET]
name: JAA Jynx
move 1: Ice Beam
move 2: Fake Out
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Psychic
item: Lum Berry / BrightPowder
nature: Timid
evs: 236 Def / 20 SpA /  252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is designed to be paired with lead Exploder and Smeargle. Smeargle Endures as your partner Explodes. Then you send out Jynx. Smeargle Spores the faster Pokemon as Jynx uses Fake Out on the other. This means that the enemy does nothing that turn, except get put to Sleep and take negligible damage. Next turn, you Endeavor the awake Pokemon and Ice Beam it for the kill, because Endeavor will put their HP to 1. Continue until all conscious Pokemon are dead, and then kill the Sleeping Pokemon.</p>

<p>Shadow Ball is for Shedinja, who would otherwise destroy this. Psychic is for Gengar, as Endeavor doesn't hit Ghosts. Shadow Ball and Psychic can be somewhat combined into Hidden Power Dark, but Hidden Power Dark doesn't OHKO Gengar, which is very important to do, especially if Gengar has 318 speed or more.</p>

<p>The Speed needs to be absolutely maxed for this, because of Rayquaza. Fake Out and Extreme Speed have the same priority, so if they bring out Rayquaza after you Explode on turn 1, you need to be able to Fake Out before they can use Extreme Speed, or they can kill Smeargle and ruin the whole strategy. Max Speed Jynx ties at worst with Rayquaza. This surprisingly effective EV spread will always survive Choice Band Rayquaza Extreme Speed, and Jynx's role is to kill Pokemon at 1 HP, so Special Attack doesn't really matter. However, this might be too much for some people, which is why another EV spread is to run 16 Defense / 240 Special Attack / 252 Speed. The Defense is to survive non-Choice Band Rayquaza Extreme Speed as you Ice Beam it into oblivion. This is not recommended, however, as your killing power doesn't change, and you still cannot beat Dusclops.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hidden Power Fire can hurt Metagross and Jirachi, do a little more to Regice, and also screw up the uncommon Scizor and Registeel switch-ins. Jynx can also learn cool support moves, such as Wish, Reflect and Light Screen, but many other Pokemon are more durable and are much more effective in a support role. There's nothing noteworthy in the rest of Jynx's movepool: it learns a few physical moves, but it does not have the Attack stat to use them effectively; this would also require taking EVs out of Special Attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Metagross and Jirachi resist Ice Beam and Psychic, and have high defensive stats to take a few hits. Sleep Talk Metagross is particularly threatening, while Jirachi can set up with Calm Mind alongside Jynx. Houndoom's Early Bird makes Lovely Kiss hard to use; it also resists Ice Beam, is immune to Psychic, and can decimate Jynx with both STAB Flamethrower and Pursuit. Blissey takes very little from anything Jynx can do, but will just be setup bait unless something else has already been put to sleep. Snorlax has Thick Fat and often runs a Sleep Talk set, which really screws over Jynx. Registeel and Regice take little from Jynx's Ice Beam, but without Psych Up, Seismic Toss, or Earthquake, Regice can't beat Calm Mind Jynx.</p>
