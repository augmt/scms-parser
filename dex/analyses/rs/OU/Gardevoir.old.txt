[Overview]

<p>Gardevoir has an immense movepool, and this is the key to keeping it from being outclassed by other Psychics. However, it has severe Speed problems, so it will not often sweep teams unless it has a Salac Berry to back it up. Nonetheless, it can mess with common Psychic counters, such as Metagross and Snorlax, and is an excellent team supporter.</p>

nature: Timid
evs: 56 HP / 252 SpA / 200 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Appearances can deceive: this is in fact a fairly threatening sweeper. Thanks to Trace, Gardevoir can switch in easily against Levitate Pokemon using Earthquake, Flygon and Claydol for instance, as well as Pokemon with an absorption ability, such as Jolteon and Vaporeon. Once it's on the field, proceed to boost up with Calm Mind and smite opponents with powerful attacks off that mighty Special Attack stat. If Snorlax is ruining your fun, Will-O-Wisp will teach it a lesson; alternatively, Gardevoir can also use Destiny Bond to take a foe down along with it. A Salac Berry isn't a bad idea here, but note that it might give away the surprise. Note that the options in the last two moveslots can all be used interchangeably, and with just about any alternative in the Other Options section as well.</p>

<p>Offensive variants of Gardevoir, like this one, should mostly invest in Speed and Special Attack. Good Speed stats to hit are 244 (192 EVs with a neutral Speed nature), which beats all Tyranitar, and 270 (200 EVs and a positive nature), which outpaces Adamant Heracross.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Gardevoir aims to trap the likes of Blissey as it switches in, put it to sleep with Hypnosis, and then set up a Calm Mind sweep, reusing Hypnosis if the foe wakes up. For the most part, Gardevoir's defenses are high enough to let it take one hit as the opponent wakes up.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Substitute

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Gardevoir trying to be Jynx. Put a counter to sleep with Hypnosis and set up with Calm Mind, while using Substitute to guard against status, block critical hits, and scout for low sleep rolls. While it isn't as good as Jynx because it packs a less accurate sleep move, lower Speed, and inferior coverage, it can at least take a hit.</p>

[SET]
name: Supporter
move 1: Psychic
move 2: Wish
move 3: Protect
move 4: Ice Punch / Thunderbolt
item: Leftovers
ability: Trace
nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP / 48 SpA / 176 SpD / 32 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set can be used as a special wall of sorts, but note that it is outclassed by Wish Blissey in some aspects. The two moves in the fourth moveslot let it counter either Dragon Dance Salamence or Gyarados as long as you stay healthy, and Wish helps your team out.</p>

<p>This bulkier Gardevoir should maximize HP and run a Calm nature. Investing in Defense can help Gardevoir to better survive attacks such as Meteor Mash, though, so it remains a viable option.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Gardevoir's movepool is humungous, to say the least, and it is very versatile: you can vary its moveset to fit your team, mixing and matching moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Hypnosis, and Wish as you find appropriate. Fire Punch is good for Grass- and Steel-types, such as Celebi and Metagross, respectively. As with its fellow Psychic-types, Gardevoir can make use of Hidden Power Grass to hurt Tyranitar and Claydol, and of course to OHKO Swampert. Psych Up lets it steal boosts from the likes of Suicune, Celebi, and Jirachi, and then proceed to beat them up: Suicune will fall to Thunderbolt, Jirachi to Fire Punch, and Celebi to either Fire Punch or Ice Punch. The paralysis provided by Thunder Wave is always appreciated, as are the defensive boosts from Light Screen and Reflect. Gardevoir can also sacrifice itself with Memento to set up a sweep for a Belly Drum or Focus Punch user, but beware of Metagross's Clear Body. Snatch is another way of wrecking opposing Calm Mind users.</p>

<p>It should be noted that while Trace is a fun ability and the more useful one as well, Synchronize can be neat as it lets Gardevoir switch into Will-O-Wisp from Dusclops or Weezing and burn them in return. Gardevoir detests being burned, though, so be sure to pack cleric support.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Blissey sponges any special attack, but she cannot beat Gardevoir on her own if Gardevoir has Wish or Rest, and Gardevoir might trap her with Mean Look. Snorlax hates being hit by Will-O-Wisp, but it can Curse up and Rest it off if it so desires, and pounds Gardevoir on its low Defense. Calm Mind-boosted Psychic will hurt Snorlax though, so be careful. Metagross resists Psychic and Ice Punch and can Meteor Mash Gardevoir into oblivion; just avoid Will-O-Wisp and Fire Punch. Tyranitar is immune to Psychic and can dent Gardevoir with STAB Rock Slide or Crunch, but again, beware of Will-O-Wisp. Celebi and Jirachi both resist Psychic and can engage Gardevoir in a Psychic war; if Gardevoir isn't packing Calm Mind, they will likely pose problems. Claydol can attack Gardevoir with Earthquake, but if Gardevoir switches in, it will Trace Levitate. Psych Up Regice can go toe-to-toe with Calm Mind variants, but it might need a critical hit or a freeze to emerge victorious. Without Calm Mind, Gardevoir isn't getting past Regice anytime soon, though.</p>

<p>Generally, Gardevoir cannot stand up to strong physical hits. While they cannot effectively switch into Gardevoir's powerful special attacks, Tauros, Aerodactyl, Dodrio, and Salamence are all faster and can put the hurt on Gardevoir. Heracross works as well; while it has the advantage of being able to absorb Will-O-Wisp, it must be wary of Psychic. Also, note that Timid Gardevoir is faster than Adamant Heracross. Choice Band Swellow too will easily OHKO Gardevoir with a Guts-boosted Return, Double-Edge, or Facade.</p>
