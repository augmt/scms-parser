[Overview]

<p>Ampharos is a great anti-stall Pokemon; although it is slow, it can hit hard. Additionally, it has decent bulk and is a lot more durable than one would think, especially for an Electric-type. However, Ampharos is outclassed by Raikou in all areas but its movepool, so if you intend on using it in OU, be sure to make use of Focus Punch, or you will find yourself merely using an inferior Raikou.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Paralyze a Pokemon, and try to hit Blissey or Snorlax on the switch with Focus Punch. Reflect and Light Screen help boost Ampahros's defenses if you predict neither Blissey nor Snorlax will switch in, but if this isn't to your taste, stick with a Hidden Power to hurt Ground-types. Hidden Power Grass hits Swampert hard, while Hidden Power Ice also damages Grass- and Dragon-types, such as Salamence and Dragonite.</p>

[SET]
name: SubPunch
move 1: Focus Punch
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Thunder Wave / Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice
item: Leftovers
nature: Quiet
evs: 252 HP / 156 Atk / 100 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the set to use if you are insecure about your prediction skills. Substitute on switches, and Focus Punch your favorite special wall away. With a Speed-hindering nature, Ampharos can use Substitute after Blissey attacks with Seismic Toss, allowing Ampharos to Focus Punch it the following turn. Substitute can also be used with Thunder Wave to fish for full paralysis. This set is somewhat more usable in OU because Ampharos is a safe switch-in to Gengar and a very decent counter to Raikou.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Counter works well with Ampharos's good HP and defensive stats; watch out, Snorlax! Fire Punch grants Ampharos coverage on Metagross and Grass-types, as well as Magneton if you don't want to rely on Focus Punch.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Claydol can sponge most anything Ampharos can dish out bar Hidden Power Ice, as can Grass-types such as Celebi, Venusaur, and Exeggutor. Swampert walls variants lacking Hidden Power Grass. Finally, one misplaced Thunderbolt on an incoming Dugtrio will mean Ampharos must sit out the remainder of the match.</p>
