[Overview]

<p>Hitmontop is a somewhat potent UU Fighting-type with many tricks up his sleeve. He is somewhat outclassed in the sweeping department by Hitmonlee and Primeape, though.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: High Jump Kick / Brick Break
move 3: Hidden Power Ghost / Mach Punch
move 4: Rock Slide / Earthquake
item: Leftovers
nature: Adamant
evs: 144 HP / 252 Atk / 112 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>You want Earthquake for Muk, Vileplume, and the OHKO on Lanturn and Manectric after a Bulk Up. Mach Punch is handy to keep for nasty things like Belly Drum Clefable and Flail / Reversal Pokemon though. When using Hitmontop in UU, you can come in on Kangaskhan, Solrock and Golem to an extent as long as you won't repeatedly take their strongest assaults. Predict switches and attack accordingly, while saving Bulk Up for later on. Rock Slide in UU isn't that good, as there are more Psychics like Grumpig there than Fliers, and the Fliers that are there are either not resistant to Fighting (Fearow) or not weak to Rock (Gligar). Rock Slide can still help for Pinsir, though, so it's not completely useless.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: High Jump Kick / Brick Break
move 2: Hidden Power Ghost
move 3: Mach Punch / Rock Slide
move 4: Earthquake / Rock Slide
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If you're decent at prediction and don't mind the loss of Leftovers recovery, you can try this one out. Jolly can be useful so you can outspeed Poliwrath. This set can do quite some damage, like any Fighter with Choice Band, as long as you pick the right move on the right turn. High Jump Kick's power is probably better with a Choice Band, but you can use Brick Break if you really hate to miss.</p>

[SET]
name: Endeavor
move 1: Substitute / Endure
move 2: Endeavor
move 3: Mach Punch
move 4: Hidden Power Ghost
item: Salac Berry
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A funny surprise that might screw up one or two enemies if they don't see it coming. Get to trigger that Salac at low HP by using Substitute or Endure, then Endeavor them to that some low amount of HP. If you can, try to Substitute on a switch to a faster Pokemon. Keep up the Substitute by using it every time they attack you to break the Substitute, and you should end up at low HP with Salac activated and a Substitute up. Now you can actually finish them off with Mach Punch or Hidden Power Ghost and Endeavor the next Pokemon. Note how even with Jolly and max Speed, Hitmontop can not outspeed max Speed Crobat and Jolteon after Salac Berry. Don't give Hitmontop HP EVs when using Substitute, you'll want to be able to Substitute four times.</p>

[SET]
name: Counter
move 1: Brick Break / High Jump Kick
move 2: Counter
move 3: Hidden Power Ghost
move 4: Endeavor / Mach Punch / Protect
item: Leftovers / Salac Berry
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 HP / 136 Atk / 112 Def / 8 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hitmontop is pretty good at Countering. With these EVs, he can come into Gligar Hidden Power Flying, Muk Sludge Bomb, etc. Protect is to scout for moves and Mach Punch for its usual uses described before. Use Salac Berry and Endeavor to hurt one more Pokemon after Countering a nearly deadly hit, otherwise go with Leftovers. Brick Break is probably better than High Jump Kick on this set, as you don't want to lose HP to High Jump Kick, since you'll need all the HP you can get for Counter.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hitmontop can Rapid Spin, but isn't any good at it. It's easily blocked by Ghosts. If you really need it on your team, it's a good filler though. Toxic and Thief are always funny fillers. Hidden Power Ice is one of the few ways for Hitmontop to hit Gligar hard in UU, but it's more likely you get more mileage from Toxic or Counter. Substitute isn't bad for Bulk Up sets to protect against status from slower Pokemon. Revenge becomes 120 base power if you get hit first, and can be used instead of Counter to beat up Special attackers.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Each set has its own useful EVs. For the most part, Hitmontop should stick with focusing on Attack, and then either try to live through hits by stacking HP, or get some Speed. Somewhere around 200 Speed is a good number.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gligar is his main fear, kind of in the same way Salamence is in standard. Its high Defense and Fighting resistance make it easy to bring in, and Swords Danced Hidden Power Flying is a major hurting for Hitmontop. Muk and other Poisons are hard to get past if you don't have Earthquake, while Misdreavus is going to be a pain in the ass without Hidden Power Ghost. Even if you have it, Misdreavus has a good chance of beating you with Mean Look, Perish Song, and then stalling with Protect. Solrock can Reflect upon you and generally tank, but on the other hand, Brick Break owns the Reflect and Hitmontop resists Rock Slide.</p>
