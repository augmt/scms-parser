[Overview]

<p>Absol has a good movepool and great Attack. Too bad its poor defenses and Speed stop it from being better, or it could be a complete monster. Baton Pass is still fun to toy with.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a Baton Passing Absol. Absol makes a great Baton Passer with Taunt and can hit stuff hard with Shadow Ball. However, you may not find Taunt to be particularly useful in UU, as very few things run Roar there, and so for this reason, you may prefer Hidden Power Fighting. It combos nicely with Shadow Ball to hit everything at least neutrally. Substitute, however, is still useful to stop status effect moves and is a lot easier on prediction than Taunt. It also blocks Explosion and goes well with Baton Pass.</p>

[EVs]

<p>You'll want to focus on Defense and HP on Baton Passing Absol. For the sweeper sets, however, you'll want Attack, and lots of it. Running 264 Speed for Salac variants helps.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Your best bet is probably Gligar, unless Absol is using a novelty Ice Beam set. What hinders Absol is that its Speed is so low that even if it could pull something off, Nidoking or Fearow could just switch in and beat it down. Pokemon like Kangaskhan can easily take a hit from the special set and 2HKO it.</p>
