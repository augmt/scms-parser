[Overview]

<p>Rapidash suffers from being a Fire-type, having to compete with a lot of other Pokemon that all have the same syndrome: high Attack but no physical STAB, and no offensive movepool to speak of. Rapidash's redeeming factors are Baton Pass and Hypnosis mostly, so try to use these when using Rapidash. You really should only use Rapidash in UU.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Substitute / Agility
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice
item: Leftovers / Salac Berry / Petaya Berry
ability: Flash Fire
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 112 SpA / 144 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hypnosis is an option on this set if your opponent doesn't have a Pokemon that Rapidash can scare off (like Skarmory), giving you a free turn to set up a Substitute / Agility. Fire Blast will keep Skarmory and Weezing from erasing your boosts, so you can Substitute as they go to, say, Blissey, and then Baton Pass that Substitute to Gengar and Focus Punch it. Obviously, this set works in UU as well.</p>

<p>You may not need as many Speed EVs if you are using Agility, but it might come handy to get in that crucial Hypnosis or Hidden Power. The IVs given are for Hidden Power Ice, which should generally only be used in OU, as Hidden Power Grass is more important to hit Waters like Blastoise, Walrein, and Quagsire there.</p>

[SET]
name: SunnyBeam
move 1: Sunny Day
move 2: Solar Beam
move 3: Flamethrower / Fire Blast
move 4: Hypnosis / Hidden Power Ice
item: Leftovers
ability: Flash Fire
nature: Modest
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>It doesn't have the best Special Attack stat, but can catch your opponent by surprise. Hypnosis is still effective vs. Pokemon with Natural Cure like Blissey. Sunny Day as they come in, Hypnosis. If they stay in, they have to eat boosted Fire Blasts, and if they switch out, they're switching to something that isn't their main special wall, so if they try and come back in, you can just use Hypnosis again on them. Hidden Power Ice hits Salamence in OU, but the main Pokemon for which it's used in UU, is Gligar, who is OHKOed by Fire Blast, and almost always OHKOed by Flamethrower anyway, so Hypnosis is probably better. Sunny Day keeps Rapidash safe from Surf as it attacks.</p>

<p>Once again, the IVs are only if you choose Hidden Power Ice.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Hypnosis
move 2: Overheat
move 3: Iron Tail
move 4: Hidden Power Rock / Hidden Power Fighting
item: Leftovers
ability: Flash Fire
nature: Hasty
evs: 252 Atk / 110 SpA / 148 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hypnosis is to put whatever Pokemon that is giving the team trouble to Sleep. Then, just use whatever attacks it needs to take it down. You'll have to deal with the limited movepool Rapidash provides for you. Overheat any Steel-types that come your way. Iron Tail any Rocks like Solrock. Pick whichever Hidden Power your team needs. Hidden Power Rock and Fighting are useful to take on Walrein just a little better.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Quick Attack is present just to counter Pokemon with Reversal and the like. It can use Double Kick on a physical attacking set to open up room so you don't have to use Hidden Power Fighting, and this works against Substitute Tyranitar in standard to an extent.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Rapidash needs 307 Speed minimum to be faster than Jolly Kangaskhan, and a load of other UU threats like Gligar. This requires 244 Speed EVs without a nature, and, if you're going that high, you might as well max it out to go for the tie against other Rapidash, Modest Electabuzz, and Modest Manectric. Alternately, you can use a +Speed nature and bring yourself to 310 Speed, which still beats all Kangaskhan, but also outpaces the aforementioned Modest Electabuzz / Manectric, which requires 144 EVs and a +Speed nature. Most sets will then max one of the attacking stats, and then pump the rest of the EVs into the other attacking stat if you're using a mixed Rapidash, or HP if you are not. The Baton Passer should have more HP EVs than that, however.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Suicune and any other Water-type shuts it out. Dugtrio can actually survive anything Rapidash throws at it except Fire Blast, and then trap it and kill with Earthquake. Aerodactyl has the advantage of resisting Fire, is faster, and has two moves that can OHKO (Earthquake and Rock Slide). Salamence easily beats Rapidash without Hidden Power Ice, same for Dragonite. All these counters should be careful for Hypnosis, if it hits of course. In Underused matches other Fire-type Pokemon generally stop it dead, if you don't have Hidden Power Ice then Altaria counters Rapidash quite easily being resistant to Fire Blast and Solar Beam and Natural Cure takes care of Hypnosis. Walrein can stall it out with Toxic, thanks to Thick Fat, or just attack it outright with Surf, same goes for Blastoise. Quagsire beats Rapidash without Hidden Power Grass. Hypno can stall out anything but a Toxic variant. Cradily stops all but the Sunny Day set, and even that one can easily get PP stalled, because the chance to get a Critical Hit is small with only 8 Fire Blast PP, and Flamethrower won't do enough.</p>
