[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Bring it in on a Choice Banded Normal or Flying hit, get up your Substitute, and start wrecking things. Focus Punch can wear down Waters quickly, STAB Rock Slide hurts in general, and Ice Beam is a nasty surprise for any Ground-type that tries to wall you, especially Gligar.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Aggron is usually too slow for Endeavor, but its immunity to sandstorm makes it interesting for standard play. Aggron can Roar, but it won't beat anything it didn't already. Counter works quite well--it can survive non-STAB Earthquakes or Brick Breaks and Counter them back for an OHKO.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gligar counters Aggron lacking Ice Beam especially well, as does Quagsire. Vileplume could also cause it some troubles, resisting Focus Punches, using Aromatherapy to prevent paralysis from Thunder Wave, and healing off Rock Slide damage with Moonlight. Solrock could wall it for quite a while since Aggron can't really do anything to it, especially if it's Reflecting. A solid tank such as Blastoise pretty much could Rest off anything Aggron has to throw at it.</p>
