[Overview]

<p>Definitely one of the best UU Pokemon available. It has an immunity to Earthquake and Thunderbolt, and resistances to Fighting, Bug, and Poison; it doesn't get much better than this. Quick Attack is a nice tool, and a STAB and Swords Dance-boosted Earthquake will hurt. It has some issues with the ever-common Water-types and Solrock, but still it has ways to get around those.</p>

<p>The standard Gligar. Get your opponent's Waters out of the way and sweep to victory. You can come in on most Earthquakes, but don't expect to live through Special hits. Iron Tail is useful for the common Solrock.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Hidden Power Flying
move 3: Quick Attack
move 4: Iron Tail
item: Choice Band
ability: Hyper Cutter
nature: Adamant

<p>It works a bit like Flygon, except in UU. If you can predict Solrock, use Iron Tail and pray that it hits, because it will nearly OHKO it. Gligar's attack is just average though; it won't do as much damage as most Choice Banders. If they don't have a very defensive Water, you can potentially 2HKO their Gligar counter with a Choice Band Earthquake or Hidden Power Flying.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance + Salac
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Hidden Power Flying / Hidden Power Bug
move 4: Substitute / Endure
item: Salac Berry
ability: Hyper Cutter
nature: Adamant
evs: 60 HP / 252 Atk / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Basically you hit stuff on the switch until you think you can kill anything that's left, faster or not. Swords Dance, then Substitute or Endure yourself into Salac range. Using a Damage Calculator isn't a bad idea with this. Almost every serious UU team has something to take out low-health users though, be sure to take that out as well before going for Salac. Hidden Power Flying is good for STAB, and does tons of damage to Meganium and a bit to other Gligar, but Hidden Power Bug still hits Grass types (unless they're part Poison, in which case Earthquake is neutral), in addition to nailing Solrock and Lunatone hard, but you're lost against anything that's Flying.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Swords Dance will usually do better than Screech, but it helps for softening up something for your counter (for example, you Screech a Blastoise on the switch, then go to a Choice Bander). Counter is unexpected, but Gligar can live through almost any physical hit, boosted or not--it's a great surprise for Fearow and such friends. Toxic can help wearing down stuff on switches, but with the prevalence of a Sleep Talking Water type for a Gligar counter, it's primarily for Solrock on teams that don't have Vileplume to Aromatherapy. Steel Wing is less powerful than Iron Tail, but more accurate.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Gligar will generally want to use an Adamant nature with max Speed to tie other Gligar, or a Jolly nature and 200 EVs, bringing you to 280 Speed after the Speed IV drop from Hidden Power Flying, making you just faster than Adamant Kangaskhan. You should always max Attack, and put the rest in HP. When holding a Salac Berry, get 254 Speed max (196 EVs), as this beats out an Electrode without a +Speed nature. Alternately, you can run 242 Speed (144 EVs), to beat the unused Persian and Sneasel after your Salac Berry. You could go down to 227 Speed (84 EVs) to be faster than a Timid Electabuzz or Manectric after you activate your Salac Berry. This is the absolute lowest recommended Speed.</p>
