[Overview]

<p>Hitmonchan is one of the worst Fighting-types in the game; about on par with Machoke. Use Hitmonlee.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band moveset. Rock Slide isn't particularly useful in UU, as even Focus Punch hits Gligar harder on the switch, but it does hit Pinsir and Scyther.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Sky Uppercut / Brick Break
move 2: Hidden Power Ghost
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Bulk Up
item: Leftovers
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rock Slide won't be hitting much of anything in UU, so Hidden Power Ghost is generally preferred for Solrock and Lunatone, while still hitting Gligar for almost as much.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Mach Punch is useful on there somewhere, to finish off Reversalers / Flailers, and to make up for Hitmonchan's mediocre Speed. Don't use Fire Punch, Ice Punch or Thunder Punch, as Hitmonchan's Special Attack is absolutely horrible.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Max Attack and Speed. Expect it to die quickly.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gligar and Solrock act as effective counters, thanks to their high Defense, but Solrock can have a bit of trouble with Hitmonchan's Rock resistance, but not really that much, because Hitmonchan isn't nearly as powerful as Hitmonlee, offensively, so it can afford to take a couple hits. Slowking will also have a thing or two to say to it. Masquerain beats those without Rock Slide. Blastoise and Meganium can take hits from the Choice Band set.</p>
