[Overview]

<p>Awesome UU special sweeper, generally overlooked for other special sweepers like Grumpig or Electabuzz, but still very good in its own right.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind + Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Calm Mind
move 3: Hypnosis
move 4: Psychic / Ice Beam
item: Leftovers
nature: Modest
evs: 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Many people don't know that Lunatone gets Baton Pass, so this could be a shocker to them. It can sweep on its own if it has to, or Baton Pass all those Calm Minds to something fast like Electabuzz and sweep.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Hypnosis
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Calm Mind
item: Leftovers
nature: Modest
evs: 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hypnosis what you can't Calm Mind against, or kill and then do what would work well in the situation.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Reflect and Light Screen can be good for pseudo-passing, and Lunatone has the typing and stats to come in on a few things to set them up. I'd go with Reflect on Lunatone, since you could just Baton Pass Calm Minds if you want a Special Defense boost. Lunatone can also Baton Pass Cosmic Power in a Baton Pass chain.</p>

[EVs]

<p>You'll generally want to max HP, give a token Speed investment, and then stick the rest of your EVs into Defense and possibly Special Attack. Calm Mind covers Special Attack and Special Defense, though. For Baton Passing, give it enough Speed to be faster than Blastoise and Grasses, which means about 200 Speed, or 96 EVs.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Grumpig and Hypno counter Lunatone exceptionally well. Aggron could give it some trouble with its resistance. Sharpedo, Slowking and Crawdaunt needs some love and countering Lunatone is where they come in handy with resistance to Ice Beam and resistance or immunity to Psychic.</p>
