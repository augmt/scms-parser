[Overview]

<p>Electrode is one of those Pokemon that only kills something by killing itself... Sadly, it is probably one of the worst Electric-types, possibly surpassing only Minun and Plusle.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>You can Substitute down to 1 HP for the OHKO with Explosion, but if you boost with a Liechi Berry, it might be predictable--it's risky to use, but it's cool. Electrode can be a pretty dangerous Pokemon, especially being faster Crobat. Only use Leftovers with Substitute, because Electrode won't survive much of anything.</p>

[EVs]

<p>A 396 Speed stat, and the rest in Attack and Special Attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>You might want to use other Electrics such as Lanturn and Ampharos. Muk, Hypno, Grumpig all fair well against it due to their HP, Special Defense, or a combination of both. The Grass-types will also be annoying for Electrode to get anything going.</p>
