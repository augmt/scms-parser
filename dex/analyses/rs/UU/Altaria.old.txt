[Overview]

<p>Natural Cure Rest is just awesome, and Altaria is the only thing that really gets to pull it off, since all other Pokemon with Natural Cure, even Corsola and Roselia, have Recover or some sort of recovery move. Thanks to Natural Cure, when Altaria uses Rest, it instantly wakes up after switching out. Its defensive stats are great, and it has the support moves to use them. That's why a set with more of a stalling mentality is recommended. However, the Dragon Dance set with Sing can really surprise people when you put their counter to sleep.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a semi-standard Altaria set for both versions of play. Toxic can be used with Altaria's defenses to stall the opponent out and then heal with Rest, while Flamethrower will hit anything that you can't hit with Toxic (namely, Steel- and Poison-types, especially since many Poisons have a part Grass typing). Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit Water-types in general and Quagsire in particular. Dragon Claw can be used as an attack for the "Flameclaw" combo, which nothing resists, but Dragon Claw really isn't going to be hurting much, so it's not recommended. Sing and Toxic don't make a very good combo, generally, so try and use that with Dragon Claw more often.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Dragon Dancing Altaria set is pretty much an inferior Salamence, except that Altaria can Natural Rest and hit the road when it knows it's beaten. Put in a Fire-type move if you want to beat Skarmory, but I'd suggest sticking with Rest and just Natural Resting when big bad Skarmory comes in. Fortunately, Skarmory is not in the same metagame as Altaria, and thus won't be seen in Altaria's normal use (UU).</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Altaria gained Heal Bell with the XD moves, making it an even better supporter. It can come in to sponge a hit, Heal Bell to cure Toxics, Sleep Powders and whatnot, maybe Rest off any damage taken, and switch out to come back later.</p>

[EVs]

<p>For Dragon Dancing sets, keep Speed at the magic 200, focus a little bit on Attack, giving it an Adamant nature, even if you're using a Fire-type move, then dump the rest in HP and defenses. For a stalling set, you'll want to take advantage of Altaria's defenses, which are actually her best stats. Give her around 200 Speed, and then max HP, with any remaining EVs going into Defense and Special Defense, with most of the emphasis on Special Defense, as it is not only her greatest stat, but Ice Beam is her greatest fear, and you want to be able to survive it. Give her a Careful nature. That should just about do it for our little cotton soprano here.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Your best choices would be Hypno and Grumpig for the special attacker, albeit watch out for Toxics. Blastoise and Walrein pretty much stop Altaria all the time. If it's a Dragon Dancer, just send in your Solrock or Lunatone. Solid high HP Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Granbull can easily take anything Altaria throws at them, too.</p>
