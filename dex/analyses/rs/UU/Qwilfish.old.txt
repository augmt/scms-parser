[Overview]

<p>Qwilfish is still Tentacruel's little brother, but Spikes are much better in Advance than they were in GSC, so Qwilfish is a valuable part of any UU team. The last set listed is also an incredible surprise Pokemon and will almost always kill something. Without Spikes it'd be insanely mediocre, but with them it's a pretty good UU. Always consider this fish for any UU team you might be making.</p>

[SET]
name: Spiker
move 1: Substitute / Hydro Pump
move 2: Sludge Bomb
move 3: Destiny Bond / Self-Destruct
move 4: Spikes
item: Leftovers / Salac Berry
ability: Poison Point
nature: Jolly / Hasty
evs: 252 HP / 24 SpD / 232 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Not a bad set with a simple idea behind it. Lead with it or switch into a Toxic or even Sludge Bomb, use Substitute, then let the Spikes roll in. Finish off opponents with Sludge Bomb, and if you've done your Spiking job and their Rapid Spinner is gone, Destiny Bond or Self-Destruct some slower Pokemon to hell. If your slower opponent sees Destiny Bond and doesn't dare to kill you, lay more Spikes or Sludge Bomb him.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Sludge Bomb
move 3: Hydro Pump
move 4: Self-Destruct
item: Leftovers
ability: Poison Point
nature: Hasty
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sword Dancing set with the opportunity to kill something with Self-Destruct. Swords Dance up as much as you can and hit whatever isn't totally resistant to your two attacking moves. Hydro Pump is needed for Gligar in particular, but also hits Aggron, Golem, and the like.</p>

[SET]
name: Uber Choice Band
move 1: Sludge Bomb
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Hydro Pump / Ice Beam
move 4: Self-Destruct
item: Choice Band
ability: Swift Swim
nature: Lonely / Naughty
evs: 200 HP / 252 Atk / 56 Spe 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is designed for the Uber metagame in particular, but can be used outside of it, you'll just need a lot more Speed. The theory is that Qwilfish becomes faster than everything else with Drizzle in effect (and thus should only be used with Kyogre), but can't stay in for long due to its poor defenses and lack of useful resists outside of Ice Beam. A Choice Band, therefore, suits the style of play Qwilfish generally needs to survive. Hydro Pump hits Skarmory, Forretress, and Metagross, and does something to Groudon, but Ice Beam will do more to Groudon and Rayquaza. Hydro Pump is probably going to be the more useful move, as Rayquaza is very rare, especially compared to Forretress, and Hydro Pump is not much weaker vs. Groudon than Ice Beam. Sludge Bomb still hits Rayquaza decently hard.</p>

<p>The Speed makes it faster than +Speed Deoxys-A in the Rain, the fastest Pokemon you are likely to encounter.</p>

[SET]
name: Flail
move 1: Endure
move 2: Flail
move 3: Shadow Ball / Destiny Bond
move 4: Swords Dance
item: Salac Berry
nature: Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Man is this thing cool. Sword Dance to boost the power of Flail, Endure to get down to 1 HP and get the Salac boost, and then nail whatever you can with Flail. Gengar or some other resistant Pokemon comes in to take the Flail after they know you have it? Destiny Bond him back to hell when he tries to do dismantle Qwilfish. Excellent surprise set that is almost guaranteed to get one kill, if not two, even in standard play. Shadow Ball prevents Ghosts from ruining your sweep if you don't want Destiny Bond.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There are better Hazers out there, but Qwilfish can Haze if you want him to, maybe in lieu of Destiny Bonding. Ice Beam can be used to for stuff like Claydol and Salamence, I suppose, but most everything else, such as Grass-types, will be hit harder by Sludge Bomb. Counter can be used instead of Destiny Bond, though most stuff KOs Qwilfish and Destiny Bond tends to be a much better move.</p>

[EVs]

<p>If you're using a mixed set, you should lower his Defense (use Hasty or Lonely nature), especially if you're using Destiny Bond, as that would guarantee that most things kill you, but still lets you switch on Walrein, Blastoise, and other Water-types. You'll want a lot of Attack on the sweeper sets, but more defensive EVs on the Spiker.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Donphan and Claydol can completely shut you down if you don't have Hydro Pump, and Claydol doesn't take much even if you do. Big brother Tentacruel can easily get set up on Qwilfish, and anything that can take a Sludge Bomb and deal some good damage is a pretty good deterrent as well. Most Rapid Spinners tend to have more than enough defense to take you on, so don't get overzealous with the Spikes. Take what you can get. From the "if it has to Destiny Bond you" standpoint of counters, Muk and Misdreavus make great switch ins. Gligar and Solrock can also have a say or two in countering this blowfish if they can avoid Hydro Pump.</p>
