[SET COMMENTS]

<p>MissyD! The old Perish Trapper from GSC is back for more in ADV. Perish trapping is even better in ADV with Taunt. Trap your foe, Protect to regain health from Leftovers, Perish Song or Taunt depending on who is on the field. Protect and Taunt whore until it falls, and switch out. This is really a no-brainer. Use Destiny Bond if you are sure Misdreavus isn't going to survive the 3 turn setup Perish Song needs.</p>

<p>A cool set, to tell you the truth. Taunt a wall and Calm Mind up, then lay the smack down with Thunderbolt.</p>

[SET]
name: Imprison
move 1: Hidden Power Ice
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Thunder Wave
move 4: Imprison
item: Leftovers
nature: Modest
evs: 236 Hp / 68 Def / 124 SpA / 80 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A lot of Pokemon rely on Hidden Power to hit Misdreavus since it's immune to Ground, Fighting and Normal, so Imprison prevents them from touching you. Often you will find the opponent frustrated by how they suddenly cannot attack her once Imprison is used. With Thunder Wave on the set you can't be paralyzed bar a random Stun Spore, and Hidden Power Ice forces Ground types to switch, helping you to spread paralysis.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Snatch can catch a nice Substitute if they think you are going to Confuse Ray or Thunder Wave. Pain Split is a decent idea for recovering HP, since Misdreavus's HP is still quite low even with all those EVs invested. Shadow Ball with a few EVs in Attack is a 2HKO to Hypno and Grumpig, and on the Imprison set allows you to wall Banette and Granbull.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Mostly HP and defenses. Maxing out Speed is not recommended: you'll only outrun Gligar (which isn't even a guarantee since many have Jolly and maximum Speed) at the expense of much-needed defenses.</p>

[Counters]

<p>Counters are Mr. Mime and Exploud due to Perish Song immunity. Misdreavus isn't capable of taking many hits so hitting it hard with Choice Banders is probably your best way to beat Misdreavus.</p>
