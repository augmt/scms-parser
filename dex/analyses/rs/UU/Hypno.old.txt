[Overview]

<p>A good UU Pokemon would be an understatement. It is top tier UU for a reason: it walls special hits over and over, takes physical hits moderately well, and supports your team with pseudo-passing moves such as Reflect, Light Screen, and Wish. It can switch into so many things in the UU metagame.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is just about the only Hypno set you will encounter. It's your standard support Hypno that you will see around UU almost all the time. It can be an annoyance if you don't have things to faint this before it Thunder Waves your whole team and sets up a Reflect. If you're using this, you will most likely switch in on something that has the potential to use a sleeping move or hit you with a special attack. While not being much of an offensive guy, it takes special hits like few others in UU. Psychic and Seismic Toss both work. It really depends though, do you want something that can hit Pokemon such as Gligar harder, or being able to stop Pokemon with Substitute from setting up as easily? It's up to you and your overall team. If you use Protect, use it with Toxic to further stall turns, but both Toxic and Thunder Wave can be used with Reflect. Use Counter with Toxic, as well, because it really ruins a perfect prediction to have them fully paralyzed when you Counter, thus destroying the surprise.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Baton Pass
move 4: Psychic
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 192 Def / 64 Spe

<p>This is pretty much the only other moveset you will encounter. Like the other moveset, switch into sleep moves and special attacks, use Substitute and Calm Mind, and Baton Pass them to a target Pokemon. It could work if you passed it to a fast Pokemon such as Electabuzz.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hypnosis could work to put Pokemon to sleep. Hypno definitely has the defenses to survive a miss or two, unlike many other Pokemon that learn Hypnosis. Light Screen helps because it protects the rest of your teams against Special hits without having to switch in Hypno. Fire Punch might work in very rare cases, but it'd be more fit if you battle against standard Pokemon such as Steelix and Metagross.</p>

[EVs]

<p>On both movesets, you will pretty much want to pump HP and Defenses. Try and get your Speed somewhere above 176 to beat Solrock and Lunatone. Put some EVs in Special Attack if you have Psychic.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Even with Reflect, Gligar and Ground Pokemon in general will switch into Hypno's Thunder Waves easily and get a free hit on whatever switches in. Banette is a bit risky because you don't want it to take a Thunder Wave, but it deals a ton of damage with its STAB Shadow Ball. Hidden Power Dark Grumpig says 'sup to Hypno as well by Substituting on the Thunder Wave and Calm Minding while Hypno is saddened.</p>
