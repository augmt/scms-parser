[Overview]

<p>Banette can switch in on a sleep-inflicting move like Sleep Powder; more often than not this will cause a switch, so it can get in a couple hits, a Will-O-Wisp, or a Knock Off. Despite its low Speed and mediocre defenses, Banette is a good UU Ghost-type with its decent Attack.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Knock Off and attack whenever possible, but it's also fun to burn things. Insomnia can really mess up some Pokemon and provides some easy switch-ins. Unfortunately, this can't be done often with Banette as you can see its defenses are lacking. This is more of an anti-tank Pokemon; if you want to counter sleep inducers, Hypno is probably the safer bet.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Hidden Power Fighting
move 3: Will-O-Wisp / Toxic
move 4: Destiny Bond / Hyper Beam
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 112 HP / 252 Atk / 144 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Banette's top two attacking moves are self-explanatory. It has such a bad movepool, though, that other attacks are hard to find; even Double-Edge doesn't damage anything more than the other moves, other than the Normal / Flying types and Girafarig. Will-O-Wisp hurts them more, anyway. Hyper Beam and Destiny Bond are both suicide moves, Will-O-Wisp actually does something to physical sweepers, while Toxic can be used to wear down bulky Water-types.</p>

[SET]
name: Salac + Destiny Bond
move 1: Destiny Bond
move 2: Endure / Hidden Power Fighting
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Will-O-Wisp
item: Salac Berry
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 32 HP / 252 Atk / 224 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set works well in UU, and it can catch things off guard. Banette is immune to Quick Attack / Mach Punch, so running Salac Berry should bring no worries. Hit / burn what you can, and then when you think your run is over, Endure and proceed to Destiny Bond that now slower sweeper or wall.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Banette's will need its Attack maxed out and should have an Adamant nature. You'll want a bit of Speed on this thing, usually, as well, because you don't want it taking a hit from what it's supposed to be killing. For the third set, max Speed and Attack with either Jolly or Adamant can work depending on what you want to outspeed after a Salac boost. Jolly can outspeed basically everything in UU except base 125 Speed Pokemon and above, but you lose the Attack power.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Not many things in UU can switch into Banette, but Blastoise, Walrein, and Politoed can hold their own quite well. Meganium can also switch into it, although it can't do anything back directly. Gligar and Golem can take a few hits, but again, watch out for that burn. Muk blocks Knock Off with Sticky Hold, and has decent defenses to take Shadow Balls and Hidden Power Fightings, but unless it has Rest or manages to get up a Substitute, it won't like taking Will-O-Wisp.</p>
