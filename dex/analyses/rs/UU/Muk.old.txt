[Overview]

<p>In UU, Muk is very hard to beat if you don't know the set. I recommend Muk for any UU team. It also has a very high cool factor.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard
move 1: Sludge Bomb
move 2: Ice Punch
move 3: Explosion
move 4: Hidden Power Ghost / Hidden Power Grass
item: Leftovers
ability: Sticky Hold
nature: Brave
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Use this set for Muk in UU, where it's right at home. Switch in on a Grasser or a Fighter (hopefully without Earthquake), and hit away. Ice Punch shuts down any unsuspecting Gligar, Hidden Power Ghost is for Misdreavus and Shedinja, and Hidden Power Grass stops Quagsire. There's no need for Special Attack EVs as you need more EVs in Special Attack than it's worth to OHKO either Gligar or Quagsire. Both Hidden Powers should do the job should Solrock come in to counter you.</p>

[SET]
name: SubPunch
move 1: Sludge Bomb
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Focus Punch
move 4: Hidden Power Ghost / Ice Punch
item: Leftovers
ability: Sticky Hold
nature: Adamant / Brave
evs: 252 HP / 196 Atk / 60 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Slow and over 404 HP, so Muk is automatically a great Subpuncher. With a great Attack, this is something to watch out for. In UU, the only Steel that is used sometimes is Mawile, which Focus Punch is more than enough for, so Fire Blast isn't needed.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Sludge Bomb
move 3: Fire Blast / Hidden Power Ghost
move 4: Explosion / Rest
item: Leftovers
ability: Sticky Hold
nature: Sassy / Careful
evs: 252 HP / 156 Atk / 100 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Great Special Defense and Attack like Snorlax, Muk makes a pretty good Curser. Cursed Explosion is powerful, but with Rest you can keep on tanking. It will probably be run over by Psychic and Earthquake.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Sludge Bomb
move 2: Focus Punch
move 3: Hidden Power Ghost
move 4: Explosion
item: Choice Band
ability: Sticky Hold
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>More novelty than anything. Bring it in like you normally would, and predict what your opponent is going to do. Use the right attack, and hopefully you will hit them hard.</p>

[EVs]

<p>When you are running no special attacks, at least 401 HP on Muk, 404 if you are using Substitute. Adamant for the SubPuncher, Careful for the Curser, with EVs focused on the stats you are boosting (Attack and Special Defense respectively).</p>

<p>For mixed movesets, use a speed-cutting nature: Brave for more Attack, Sassy for more Special Defense.</p>

<p>As you see, Muk is quite hard to spread EVs for, so if you're having a lot of trouble you can just use max HP and Attack and you'll be just fine.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Body Slam can paralyze the opponent, and paralysis is always good. Imprison is very unorthodox and works in very rare circumstances, stay away from it until you've tried out the standard Muk. Memento can make your opponent's Pokemon harmless, so you can set up a Belly Drummer next turn. Explosion is more recommended for suicide, though. Rest, with or without Sleep Talk, makes your Muk live longer. It's really an easy switch for counters though.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Muk is hard to counter. Its first set isn't shut down by anything completely, except Misdreavus and Shedinja if you run Hidden Power Grass, or Quagsire / Whiscash if you have Hidden Power Ghost. Nidoking and Nidoqueen can take one or two Ice Punches and Earthquake Muk to death.</p>
