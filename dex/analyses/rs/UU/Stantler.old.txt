[Overview]

<p>Stantler; it's not just for Christmas teams! Stantler's average stats and awesome movepool make it a top-tier UU that can fit on most any UU team. It just doesn't have the durability for OU play, but is an interesting option if you're in need of a change and want a good statuser. Plus, it's a reindeer. Gotta love it.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Hypnosis
move 2: Calm Mind
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Psychic / Hidden Power Ice
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 96 HP / 252 SpA / 160 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A special sweeper that uses Hypnosis to put its counters out of commission. Psychic hits more powerfully than Hidden Power Ice on foes that are neutral to the attacks, but Hidden Power Ice has better type coverage with Thunderbolt.</p>

[SET]
name: Swagger + Psych Up
move 1: Swagger
move 2: Psych Up
move 3: Return
move 4: Shadow Ball / Earthquake
item: Leftovers
nature: Jolly
evs: 188 HP / 68 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Blah. I don't like Swagger + Psych-Up combo, but if you do Stantler can certainly pull it off. Just be careful you don't Swagger something that's going to destroy you in one hit if it hits through confusion.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Return
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Thunderbolt / Double-Edge
item: Choice Band
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A watered down version of Tauros except for Shadow Ball. Thunderbolt for Skarmory, Double-Edge to hit harder. I wouldn't recommend it but Stantler has a good movepool, so you can go for it if you want to.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Skill Swap could be fun, and your Intimidate won't help anybody. Toxic and Hypnosis are other options for statuses that Stantler can inflict.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Stantler needs some weird EVs, depending on his set. For the standard set you're obviously going to want some Speed and Attack, so either give it full Speed and a +Spe nature or 285, enough to outspeed Medicham and other things at that Speed. Split the rest in Attack and HP so he'll survive and get more from Leftovers. For the Calm Mind set worry more about Special Attack and Speed over everything else, maybe a little in HP too. Psych-Up set is going to need less Attack and MUCH more HP and Defense.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything that shrugs off or abuses status for the first set, like Heracross or Celebi. Any physical attacker owns the shit out of the Swagger / Psych Up set with some luck. Prediction counters the last set. Skarmory beats all sets except those with Thunderbolt, Gengar / Misdreavus beat you if you don't have Shadow Ball, and any Steel / Rock can shut you down, especially without Earthquake. Steelix just laughs even at Choice Band Earthquakes and counters with an Earthquake of its own, or Toxic.</p>
