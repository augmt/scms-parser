[Overview]

<p>Sableye's unique type combination makes it have no weaknesses. This, however, is overshadowed by its low HP and defensive stats, meaning all neutral hits still do serious damage. Outside of Knock Off and Recover, its movepool is severely lacking. It can still abuse immunities and Recover, however, to help wall a few Choice Band Pokemon, and Knock Off is a rare and very useful move.</p>

[SET]
name: Knock Off
move 1: Seismic Toss
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Recover
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 48 Def / 208 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Standard set to most people. Knock Off every Pokemon's item and just take care of them with Toxic. Seismic Toss covers for its terrible offenses, while Recover is there to help its below-average defenses by healing and stalling out with Toxic. Its type combination helps this set a little, seeing as it has no weaknesses, but don't expect much from Sableye. If it had Will-O-Wisp, it could have been a little better.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Focus Punch
move 3: Brick Break / Hidden Power Rock
move 4: Fake Out / Hidden Power Rock
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 76 HP / 252 Atk / 180 Spe 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Shadow Ball and Focus Punch hit everything at least neutral. Brick Break works to hit stuff that's already in, Fake Out can stop Pokemon at low HP, and Hidden Power Rock hits Fearow and the like hard.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Hidden Power Dark
move 3: Water Pulse / Ice Punch / Thunder Punch
move 4: Recover
item: Leftovers
nature: Modest
evs: 252 HP / 80 SpA / 176 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The move in the third slot is mostly to hit some of the bit physical Pokemon in UU. Water Pulse hits both Aggron and Gligar, for instance. Ice Punch hits Gligar harder and also covers Fearow and random Grass Pokemon. Thunder Punch still hits Aggron for neutral damage, as well as hitting Poliwrath, Tentacruel, and Walrein. Otherwise, just Calm Mind up to block special hits and then start slamming on your enemies with STAB Hidden Power Dark, Recovering off the damage.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Well, Sableye isn't exactly the Pokemon you look forward to if you're looking for a myriad of attacks. Night Shade covers Gengar, Dusclops, and Misdreavus to an extent. Torment and Taunt are fun moves to use, particularly when combined with Toxic. Substitute is some random move that can be put there.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Not much you can do with Sableye here. Think about its HP and defenses on any set you're planning to make.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any Pokemon with decent offense and the ability to hit Sableye for neutral damage can counter it, but all Pokemon have to beware of losing their item to Knock Off. After you switch one Pokemon into Sableye, that should be your general switch-in for the rest of the match, to limit the effectiveness of Knock Off. Don't get too predictable with this, however, or the Sableye user can abuse your obvious switches to get in a real heavy-hitter like Electabuzz or Hitmonlee.</p>
