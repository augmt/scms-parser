[Overview]

<p>Solrock is a staple in UU play for a good reason: he is immune to Earthquake, resists Normal and Flying, can hurt his opponents, set up dual screens, Baton Pass goodies, and Explode whenever he wants. He's been so influential that standards have changed: Gligar packs Toxic, Steel Wing or Iron Tail to deal with him, Fearow uses Steel Wing and some Grounds use Hidden Power Bug or Ghost. Still, he's good to go. In standard, he can counter some Choice Banders like Salamence and Tauros pretty decently, but you'll have to predict even more accurately because despite his good HP and Defense, he takes quite a beating from neutral or super effective hits.</p>

<p>A supporting Solrock. Solrock can come in pretty easily on Gligar, Sandslash, Kangaskhan or Fearow and put up a Reflect. You may want to beware of Shadow Ball, Steel Wing and Hidden Power Bug, but as long as you switch to Solrock on the right move and put on a Reflect, you'll be fine. After that, attack to your heart's content, switch out of counters, and keep the cycle going until you've had enough. Blow up Solrock on something that doesn't like to get blown up, and its job is done.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A more offensive version of Solrock. It won't take beatings nearly as well as the Reflect version, due to lack of Leftovers and defensive EVs, but it does pack a great punch. Preferably bring it in on Earthquakes to avoid unnecessary damage, predict your opponent's next move, and hit the appropriate button. Explode when you're through.</p>

<p>XD grants Solrock the luxury of Baton Pass, which it performs quite well. As mentioned before, it's easy to bring in. Get in a Substitute or a Calm Mind, and Baton Pass to a recipient to raise some hell on your opponent. You can toy around with the moves and the EVs--Solrock can make a fairly decent Grumpig counter with some Special Defense EVs and Shadow Ball, while still fulfilling this duty.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>With Psych Up, Solrock can surprise Snorlax in standard play. Come in when he has some Curses, copy them, and either try to take him out by yourself, or Baton Pass to something to handle him and the rest of your opponent's team. You may want to watch out for Shadow Balling ones though. Cosmic Power can be Baton Passed as well, but usually begs for Critical Hits, which you don't want. Light Screen, like Reflect, helps Solrock and the rest of the team to take hits better. Since Solrock lures Waters and Grassers, it's not a bad idea at all.</p>

<p>Body Slam can paralyze opponents sometimes, and Fire move can hurt Steels like Skarmory and Forretress in standard. Toxic can help to wear down the Waters that switch in on Solrock all the time, and finally, he doesn't make a bad Rest / Sleep Talk user. It does take away a lot of his offense though.</p>

[EVs]

<p>For most tankish Solrock, a +Defense nature like Impish is preferred. Max out his HP before working on his defenses, put his Defense somewhere between 260 and 280 to live through most hits decently. Special Defense is welcome to take on Psychics. A few Speed EVs isn't a bad idea either, especially if you're using Shadow Ball. Solrock ties Speed with Claydol, and of course it helps against enemy Solrock too.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>In standard, Metagross awaits him with his resistance to Rock Slide and Explosion, and a STABed super effective Meteor Mash for the OHKO. Earthquake without a Choice Band will only 3HKO him, so watch out. Jirachi with Reflect or Wish can be annoying to an extent, but it needs Thunderbolt and a Calm Mind to really hurt him. Swampert's, Milotic's, and Suicune's high durability and STAB Surfs will be a huge problem as well, try to Explode on them and sweep with something else. Check for Protect Swampert first though, or do it on the switch. Skarmory and Forretress take jack from any physical hit you throw at them. Both will put up Spikes, and Forretress sometimes uses Hidden Power Bug. Celebi can Recover off all your hits, and may pack a Grass move to really put a hurting in you. Dusclops can kill you with Shadow Balls, Will-O-Wisp you, block Explosions and Rest/Pain Split off the damage.</p>

<p>For UU, generally Waters and Grassers can come in on anything Solrock does, and use their STAB attacks to put a hurting in you. Most notably Quagsire, Whiscash, Blastoise, Poliwrath (usually has no Water moves though), Politoed and Slowking on the Water side, and Meganium, Vileplume, Bellossom and Tangela on the Grass one. Banette can be a pain with Will-O-Wisp but won't be switching in on Rock Slides or Shadow Balls. You must beware of him when you want to Explode though, and the same goes for when your opponent uses Misdreavus.</p>
