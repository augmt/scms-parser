[Overview]

<p>With its high HP and good Special Defense, Lanturn is a viable Electric Pokemon counter. Lanturn is also really annoying to kill in general, especially in UU matches. Volt Absorb repeatedly zaps it back to high health, and it keeps on dishing out status and some damage. Definitely worth trying.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This version of Lanturn can absorb any status from any Water, and dish attacks right back at it. With its great defensive capabilities, many special attackers will be stopped cold, and will become paralyzed in the process.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Double STAB and paralysis + confusion--Lanturn is one annoying Pokemon if used correctly. Lanturn's defensive capabilities extend beyond its ability to annoy, as its high HP coupled with its almost unique resistance to the popular Thunderbolt / Ice Beam combination make it a formidable special wall. Lanturn's ability to own Electrics, Waters, and Ice-types, and spread status all around an opponent's team, make it a strong team player.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Substitute is cool because it can make over 101 HP Substitutes. Ice Beam is a decent option on any set, but only really for Flygon in standard (and of course it is in the uber set). Salamence gets wrecked by Thunder Wave, if Lanturn is not wrecked by Earthquake beforehand. Also, Toxic is a great option in the Underused environment due to the absence of viable Heal Bellers and Aromatherapists.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Lanturn's HP is plentiful enough; it gains better defensive capabilities if you stack its defenses. 404 HP is required if you use Substitute; 401 will do otherwise. Usually it doesn't need Defense since it's mostly a special wall, so focus on Special Defense. It is desperate for Special Attack EVs for hurting anything. Use Calm or Modest nature.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Quagsire, due to Water Absorb and Electric immunity. Light Screen Meganium will outstall Lanturn even it has Ice Beam. You can stall Lanturn out with another Lanturn. Grumpig can switch in and setup quite easily. Hypno walls Lanturn decently as well. Toxic messes up all of these, which is why Vileplume is also viable as a counter.</p>
