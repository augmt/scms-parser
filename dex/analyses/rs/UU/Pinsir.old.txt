[Overview]

<p>Completely outclassed by Heracross, due to a lack of Megahorn, worse defenses overall, and no double STAB, if you ever feel like using it in OU. But Pinsir is a great UU Pokemon. It hits hard and fast, doesn't have that prominent 4x Flying weakness that Heracross has, and has got a great movepool. Pinsir suffers the most from not having a decent STAB attack, but, with the element of surprise backing, he can be a worthwhile investment. It has the advantage of not being walled by Solrock, and has a likely 2HKO with Rock Slide or Brick Break on Walrein with a Choice Band set, same for Return on Gligar, which are the 3 main physical walls used in UU. The Swords Dancer also has the ability to set up on almost anything in a UU team, and Solrock can't come out to try and abuse your weakness to Rock due to the threat of Hidden Power Bug.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Hidden Power Bug
move 4: Rock Slide
item: Leftovers / Salac Berry
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Pinsir is actually quite a good lead Pokemon, especially for UU teams, as it's quite unpredictable. It has a huge movepool for something that only gets one STAB attack. Well, it's surprisingly fast, hits hard, and has decent defenses, which is very good for a Swords Dancer. Most of Pinsir's counters will 2HKO it, so the damage from their hit will usually put Pinsir into Salac range, so that's a decent item, even without Endure, but Leftovers gives more longevity.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Hidden Power Bug
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Return / Focus Punch
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Focus Punch here is good to predict switches to Pokemon like Walrein and Kangaskhan, as it's a guaranteed OHKO on Kangaskhan, and Walrein needs max Defense, Bold, and near max HP to even have a chance to survive. Return, however, will 2HKO Gligar, whereas Rock Slide will generally 3HKO.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance + Flail
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Endure / Substitute
move 3: Flail
move 4: Earthquake / Hidden Power Bug
item: Salac Berry
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The general strategy here is to bring it out on something that you scare off, and use Swords Dance on the switch. If they don't have Thunder Wave or Toxic, then Endure if they can OHKO you (almost nothing can when you are full health, except a Choice Band Gligar), otherwise, Swords Dance again. If you have Substitute, you can use that to block status, but you can't switch it in to any attack, and it can be harder to pull off a Swords Dance. Flail will seriously hurt things when you are at 1%, and then you have a choice between Earthquake and Hidden Power Bug. Hidden Power Bug hits Solrock and Lunatone, but Earthquake hits Golem, Aggron, and Omastar. Watch out for Quick Attackers, but Flail and Reversal have become such a rare strategy in UU that many people no longer carry one of those.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>It's just a shame Pinsir doesn't get Counter anymore. Oh well, Revenge is partial compensation for that. Bulk Up is a decent alternative to Swords Dance. You could try a Rest + Sleep Talk set, because Earthquake and Hidden Power Bug covers most everything but Gligar that's seen on most teams, and Pinsir has a lot of durability. Double-Edge can be used over Return in case Gligar gets really defensive.</p>

[EVs]

<p>You'll want an Adamant nature most of the time, but sometimes, Jolly can get you just enough Speed to put you above foes like Kangaskhan and enemy Gligar.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fearow can come in on Earthquake or Hidden Power Bug and OHKO with Choice Band Drill Peck. Golem has high defenses and STAB Rock Slide to take Pinsir out. Ninetales, Magmar, and Rapidash resist Hidden Power Bug and have STAB on Flamethrower, but Earthquake or Rock Slide will spell their end. Gligar can take on any Pinsir save those with Choice Band Return, and even then has a chance to win, depending on who's faster. Be sure to carry a Quick Attacker / Mach Puncher, however, or the Flailing Pinsir will sweep you, unless you have Misdreavus, or if a Pokemon you have can counter the specific set Pinsir runs. Aggron and Golem can do this for Hidden Power Bug Flailers and Solrock works well against Pinsir that run Earthquake as their secondary offensive move.</p>
