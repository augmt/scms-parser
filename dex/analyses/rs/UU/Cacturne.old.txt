[Overview]

<p>It has a great stalling movepool, but really low defensive capabilities. A jack of all trades, master of none. What he has going for him is the element of surprise, and the ability to mess up stall teams to an extent thanks to Leech Seed, Spikes, and Focus Punch. However, any proper offense shuts him down. Hard to use in UU.</p>

[SET]
name: Destiny Bond
move 1: Endure
move 2: Destiny Bond
move 3: Focus Punch 
move 4: Hidden Power Ghost
item: Salac Berry
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Any attack can be used in the last two slots. The idea is simple: Endure a killing hit to trigger Salac Berry. Destiny Bond will take your opponent down with you if they decide to land the finishing blow. If they don't, alternate Destiny Bond and Focus Punch. The moment they hinder Focus Punch is the moment they go down to Destiny Bond. Hidden Power Ghost is for Ghosts. Cacturne maxes out at 229 Speed (343 after Salac), so you won't be Destiny Bonding before some really fast Pokemon like Crobat or Persian.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Counter will surprise and kill if it ever works, but Cacturne is really frail so you'll need to pump Defense and HP EVs. Grasswhistle is inaccurate, but can help you set up a Focus Punch or something. He gets Swords Dance as well but besides Dynamic Punch nothing interesting to work with it. He is too slow and fragile for it as well. He has Spikes but there are better Pokemon to do that.</p>

[EVs]

<p>Cacturne doesn't have the stats to tank efficiently, but to get in that extra layer of Spikes or to make Counter work you'll want to load its HP. Otherwise, focus on the offensive stats you're using. Destiny Bond set obviously needs max Speed to work well.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fearow easily comes in on Grass moves or non-attacking moves and OHKOs with Drill Peck all the time. Thunder Punch and Focus Punch whack him up. Muk and Swalot, like Weezing, carry Sludge Bomb and resist Cacturne's main attacking moves. Gligar doesn't like Special Cacturne hits, but has enough Defense and Fighting resistance to come in easily, as well as a STAB Hidden Power Flying. Scyther resists both Grass and Fighting 4x, has STAB Bug moves for the OHKO, as well as the option to set up for Reversal. Any Fire-type obviously fries Cacturne.</p>
