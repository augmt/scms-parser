[Overview]

<p>Azumarill has an easy time coming in on attacks in standard and might actually hurt the opponent, however it is really flawed in that it lacks physical STAB, or good stats not named HP or that auto-boosted Attack to begin with. It's good on paper, but isn't used much for a reason.</p>

[SET]
name: SubPunch
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Focus Punch
move 3: Hidden Power Ghost
move 4: Sing / Encore
item: Leftovers
ability: Huge Power
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is a bit harder to use in UU than in standard, because most Pokemon are either really offensive or use Toxic, and nearly everything is faster than Azumarill. Gligar and Solrock sort of wall this set, but Azumarill learns Ice Beam and STAB Water moves to remedy that.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Focus Punch
move 2: Return
move 3: Hidden Power Ghost
move 4: Iron Tail / Hydro Pump
item: Choice Band
ability: Huge Power
nature: Adamant
evs: 240 HP / 244 Atk / 24 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If you can predict, this might work. Azumarill is really slow and has low defenses though, and no STAB on any physical move. Like with the first set, it should be brought in on Waters. Focus Punch can do major damage sometimes.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hydro Pump or Surf can be used to try and beat physical walls like Solrock/Gligar. Attract, like Sing and Encore, can buy you more time to Focus Punch. Light Screen supports the team against the Electrics Azumarill hates, while Charm and Tickle help against physicals. Icy Wind slows down opponents, it takes a while for Azumarill to catch up with it but your team might appreciate it. Perish Song forces switches, Present is a fun gamble that will either hurt the crap out of your opponent, do shitty damage or heal them. Azumarill is too slow to Belly Drum effectively but it's there.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gligar and Solrock, by themselves or used together, wall this Pokemon quite effectively. A fast Electric starter could also just end it from the start and Vileplume can take any of its non STAB attacks. Sableye sadly walls this Pokemon from head to toe and can heal off any hopes of getting a critical hit with Hidden Power Ghost and whatnot.</p>
