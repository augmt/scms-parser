[Overview]

<p>Granbull can be a crucial member to any UU team with Heal Bell. Since most UU Pokemon don't have Rest, they are susceptible to paralysis and poison. Granbull has a good Attack, but besides that pretty mediocre stats. If you're going to use Granbull, use Heal Bell. There's really no other reason to use it.</p>

[SET]
name: Heal Bell
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Return
move 4: Heal Bell
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If your opponent doesn't resist Return, it's probably going to hurt. This thing's Attack is up there with Donphan. Heal Bell helps the entire team. Rest and Sleep Talk gives Granbull survivability, and coupled with Heal Bell makes Granbull a good RestTalk user indeed.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Shadow Ball will hit Ghost-types, and you could work Curse in there with maybe Roar for a sweeper, but Kangaskhan does that better.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Granbull can't do much outside of Normal attacks, so Gengar and Misdreavus usually completely wall it. For the odd one that has Shadow Ball, defensive Rock-types work well, including Rhydon, Golem, and Omastar. Steel-types such as Steelix, Skarmory, and Scizor are obstacles that Granbull will never overcome, as well. Additionally, its defenses aren't particularly good, so the "just hit it hard" philosophy is decent when combating it.</p>
