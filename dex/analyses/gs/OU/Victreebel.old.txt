[Overview]

<p>Victreebel is an awesome UU sweeper and can make a big dent in OU play if used correctly. The beauty is that Victreebel can also help itself or its team by putting the opponent to sleep with Sleep Powder. After a Swords Dance, Sludge Bomb will OHKO a lot of things, and while it's not particularly fast, Victreebel does outspeed many OU Pokemon. Try and keep it from getting hit, though; even with Synthesis, Victreebel can't take a lot of hits unless they're Surfs or Thunderbolts.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Sludge Bomb
move 4: Giga Drain
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Swords Dance set can be very dangerous in OU play as well as UU. Put anything that can slow Victreebel down to sleep with Sleep Powder, then set up Swords Dance up and sweep with Sludge Bomb. Giga Drain hits Rock- and Ground-types and replenishes HP. Other options for the last slot include Hidden Power Ground, which benefits from Swords Dance and hits Rock-, Steel-, and Poison-types, or there's also Hidden Power Fire which covers Steel-types, specifically the ever-present Skarmory.</p>

move 3: Giga Drain
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Ice
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Victreebel's Special Attack isn't much lower than its Attack stat, but it suffers from low power on its primary attacking move and the fact that Growth only increases Special Attack by one stage instead of two.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Synthesis takes away a little of Victreebel's attacking versatility, but it serves well to recover half its HP. Razor Leaf has a lot more PP than Giga Drain, has a 25% critical hit rate, and works on foes that use Substitute. Stun Spore, while not as useful on a sweeper like Victreebel, can paralyze a lot of Pokemon, which could help another teammate set up to take over.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>As with most Grass-types, Steel-types shut down Victreebel just about completely, though note that they can be put out of commission with Sleep Powder or even be at a disadvantage if Victreebel sports Hidden Power Fire. Gengar and Nidoking are also good options thanks to their 4x resistance to Sludge Bomb and ability to take little damage from Giga Drain. Ground- and Rock-types resist Sludge Bomb, but must be wary of Giga Drain. Most Poison-types can hold their own against Victreebel due to their resistance to Sludge Bomb.</p>
