[Overview]

<p>Farfetch'd is quite an inferior Flying-type. The Baton Pass set has some possibilities, but other than that, it's about as worthless as you get. Sorry.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Swords Dance / Psych Up
move 3: Agility / Swagger
move 4: Return / Hidden Power Flying
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>All Farfetch'd can really do is Baton Pass, so this set capitalizes on that. It can Swagger + Psych Up, if you're into that, or you can Swords Dance or Agility if you are not suicidal. Return is recommended for the last slot, although Hidden Power Flying gets some type advantages. It's up to you.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Return
move 3: Hidden Power Flying / Gust
move 4: Agility / Baton Pass / Hidden Power Ground
item: Stick

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>JoltWak--more like JoltFetch'd! This Pokemon has almost swept a team. Almost. After firing off an Agility with Jolteon, the opponent switched to Meganium for an expected Marowak pass, but I surprised them with this! I recommend Baton Pass and Hidden Power Flying, but you can use Agility if you want it to be more self-sufficient, or Baton Pass if you think you can pull it off.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Reflect can be useful to the team, Thief just for kicks, Toxic with Protect for naught, Whirlwind for phazing, and it can Endure + Flail.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Skarmory is the best counter in the game for Farfetch'd. He completely shuts down the sweeping or Flailing sets, and can just Whirlwind away the stat boosts from the Baton Pass set. Other than that, any Electric, Ice, and Rock attack, as well as generally strong attackers and phazers will destroy poor, little Farfetch'd.</p>
