[Overview]

<p>Dewgong is a nice Pokemon to have. It is not recommended as a Ground-type counter, however, since it can't take many hits on the switch in. Take caution when using it, and remember, it isn't Starmie or Lapras.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard
move 1: Surf
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Rest
move 4: Encore / Sleep Talk
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is pretty straightforward: Surf and Ice Beam for STAB, Rest to heal, and Encore is handy to take on Curse users. RestTalk is a decent option, since it has pretty good defenses.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Perish Song and Whirlpool go hand-in-hand, you just need to hope Whirlpool hits and lasts the turns it needs for Perish Trapping to work. Toxic isn't really that good, but you might be able to work it in.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Electric Pokemon easily KO it. Snorlax can set up a Curse sweep against Dewgong, but has to worry about Encore giving a free switch. Blissey can counter it if it has Thunderbolt. Fighting-types such as Machamp or Heracross, or some other physical Pokemon not weak to Surf and Ice Beam that can hit hard will not have much trouble with Dewgong.</p>
