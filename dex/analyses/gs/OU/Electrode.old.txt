[Overview]

<p>Far better options out there, but none that can Explode. Electrode isn't meant for serious teams. It's also one of the fastest Pokemon. Sadly, it can't be put it to good use.</p>

[SET]
name: Exploder
move 1: Thunder Wave
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Explosion
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Water / Hidden Power Ice
item: Leftovers

<p>Basically, hit what you can and blow up when you're almost dead. Most people would say Explosion sucks with 198 attack. True, but if you play correctly you can try to set up the Explosion on something with a weak Defense like Blissey, Jumpluff, or Raikou (maybe even a weakened Snorlax). It isn't like Electrode has much else to do.</p>

[SET]
name: Support
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Light Screen / Reflect
move 3: Rest / Explosion
move 4: Thunder Wave / Toxic
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Supporter-type Electrode. Usually switch it in against enemy Electric-types and set up. Use Rest so that you can come in late-game. Explosion is just Explosion.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Mirror Coat isn't that great, even if you play your game right. Screech helps Explosion if they don't switch and can also force switches. Substitute just blocks crap.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Electrode is rather weak, so anything that can take a solid Thunderbolt counters it. Depending on whether Electrode has Hidden Power, Steelix, Quagsire, or some other Rock-, Steel-, or defensive Ground-type can counter it; they have the added benefit of not fearing Explosion much.</p>
