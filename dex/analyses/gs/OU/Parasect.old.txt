[Overview]

<p>Argh. This thing is probably one of the 5 worst fully-evolved Pokemon in the game. Definitely bottom 10. Very cool, however, and with Spore and Stun Spore, it can cause a few status ailments for support.</p>

[SET]
name: Double Powder
move 1: Spore
move 2: Hidden Power Bug
move 3: Giga Drain
move 4: Stun Spore
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>OK, for this set to work, you have to switch into something that won't KO Parasect in one hit, or two hits if you plan on getting hit on the switch. Spore whatever you want... and this is where Parasect's usefulness pretty much ends. Use Stun Spore to paralyze whatever comes in next. After this, just attack away. If you used Stun Spore, you should have the Speed advantage, so enjoy that while it lasts. Giga Drain can dent Rhydon, Quagsire, and Golem, if they decide to switch in that is.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Sweeper
move 1: Spore
move 2: Growth
move 3: Giga Drain
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Ice
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Good luck staying alive long enough to set this up. Spore might be able to buy you a free turn or two, and maybe they'll bring in a Steel-type expecting a physical attacking Parasect. Hidden Power Fire covers Steel- and Bug-types, whereas Ice covers Flying-types (especially Dragonite, should you use Parasect in OU). Both hit enemy Grass-types. You could use Hidden Power Rock for the inevitable Fire-type switch-in. Hidden Power Rock is a better choice than the special Hidden Power Fire because you will not be hitting them after using a Growth (when you use Growth, they just switched in, are faster than you, and OHKO), meaning you'll have to whittle them down on switches. With Hidden Power Rock, you can use Parasect's superior Attack stat. This also lets you hit Flying-types on the switch. The only advantage of Hidden Power Water is if you have paralysis support, or are using Parasect in OU for some reason and need to hit Steelix harder.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Spore
move 2: Hidden Power Bug
move 3: Return / Sludge Bomb
move 4: Swords Dance
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Parasect attempts to sweep with Swords Dance. It will usually be about as useful as the first set (put something to sleep with Spore). Losing Stun Spore means you have less of a guarantee of long-lasting damage, though, so it's a bit riskier.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>It has access to Reflect and Light Screen and can actually pass them on to the team just as well as most other Pokemon. Thief is actually a good choice with Parasect's sparse movepool. You might want to consider Stun Spore + Spore + Thief + Reflect / Light Screen as an all-out support Parasect.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Parasect has the unfortunate trait of being both extremely slow and weak to many types of attacks. Sleep is not nearly as valuable in GSC as it is in other generations, and the variety of Pokemon with RestTalk detracts from the only advantage Parasect has in Spore. Parasect is 4x weak to Flying and Fire attacks, so something like Arcanine or Fearow will easily OHKO. Also not helpful are Parasect's Rock and Ice weaknesses. Additionally, Parasect isn't a very strong attacker either, so basically anything that resists Hidden Power Bug beats it. Basically, any decent team can handle Parasect.</p>
