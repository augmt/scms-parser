[Overview]

<p>Nothing amazing here, just a typical Normal Pokemon with average stats, excluding its good HP and low Speed. It has an above-average movepool too. In the end, however, it's just a middle tier UU Pokemon at best, with its best options being Glaring things and trying to get lucky with flinches.</p>

[SET]
name: Swagger + Psych Up
move 1: Glare
move 2: Swagger
move 3: Psych Up
move 4: Headbutt
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Closest thing to an old standard there is. Glare is a nice move to paralyze, Swagger the opponent for confusion, Psych Up the Attack boosts, and then flinch away with Headbutt. If they do switch out after being Swaggered to try and escape confusion, then that just gives you the opportunity to paralyze something else with Glare. Dunsparce is totally shut down by Ghost-types, though, because Glare cannot paralyze them. This set works best with Spikes down to punish the opponent for switching.</p>

[SET]
name: SunnyBeam
move 1: Sunny Day
move 2: Solar Beam
move 3: Flamethrower
move 4: Return
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Total surprise moveset running off of a 228 Special Attack stat with no STAB? Still, it might work, and it has STAB Return so Blissey doesn't totally block it out. It has a decent movepool, you might as well exploit it. Just watch out for Snorlax.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Return
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk / Rock Slide / Iron Tail
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>It has bad Speed already, so Curse only helps it, really. Standard Cursing set, either go with RestTalk for longevity or use one of his other attacking move (an Ancient Power boost would go nicely with all your Curses). Not bad, but lots of other Pokemon do this much better.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Dunsparce can weaken stuff with Screech and finish them off with Return, but it would do better doing this if it were faster. It can use Spite, but it won't get much use out of it beyond wasting the opponent's Heal Bell and Soft-Boiled and other such bothersome moves. Thief is pretty good if you are using Screech and don't really have a 4th move to use.</p>

<p>Dunsparce can try out Nightmare to keep any RestTalk users at bay, if you are having trouble with them. Zap Cannon works for a nice surprise on the inevitable Skarmory who'll come in to wall you, as does Flamethrower. Zap Cannon has that nice paralysis, but Flamethrower also hits Forretress, Magneton, Scizor, and Steelix.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Steel and Rock Pokemon resist most of what Dunsparce can throw at them. Curse users can just set up faster than Dunsparce can damage them, and stuff like Snorlax and Miltank will outdamage Dunsparce in a Curse war. Other heavily defensive Pokemon will do much of the same.</p>
