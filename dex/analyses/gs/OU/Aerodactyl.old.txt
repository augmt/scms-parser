[Overview]

<p>Undoubtedly a cool Pokemon and he is usable, but Aerodactyl is simply that: usable. He has good Attack and Speed, but unfortunately does not have any strong STAB attacks to take advantage of it. Being a Rock-type immune to Earthquake is good, but his defensive stats are weak and he has a myriad other weaknesses. His only option to get an attack boost besides getting lucky with Ancient Power is Curse, which ruins his Speed. Despite all of these contradictions, Aerodactyl is very solid, but only if you know what you're doing.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard 
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Hidden Power Rock / Ancient Power
move 3: Wing Attack / Hidden Power Flying
move 4: Fire Blast
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is an attacking Aerodactyl. Depending on which "regular" attack you choose, opt for Hidden Power for the other. Though Ancient Power has that chance to boost all stats, its weak Base Power and low PP lead Hidden Power Rock to be recommended. Earthquake is mainly for Electric- and other Rock-types. Wing Attack has STAB and is a nifty OHKO on Heracross. And finally, should something like Forretress or Skarmory come along, Fire Blast will give them something to think about. Good in theory, but unfortunately this pales in comparison to the RSE standard for a lot of reasons, notably the lack of Rock Slide, Choice Band, and Rock Head (which would make Double-Edge an option).</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Hidden Power Rock / Ancient Power
move 4: Substitute
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Curse helps Aerodactyl's weak Defense, and Substitute blocks status while you Curse up. It sucks that Ancient Power only has max 8 PP, so Hidden Power Rock is recommended. This set will give Aerodactyl a chance to actually do some damage, but it comes at a cost of Aerodactyl's best stat, his Speed.</p>

[SET]
name: Defensive
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Rest
move 3: Whirlwind
move 4: Hidden Power Rock / Wing Attack
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Despite his bad Defense, Aerodactyl's typing and ability to learn Reflect can make it useful as a phazer. Though this set overlooks Aerodactyl's Speed (and Attack for that matter), it can be quite useful as somewhat of a wall. This was more popular when Fire Blast was on a lot of sweepers, notably Snorlax.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Double-Edge is a wild option simply for the sheer power, but the recoil probably won't be worth it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Suicune's very high defenses and STAB Surf completely ruins Aerodactyl, as do those of most other Water-types. Skarmory needs to beware of Fire Blast, but otherwise takes Aerodactyl's attacks easily and Whirlwinds it off. Pokemon with Curse and Roar will boost with the Curse set and then remove whatever Aerodactyl accomplishes.</p>
