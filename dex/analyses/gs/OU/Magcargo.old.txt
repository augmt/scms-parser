[Overview]

<p>Simply put, Magcargo stinks. Its typing is HORRIBLE (4x weak to Ground and Water and 2x weak to Rock and Fighting). Its stats are also bad, as it can't really take physical hits despite the 338 Defense (it can tank some things like Muk, but don't expect it to do much). Its movepool does it no favors either. If Magcargo got Explosion it could be more useful.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Fire Blast / Rest
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Magcargo needs Curse to even begin thinking about doing some kind of damage--Rock Slide is for STAB, Earthquake is there because it's a good physical attack, and Fire Blast is there so Skarmory doesn't totally laugh at you. However, it may need Rest so that it can actually live long enough to do something useful.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>"Pathetic" would be the best word to describe Magcargo's movepool. Amnesia might let you live though some special attacks, and Toxic will help to do damage, since Magcargo's attacking stats aren't good at all.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Magcargo has many common weaknesses to capitalize upon; it is also pathetically slow. Even after a few Curses, a good Earthquake will OHKO it, and Rock Slide and Fighting attacks will deal a significant amount also. Surf and Hydro Pump are essentially guaranteed to OHKO it, regardless of which Pokemon delivers them. Overall, Magcargo is one of the most easily countered Pokemon in the game, and every team has something that will murder it.</p>
