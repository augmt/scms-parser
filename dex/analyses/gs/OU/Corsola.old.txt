[Overview]

<p>Corsola is a horrible Pokemon. Its typing is bad, and Kabutops is far better as a Water / Rock, anyway. It can't do anything to Grass-types, and with Exeggutor as a standard in GSC, that's not good. Even in UU play, strong Ground-types will kill it before it can Curse up, and its Surf doesn't do enough to kill any of them, really, not even the 4x weak ones. Keep this guy in UU and you might do all right.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Mirror Coat / Surf
move 2: Curse
move 3: Ancient Power
move 4: Recover
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is probably the best you can do with this useless Pokemon. Corsola has average defenses, but bad typing. Start Cursing up, and if you're lucky, that will bring in a special attacker. If it's something you can survive, Mirror Coat it back for the KO, then Recover to get health back. When they catch on, attack with Ancient Power until you can't do any more. If you really want to use it, Surf can go over Mirror Coat for the inevitable Ground-type switch-in, but you'll need a Curse or two to take an Earthquake from something like Rhydon or Thick Club Marowak, and your Surf won't OHKO a lot of stuff. Grass-types still beat this as well.</p>

[SET]
name: Support
move 1: Surf
move 2: Recover
move 3: Toxic
move 4: Mirror Coat
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>More of a support set, and at least you can Toxic Grass-types without a secondary Poison typing. Surf any Ground-types who come in to kill you, and Mirror Coat other stuff that you can.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Amnesia can be used to survive a Grass attack or Zapdos's Thunder and Mirror Coat it back. Ice Beam will actually damage a Grass-type who switches in, but not much. Earthquake isn't that good on Corsola, and won't exactly help its Grass problem, but hey, it learns it. Most anything in the game can use RestTalk effectively, and Corsola has relatively high defenses, so it can work as well.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Zapdos and Raikou can easily switch in and hit it with STAB Thunderbolts. Grass-types such as Venusaur and Victreebel have Corsola's number with Giga Drain, Sleep Powder, or Leech Seed. Machamp and other Fighting-types have little trouble switching into Corsola and can deal huge damage with Cross Chop.</p>
