[Overview]

<p>Arbok's stats are evenly distributed, but on the whole they're below average. However, the combination of moves available to it allows Arbok to perform well in the UU environment.</p>

[SET]
name: Glare
move 1: Sludge Bomb
move 2: Glare
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Giga Drain / Substitute / Screech
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Poison and Ground is a good attacking combination, and although it happens to be walled by Skarmory, Arbok isn't going to do anything to Skarmory anyway. The last move is up to you. Giga Drain will do about 50% to Rhydon and will replenish some HP, while Substitute could buy you some time to paralyze or poison an opponent. Screech allows you to deal much more damage and force switches, and can work well in conjunction with paralysis.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Arbok learns Haze, though it may be too frail to use it effectively.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Arbok has a hard time damaging Scizor and Forretress due to their high Defense and Poison immunity, allowing them to set up Swords Dance and Spikes, respectively. Skarmory resists everything Arbok can throw at it, as does Aerodactyl. However, the latter is crippled by a timely paralysis from Glare. Despite Arbok's Earthquake, Rhydon and Golem can both take a hit and Earthquake Arbok into oblivion in return. On the same token, Donphan can begin to Curse while Arbok can do very little to stop it. Watch out for Giga Drain, though, especially with Rhydon and Golem.</p>
