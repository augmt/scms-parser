[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Murkrow has decent Speed and attacking stats, and a unique typing. But it isn't used. Why? Because its defenses stink. It won't live long, so this is all you can do mostly. Use Drill Peck and Feint Attack off of those decent attacking stats for double STAB. The last two moves aren't really important. Pursuit lets you hit the few Pokemon Murkrow can scare off for double the damage. Night Shade works for dependable damage that might do something to Steel-types, while Toxic will help you do some more damage over the long-run to defensive Pokemon without Rest.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Psych Up might be useful, which isn't saying much. Unless Murkrow is faster than the opponent, or said opponent is a poor player, you won't make good use of those stat ups. Mirror Move might be good for laughs though. Making Murkrow a phazer with Whirlwind is very risky--it usually won't live long enough to phaze very many opponents.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Murkrow is one of the frailest Pokemon around, so any solid attack will do decent damage. Corsola has good Defense and Special Defense coupled with Recover, and enough offensive power to hurt Murkrow. Omastar has weaker Special Defense and no Recover, but possesses more powerful attacks. Magneton resists anything Murkrow can use and is immune to Toxic, and it OHKOs with Thunderbolt. Magcargo is also resistant to Drill Peck. Basically, anything that isn't weak to Dark or Flying attacks takes on Murkrow well enough.</p>
