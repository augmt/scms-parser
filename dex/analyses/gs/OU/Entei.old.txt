[Overview]

<p>Being a Fire-type and having a horrible movepool hurts Entei badly. It doesn't learn any good moves that work off its STAB or best stat either. But it is redeemed a bit by being able to survive a lot with its massive HP. Entei is the only bulky Fire-type in this generation, which makes its usefulness unique, albeit limited. It is legendary only by name, as it is by far the worst of the legendaries available. Because of this, it is only viable in the UU metagame (if it is allowed there), as anything in the OU tier would tear it apart quickly and without hesitation.</p>

[SET]
name: SunnyBeam
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Solar Beam
move 3: Sunny Day
move 4: Return / Rest
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set turns weaknesses into strengths. Water-types will have greater trouble dealing with this due to Sunny Day, and Solar Beam punishes Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types, all of which are common Fire counters. Fire Blast over Flamethrower lets you deal the optimal amount of damage in the shortest period of time. Use Return if you want to have a solid finisher move without depleting Fire Blast PP or if Sunny Day isn't active, Rest if you want Entei around for the long haul.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hidden Power Fighting can punish a lot of Pokemon that would normally switch into Entei, including Blissey and Tyranitar. It is sturdy enough to be used as a phazer against Perish Trappers and the like. If you favor accuracy over power on a set, Flamethrower works out fine as well. A Curse or RestTalk set are viable if you need one or the other on your team.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Tyranitar, although weak to Solar Beam, takes the hit well and can dispose of Entei without too much trouble. Most Rock and Water Pokemon, in particular Starmie, also counter Entei if Sunny Day isn't set up due to their ability to naturally counter Entei's type.</p>
