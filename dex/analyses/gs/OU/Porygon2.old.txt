[Overview]

<p>Porygon2 has amazing stats; nothing goes to waste here. While his Attack isn't exactly stellar, it's not horrible either, and Curse can easily raise it (and augments his Defense as well). While his movepool is actually fairly limited, he just happens to learn all of the right moves to complement his stats (Recover in particular). Porygon2 has the potential to take out an entire team utilizing Curse, or it can provide perfect support for a team with Thunder Wave, all the while being able to hit hard with STAB Normal attacks and special attacks from a stellar Special Attack stat. Porygon2 will probably always lie in Snorlax's shadow (along with everything else, that fatty), but he is a bit underrated.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Porygon2 can be an awesome Curse sweeper, since he doesn't have to Rest and fall asleep for two turns, thanks to his access to the nifty Recover. Curse up and hit everything with Return (there's also Double-Edge, which has more power but potentially nasty recoil). Your ace in the hole here is Ice Beam; with a 308 Special Attack, most Pokemon that are resistant to Return will take punishment from it. If you want, you can try out Thunderbolt in place of Ice Beam; this gives Porygon2 the advantage on things such as Skarmory and Starmie (which sports Reflect on a regular basis), but it does leave him powerless against Rhydon, Steelix, and struggling against Exeggutor (who can have Leech Seed and Sleep Powder). Ice Beam is more general; Thunderbolt is more specific.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Porygon2 is arguably the best (but far overlooked) paralysis inducer in GSC with Thunder Wave. With his well-rounded stats and Recover, he can paralyze things over and over again without taking much net damage itself--and Electric-immune Ground-types will get promptly hit with a hard Ice Beam. Porygon2 also has access to Reflect, which buffers the entire team's Defense for five turns. With Recover at hand, Porygon2 can do it many times.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Steelix, Forretress, Umbreon, Tyranitar, Misdreavus, Miltank, and Gengar can take all of Porygon2's attacks, and Umbreon can Charm away any Attack boosts that Porygon2 tries to build up with Curse. Reflect in general can null any attacking threat Porygon2 can launch for a bit. In the UU arena, Omastar and Kabutops are good counters as long as Porygon2 isn't carrying Thunderbolt. Porygon2 finds Toxic extremely annoying as well when he's trying to set up Curse.</p>
