[Overview]

<p>Honestly, Venomoth is a great Pokemon. Like any other, he needs a little support from his 5 other teammates. Not to mention he is great for UU battles. He's rather fragile though.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Sludge Bomb
move 3: Stun Spore / Sleep Powder
move 4: Hidden Power Bug
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The goal of the set is to first cripple the opponent with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore, and then set up Curse. From there blast the enemy with Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Bug until they go down.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Psychic, Reflect, and Giga Drain are up for consideration if you want to use a special sweeper Venomoth. Baton Pass can be nice if you want to pass Curse, and Thief is fun to steal Skarmory's Leftovers on the switch in. The Double Powder combo is always nice to utilize.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Skarmory is the big gun. Venomoth cannot touch it without Hidden Power Fire or Electric, which are both kind of a waste on Venomoth. Golem and other Rock-types will also cause havoc for Venomoth. If Venomoth has Giga Drain it can take down Golem with a few predicted switches however. And of course most Psychic-, Fire-, and Rock-types will counter Venomoth pretty effectively.</p>
