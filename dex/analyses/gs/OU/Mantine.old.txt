[Overview]

<p>Mantine is a special sponge that got ruined in the HP department. It can't sponge too well, and its movepool doesn't help it much either. Its Flying typing is totally unnecessary and only hurts it. Strictly a UU Pokemon.</p>

[SET]
name: Support
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Confuse Ray
move 3: Toxic
move 4: Haze
item: Leftovers 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Mantine stinks, plain and simple. Use Hydro Pump because Mantine needs the power, and Confuse Ray and Toxic because it won't do enough with just Hydro Pump and that terrible 258 Special Attack, STAB-boosted or not. Haze is there because it can't do much else.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Not much here. Ice Beam can be used because most Water-types learn it, and it lets you hit Venusaur. You can use Attract for an annoyer set, though it isn't recommended. Mantine sucks enough as it is. A RestTalk set is always viable in UU, though.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pokemon with Thunder, Snorlax, RestTalk users, Water- and Grass-types, Blissey or any other Pokemon with high Special Defense or that resists Water attacks and can hit hard.</p>
