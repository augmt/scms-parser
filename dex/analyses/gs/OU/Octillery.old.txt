[Overview]

<p>Octillery's great attacking stats are wasted by his dismal Speed and mediocre Defenses. He's basically a mirror of himself--his offensive and defensive stats are the same on both the special and physical side. If he had a higher Speed stat, he might be used more, but there isn't much he can do besides hit things (and you have to be good at predicting). If you want a Water-type that has a great Special Attack and an awesome movepool, stick with Starmie. If you want a Water that can hit both physically and specially, go with Poliwrath.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>As one of three Water-types that can learn a Fire-type move, he puts it to decent use, as it fries Exeggutor and Skarmory. Octazooka is mostly for switch-ins, but if you prefer power, go with Surf. Return is the only good physical move he can use to run off his relatively high Attack stat, since Hidden Power is just a waste. Ice Beam deals with Grass- and Flying-types.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Use Curse over Ice Beam if you want to beef up his Attack in the late-game, Haze makes him a decent UU Hazer, Screech is a decent phaze move of sorts, since after a Screech, Return is really going to hurt something. Thief is there because he can use it, and it's fun to use.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Electric-types cut Octillery to shreds, and aren't afraid of any attack it sports in particular. Water-types with either Thunderbolt, like Starmie and Lapras, or some other way to overcome Octillery, such as Swords Dance Tentacruel, can work well. Grass-types with good defenses can also beat Octillery, despite their Ice weakness.</p>
