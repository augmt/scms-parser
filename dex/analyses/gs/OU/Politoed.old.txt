[Overview]

<p>Having well-rounded stats and learning a few useful moves boosts Politoed's ability to leave a mark in the UU metagame. However, outside of UU, Politoed kind of fades into obscurity with the likes of such things as Golduck and Blastoise, since it simply isn't strong enough to sweep in OU, like Tentacruel, nor is it remarkably good at supporting, like Suicune and Starmie.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This guy can pack a little punch in the UU metagame. Use Belly Drum, and hit everything with Body Slam, saving Surf for Rock- and Steel-types. Since Politoed is hardly common, you have a chance to wreak havoc. If someone tries to phaze you once you've set up Belly Drum, use that Lovely Kiss to put them to sleep and keep things going. Politoed is better late in the game when everything is injured or sleeping, since it doesn't have STAB on Body Slam.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>You can try out Growth with various special attacks for a special sweeper, but that's a long shot. Counter is a great option since people will try to pound on Politoed's average Defense. Politoed can also make a decent Haze user in a pinch.</p> 

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Even after a Belly Drum, Politoed's non-STAB Body Slam is unimpressive, and Politoed is also quite slow. Super effective Grass and Electric attacks work wonders, especially on something that has more than a sliver of Defense, such as Meganium. Solid Water-types with Thunderbolt are excellent choices, along with Electric- and Grass-types that have the STAB versions of those typed attacks.</p>
