[Overview]

<p>This guy is a big threat in UU, and if it gets the right support, can maul a lot of stuff that's even OU.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Cross Chop
move 3: Thunder Punch
move 4: Hidden Power Water
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Fire Blast and Thunder Punch together hit just about everything for at least neutral damage. Cross Chop stops most of the special walls (especially should you choose to use Magmar in OU) and Hidden Power Water covers those annoying Rock-types who have high enough Defense to take Cross Chop.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Magmar has some limited move options. If you can weaken a Water-type enough, you can use Sunny Day when it switches in to make it safer to deliver the final blow. Naturally, Sunny Day will make Fire Blast a hard-hitter. Protect could be used as a free recovery turn and to see what moves your opponent is packing. Magmar learns Psychic, but there isn't much out there to use it on. It does give you a guaranteed 2HKO on Gengar (and won't miss), so that's useful. You can use Confuse Ray to try and buy yourself some turns, but Magmar is usually better off attacking. You can hit stuff on the switch with Screech, but you're usually better off just hitting them twice with Cross Chop, because if you Screech something you can't KO afterwards, you'll have to switch out, possibly wasting that turn.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Water-types that are faster than Magmar are easily its best counters, particularly Starmie. Tentacruel is a decent counter, but it doesn't have a recovery move, so some well-placed Thunder Punches will hurt Tentacruel enough. To be honest, anything that can take more than one hit and has a powerful STAB attack can be considered a Magmar counter, since it can't take more than two hits or so. There's a reason why Magmar is UU.</p>
