[Overview]

<p>Delibird is really cool. But it's also really bad. Horrid typing and awful defensive stats don't help, and its attacking capabilities aren't so hot either. All it has going for it is Spikes and Rapid Spin, and it can't use both at once, which is really bad. Use this guy as a UU Spiker and watch out for Rock moves, STAB or not.</p>

[SET]
name: Spiker
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Toxic
move 4: Hidden Power Flying / Thief
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is probably the best Delibird moveset you can use. You'll want to start by laying down some Spikes, then spread Toxic around on the opposing team. Never underestimate the impact of stealing Leftovers off something like Blissey or Snorlax with Thief--especially when in conjunction with Spikes. A pretty good moveset for something like Delibird.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Hidden Power Flying
move 3: Ice Beam / Sleep Talk
move 4: Rest
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Curse up and use Hidden Power Flying to do some damage with STAB, and then Rest off damage when you need to. You can either use a RestTalking version for more survivability, or use STAB Ice Beam to actually do some damage to the Rock-types who resist your Flying moves and to Skarmory when it Whirlwinds you out. Not a bad set, but there are about a million Pokemon who can do it better. Only the STAB Ice Beam sets it apart from some other Pokemon who could do the same thing.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Rapid Spin is cool, and Delibird is the only Rapid Spinner who also resists Spikes, but you can't use both Rapid Spin and Spikes, so if you have to choose between the two, you should probably go with Spikes instead. Quick Attack can be used with Curse for a poor man's Dragonite Curse + Extreme Speed set. If you feel like taking a super risk and having some fun, use Present in Gold and Silver only. Present is a glitchy move in those two games, and can possibly deal a ton of damage to certain Pokemon.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Kabutops, Omastar, Corsola, and Scizor all resist Ice Beam and can hit it with a STAB super effective move. Electric-types like Raikou and Jolteon usually have high enough Special Defense to take Ice Beam, resist Hidden Power Flying, and have STAB Thunderbolt to hit Delibird with, but Zapdos isn't so good of a choice because it's weak to Ice Beam. Basically, anything that resists its moves and can attack stop Delibird. Things with Rapid Spin prevent it from getting use out of those Spikes, particularly Forretress.</p>
