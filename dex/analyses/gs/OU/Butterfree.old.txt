[Overview]

<p>Butterfree stinks. Really, it does. If it had a special typing, that still wouldn't make it any more useful. It gets the ability to induce sleep and an additional status, which is nice--too bad it can't effectively force switches like say, Jumpluff. It's hard to think of a situation where Butterfree could be useful.</p>

[SET]
name: Double Powder
move 1: Sleep Powder

move 4: Giga Drain
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Go, useless butterfly! Bad typing + bad stats + bad movepool = bad Pokemon. OK, this may be one of the few times you'll see Nightmare as a move option. Sleep Powder and Stun Spore are needed. Psychic and Giga Drain are there because Butterfree really doesn't learn anything more useful, nor can it do too much more. Nightmare the RestTalk users, though it's doubtful you will live long enough for it to matter.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>That's really about it. Reflect and Safeguard can benefit your team. Never EVER use Whirlwind unless you're crazy, as Butterfree can't Whirlwind well at all since it is ridiculously fragile. Toxic because what else will it use... String Shot?</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pokemon beats Butterfree with move. Seriously, Butterfree dies to practically everything, and it can't do much else to them but sleep or paralyze them. And with Heal Bell and RestTalk users abound, it sort of nullifies double powder's effectiveness.</p>

<p>Zapdos willingly takes the sleep and hits back with STAB Thunderbolt and Drill Peck. Arcanine is much the same with Fire Blast. Clerics can nullify any of Butterfree's effectiveness, and any strong STAB or super effective attack sends Butterfree running.</p>
