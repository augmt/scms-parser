[Overview]

<p>Golduck is inexplicably little used, as it is a very versatile Water-type, as are most other Water-types. He can be used as a SkarmBliss counter, and his movepool isn't half bad. Golduck can be a nice sweeper in the UU environment with the right set.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard
move 1: Cross Chop
move 2: Hypnosis
move 3: Surf / Hydro Pump
move 4: Ice Beam / Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Electric
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is pretty much the standard Golduck set. Cross Chop is there since its Attack isn't half bad and thus is not rendered completely useless against special walls. Put any slower counter to sleep with Hypnosis. The last two moves run off its nice Special Attack stat.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Light Screen is good for your team, of course. Psychic is a good special attack, but doesn't have really good type coverage. Psych Up can possibly copy some Curses or Swords Dances and let you mess things up, and Petal Dance is only here as a comedy option, thanks to the NYPC.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Electric-types can generally take a Surf or two and respond with super effective hits. If Golduck doesn't have Ice Beam, then Grass-types deal with it reasonably, while if he doesn't have a Hidden Power to hit the appropriate Water-types, Gyarados, Quagsire, and Starmie beat it.</p>
