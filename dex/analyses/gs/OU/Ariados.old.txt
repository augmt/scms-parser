[SET]
name: Baton Pass Trapper
move 1: Spider Web
move 2: Agility
move 3: Baton Pass
move 4: Sludge Bomb
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Use Spider Web to trap something that can't easily beat Ariados, Agility, and pass to an appropriate counter. Sludge Bomb gets STAB off its decent 278 Attack. This set is a good counter for Perish Trapping (Mean Look + Perish Song) Misdreavus, as you can trap it right back.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Skarmory effortlessly foils any Spider Web strategies, although Disable can catch it off guard. You're probably best off just Drill Pecking the first turn. Rhydon, Donphan, and Steelix love to Curse up on Ariados and can Roar away Spider Web.</p>
