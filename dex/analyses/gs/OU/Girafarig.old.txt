[Overview]

<p>Girafarig would be an awesome Baton Passer if it weren't for its poor defenses. It's still a good Baton Passer by GSC standards since it can hurt most of the GSC phazers (it can even take out 40% of Suicune's health with Thunder) and can take a hit from Snorlax (and give one back) with Curse before passing it to a teammate. Girafarig is generally overlooked, but Baton Pass is probably Girafarig's best (read: only) asset, not its stats, so keep it out of trouble.</p>

item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Despite its never being used, Girafarig makes a decent Baton Passer. Agility is the best thing it can pass. Thunder is for Skarmory and Suicune, and the last slot is up to you. Psychic and Earthquake both hurt Rhydon. Psychic could hurt Donphan, while Earthquake would do well against Steelix, Houndoom, and Tyranitar. Return gets STAB. Crunch covers enemy Psychic-types and puts the hurt on Misdreavus a bit more.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Both Amnesia and Curse can be Baton Passed. Amnesia will very rarely be helpful, but Curse is an interesting possibility, and it would be fun if you passed them to a heavy physical attacker (like Machamp, Rhydon, or Marowak). Speed isn't much of a concern since Speed is not that important in GSC.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Girafarig is mediocre at both attacking and defending, so generally very strong attackers or defenders will overcome it. Granbull's Resting cycle will keep it at high health against even Psychic while Granbull slams at Girafarig with Return. Piloswine can Curse up, Earthquake Girafarig, and may even Roar its Agilities away. Quagsire does the same, minus the Roar part. Quagsire can take Psychic better than Piloswine, though. Magneton resists everything Girafarig does except Earthquake, so as long as Girafarig doesn't carry that, it should be fine.</p>
