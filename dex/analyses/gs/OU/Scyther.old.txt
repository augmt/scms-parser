[Overview]

<p>Scyther has good potential, but bad typing--plus it gets beaten by a lot of common Pokemon in OUs. It's pretty good in UU though thanks to that Speed and access to Swords Dance. Scyther (along with Pinsir) would be a whole lot better off if there were 'real' Bug attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Hidden Power Bug / Hidden Power Rock
move 2: Return / Wing Attack 
move 3: Swords Dance
move 4: Baton Pass
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Swords Dance up, then either attack or, if they don't switch to a phazer, Baton Pass to a teammate and let them steal the show. Hidden Power Bug has STAB, but Hidden Power Rock can hit Flying-types, making them wary to blow Scyther away with Whirlwind. Return in general can be used because Scyther just doesn't have much else, while Wing Attack can be used for threats like Heracross and it gets STAB.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Scyther could run Endure + Reversal well; although it doesn't have STAB, 200 Base Power is good, and coupled with Swords Dance could be hard to stop, plus Scyther is immune to Spikes. Counter is handy for something cocky that tries to Drill Peck Scyther instead of using Whirlwind.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Scyther is fast and powerful, but it can't avoid the fact that it is a Bug / Flying type, and therefore has a plethora of weaknesses. Most Fire-types do well, especially the part Flying ones like Moltres and Charizard and the defensive ones like Magcargo; watch out for Hidden Power Rock, though. Rock-types resist both Wing Attack and Return and hit Scyther's 4x weakness, meaning Rhydon, Golem, and Tyranitar (if Hidden Power Bug is absent) are excellent counters. Aerodactyl even has the benefit of outrunning it. Sturdy Poison- and Steel-types, including Weezing, Muk, Skarmory, and Steelix, are resistant to Hidden Power Bug and not weak to any one of Scyther's attacks. Skarmory and Steelix get special mention for being able to phaze Scyther before it can Baton Pass anything.</p>
