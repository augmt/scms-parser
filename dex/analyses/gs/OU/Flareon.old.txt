[Overview]

<p>Flareon has a lot of potential, but its low defenses and Speed hinder it from doing much. Flareon is the black sheep of the Eevee family, since all of the other evolutions have their own uses and work well. Maybe if Flareon is played with lots of Reflect and paralysis support, it can do something other than die.</p>

item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>All-out attacking Flareon! Doesn't get STAB off its best stat, which stinks. The last move just depends on if you want to beat whether it be other Fire-types, Electric-types, or Blissey and Snorlax.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Lots of options, too bad Flareon can't pull most of them off too well. Iron Tail is there if you want to hit Aerodactyl and Rhydon hard on the switch, Zap Cannon can be fun against Water-types, Growl or Charm can be good against Curse users...MAYBE. Flareon can be a good Baton Pass intermediate if Skarmory likes trying to phaze your Baton Pass chain, and Growth boosts its Special Attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Flareon is a slow Fire-type with low Defense, so countering it is fairly easy. Water-types like Suicune and Omastar wall Flareon and Surf it, while Rock-types resist Fire Blast and strike back with Earthquake or Rock Slide. Although Flareon's Special Defense is good, its Defense is not--as a rule, strong physical attackers that are faster than Flareon take care of it.</p>
