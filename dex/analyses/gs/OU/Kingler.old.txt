[Overview]

<p>Go, useless crab! All that Attack wasted on Kingler. Keep this thing on the fun teams, please. It's not going to scare anyone. It might be good for killing Blissey.</p>

name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Return
move 3: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Fighting / Hidden Power Rock
move 4: Substitute / Surf / Crabhammer
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Kingler's lack of physical STAB hurts it badly. Swords Dance up and hit with an attack. Crabhammer gets STAB, but is only listed because of its high critical hit rate, which could help it do more damage at a crucial time. Just pick a physical Hidden Power, besides Poison or Steel of course.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Double-Edge
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Only use this once the special attackers are gone, or if you're faster than them, since they'll mess you up badly. Same with the Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-types, since Kingler really can't do much to them, either.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>248 Speed isn't horrible; it's still faster than some standard stuff, so Flail can be used with paralysis support. Haze is possible with Kingler's nice Defense, although it's lacking in the HP department.</p> 

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything with an Electric or Grass move should be able to counter Kingler, especially Pokemon having a modicum of defense. Rock, Steel, or Ghost Pokemon, in particular, counter Kingler since it can't attack with much else besides Return or Double-Edge.</p>
