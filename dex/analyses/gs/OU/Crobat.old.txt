[Overview]

<p>Crobat isn't worth using unless you're expecting to lose. All that Speed is wasted on a Pokemon without the moves to take advantage of it.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive
move 1: Wing Attack
move 2: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Fighting
move 3: Toxic / Return
move 4: Screech
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hidden Power Ground hits those Electrics who think Crobat is a free switch in, as well as Poisons, but Hidden Power Fighting can be used to cover the common Normal-types, Umbreon, Tyranitar, and Houndoom. If you choose Hidden Power Fighting, you'll definitely want Return to hit Electric-types, but if you use Hidden Power Ground, Toxic vs. Return is a toss-up.</p>

[SET]
name: Toxic Staller
move 1: Confuse Ray
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Wing Attack / Hidden Power Flying / Fly
move 4: Mean Look
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>So this is what you've got. Confuse Ray + Toxic is probably how you'll do most of your damage. Your Flying attack won't do much. Wing Attack and Hidden Power Flying do more damage over time, but Fly stalls for time. Mean Look to trap whatever gets hit by Toxic and make sure it doesn't leave. Don't expect much when you use Crobat.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>With 358 Speed, Flail isn't such a bad idea, with only a handful of things as fast as Crobat or faster. Giga Drain works if you really don't like Rhydon, Golem, and Quagsire. Pursuit might be a fun surprise. Mimic because a Spiking Crobat is a sight to see. Steel Wing nails Aerodactyl if it likes switching in on you. Hidden Power Bug can do a bit extra to Exeggutor, but it doesn't do too much more than Hidden Power Flying.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any Steel-type stops Crobat cold. Gengar counters it, as well as most Rock / Ground types. Crobat can't do anything to Nidoking and Nidoqueen, or any Poison-type for that matter. A sturdy Pokemon like Snorlax with Rest screws Crobat as well.</p>
