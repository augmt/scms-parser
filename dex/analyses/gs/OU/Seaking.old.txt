[Overview]

<p>Seaking isn't that good of a Pokemon, but usable if you are looking for a challenge. A Water-type Swords Dance user such as this is fairly unique, and its sizable HP can bring a lot to the table. It's unfair, really. Water is the deepest type in GSC and there are so many of the type clearly ahead of Seaking, it probably gets overlooked a lot.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Agility / Hydro Pump
move 3: Double-Edge
move 4: Hidden Power Ground
item: Miracle Berry / Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set makes use of its two best stats, HP and Attack. It is best used by saving it as a trump card late-game. Choosing between Agility or Hydro Pump depends on the type of team you are going to be using. If you are running a hard hitting non-status spreading team, Agility would probably be wise. However, if you have a lot of Pokemon with Stun Spore, Body Slam, or Thunder Wave, then Seaking will not need to make itself fast and won't need to bluff having a STAB Water attack, such as Hydro Pump. As long as you keep Hidden Power Ground or Double-Edge a secret, it is likely that an opponent will hesitate confronting this Pokemon with a Rock- or Ground-type, which is favorable to you. Hidden Power Ground punishes Electric-types, although it will have to be set up nicely before it can be used to your favor effectively. Miracle Berry is to get the jump on any late paralyzing or sleeping Pokemon that are in a last ditch effort to stop you from doing heavy damage to their team.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Surf
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a much more conservative way of fighting and it works in mostly the opposite way of the Swords Dance set. This set does not hit hard nor does it impress up front, however it fills out the token Water-type slot for a team. This Seaking is much more durable and gets the job done eventually. While it won't pack the punch of a sweeper it is worth a mention for UU teams that just need a regular Water-type without any gimmicks.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Icy Wind is always useful on slow Pokemon with the ability to make normally fast Pokemon humorously slow. Endure + Flail deserves a mention even if Seaking is probably too slow to pull it off effectively.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Faster Electric-types will easily beat Seaking, as its defenses are acceptable but nothing extraordinary. Examples of such Pokemon are Electabuzz and Jolteon, who also usually have good Special Defense with which to take Surf. Watch out for Hidden Power Ground, though. Grass-types that aren't too afraid of Ice Beam are also excellent choices, and include Meganium, Venusaur, and others.</p>
