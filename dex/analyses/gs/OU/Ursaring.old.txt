[Overview]

<p>Ursaring is a cool high-tier attacker. With its massive Attack score and STAB on the all-around good awesome attack Return, it can really put a hurting on almost any Pokemon in the game, and it gets just about all the right moves to help its cause. However, Ursaring's average defenses will leave it forever in the shadow of Snorlax, who can do Ursaring's job and have the defenses to take a lot of hits as well.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Curse
move 2: Return
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set set the stage for Ursaring to completely dominate the UU tier to the point where it had to be moved up to BL. The idea is simple: set up with Curse and unleash its monster Attack with its STAB Return. When Ursaring is going to go in the red, heal up with Rest and continue the mayhem with Sleep Talk. Anything that isn't resistant to Return (and even some things that are) is going to get wasted.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker 
move 1: Return
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Zap Cannon
move 4: Curse / Fire Punch
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When Ursaring enters the stage, most players will expect the RestTalk set and send in a Pokemon resistant to Return. This is when you flip the tables and use Earthquake or Zap Cannon--the paralysis is also extremely handy for Starmie, who may try to come in and Reflect. The last moveslot is up to personal preference; Curse will bolster Ursaring's already-massive Attack, or there's also the option of Fire Punch, which gives Ursaring a dependable stream of damage against Steel-types--Forretress will be maimed, it does a bit more to Steelix than Earthquake, plus it saves Ursaring from having to rely on Zap Cannon to do noticeable damage to Skarmory.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Counter works great with Ursaring's HP and Defense to give Rhydon, Snorlax, and Tyranitar something to think about. You could also give Roar a try with Curse, but it's probably better to leave that job to Kangaskhan, who has better defenses.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Most Pokemon that resist Normal-type moves will counter the RestTalk set--Skarmory, Steelix, Forretress, Gengar, and Scizor are all good examples. However, the mixed attacker is harder to counter and will come down to prediction. Skarmory or Aerodactyl are probably the best options, but Skarmory will be annoyed by Fire Punch and Aerodactyl can get crippled by Zap Cannon.</p>
