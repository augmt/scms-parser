[Overview]

<p>Weezing is a decent UU Pokemon with good attack stats in both categories; however, its beaten by Muk in just about every way. No Will-O-Wisp or Levitate makes GSC Weezing less popular than its future ADV self. Explosion is always nice though.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker 
move 1: Thunder
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Sludge Bomb
move 4: Explosion
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thunder and Fire Blast take care of Steel and Water Pokemon (making it handy against the common Spikes users), Sludge Bomb has STAB and runs off of Weezing's decent Attack, and Explosion is just a great move in general for taking out troublesome opponents.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Destiny Bond isn't seen much, but could be nice to snuff out a Curse user who's about to sweep your team. Curse and Screech are there mainly to boost Sludge Bomb's power and maybe force a switch. Pain Split can work decently with Curse as a pseudo-recovery move, and Haze could help with Curse users--Haze and then go kamikaze when they're about to KO Weezing.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Rhydon, Golem, and Gengar all resist Sludge Bomb, and the first two also resist Weezing's other offensive moves. Misdreavus can be tough to face. Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Donphan, and Sandslash also resist Sludge Bomb. Alakazam and Espeon can both lay the smack down with Psychic, but Alakazam needs to watch out for Sludge Bomb damage.</p>
