[Overview]

<p>Wigglytuff has a great movepool, but is out-shined by Clefable in every way. It doesn't have a recovery move, and it can't sweep with Belly Drum like Clefable can. Wigglytuff is decent in UU, however, because for the most part, move versatility is more important than attack strength. Even so, Clefable can play the attacking game better.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Double-Edge
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Thunder Wave / Counter / Sing
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The Ice + Electric combo is only resisted by Lanturn and Magneton, and has super effective coverage on pretty much everything Double-Edge doesn't hit for neutral damage. The last three moves each have their own benefits. Thunder Wave and Counter are your best options here, though Sing can be used for an unpleasant surprise for your opponent. If you decide to use Counter, you might want to opt for Return over Double-Edge to lessen the amount of HP Wigglytuff is going to lose over the course of a match.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Wigglytuff has one of the best movepools in the game. Fire Blast can hit Steel-types hard. Curse can patch up its subpar Defense, and can be used in conjunction with Rest and/or Shadow Ball. Body Slam can paralyze things, and Charm will ruin strong physical attackers when they switch in.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Suicune can take just about anything it throws at it (even a few Thunderbolts from its pathetic Special Attack). Raikou, Ampharos, Tyranitar, Umbreon, Tauros, Forretress, Kangaskhan, Snorlax, Steelix, and Scizor can all take Wigglytuff out before it gets a chance to do anything back (with the obvious exception of Umbreon).</p>
