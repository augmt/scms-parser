[Overview]

<p>Shuckle possesses the best defenses in the game, that's a fact. It also has a fairly good typing. So why the hate? Well, terrible HP and the inability to effectively attack at all really hurt Shuckle's usefulness, not to mention the fact that Shuckle's most effective method of damage is easily countered by Steel and Poison Pokemon, who are very common, and the amount of Heal Bell and RestTalk users in GSC isn't helping its cause either. Things can easily set up on Shuckle, especially something like a Curse / Return / Rest / Sleep Talk Kangaskhan that can set up after being hit with Toxic and just Rest it off, unless Encore lasts an incredibly long time. Shuckle is best used on stall or TSS (Toxic / Spikes / Sandstorm) based teams, because it won't do much besides stalling.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Looking at Shuckle, you see massive defenses... and nothing else. Its HP is in fact the lowest of all fully evolved Pokemon and tied for second lowest in the game (it's at least higher than Diglett's). Basically, Wrap something non-Steel or Poison typed (obviously non-Ghost too) and then Toxic them, praying that they don't have Rest (but it's GSC, so they probably will). Use Shuckle's high defenses to tank hits in the meantime, then use Rest when you need to. Encore is pretty cool, as even with Shuckle's low Speed you can Encore stat ups and switch to some setup Pokemon or phazer of your own. Or just have Shuckle Encore an Earthquake and switch to a Flying-type; just don't expect it to be as useful as, say, Jumpluff. You can use Protect for even more PP wasting and Toxic stalling.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sweet Kiss works for confusion, possibly over Encore for general annoyance. Attract could also be used in the capacity that confusion would be, just to be more annoying and maybe stop things from hitting or setting up on Shuckle. Safeguard lets Shuckle be more of a help to the team, and Sleep Talk can be used with Rest because Shuckle has the defenses to easily utilize it, but seriously, what can Shuckle do except stall?</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any Steel or Poison Pokemon, especially Gengar and Steelix, will be immune to anything Shuckle can pull off. Most Pokemon that setup can use Shuckle as a free opportunity, but they have to beware of Encore. Water-types with high Special Attack can hit Shuckle on one of its main weaknesses. Rest and Heal Bell in general will keep Shuckle from racking up Toxic damage. Anything with Seismic Toss or Night Shade bypasses those high defenses and goes straight for the garbage HP.</p>
