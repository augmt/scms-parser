[Overview]

<p>Game Freak really must not have liked Tangela, because they took away an astonishing 120 points from its Special Defense, essentially taking away any of Tangela's tanking ability. It not learning Leech Seed is a bummer too. However, Tangela has potential in UU for absorbing hits from threats that only have physical attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: Double Powder 
move 1: Stun Spore
move 2: Sleep Powder
move 3: Giga Drain
move 4: Reflect / Synthesis
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Double Powder is a good thing to have, so status away. Giga Drain combined with Tangela's decent Special Attack makes it a good Rhydon, Golem, and Marowak counter. Reflect can help the team, or Synthesis keeps Tangela in the game longer.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Swords Dance and Body Slam should only be used together. It can work in UU for something unexpected, but you probably would want to leave this job to Meganium or Venusaur. You could also use Growth to bolster the strength of Giga Drain, since it's tough working with 8 PP.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Exeggutor hard counters Tangela because Tangela can't do anything back to it. Skarmory, Zapdos, Moltres, Charizard, Jynx, Houndoom, Gengar, Articuno, Muk, Heracross, Tentacruel, and Victreebel all work as counters because they have at least one move that smokes Tangela.</p>
