[Overview]

<p>Kingdra has good stats, but a horrible movepool. The awesome Dragon / Water typing helps, but it's a little overrated since it doesn't give Kingdra any physical STAB. Nevertheless, it can attack from both attack stats decently and it can take a Thunderbolt too. Kingdra is very usable, but also very predictable.</p>

name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Double-Edge
move 4: Surf
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>RestTalk was made for Kingdra. If Surf doesn't do enough to your opponent, use Double-Edge (it puts a decent dent on Snorlax and Blissey). Considering Kingdra's defenses, it's not going to die anytime soon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Ice Beam could help for Grass-types, but it leaves you useless against any special walls. Curse isn't that bad of an option, since Double-Edge's power is very nice. Since Kingdra has good defenses, it could use Haze decently. DragonBreath and Toxic are novelty at best for status afflictions.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Snorlax comes into Kingdra with impunity despite Double-Edge and set up Curse. Electric-types like Raikou and Zapdos aren't scared of Surf and blast back Kingdra with Thunderbolt. Exeggutor resists Surf and can use Leech Seed to sap at Kingdra's HP. Slowbro and Cloyster can use STAB Psychic and Ice Beam, respectively, while suffering little damage from Double-Edge; use Cloyster with caution, though, because its low Special Defense will cause it to succumb to Surf quickly.</p>
