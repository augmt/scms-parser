[Overview]

<p>Slowking is essentially a weaker Slowbro. Since every special attack (except for Dragon attacks, but those are out of question since nobody uses them) will either be super effective or not very effective on him; the Special Defense really doesn't make much of a difference--most strong Thunderbolts KO Slowking in 2 hits just like Slowbro. However, Slowbro can eat a good deal of physical hits, while Slowking cannot. It's funny how simply swapping 2 stats vastly changes the usefulness. Slowking is still good, but Slowbro is just better.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Does it look familiar? It's just like Slowbro. Paralyze things, attack as you see fit.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>It can set up Reflect to boost its average Defense, and Zap Cannon is fun to attack with and spread paralysis. Slowking can run Fire Blast to hit Grass- and Steel-types. Ice Beam covers Grass Pokemon as well as Dragonite. If you want to give Blissey and Snorlax a run for their money, consider Dynamic Punch.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Slowking is fairly sturdy on the special side, so the usual Electric-types won't destroy it as quickly as they do other Water-types, but eventually they will win. Exeggutor does a good job of wearing down Slowbro. Snorlax and Blissey, as usual against special attackers, stall Slowking out, and the former will set up and sweep with Curse. Starmie's Thunderbolt has a bit of a hard time taking it out, but Recover will make sure Starmie lasts long enough for it to do so.</p>
