[Overview]

<p>Lickitung is the (very) poor man's Snorlax. It has relatively high HP, but it lacks in its Attack and Special Attack stats to do much damage without a boost. Its defensive stats aren't so pleasing either. Lickitung can do some damage in UU battles with its physical set, but other than that, it can't do much else sadly. There's nothing saying that you can't use Lickitung, but rather that it's really hard to use Lickitung effectively in any situation. Even in its own common environment it's rarely used.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Body Slam
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Sleep Talk
move 4: Rest
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Use Swords Dance to increase Lickitung's not so hot Attack, and then attack with Body Slam. Paraylzing with Body Slam will make you happy, because after paralysis Lickitung's Speed won't be much of an issue. Then, when you have a third of your HP left, use Rest and Sleep Talk from there. If only Lickitung had a higher Attack stat, that would make it so much better.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Sleep Talk
move 4: Rest
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is more or less a novelty set than anything else. Lickitung has a large movepool which is very surprising. However, its low stats don't really support the massive amount of moves it can learn. If not, use either Thunderbolt or Ice Beam on their own, then Rest and Sleep Talk when low on HP. You do have a chance of paralyzing or freezing, but it's very unlikely that either will occur. If you manage to give an opposing Pokemon a bad status, then jump for joy, since Lickitung loves such things.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>With the Swords Dance Lickitung, you can easily change it from a Swords Dance Lickitung to a Curse Lickitung. The Attack and Defense pumps are great for Lickitung, and because of how slow Lickitung is in the first place, the Speed lowering flaw of Curse doesn't matter. If you feel that Lickitung needs to deal more damage, go with Double-Edge. Return can substitute in for Body Slam as well if you don't like the recoil of Double-Edge. Though, Body Slam's paralyzing effect is really hard to pass by on. There aren't many other choices for Lickitung using its special set.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Ghost-types, Skarmory, and Machamp. I strongly suggest that if you using Lickitung that you also have Houndoom or Tyranitar, as they can Pursuit and keep the threat of Ghosts completely destroying Lickitung to a minimum.</p>
