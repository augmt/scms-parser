[Overview]

<p>Aipom is strictly an annoyance Pokemon, so it automatically isn't very effective. Killing something with Counter once is fun, but it's too bad Aipom can't do this more than one time. It has bad stats and a movepool it can't do anything with.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Agility
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Return
move 4: Counter
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is about as good as it gets. Don't let the low HP and Defense fool you. Aipom can Counter back strong attacks, such as Megahorn from Heracross, for an OHKO. That's your best bet at killing something. You can also Baton Pass Agility if you want.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Curse doesn't really help Aipom, but it doesn't have many options. Screech can help Aipom when attacking, but it shouldn't be attacking anyway. Spite works if you want to waste Blissey's Heal Bells.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Aipom is just begging for Rhydon, Steelix, or Donphan to come in and begin Cursing. Forretress can set up Spikes while taking minimal damage. Strong Fighting-types such as Machamp can OHKO Aipom without fear of Counter, and Skarmory can Whirlwind away Aipom's attempts to Baton Pass.</p>
