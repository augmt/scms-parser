[Overview]

<p>What's to say? Rapidash is a Fire-type. Not a very good Fire-type either. Its best stat is Attack but it doesn't even get good moves for that stat. Earthquake or Magnitude would have fit perfectly on a Pokemon with hard hooves. It suffers from the same thing most Fire-types suffer from: poor movepool, and stats allocated in the wrong places. It might be able to do some things in the OU metagame, but Charizard is better in every way.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard 
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Return
move 3: Hypnosis
move 4: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Rock
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Meh. No wonder this horse is UU. Fire Blast gives Rapidash some extra kick behind its Fire attacks. Return and the Hidden Power run off its best attacking stat. Hypnosis is there because there's not a whole lot more Rapidash can do.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Return / Iron Tail
move 4: Hypnosis
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set might be good for a laugh and to catch people off-guard. It's stopped cold by Rock-types, though, which is why Iron Tail is an option. Put what you can't beat to sleep with Hypnosis, and burn whatever resists your physical attack with Fire Blast.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Reflect is a good option because it can help Rapidash live a bit longer. Double Kick can be a nice alternative for Hidden Power Fighting if you don't want to hurt your attack stat by using the Hidden Power (10 less Base Power, but at least you'll have a few more attack stats). Charm can be good against the common Curse users. Sunny Day can help beef up the power of that somewhat mediocre Fire Blast and weaken incoming Water-type attacks.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Rapidash is very limited in terms of move selection, so Rock and Water Pokemon are excellent counters because they resist its main offense, Fire Blast. Snorlax takes next to nothing from Fire Blast and will usually win a Curse war. A sturdy Pokemon with RestTalk will usually stonewall Rapidash, as it renders worthless what is arguably its biggest asset, Hypnosis.</p>
