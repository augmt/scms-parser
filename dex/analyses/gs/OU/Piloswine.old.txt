[Overview]

<p>Piloswine is definitely one of the better UU sweepers and can be extremely effective when it's in the right hands. Its unique typing gives it STAB on two of the best attack types, not to mention that Ice and Ground attacks cover each other's shortcomings amazingly well. While its stats aren't stellar (exception being a good deal of HP), they're made up for with the good typing. It does get countered by just about any standard Water-type, but besides that it's a great UU choice. Unfortunately, as good as Ground / Ice is offensively, it is a garbage typing defensively. It's only immune to Electric and it resists Poison. Other than that, Piloswine takes everything for neutral damage or worse.</p>

<p>Curse up and Roar out anything that tries to Roar you. Blizzard hits Grass- and Flying-types since Earthquake won't work well on them. Blizzard KOes Zapdos in two hits and Skarmory in three.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Piloswine has decent Defense and great HP, so it can use RestTalk well. Ground + Ice has at least neutral damage on the entire metagame, and double STAB is not a bad thing.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>If Blizzard isn't your cup of tea, you can try Ice Beam. Also, Piloswine has access to Rock Slide, Body Slam, or Ancient Power for physical attacks. Ancient Power is always fun for that possible global stat boost.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The usual defensive Water-types completely stop Piloswine in its tracks and blast it with Surf in its weak Special Defense. Heracross's Ground resistance and good Special Defense help it take Piloswine's attacks, while its powerful Megahorn will take its toll. Skarmory doesn't have trouble taking Piloswine's attacks, but the former will unfortunately always be Roared out, as Piloswine has the slower Roar. Skarmory is still very effective at wasting Piloswine's PP, though. Moltres and Charizard beat Piloswine if it doesn't have a Rock move.</p>
