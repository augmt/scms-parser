[Overview]

<p>Nidoqueen is whatever you want it to be. Really, Nidoqueen is used to fill in gaps in a team, and to be played defensively. Nidoqueen is a great Pokemon with a nice typing, which makes it immune to Electric, 4x resistant to Poison, and 2x resistant to Fighting, Bug, and Rock. Sure, a few of its weaknesses are pretty common, but every Pokemon has weaknesses. Nidoqueen could work in OU, given its immunity to Thunder Wave and Toxic, and its all-around usefulness. You could mix and match the moves above to make it a useful Curse counter. Really, Nidoqueen can fill in almost any role you may need on a team. Nidoqueen's versatility is what makes it so useful and fun to use. Facing one can be annoying though, since it has a large movepool at its disposal and its standard set has excellent type coverage, and several other movesets are possible.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard 
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Lovely Kiss
move 3: Thunder / Thunderbolt
move 4: Ice Beam / Fire Blast
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The two moves are standard, the other slots are just picking what you need on your team and would like to use. Earthquake gives a nice powerful STAB attack. Lovely Kiss lets you sleep those annoying Water-types and what-not. Thunder and Thunderbolt help annoy Starmie and Suicune, and the last move is just a filler for your team.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>You can pass Reflect to the team. Nidoqueen can utilize Charm for countering Curse users. Counter could be interesting for sending back non-STAB Earthquakes.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The most reliable counters can take attacks from both attacking stats without instantly being KOed, such as Suicune and Porygon2. Hypno and Snorlax (to an extent) also work well. While Alakazam isn't particularly defensive, its extremely powerful Psychic can nearly OHKO Nidoqueen. Depending on the moves present in the set, a variety of Pokemon with super effective moves against Nidoqueen or good defensive capabilities might be viable.</p>
