item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Double Powder is always fun to try. Moonlight gives constant recovery, and Razor Leaf is a good STAB attack. This set is good for switching in on Rhydon or Marowak.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Arcanine can use Fire Blast to roast Bellossom, and often carries Sleep Talk, anyway. Zapdos has Drill Peck and Sleep Talk. Steel-types, such as Skarmory, easily counter Bellossom's attacks. Forretress, Scizor, and Skarmory in particular can use their STAB moves to hit Bellossom super effectively. Grass / Poison types like Victreebel and Venusaur can Sludge Bomb Bellossom for its doom. Heracross can easily take whatever Bellossom throws at it and fire off a Megahorn.</p>
