[Overview]

<p>In the early days of GSC Scizor was one of the most overused Pokemon, but is now in the shadow of BL when everyone decided to carry random Fire attacks for Steel-types. He's pretty underrated in GSC and can be extremely deadly if you're good at predicting.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Swords Dance / Agility
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Agility / Steel Wing
move 4: Hidden Power Bug
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Swords Dance and Agility together might be hard to use, because it's already hard enough Baton Passing one stat, let alone two. You want to have attacks that can hit a broad range of opponents so Scizor can potentially take out some phazers. Hidden Power Bug is good if you're goal with Scizor is to sweep, or there's Steel Wing to hit Rock-types (though it won't do much to most of them).</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance Sweeper
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Steel Wing
move 4: Hidden Power Bug / Hidden Power Rock
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Swords Dance sweeping Scizor isn't as much of a team player as the Baton Pass set, but can attack well in his own right. If you can get rid of any opposing Steel-types and opponents with Fire moves, Scizor can really be a pain to the opponent. Steel Wing and Hidden Power Bug are there for STAB. Hidden Power Rock can be used instead of Hidden Power Bug because it will hit Flying- and Fire-types hard and will at least hit Skarmory for neutral damage.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Scizor learns Light Screen, which is a generally rare move, but he's a lot better at just outright attacking. Scizor also learns Counter, which could surprise Pokemon like Donphan and Rhydon, and if Swords Dance isn't to your taste there's always Curse. There's Endure + Reversal too, but Scizor is slow, so only use it with Agility. And finally, you can stick Rest on the metal bug; with decent defenses, one weakness, and resistance to Normal attacks, he can pull it off pretty efficiently.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Skarmory, Steelix, and Forretress are good counters because they can take anything Scizor has in the way of offense. Suicune doesn't resist any of Scizor's moves except Steel Wing, but it has such a huge Defense stat that Scizor will do diddly squat to it, and it can Roar Scizor away or KO it with Surf. Arcanine, Moltres, Charizard, Zapdos, and Houndoom all have moves that take care of Scizor within seconds and resist all of Scizor's attacking options. Rhydon and Golem counter it well if Steel Wing is absent. Anything else with Fire Blast will also take care of Scizor quite nicely.</p>
