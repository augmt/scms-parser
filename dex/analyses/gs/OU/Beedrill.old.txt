[Overview]

<p>Utterly useless in OU play, and totally outclassed in UU as well. Keep this one on your fun teams, people.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Sludge Bomb
move 2: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Rock
move 3: Swords Dance
move 4: Agility / Return / Twineedle
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Go, useless bee! Nice Attack and slightly below-average Speed. I wonder why no one uses Beedrill. Oh yeah, it can't really do much. With this set, just try to up your stats and attack like crazy until either you die, or a counter shows up, whichever comes first. Sludge Bomb gets STAB of course, and Hidden Power Ground covers most of its resistances, but Hidden Power Rock can hit enemy Bug-types. As for the last move, you can gamble with your Speed if you like. I doubt the bee will live long enough to do much with it anyway.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>What a plethora of options! Reflect can help those weak defenses. Substitute can help with your predictions. And to use Beedrill, you're going to have to be pretty good at prediction to make it work.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Steel-types such as Steelix, Forretress, and Skarmory all perpetually wall Beedrill. Rhydon sets up on it with Curse, and Suicune takes little damage from its attacks. Anything that knows a Rock, Psychic, Fire, or Flying move makes a pretty good counter.</p>
