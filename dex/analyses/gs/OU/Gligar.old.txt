[Overview]

<p>A good concept Pokemon (Ground and Flying cover each other pretty decently), but torn to pieces by mediocre stats and bad movepool. He does make a decent UU counter to Marowak and Raikou, but that's about it.</p>

[SET]
name: Screech
move 1: Screech
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Wing Attack
move 4: Counter
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Use Screech as the opponent switches, and if you've got a shot at taking them out, go ahead. You're not going to be able to touch Zapdos or Skarmory, but then again, with Counter, they're not going to do too much to you without getting killed. With his decent Defense, Counter is also great for Snorlax and Marowak.</p>

[SET]
name: Thief
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Wing Attack
move 3: Rest / Protect
move 4: Thief
item: Mint Berry / Miracle Berry

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Only use Rest with Mint Berry. This is the old "standard" Gligar. It's ideal if you can steal a Thick Club from Marowak or Leftovers from Snorlax or Zapdos.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>If you're really desperate to hit Zapdos, there's Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Rock. You could just put Sludge Bomb over Wing Attack since you're not going to touch Skarmory anyway and Heracross isn't seen as much recently. Gligar can use Curse instead of Screech, but he doesn't have the kind of time for that.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Most Water-types that have even a minimal semblance of stability can take on Gligar with Surf or Ice Beam; among those ranks are Suicune, Slowbro, Starmie, Quagsire, etc. Flying-types also work well with their immunity to Ground, especially specially-based ones like Moltres and Articuno. Zapdos and Skarmory beat Gligar through attrition, as they resist Wing Attack as well.</p>
