[Overview]

<p>Jynx is a high-risk, high-reward type of Pokemon. That Special Attack stat is awesome, Jynx's types work together well as attacks, and the few things that can handle her attacks easily can get put to sleep and get chipped away. Jynx also has enough Speed to be faster than most common Pokemon in standard GSC play. However, Jynx's biggest liability is her defenses. She simply cannot afford to take more than one hit unless it's Ice Beam or Psychic, so be careful in bringing her in and leaving her in. When using Jynx, make sure to surround her with things that can take advantage of what she has to offer. For example, something like Starmie can absorb Jynx's attacks easily, but it can be put to sleep with Lovely Kiss; once it's asleep, it's a lot easier to bring in something like Machamp, who can now Curse at least once without fear of Starmie using Psychic or Reflect.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Ice Beam
move 2: Lovely Kiss
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Psychic
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Jynx is a hardcore special attacker. You might want to hold off on Lovely Kiss for a bit, otherwise you might put something like Zapdos (a very common RestTalk user) to sleep when you'd have been better off just attacking it. As for her attacks, she makes the most of her typing with STAB on both Psychic and Ice Beam, and she can hit quite hard with that Special Attack; the only standard things that resist both attacks are Starmie and Forretress, but the beauty here is that you can put them to sleep and open the door for something to set up on them and sweep. Substitute will prevent Jynx from getting hit with status moves and will partially shield Jynx from physical attacks. Jynx won't be sweeping any teams with this set, but this blend of status and attacking power can be a handy tool indeed.</p>

[SET]
name: Perish Trapper
move 1: Mean Look
move 2: Perish Song
move 3: Protect
move 4: Ice Beam / Substitute
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the Perish Trapping version of Jynx, and it can be almost unstoppable at times. Mean Look when they switch, and then Perish Song away. Protect keeps Jynx from getting harmed. The last move is up to you. Ice Beam capitalizes on Jynx's stellar Special Attack, and also receives STAB. This is ultra convenient because most common phazers are Flying- or Ground-types, both of which are punished by Ice Beam. Another option is Substitute, which works as another turn of guaranteed added protection (at the cost of 25% of its health) if Jynx is faster than its opponent. Since Jynx is so fragile, it's certainly an option since Protect only has a 50% chance of working the second consecutive time it is used. Note, however, that Jynx will be left without an attack, and thus have no way to directly damage anything.</p>

[SET]
name: Sleep Trapper
move 1: Ice Beam
move 2: Lovely Kiss
move 3: Mean Look
move 4: Nightmare
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The philosophy here is to Mean Look whatever switches in, and if you have an advantage, put it to sleep. Normally a special wall would wall this, but then you can flip the tables on them and use Nightmare, which takes away 25% of the victim's health as long as it is asleep. Nightmare in conjunction with Jynx's STAB Ice Beam will kill most things in 3 or so hits. This set is great to surprise threats that would otherwise wall Jynx (such as Blissey, Umbreon, Snorlax, and Tyranitar). This can be a very high-risk set, since there is no kind of protection for Jynx, who is very fragile, but the payoffs can be amazing. As with the other sets, be on the lookout for RestTalk users that Jynx can't kill with Ice Beam as well as Water-types that resist Ice Beam.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Since Jynx is always female, and most things are male, Attract will certainly be an annoyance, and can help you fire off another attack to KO. The last two options are for Jynx's bad Defense. Physical attacks really nail Jynx hard, so an unexpected Counter will send the attacker packing. Reflect will bolster Jynx's Defense (as well as the rest of the team) for 5 turns, again giving you a chance to attack again or put something to sleep.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Snorlax and Blissey both can take Ice Beams and Psychics from Jynx all day. However, remember that these can both be put to sleep with Lovely Kiss, and both Snorlax and Blissey are at the bottom of the list of things to use as sleep sacrifices. Note, though, that some Snorlax carry Sleep Talk, and a Sleep Talking Snorlax will counter just about everything Jynx can do.</p>

<p>The main Dark-types--Tyranitar, Houndoom, and Umbreon--can also give Jynx problems, especially since all three often carry Pursuit. Houndoom in particular is a perfect foil, as its Speed mirrors Jynx and it resists both Ice Beam and Psychic. Tyranitar can hit hard, but it can be put to sleep and, if it doesn't carry Pursuit, Jynx can wear Tyranitar down with repeated Ice Beams on the switch in. Umbreon has high Special Defense and usually totes Pursuit, but note that its Pursuit does not break Jynx's Substitute, so if Jynx does not want to put Umbreon to sleep, it can Substitute and switch out without sustaining much damage.</p>

<p>Starmie, Slowbro, and Forretress all resist Ice Beam and Psychic and have their ways of disarming Jynx, be it status moves or direct attacks. Keep in mind, though, that these three usually play somewhat of a defensive anchoring role on their teams, so putting them to sleep can really put the pressure on them to stop your offense.</p>

<p>Finally, there are some RestTalk users that can foil Jynx, but these are usually more defensive-based. Snorlax was always mentioned, but others include Raikou and Suicune; Raikou has enough Special Defense to survive repeated hits and can hit back with Thunderbolt or Crunch, while Suicune's defenses make it basically impervious to Jynx's hits when coupled with RestTalk.</p>
