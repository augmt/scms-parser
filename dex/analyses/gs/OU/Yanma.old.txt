[Overview]

<p>Yanma is a horrible Pokemon, no question about it. A lot of weaknesses and no means to attack doesn't help it at all. This Bug needs Attack Baton Passed to it so it can do something else other than die. Unfortunately, most other Pokemon can perform better with Attack passed to them, so it's hard to justify using Yanma.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Curse / Screech
move 2: Hidden Power Bug
move 3: Wing Attack
move 4: Giga Drain
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Yanma is horrible, so this is about as good as it gets without something Baton Passing to it. Set up Curse to boost its low Attack, or lower the opponent's Defense with Screech (though they may switch out), then attack like there's no tomorrow, since with Yanma, there IS no tomorrow. Giga Drain is mostly for lack of a better move. At least it hits guys like Golem and Rhydon for a 2HKO.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sad. Just sad. Yanma can utilize Reversal because its 288 Speed isn't bad at all, though 228 Attack (without STAB) is.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Yanma has many weakness, bad defenses, and lackluster offenses, so it has many, many counters. Arcanine and Sudowoodo are among the best choices, as they resist Bug and have high Defense, respectively, and hit back with super effective STAB attacks. Electric-types like Raichu and Electrode work well, too. If Yanma has just a bit of prior damage, which isn't too hard to accomplish, Delibird, of all things, wins against it. Yanma is <strong>extremely</strong> simple to counter.</p>
