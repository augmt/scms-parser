[Overview]

<p>I've always liked Stantler. He's a very overlooked UU Pokemon, and while he isn't going to sweep any UU teams, he's got support moves that can help your team out. It's a shame that such a good Special Attack stat is completely ruined since he only learns one decent special attack, Psychic (which isn't a great one anyway). Again, a good concept completely wasted by movepool.</p>

[SET]
name: Screen Support
move 1: Confuse Ray
move 2: Return
move 3: Reflect / Light Screen
move 4: Earthquake
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Use Confuse Ray on whatever switches in, set up Reflect or Light Screen appropriately, and then attack.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Curse could patch Stantler's bad Defense and boost his Attack up. Putting enemies to sleep with Hypnosis is an option since most people don't know what moves Stantler learns anyway. Psychic, though not boosted by STAB, runs off of a nice Special Attack stat for a Normal-type, and it'll hit opposing Fighting-types hard. You can pair Reflect, Light Screen, or Curse with Roar to phaze anything that might be a pest.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Stantler is a typical Normal-type with mediocre stats all-around, so strong attacks will always make him fall. Additionally, defensive Pokemon that aren't weak to Earthquake, such as Meganium and Skarmory, work well.</p>
