[Overview]

<p>Omastar is a nice little UU tank that can also attack pretty hard. With great a Defense stat, Rock typing, and a stellar Special Attack stat, Omastar can both support and attack pretty well. A great counter for Porygon2 and Curse + RestTalk users. However, other Water-types completely shut Omastar down, so beware.</p>

[SET]
name: Support
move 1: Surf
move 2: Rest
move 3: Haze
move 4: Reflect
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a pretty basic set and takes advantage of Omastar's Rock typing and its big Defense stat. Bring this in on a Curse Pokemon and set up Reflect. Behind Reflect you can use Haze to nullify any stat-ups the opponent may have received. When you have a spare turn, attack with Surf (Omastar has an awesome Special Attack score, 328, on par with that of Raikou). When you have taken a lot of damage, Rest away your worries. This set is great against a lot of Curse users, but beware of those that have Earthquake.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Hydro Pump / Surf
move 4: Ice Beam
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Defense and Special Attack are Omastar's two best stats, and this set takes advantage of them. Hydro Pump will deal a load of damage to many Pokemon not resistant to it, and if they send in Exeggutor or Zapdos, Ice Beam will hit them hard. When low on health, Rest and Sleep Talk will continue the attacking fun. With Omastar's resistances, it'll get plenty of switch-in opportunities, especially in UU. Watch out for other Water-types.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Toxic will whittle away at the Water-types that are Omastar's best counters.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Other Water-types use their resistances to Water and Ice to switch in easily and can capitalize on its neutrality to Surf to strike back for greater damage. This roster includes Pokemon like Octillery, Dewgong, and Golduck. Gyarados, while not resistant to Ice, can take hits with its high Special Defense and hit back with Zap Cannon or Surf; Mantine has even higher Special Defense, and can Surf Omastar as well. Electric-types such as Magneton and Raichu can take a Surf and Thunderbolt Omastar's weak Special Defense. If Omastar doesn't have Ice Beam, Vileplume, Victreebel, and other Grass-types work very well, too.</p>
