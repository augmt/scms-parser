[Overview]

<p>Arcanine is one of those Pokemon that had a lot of potential but sadly wasn't able to take full advantage of it. Despite its nice spread of stats, its lack of a real usable movepool and the disadvantages of being a pure Fire-type leave it in the shadow of UU. Arcanine is a hit and run sort of Pokemon, and unlike most Fire-types, it can actually afford to take a hit.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Fire Blast / Flamethrower
move 2: Hidden Power Fighting / Body Slam
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes advantage of Arcanine's decent durability. Either Fire Blast or Flamethrower is necessary for that great STAB. Body Slam is good for paralysis on Starmie and others, while Hidden Power Fighting will damage Rock-types such as Tyranitar, and dent Snorlax and Blissey. Double-Edge is an acceptable alternative to Body Slam. Note that in using it, you'll be trading the paralysis chance Body Slam offers for a higher average damage output.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hidden Power Grass and Crunch will deal some damage to incoming Water-type Pokemon, although Crunch is limited to Slowbro and Starmie in this regard. However, it has the possibility of lowering the opponent's Special Defense. Extreme Speed is handy to finish off Pokemon that would outspeed you otherwise. Keep in mind, however, that it suffers from PP issues. Arcanine can set up Reflect and Safeguard for the team if you want to do that. Note that in combination with Rest and Sleep Talk, this would severely limit Arcanine's versatility. Curse and Toxic are also available to it.</p>

<p>Curse and Extreme Speed can potentially work quite well together, as Extreme Speed negates the decreased Speed from Curse. However, with only 8 PP at your disposal, sweeping the opposition with it can be difficult.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Starmie, Suicune, Slowbro, and Slowking can easily take repeated hits from Arcanine. Starmie may have a hard time switching into Body Slam, however, as paralysis cripples it. Snorlax has the defenses to begin to Curse and sweep despite Arcanine's best efforts to stop it. Rock-types such as Golem and Rhydon can KO Arcanine easily, but are severely damaged by Hidden Power Grass. Other Fire-types, such as Charizard and Moltres, can also trouble Arcanine.</p>
