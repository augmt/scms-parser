[Overview]

<p>While Dodrio dies to basically any hit, if you can keep it from getting hit, it can deal a load of damage to anything not resistant to its two attacks. A critical hit Double-Edge OHKOes Blissey, which is nice. A great UU counter to Heracross, it excels in UU as one of the best physical attackers available.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Double-Edge
move 2: Drill Peck
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is probably the only usable Dodrio set. Rest and Sleep Talk extend its staying power, but barely. The main reason for RestTalk is to heal the massive amounts of recoil Dodrio is going to suffer from its STAB Double-Edge, which is its main form of attack. If you can KO something with Drill Peck and save some recoil damage, do it. Drill Peck is also nice for Machamp, Grass-, Bug-, and Ghost-types.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There's always Endure and Flail as Dodrio is fast, but Flail will more than likely get shut down by a Rock- or Steel-type (or even a Ghost).</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything resistant to Normal and Flying attacks will work, especially Rock-types such as Golem and Rhydon. Steel-types such as Steelix, Forretress, and Scizor also work. Cloyster has high enough Defense to not care too much about Dodrio's attacks and can set up Spikes (Forretress can too). Zapdos and Raikou resist Drill Peck and can OHKO with STAB Thunderbolt, but they can't easily switch into Dodrio's Double-Edge.</p>
