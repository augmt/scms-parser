[Overview]

<p>Magneton is a really cool Pokemon, but it's also kind of an oddball. Like Ampharos and Lanturn, Magneton lacks the distinguishing Speed of most Electric-types. Gaining a Steel typing gave it a few more resistances, and it has good Defense, but it also has horrible HP (also, its Special Defense leaves something to be desired). Its movepool is pretty limited, but it does have awesome Special Attack and STAB on Thunderbolt. Magneton is a good choice for a UU team, as it can counter all of those Curse + RestTalk Pokemon with Reflect and repeated Thunderbolts. In order to work in OU, however, Magneton needs support to take out those special walls that will almost always block it. Once they are out of the way, however, Magneton can actually be a formidable opponent, and that resistance to Normal attacks can always come in handy.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Thunder Wave
move 3: Hidden Power Water
move 4: Substitute
item: Leftovers

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>No Magnet Pull here, but Magneton can still manage. The general idea is to Substitute when you get in to prevent any kind of status afflictions, and then go from there. Hidden Power Water is optimal for the super effective coverage on Nidoking, Steelix, Rhydon, and Golem. If your opponent sends in Exeggutor or a special wall, Thunder Wave will ensure that they don't leave completely unscathed. If you're using Magneton in a completely UU environment, you might want to opt for Hidden Power Grass for a cool 4x coverage on Quagsire.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>The type of Hidden Power you use can vary widely; in addition to Water, viable choices include Ice for most Ground- and Grass-types, Grass for most Ground-types, and Fire for Grass-types and Steelix. Reflect is good to pass around the team, and if your team is cut out for it, you can use Toxic on special walls (Snorlax especially) and make them take damage every turn. The poison damage Snorlax takes in addition to a Thunderbolt will translate into a good chunk of its health.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Prediction, really. Anything that has a Ground, Fire, or Fighting move will kill Magneton, but make sure it can absorb a strong Thunderbolt or Hidden Power. The most obvious counters are Blissey, Snorlax, and Fire Punch Electabuzz and Ampharos.</p>
