[Overview]

<p>Mew is probably the best Uber due to Swords Dance and the movepool that allows it to do anything it wants. It's best used as a physical sweeper since most physical walls and the other Ubers have a physical weakness that Mew can exploit.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Submission
move 3: Soft-Boiled
move 4: Shadow Ball / Rock Slide
item: Leftovers
 
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Set up with Swords Dance and hit everything with the attack that will do the most damage. Submission will work wonders on most opponents. Shadow Ball is there for the Psychic-types that are prominent in the Uber metagame, and Rock Slide will take apart the Flying-type Ubers.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>If Shadow Ball or Rock Slide doesn't appeal to you, Mew has just about every special attack under the sun to use to counter whatever you want to. Mew can also use Swords Dance with Earthquake or Explosion. There's also a myriad of other good moves available--some examples are Curse, Counter, and Thunder Wave. It's also possible to make any other combination of these, but in general the physical sweeper set is the most effective overall.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>There really isn't a sure-fire Mew counter, and that's why its Uber. Your best bet is probably Heracross, since he resists Submission and most Mew don't have Psychic or Fire Blast. If Mew doesn't have Psychic or Earthquake, then Muk stands to be a good counter too.</p>
