<p>Physical attacking moveset. Victreebel and even Vileplume pull this off better thanks to STAB on Sludge Bomb and better speed in Victreebel's case, though. You could use Moonlight to keep you at full health to Swords Dance more.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Giga Drain because of STAB. Reflect + Leech Seed could annoy Cursers and force them to Rest, allowing you to counter appropriately.</p>

[Opinion]

<p>Bellossom is a cool Pokemon. It has the pure Grass typing and can use both Stun Spore and Sleep Powder, unlike Meganium. In addition, it isn't weak to Rock Slide like Jumpluff and has good Special Defense unlike Tangela. Movepool is fairly limited, but that's a characteristic of most Grass Pokemon.</p>
