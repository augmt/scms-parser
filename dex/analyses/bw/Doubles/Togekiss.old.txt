[Overview]

<p>Togekiss is one of the best support Pokemon in the Doubles metagame. It has one of the largest array of support moves in its arsenal, including the unique combination of Follow Me and Tailwind. Togekiss's bulk is awesome, and it happens to be one of the most specially bulky users of Follow Me and Rage Powder. It's no slouch in the offensive department either, with a whopping base 120 Special Attack. Its typing is queer, having the ability to evade the common Earthquake. However, this renders it vulnerable to other common moves such as Blizzard and Rock Slide. Nonetheless, Togekiss is an extremely versatile Pokemon and should definitely be considered for a slot on your team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set invests in bulk in order to maximize sustainability for Togekiss, permitting it to set up multiple Tailwinds throughout the match. Tailwind is an obvious option to double the Speed of all your teammates for three turns, granting a tactical advantage that has been the staple of many Doubles cores. Air Slash is an option to deal with slower and bulkier threats, such as Cresselia, while your sweepers wreak havoc on the other opponent. It also boasts a 60% chance to flinch opponents, rendering them motionless for that turn. Follow Me is a great option to grant setup opportunities for your teammate, as it lures all the opponents' attacks onto Togekiss's giant bulk and keeps your teammate safe. Protect is a classic option in Doubles to defend Togekiss from attacks, possibly leaving your teammate free to attack the opponent or to shield it from multi-hit moves. Helping Hand is a wonderful option to grant a 50% power boost to your teammate, allowing it to deliver powerful blows to the opponents.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Speed EVs allow Togekiss to outspeed Cresselia, minimum Speed Rotom-W, and some faster Hitmontop variants. 248 HP EVs are used so Togekiss can attain an odd HP number to receive less damage from hail and sandstorm. The rest of the EVs are put into its already stellar Special Defense as an extra boost. 176 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed maximum Speed neutral base 70s, specifically Hitmontop and Ludicolo. 16 Defense EVs can be given to allow Togekiss to survive a Choice Band- or Helping Hand-boosted Rock Slide from Tyranitar. A Sitrus Berry is given instead of Leftovers as it is more useful in sand and hail, being able to restore 25% of Togekiss's health instead of being nullified by weather. Additionally, it is more helpful in allowing Togekiss to tank two attacks in a turn.</p>

<p>Togekiss usually aids teammates instead of having teammates aid it; it works well with powerful teammates with middling Speed such as Kyurem-B, Hydreigon, Breloom, Metagross, and more. Mold Breaker Excadrill is a great partner for Togekiss, with Follow Me to allow a Swords Dance boost; it can also use Earthquake freely, as Togekiss is immune to Ground-type attacks. Hitmontop is also a good partner thanks to Intimidate, helping to cover Togekiss's weaker Defense while providing Wide Guard support to protect Togekiss from Blizzards, Rock Slides and Discharges. Heracross and Mamoswine are also decent partners, having good synergy with Togekiss and appreciating Tailwind support. Heracross can defeat the Rock- and Ice-types that threaten Togekiss, while Mamoswine handles Electric- and Ice-types. Landorus-T can also be used, but has to beware of Blizzard.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Togekiss set works wonderfully on bulky offense teams due to its ability to Thunder Wave a majority of the opponents and slow them down for your sweepers. Air Slash is a great move in combination with Thunder Wave, granting the paraflinch combo. Not to mention Togekiss also has Serene Grace, being able to double the rate of flinching from Air Slash and therefore being able to keep the opponent immobile for longer. Follow Me is Togekiss's advantage over other Thunder Wave users such as Thundurus&mdash;the ability to lure attacks aimed at your partner and tank them with great special bulk is a huge selling point. Protect, as usual, is to defend Togekiss from attacks that are aimed at it. Helping Hand is a great move to give your partner a 50% power boost, allowing it to annihilate the already paralyzed opponents.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are specially tailored to allow Togekiss to survive a multitude of powerful attacks, namely Rock Gem Terrakion's Rock Slide, Dragon Gem Latios's Draco Meteor, Thundurus's Thunderbolt, and Choice Specs Rotom-W's Thunderbolt. The HP EVs are given an odd number in order to reduce damage taken from sandstorm and hail. A Sitrus Berry is used to grant greater longevity, helping Togekiss take two attacks in one turn and is overall more useful than Leftovers in this metagame.</p>

<p>Togekiss works great with bulky offensive Pokemon that benefit from opponents getting paralyzed, allowing them to go first and wreak havoc. These Pokemon include Metagross, Landorus-T, Heatran, and Kyurem-B. Hitmontop is once again a good partner with Intimidate to cover Togekiss's weaker Defense and can also use Wide Guard to protect Togekiss from the likes of Rock Slide, Blizzard, and Discharge.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Togekiss isn't only meant to function defensively; it can also go offensive thanks to its useful base 120 Special Attack. Tailwind is on the set in order to increase the Speed of the whole team, while Air Slash is for a reliable STAB and helpful flinches. Heat Wave is a good Fire-type move that can hit both opponents for decent damage and has a nice 30% chance to burn them. Aura Sphere is another reliable option to induce solid Fighting-type damage onto the opponent. Protect is useful in this instance to stall out Trick Room turns, while Helping Hand is good for boosting allies, especially when Togekiss's coverage is ineffective in that particular situation.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>208 HP EVs are used to give Togekiss an odd HP number to reduce damage from sandstorm and hail. 48 Speed EVs are given to allow Togekiss to outspeed 4 Speed base 85s, most notably Cresselia. Sitrus Berry is given to grant Togekiss greater longevity and to take more hits, while Flying Gem can give Togekiss a cool one-time damage boost. Fire Blast or Flamethrower can be used instead of Heat Wave for greater damage on individual opponents.</p>

<p>Good teammates should have good coverage in tandem with Togekiss so they can take out bulkier opponents such as Cresselia. Tyranitar and Chandelure are good choices in this regard, and also benefit from Tailwind. Mamoswine and Heracross are also good partners&mdash;Mamoswine has good coverage and enjoys the flinches that Togekiss deals onto the opponent, while Heracross enjoys the Helping Hand support which permits it to OHKO Cresselia, and also beats the Ice- and Rock-types that trouble Togekiss. Hitmontop's Intimidate comes in handy to cover up Togekiss's weaker Defense, and its Wide Guard support grants protection against Blizzard, Rock Slide, and Discharge.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Roost is a great option to heal yourself when necessary. Body Slam is also a great option for spreading paralysis as it bypasses Taunt. Togekiss can also run an interesting support set with dual screens, but is outclassed by Pokemon such as Cresselia in this regard. Tri Attack is usable for spreading debilitating status effects onto your opponent. Hyper Voice is Togekiss's strongest spread move and benefits from STAB, but its poor coverage is disappointing. ExtremeSpeed can catch opponents off guard, but has a poor damage output and thus is a waste of a moveslot. After You is an interesting option for speeding up your team, but has major limitations that prevent it from being effective. Togekiss can also function as a weather inducer with Sunny Day or Rain Dance, but the above sets are better. Togekiss also has other interesting moves such as Magic Coat, Encore, and Safeguard, but these function on a case-by-case basis.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Togekiss is weak to Blizzard and Discharge, and due to these moves being common in Doubles, Togekiss might have trouble finding turns to set up. Blizzard users include Abomasnow, Kyurem, and Rotom-F, while Discharge users include Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Thundurus. Taunt users that outspeed Togekiss, including Prankster users, can prevent Togekiss from using its support moves and render it helpless, barring the moderately powerful Air Slash. Rock Slide is also a threat to Togekiss, and thus it has to beware of users such as Tyranitar, Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Excadrill. Togekiss, like any other Tailwind user, is quite vulnerable to Trick Room, and thus steps should be taken to prevent it from being set on the field.</p>

<p>Common Electric Pokemon such as Zapdos are thorns in Togekiss's side, but might not necessarily OHKO it, allowing Togekiss to unleash a Tailwind or Thunder Wave before death. Rain-boosted Swift Swim users such as Kabutops can also outspeed Togekiss and deal heavy damage, and Sand Rush-boosted Excadrill can do the same. Steel-types are checks to Togekiss as they can handle Air Slash with ease, but are usually unable to stop Togekiss from playing its support role.</p>
