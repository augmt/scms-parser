[Overview]

<p>Although Heracross is often overlooked when team building, it has several advantages over many common Pokemon in the Doubles metagame. With an amazing offensive typing, a base 125 Attack stat paired with two 120 Base Power STAB moves, and an amazing ability, Heracross can easily be a top offensive threat. Though it hits really hard, it lacks speed. Only possessing a base 85 Speed stat is a problem that will always haunt Heracross. If you can use speed control moves such as Tailwind, Thunder Wave, and Icy Wind to help support it, Heracross will easily be the M.V.P of its team almost every game.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Heracross has one job and one job only, and that is to hit extremely hard. A Bug Gem boosted-Megahorn can OHKO a lot of Pokemon, such as Cresselia, 4 HP Kingdra, uninvested Politoed, and Tyranitar. If the Pokemon in question doesn't resist Megahorn, it will take major damage and might even get OHKOed. After picking up a KO by using one of the most powerful moves in the metagame in Megahorn, Moxie activates, giving Heracross an Attack boost to heighten the power of its already powerful attacks. Close Combat is used as Heracross's other STAB move, allowing it to hit Pokemon that resist Megahorn, such as Heatran and Ninetales, for heavy damage. Feint is used to help Heracross's partners, as it hits through Protect and makes the opposition vulnerable to another attack that turn. If Feint isn't appealing to you, however, Stone Edge can be used in the third moveslot; Stone Edge allows Heracross to hit Flying and Fire-type Pokemon that would otherwise be resistant or immune to its STAB combo, such as Chandelure and Volcarona, respectively. The final moveslot in this set goes to the most common move in Doubles, Protect: it is used to protect Heracross from Flying-type moves and powerful spread moves such as Rock Slide and Heat Wave while its partners dispose of the problem.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An alternate EV spread of 208 HP / 116 Atk / 48 SpD / 136 Spe can be used as well. It allows Heracross to survive hits such as a Choice Specs-boosted Thunderbolt from Thundurus-T and a Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor from Kingdra. The Attack EVs give Heracross enough power to OHKO Calm Cresselia with 116 Defense EVs 93% of the time. Finally, Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge to give Heracross a spread move; while it's not strong at first, after a boost or two from Moxie, Rock Slide becomes very powerful.</p>

<p>Heracross's base 85 Speed stat can hinder it at times, which is why Pokemon who can control speed are great assets for it. Pokemon such as Thundurus, Togekiss, and Cresselia can not only control speed, but can also remove Flying- and Fighting-types, which allows Heracross to reach its full potential. Due to Heracross being an all-out physical attacker, Defiant Pokemon such as Torandous and Bisharp make for good partners. Defiant discourages Intimidate-users from switching in, as Intimidate will actually give these Pokemon a boost, making it easy to take care of them. Faster Pokemon, such as Latios and Rotom-W, can also be used to remove Intimidate-users in addition to threats such as Victini and Volcarona. Heracross can also be used on a rain team; not only does rain halve its weakness to Fire-type attacks, but due to its amazing offensive coverage it can manage to defeat many common threats to rain such as Abomanow, Tyranitar, Gastrodon, Ferrothorn, and Cresselia. Kingdra in the rain can also remove Pokemon that directly threaten Heracross.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Megahorn
move 2: Close Combat

move 4: Earthquake
item: Choice Scarf

evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

<p>Heracross doesn't always have to be reliant on its teammates to be faster than the opponent. Choice Scarf gives Heracross a much needed boost in the Speed stat, allowing it to outspeed every non-Choice Scarf Pokemon in the metagame. Megahorn and Close Combat are the two main moves of the set, both of which are base 120 STAB moves, meaning that Heracross can hit opposing teams extremely hard. The choice between Rock Slide and Stone Edge is a hard one. Rock Slide is a spread move that will hit both opponents and has a chance to flinch, whereas Stone Edge isn't blocked by Wide Guard and has more power. Earthquake is used in the last slot because it's another spread move that allows Heracross to hit Pokemon such as Toxicroak for super effective damage while hitting the opponents as well. The only downfall to Earthquake is that it runs the risk of hitting Heracross's teammate as well. Finally, it's worth mentioning that this Heracross variant CANNOT OHKO the standard Cresselia.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Follow Me and Rage Powder support will allow Heracross to live longer and take advantage of the free hits its partner will give it. Pokemon such as Jirachi, Togekiss, and Amoongus are all good teammates because of this. Helping Hand, a move that will boost the attacking power of Heracross, can also be used to further support it. Cresselia, Politoed, and Togekiss can all use this move to great effect. Intimidate is going to be a problem because Heracross relies so heavily on physical attacks, so Pokemon with the ability Defiant can be used to discourage Pokemon with Intimidate from switching in freely. Faster teammates such as Latios and Rotom-W can be used to remove Intimidate-users as well as Pokemon such as Victini and Volcarona. Just like before, being on a rain team is also a viable option for Heracross, as it helps directly threaten many Pokemon that are a problem to rain; Pokemon such as Abomasnow, Gastordon, Tyranitar, Rotom-W, and Cresselia can all be easily removed by it.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There are many other interesting options that Heracross can put to use. Guts with a status orb is one of the main options, as it will instantly boost Herracross's Attack at the cost of residual damage. Night Slash and Pursuit can be used for a high critical hit chance and the ability to catch switching opponents, respectively. Bug Bite, while having half the power of Megahorn, can be used as a niche move to dispose of opponents' berries, such as Cresselia's Sitrus Berry or Chesto Berry. Swords Dance can be used as a boosting move for Heracross, but it's harder to pull off in the Doubles Metagame in comparison to singles. Heracross can also use a gimmicky combination in Endure, Salac Berry, and Reversal, giving it an extremely powerful STAB move, but be aware this would take a lot of support to pull off. Finally, Heracross can do more than attack: it can also support its teammates. Helping Hand is a option to help boost its teammates attacking power, and Sleep Talk can be used to make Heracross a sleep absorber, taking sleep-inducing moves from Pokemon such as Amoongus.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Heracross's main problem comes in the form of Intimidate users. Hitmontop, Gyarados, Salamence, and Landorus-T are all problems that it doesn't like to face, with the latter three being able to come in and lower Heracross's Attack while resisting its dual STAB combination. Pokemon such as Thundurus and Togekiss that can paralyze it are also major issues. Heracross cannot afford to have its Speed be lowered.</p>

<p>Pokemon that are immune or resist Heracross's STAB moves and can OHKO back are bad news. Heracross can't actually touch Jellicent and Chandelure if it doesn't have Stone Edge or Rock Slide. Pokemon such as Latios and Volcarona can outspeed Heracross and OHKO with one of their STAB moves. Toxicroak, being resistant to both of Heracross's STABs, can hard-wall any variant of Heracross that doesn't carry Earthquake. Priority-using Pokemon, such as Scizor and Breloom, can easily revenge kills Heracross after a couple of Defense drops. Any Pokemon carrying a Flying-type move has a reason to bring worry to Heracross. Crobat, Tornadus, Landorus, Togekiss, Hidden Power Flying Salamence and Thundurus can all OHKO Heracross without taking much damage. Finally, Pokemon such Dusknoir, Dusclops, and Sableye are all immune to Close Combat and don't take much from Megahorn; they can also burn Heracross and severely hinder its sweeping ability.</p>
