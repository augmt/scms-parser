[Overview]

<p>Even though Hitmontop has had a mediocre reputation in singles throughout all generations, its movepool and ability make it perfect for Doubles. With access to Intimidate, Fake Out, and Wide Guard, Hitmontop is the master of creating free turns. It can switch in on the majority of physical attackers in the tier, and proceed to immobilize the more threatening half of the opposition for a turn; Hitmontop is also able to break Protect with Feint and shut down spread moves with Wide Guard. It does not end here, for Hitmontop's Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combat allows it to OHKO Chople Berry Tyranitar, Heatran, and Kingdra; the move also deals heavy damage to almost anything that doesn't resist it, allowing Hitmontop to fill the role of a supporter and a powerful attacker with the same moveset, increasing its versatility.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When it comes to shutting down physical attackers in Doubles, Hitmontop is one of the best due to its access to the notorious combination of Intimidate and Fake Out. This moveset allows Hitmontop to effectively utilize its access to Intimidate, Fake Out, and Close Combat to the fullest extent. Thanks to the Fighting Gem, Close Combat will be hitting hard, even off of Hitmontop's below average base 95 Attack stat. Feint is useful for breaking the ever so common Protect, allowing Hitmontop's partner to snipe down the cowardly Pokemon. Sucker Punch is a good alternate option, as it lets Hitmontop pick off weakened threats; it also forms the extremely effective Fighting + Dark coverage along with Close Combat, and is especially useful for hitting Latios and Latias hard. In the last spot, Wide Guard is usually the preferred option, as it lets Hitmontop create protect itself and its teammate from Blizzards, Rock Slides and Surfs. Teammates weak to these common spread moves love the support it can provide; however, if you don't feel comfortable with Wide Guard or if your team isn't weak to spread moves at all, Detect is a great option. Detect is used over Protect because it stops Hitmontop from being hampered by the combination of Protect + Imprison.</p>

<p>The EVs allow Hitmontop to outspeed standard Rotom-W whilst optimizing its attacking prowess. The rest of its EVs are invested into HP to utilize its decent bulk and access to Intimidate. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe could be used to completely optimize Hitmontop's bulk, but missing out on Rotom-W and things slower than it is usually not worth the extra bulk. If you want Hitmontop to last longer, Sitrus Berry is a viable option, but Hitmontop loves to fire off a powerful first hit, making Fighting Gem the better option.</p>

<p>Almost any Pokemon can use the massive support that comes from Intimidate and Fake Out, making Hitmontop really easy to fit on a lot of teams. A noteworthy partner that works wonders alongside Hitmontop is Quiver Dance Volcarona; the combination of Fake Out and Wide Guard will help shield Volcarona from its despised spread weaknesses to Rock Slide and Surf.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set lets Hitmontop survive hits that would otherwise OHKO a more offensive variant. You will often see Hitmontop switch in many times in a match and immobilize the opposition for at least a turn, aiming to provide as many free turns as possible for a teammate to dish out damage or set up with moves such as Trick Room, Tailwind, or even Quiver Dance, in Volcarona's case. Fake Out and Close Combat are obligatory, as they prevent the foe from moving for a turn and dish out heavy damage respectively. When it comes to choosing between Feint and Helping Hand, you really should consider what fits your team best. Feint is a great option if you have problems with offensive Pokemon that like to use Protect, as it can expose unsuspecting victims, such as Deoxys-A, that feel they're safe behind a Protect. Helping Hand is awesome for Pokemon that like to use spread moves, as it easily patches up the 25% power drop, even boosting the moves past their normal base power.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With the given spread, Hitmontop will be able to take both Psyshock and Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor from Latios, whilst healing a portion of its health back up with the Sitrus Berry. The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack to hit things harder with Close Combat. You could alternatively try shifting the EVs from Attack to Special Defense, just to have overall better bulk after Intimidate. This new spread would be 252 HP / 64 Def / 192 SpD; however, the extra attack could prove useful against Pokemon weak to Close Combat, such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Terrakion.</p>

<p>As this set revolves more around supporting teammates, Hitmontop is now the optimal Volcarona partner if Hitmontop has Helping Hand, as Volcarona can do tons of damage with Helping Hand-boosted +1 STAB Heat Wave. This Hitmontop also pairs extremely well with Substitute + Protect Heatran, as Hitmontop can block incoming Earthquakes with Wide Guard whilst using Fake Out to create a free turn to set up a Substitute. Other than that, Hitmontop generally supports almost any Pokemon extremely well, especially with its newfound bulk.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Almost all of Hitmontop's other options don't really shine in Doubles. You could, of course, run some extremely situational items, such as Coba Berry for Flying-types on the bulky set or Dark Gem on the offensive set to KO Latios, but item-wise, Hitmontop usually won't utilize anything as consistently as Fighting Gem or Sitrus Berry. Stone Edge can be used specifically to hit Flying-types, such as Zapdos and Thundurus, who would otherwise give Hitmontop a lot of trouble. A spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe is also usable to avoid other Hitmontop's Fake Outs, whilst catching Pokemon such as Breloom off guard with a Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combat.</p>

<p>A completely different set would be a priority attacking set with Life Orb and Technician. It takes a completely different approach to using Hitmontop, and could provide strong Fake Outs and Mach Punches, which, when used alongside Sucker Punch, would create perfect neutral priority coverage. This would of course, mean that Hitmontop would have to give up Intimidate, and because Intimidate is one of the best abilities in the metagame, it would be a harsh loss to suffer.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Perhaps Hitmontop's biggest problem is sturdy, hard-hitting Flying-types with STAB moves. Zapdos or Thundurus carrying Hidden Power Flying will severely damage Hitmontop, and Hitmontop cannot do much in return bar hitting them with the rare Stone Edge. Even if it has Stone Edge, it won't be able to OHKO Zapdos, and only has a 12.5% chance to OHKO 4 HP / 0 Def Thundurus. Defiant Tornadus is the most problematic Flying-type, considering it not only ignores Intimidate, but gains a boost from it, allowing it to easily OHKO Hitmontop with Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. Bisharp will make the Hitmontop user think twice about switching it in, as Bisharp also has access to Defiant. Bulky Psychic-types, such as Cresselia, Jirachi, and Metagross, will also be able to completely stop Hitmontop in its tracks, whilst usually 2HKOing in return. Ghost-types with Will-O-Wisp, Dusclops and Jellicent, can prove to be a living hell for Hitmontop, as there is no way Hitmontop can touch them. The presence of Ghost- and Psychic-types alone will usually allow said Pokemon to take advantage of the team spot that is now filled with dead weight.</p>
