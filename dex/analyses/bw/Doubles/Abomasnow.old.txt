[Overview]

<p>Abomasnow seems lackluster at first glance, but it is actually a large threat in the Doubles metagame. Its key to success is its ability, Snow Warning. This allows it to be a great check to opposing weather teams, robbing Pokemon such as Kingdra and Excadrill of their respective weathers. Its STABs are also great offensively, providing good neutral coverage and allowing it to easily dispatch the two most common weather inducers in the tier, Politoed and Tyranitar. Defensively, its resistance to Water-type attacks allows it to be a thorn in the side of most rain teams. Furthermore, Snow Warning grants it access to perfectly accurate Blizzards, allowing it to be pose an even bigger offensive threat. However, it is also left weak to many common attacking types and spread moves. This makes Abomasnow difficult to keep alive, as those weaknesses can be easily exploited. Abomasnow does have its fair share of flaws, but its excellent ability and unique set of assets more than make up for this, making it a Pokemon that should be considered for many teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With this set, Abomasnow can stay alive longer in order to keep hail up. It can also act as a good check to common weather sweepers such as Excadrill and Ludicolo. Blizzard is the main attacking move here due to the fact that it is both very powerful and a spread move, letting Abomasnow hit both opposing Pokemon hard. In addition, Blizzard has good neutral coverage, so it is easy to spam. Giga Drain is a good secondary STAB move, as it allows Abomasnow to hit bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent and Politoed. The recovery from Giga Drain is a nice bonus to grant more longevity and potentially allow Abomasnow to put itself back in Focus Sash range. Grass Knot is a nice alternative to hit heavier Pokemon such as Tyranitar for more damage, although the lack of recovery is unfortunate. Ice Shard is a useful option to pick off weakened Pokemon and somewhat makes up for Abomasnow's low Speed, while Hidden Power Fire is a great option to roast Scizor, Metagross, and opposing Abomasnow. The former in particular will otherwise switch into Abomasnow without worry.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Focus Sash is used so that Abomasnow can survive any attack at full health. A Quiet nature is the main option because it makes Abomasnow slower than most weather inducers, which lets it put up hail turn one. In addition, it allows Abomasnow to be a nice check to Trick Room teams. However, if you'd rather have the additional Speed, you could use a Modest nature instead. Hidden Power Rock is an option to hit Volcarona, who otherwise has nothing to fear from Abomasnow. However, Abomasnow is not a very reliable check, as Volcarona can easily outspeed and KO it. It is also a very niche option and won't be needed very often, as outside of Fire-types, Hidden Power Rock and Blizzard have redundant coverage.</p>

<p>Due to Abomasnow's poor Speed, Trick Room setters such as Cresselia and Slowking make for great partners, forming a devastating HailRoom combination that can quickly dismantle unprepared teams with Blizzard. Psychic- and Ghost-types are great options to set up Trick Room, as they can also cover up Abomasnow's Fighting weakness. Hitmontop makes for an amazing partner as it has access to Wide Guard, shielding Abomasnow from Rock Slides and Heat Waves that would otherwise deal heavy damage to it. Hitmontop's Fighting-type STAB also lets it threaten Rock-types, such as Tyranitar, and Steel-types, such as Heatran, that can cause problems for this set. Heatran and Chandelure make great partners for this set as they can discourage the opponent from using Fire-type attacks that would otherwise spell the end of Abomasnow. They can also defeat the Steel-types that resist both of Abomasnow's STAB moves and can KO Abomasnow in return. Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune make for nice partners, as they can defeat Pokemon that threaten Abomasnow such as Scizor, Heatran, and Tyranitar. In return, Abomasnow can eliminate Gastrodon. Other Blizzard users such as Kyurem and Rotom-F make for good partners as well, as they can provide the pieces for a deadly BlizzSpam strategy.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Wood Hammer
move 2: Blizzard
move 3: Ice Shard / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Protect
item: Grass Gem
ability: Snow Warning
nature: Brave
evs: 64 HP / 124 Atk / 68 Def / 252 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The main goal of this set is to use raw power to eliminate opposing weather setters and win the weather war quickly. Wood Hammer is the main draw of this set, and thanks to its high Base Power, it can deal huge amounts of damage to Pokemon such as Politoed and Tyranitar. Although a special attack might seem more practical, Wood Hammer has the advantage of circumventing Tyranitar's Special Defense boost from sandstorm, allowing it to do more damage than special alternatives would. Blizzard is used as a secondary STAB move, and it is a great attacking option thanks to its high Base Power and the ability to hit both opposing Pokemon. It is also nice because it has great type coverage with Wood Hammer, taking out Flying-types that resist the move. Ice Shard is a nice option in the third slot to pick off weakened Pokemon and somewhat mitigate Abomasnow's low Speed. However, Hidden Power Fire is another great option to hit Steel-types, such as Scizor and Metagross, that can quickly become a problem for Abomasnow. It also allows Abomasnow to take out opposing Abomasnow, which is a nice bonus.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Grass Gem is used on this set because it allows Abomasnow to net some important KOs with Wood Hammer, such as an OHKO on Politoed and Tyranitar, the two most common weather setters. Although the EV spread seems complicated, it serves a very specific purpose: 124 Attack in conjunction with a Brave nature allows Abomasnow to OHKO Tyranitar and Politoed with a Grass Gem-boosted Wood Hammer. The HP and Defense EVs allow Abomasnow to survive both a Rock Slide and a Low Kick from Tyranitar. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to power up Blizzard. Brave is used over Adamant so as not to reduce the power of Blizzard. It also ensures Abomasnow is generally slower than most opposing weather setters, so it can swiftly KO them with Wood Hammer and keep hail up.</p>

<p>Other Blizzard users such as Kyurem and Rotom-F make for excellent partners to this set, as they can take advantage of Abomasnow's ability to get rid of opposing weather setters by spamming STAB-boosted Blizzards and heavily damaging opposing teams. Hitmontop is also a great partner, as Wide Guard support is appreciated with Abomasnow lacking any way to survive deadly spread moves such as Heat Wave and Rock Slide. The fact that Hitmontop has Feint is also great to get a surprise KO on Politoed and Tyranitar that think that they are safe by simply Protecting. Chandelure and Heatran are nice partners, as they can dissuade opposing Pokemon from using Fire-type attacks thanks to their Flash Fire ability. Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune make for good partners as well, as they can handle the Rock-, Fire-, and Steel-types that can give Abomasnow trouble; in return Abomasnow can quickly KO Gastrodon, who is a large nuisance to them. Thanks to its low Speed, Abomasnow partners well with Trick Room setters such as Cresselia and Slowking to utilize a HailRoom strategy that can be very difficult for the opponent to fight. Most Trick Room setters also either resist or are immune to Fighting-type attacks, so they can take on the Fighting-types that trouble Abomasnow.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Blizzard
move 2: Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Ground
move 3: Giga Drain / Grass Knot
move 4: Ice Shard
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Snow Warning
nature: Timid
evs: 28 Def / 228 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a Choice Scarf equipped and maximum Speed investment, Abomasnow is able to reach 360 Speed, allowing it to outspeed fast sweepers such as Tornadus and Latios and dispatch of them. Blizzard is the main attacking move here, being an excellent move to be locked into thanks to its amazing neutral coverage, great power, and the ability to hit both opposing Pokemon at once. Hidden Power Fire is a good option to dispatch Scizor and Genesect. However, if these Pokemon are not concerning to you, Hidden Power Ground is a good option to hit Heatran and Chandelure, who would otherwise be massive threats to Abomasnow. Giga Drain is a good secondary STAB move to hit bulky Water-types, such as Politoed, that would otherwise not be bothered by Abomasnow's attacks. The fact that Giga Drain recovers some HP is a nice bonus as well. Grass Knot is an alternative to hit heavier Pokemon, such as Jellicent and Tyranitar, for more damage. Ice Shard is a good option to pick off faster Pokemon such as Shaymin-S, as even with a Choice Scarf equipped, Abomasnow still isn't that fast.</p>

<p>This set has a nice surprise value, as Pokemon such as Latios and Tornadus will often attempt to OHKO Abomasnow, only to be outsped and OHKOed themselves. In addition, this set is a nice check to dangerous weather sweepers such as Kingdra and Excadrill, as it can remove their preferred weather, outspeed them, and hit them for nice damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>28 EVs are put into Defense to allow Abomasnow to survive both a Bullet Punch from Scizor and a Steel Gem-boosted Bullet Punch from Metagross, and the remaining EVs are put into Speed and Special Attack. A Modest nature might be appealing to grant Abomasnow more power, but Timid is necessary to outspeed Latios and Tornadus. Light Screen is an interesting option in order to give Abomasnow's partner more special bulk in a pinch, letting it survive hits it otherwise might not. However, being locked into Light Screen will quickly become problematic for Abomasnow. Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Volcarona, but it is very situational and outside of targeting Fire-types, Hidden Power Rock gets redundant coverage with Blizzard.</p>

<p>Because this set has a harder time winning weather wars than its other sets, Pokemon that can take on Ninetales and Tyranitar, namely Terrakion, Garchomp, and Rotom-W, make for great partners. Heatran and Chandelure make for good partners to discourage the opponent from using Fire-type moves, which otherwise can easily eliminate Abomasnow. Other Blizzard users such as Kyurem and Rotom-F make for great partners to this set, as together they can form an effective BlizzSpam core.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A Substitute set can be useful to shield Abomasnow from Pokemon looking to KO it, but due to its slew of weaknesses, it can be difficult to find the time to set up a Substitute. Leech Seed can be useful to give Abomasnow gradual recovery as well as stacking residual damage with hail, but Leech Seed stalling isn't as effective in Doubles as it is in Singles. Earthquake is an option to hit Steel- and Fire-types for super effective damage; however, due to the fact that it lacks STAB and has its damage reduced due to being a spread move, it can be problematic. In addition, the fact that it would also hit Abomasnow's partner can make it difficult to use at times. Ice Beam is an option to allow Abomasnow to reliably hit Pokemon with an Ice-type STAB move when hail isn't up, but this option is rather situational and it is usually better to just run Blizzard. Icy Wind can be used to provide speed control for the rest of your team, but Abomasnow is usually better off leaving that to a teammate. Focus Blast can be useful on special attacking sets to hit non-Chople Berry Tyranitar harder than Giga Drain, as well as hitting Pokemon such as Heatran, Bisharp, and Kyurem super effectively. An Ice Gem is a nice way to power up Blizzard, doing large amounts of damage to anything it hits neutrally. Finally, a set utilizing Expert Belt can be a nice option to power up Abomasnow's coverage moves and net additional KOs.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fire-types such as Ninetales, Heatran, Chandelure, Victini, and Volcarona make for great counters, as they resist all of Abomasnow's commonly used moves and can easily KO it with STAB-boosted Fire-type attacks. Heatran and Volcarona are especially threatening, as they can easily set up a Substitute or a Quiver Dance, respectively, while Abomasnow is on the field. Jirachi makes a great check as it resists both of Abomasnow's STAB moves, is difficult for Abomasnow to wear down, and can use Follow Me to redirect its attacks and thus limit its usefulness. Metagross, Bisharp, Genesect, and Scizor also resist both of Abomasnow's STAB attacks and can deal large amounts of damage back with their Steel-type attacks. However, they must all watch out for Hidden Power Fire, especially Scizor. Fighting-types such as Hitmontop, Scrafty, Conkeldurr, and Terrakion also make good checks to Abomasnow, as they can easily threaten it with their Fighting-type attacks. Hitmontop and Conkeldurr are especially threatening, because they can use Wide Guard to shield both themselves and their partners from Abomasnow's Blizzard. Offensive Cresselia can take any of Abomasnow's hits and KO it with Hidden Power Fire. Tornadus easily outspeeds Abomasnow and can maul it with Acrobatics, although it has to watch out for Ice Shard and the Choice Scarf set. Rock Slide users such as Tyranitar and Excadrill can deal significant damage to Abomasnow, though if it lives through the hit, it is capable of doing a lot of damage to them in return.</p>
