[Overview]

<p>Scizor might not hold the spot of a top threat in Doubles that it holds in Singles, but it remains a powerful adversary nonetheless. A great Bug / Steel typing allows Scizor to switch into common attacks in the Doubles metagame, such as Draco Meteor and Blizzard. Access to a Technician-boosted Bullet Punch allows Scizor to heavily damage several threats before they can attack, such as Mamoswine and Kyurem-B. Furthermore, a powerful Technician-boosted Bug Bite allows it to tear down Cresselia, and it fits well on rain teams since Bug Bite can also take down Tyranitar and Abomasnow. To top things off, Scizor can provide support for its team in numerous ways, such as setting up Tailwind or breaking Protect with Feint. It can also go all-out offensive with its classic Swords Dance set.</p>

<p>However, a lot of factors hold Scizor back. The great resistances that its typing provides are offset by a mediocre Special Defense. A lack of coverage options outside of Superpower means that Fire-type threats can easily dispose of it. Its attacks often lack enough power to get key OHKOs without a boost. Finally, it has a low 65 base Speed, which means Speed control, such as Icy Wind, is a must if you want to make the most of it. Fortunately for Scizor, these setbacks do not change the fact that its useful Bug / Steel typing allows it to check some of the top threats in the Doubles metagame, such as Cresselia, Tyranitar, and Latios.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set makes the most of Scizor's bulk and power. Bullet Punch provides Scizor with a very powerful priority attack and can deal a lot of damage to a wide array of threats, such as Tyranitar and Kyurem-B. The second slot can be filled with a number of options. Feint is one of the best, as it allows Scizor to break through Protect, easing prediction and putting the opposition in a tough spot. Superpower is another option, providing useful coverage against Steel-types, particularly Heatran. Bug Bite is a very interesting move, as it steals and eats berries. This means that Scizor can heal itself if the opponent is carrying a Sitrus Berry, remove type-resisting berries from numerous Pokemon, and so on. Protect is in the fourth slot as expected, allowing Scizor to stall while its partner takes out a potential threat.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Steel Gem is the preferred item, increasing the power of Bullet Punch so that Scizor can take out a lot of weakened threats before they can attack. Occa Berry is also an option, however, as it allows Scizor to survive weaker Fire-type attacks, such as Hidden Power Fire from various threats and an unboosted Hydreigon's Flamethrower, but don't expect Occa Berry Scizor to tank stronger Fire-type attacks, as attacks like Modest Heatran's Heat Wave will still OHKO more than half of the time. U-turn is an option over Bug Bite, as it eases prediction and provides a safe switch-in thanks to Scizor's low base Speed, but it comes at the cost of a lot of power. Acrobatics is an option for the second slot, as it can take out a large array of threats, notably Volcarona, Amoonguss, Breloom, and Hitmontop. However, note that a Flying Gem is more or less required for the item should you choose to run Acrobatics. Aerial Ace accomplishes feats similar to those of Acrobatics, but with a huge loss of power in exchange for the ability to reliably run other items.</p>

<p>This set can function effectively on almost any team, but it works to its best potential on bulkier teams because it can snipe fast and frail opponents with Bullet Punch. Trick Room setters, such as Jellicent and Cresselia, make for helpful teammates, as Trick Room can patch up Scizor's lacking Speed. If you opt to run something other than Superpower in the second slot, answers to Steel-types, such as Heatran and Conkeldurr, make for nice partners. Heatran in particular is a great partner, as it can absorb Fire-type attacks intended for Scizor. Mamoswine is a great partner as well, as it synergizes with Scizor offensively and its STAB attacks can help deal with Fire-type attackers, Landorus-T, Thundurus, Zapdos, and Thundurus-T, all of which give Scizor a lot of trouble. Similarly, Rotom-W can handle the majority of Scizor's counters, including Fire-types, Water-types, Gyarados, and Landorus-T. Latios works well with Scizor, as its Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor can OHKO a lot of Pokemon that threaten Scizor, including Landorus-T, Gyarados, Zapdos, Hitmontop, and Thundurus-T. Latios particularly enjoys this set's Feint support, which allows it to spam Draco Meteor with less risk. Finally, Thundurus-T can handle Water-types and Hitmontop, which give Scizor a lot of trouble.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set works simply: set up Swords Dance if given the opportunity, then proceed to kill as many Pokemon as possible. However, while Scizor's attacks are powerful after a Swords Dance, its low Speed and lack of sufficient bulk mean that you will need a lot of support to pull off a sweep of any kind. Bullet Punch is Scizor's best priority option, and can deal heavy damage to threats such as Tyranitar. Bug Bite is Scizor's best Bug-type STAB option and consumes any berry that its target might be holding. Protect rounds off the set, allowing Scizor to stall while its partner eliminates any threats to Scizor.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Steel Gem is the preferred item, as a Steel Gem-boosted Bullet Punch is going to hurt, especially after a Swords Dance. Occa Berry is also an option, allowing Scizor to survive a weaker Fire-type attack such as an unboosted Flamethrower from Hydreigon. Note that even with an Occa Berry, attacks like Heatran's Heat Wave will still OHKO most of the time, so don't expect Scizor to endure stronger Fire-type attacks. Lum Berry is also plausible, as it will allow Scizor to avoid nasty paralysis, sleep, or burns.</p>

<p>This set functions best on bulky teams, especially those that can provide the support needed in order to pull off a sweep. While its attacks are powerful after a Swords Dance boost, they have poor coverage, so partners that can take out Steel- and Fire-types, such as Landorus-T and Heatran, will be needed to make the most of Scizor's abilities. Mamoswine makes a great partner for Scizor, synergizing well with it offensively and taking out numerous Pokemon that can counter it, including Fire-types, Thundurus, Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Thundurus-T. Rotom-W is also useful for taking out threats such as Landorus-T and Heatran, as well as Gyarados and other Water-types. Thundurus-T can handle Water-types and Hitmontop, both of which give Scizor grief. This set also loves Speed control, such as Trick Room or Tailwind, since it allows Scizor to patch up its lackluster Speed and kill an opposing Pokemon with Bug Bite before it can attack. This set also enjoys Follow Me support; Togekiss in particular works very well with Scizor, drawing in attacks with Follow Me and setting up Tailwind for Scizor so that it can attack first. However, note that Follow Me will not help against Heat Wave.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Scizor has a considerable number of other options to play with. Choice Band can provide it with as much power as possible, at the cost of Protect and locking you into a move, which makes it inferior to a Steel Gem or Bug Gem in most cases. Life Orb can provide consistent power without the drawbacks of Choice Band, but the recoil really puts a damper on Scizor's bulk. Natural Gift can be used alongside Occa Berry, as factoring in Technician, you will get a one-time 90 Base Power Fire-type attack. This is useful for hitting opposing Scizor and Ferrothorn harder, and still retains sufficient power against other Steel-types bar Heatran. Pursuit can also be used, as you can potentially deal a lot of damage to opponents like Cresselia that attempt to switch out. Roost can heal you, potentially extending longetivity, but Doubles is usually too fast-paced for such a move to ever pay off. Finally, Scizor can run Tailwind, preferably on a set with a bulkier spread. However, an offensive spread with Tailwind is also viable, since Scizor really benefits from the Tailwind boost and the extra power allows it to dish out heavy damage.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fire-types, especially Chandelure, Rotom-H, and Heatran, wall Scizor inside and out, and can easily roast it with their STAB Fire-type attacks. However, Heatran must be wary of Superpower. Intimidate weakens Scizor's offensive potential even further; Gyarados and Landorus-T in particular really ruin Scizor's day, as they both resist Bug Bite and Gyarados also resists Bullet Punch. Fast Water-types&mdash; Swift Swim abusers in particular&mdash; can put a hole in the bug with their Rain-boosted STAB attacks. Bulky Jellicent also gains a special mention, as it resists Scizor's STAB moves and can burn it with Scald or Will-O-Wisp. Thundurus and Zapdos resist both of Scizor's STAB attacks and can easily set up Tailwind, spam Thunder Wave, or simply take Scizor out with their attacks. Additionally, both sleep and burn cripple Scizor, making it an easy target to take out; just be careful around the Swords Dance set, as it occasionally runs Lum Berry. Scizor, in general, is not very bulky compared to other Steel-types, so as long as it doesn't pack a super effective attack you should be able to deal more damage to it than it does to you.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Swords Dance set can be handled by good prediction and use of Protect, as it can only attack one target at a time. Taunt can also stop Scizor from using both Swords Dance and Protect, which makes it very ineffective.</p>
