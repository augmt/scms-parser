[Overview]

<p>Latias is outclassed in most roles that it can perform in Doubles due to the omnipresent Psychic-types, Cresselia and Latios. Cresselia usually pulls off a support role better courtesy of its mind boggling bulk, something Latias can only dream of rivaling. Latios, on the other hand, largely outclasses Latias as an offensive Pokemon, due to its higher Special Attack stat. That said, thanks to its good bulk, useful resistances to common attacking types&mdash;Water, Fire, Electric, and Fighting&mdash;and Speed, Latias is one of the best Tailwind setters in the metagame.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With this set, Latias pieces together all of its positive traits to make the most out of itself as a fast supporter in the Doubles metagame. Tailwind is a fantastic support move, helping your team wreak havoc throughout the four turns that it lasts without fear of getting outpaced, but Thunder Wave is a perfectly viable alternative that permanently affects a Pokemon on the opponent's team's Speed. Draco Meteor might seem odd on a support Pokemon, and Dragon Pulse looks a bit more appealing on paper, but Draco Meteor provides fantastic utility by being able to OHKO many popular Dragon-types in Doubles and makes sure Latias can perform an alternative role as opposed to just being a fully support-oriented Pokemon.</p>

<p>To show the benefit of using Draco Meteor over Dragon Pulse, here are some important damage calculations:</p>

<ul="damage_calculation">
<li>Draco Meteor vs. 4 / 0 Salamence: 119.27 - 140.96%</li>
<li>Draco Meteor vs. 4 / 0 Hydreigon: 109.2 - 129.44%</li>
<li>Draco Meteor vs. 4 / 0 Garchomp: 104.46 - 124.02%</li>
<li>Draco Meteor vs. 0 / 4 Latios: 100.33 - 118.27%</li>
</ul>

<p>The third slot is another move that prevents Latias from becoming dead weight after using Tailwind or Draco Meteor. Helping Hand is extremely useful, as it can boost Latias's teammates' moves after Tailwind has been set up, helping it fill the role of a supporter more effectively. Protect is very useful in the last slot for playing mindgames and is a general staple on many Pokemon in Doubles, but because Latias is as bulky as it is, Protect is not nearly as necessary as it would be on an offensive Pokemon. Psyshock is another viable option, as it hits common Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Breloom for solid damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given spread allows Latias to use its amazing Speed tier to outpace key threats such as Terrakion, Salamence, and Garchomp. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD might look appealing for additional bulk, but Latias's Speed is what really sets it apart from Cresselia, and it is much harder to set Tailwind or use Thunder Wave if Latias is slow. Sitrus Berry is the main item, as it helps with Latias's overall longevity, but Haban Berry helps it deal with opposing Dragon-types much more effectively, as it can survive any Dragon-type attack and retaliate by either setting up Tailwind or hitting back hard with a Draco Meteor. Dragon Pulse could work over Draco Meteor, but it misses out on the important OHKOs listed above. Psychic is an option to hit Pokemon such as Breloom and Landorus-T for more damage, but Psyshock hits most Pokemon harder due to the metagame being more specially defensive in general.</p>

<p>First and foremost when it comes to picking teammates, know that anything with middling to high Speed appreciates the speed control support from Latias. Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Heracross, and Victini are all good Pokemon to use on Tailwind teams and should therefore be considered for use alongside Latias. Even more notable Pokemon under this category are Ground-types that benefit from Tailwind. Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine are all fantastic teammates, as they can freely use Earthquake due to Latias's immunity to it. Steel-types synergize extremely well with Latias, as they resist attacks that hit Latias for super effective damage, so Pokemon such as Scizor and Metagross are good teammates as well. Finally, teams weak to sun and rain appreciate the presence of Latias, as its presence alone will be a thorn in the side of those archetypes.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>If you could describe Latias's movepool with a single word, it would be 'colossal'. That said, even with plenty of attacking and supportive options, there are few if any combinations Latias can use as effectively as the moves listed on the main set. There are two item options worth mentioning though: Yache Berry and Dragon Gem. Yache Berry is fairly self-explanatory; it helps Latias in countering Blizzard teams and taking Ice-type attacks comfortably in general. Dragon Gem, on the other hand, seems like complete madness, but because Latias secures OHKOs on Breloom, Kyurem-B, and Chandelure with it, it is a perfectly viable option if you wish to fling an extra hard-hitting Draco Meteor in your opponent's direction.</p>

<p>As Latias is first and foremost a supporter, additional moves that help it support naturally get the first mentions. Icy Wind can be used as a different form of speed control, but it is often better used by more bulky Pokemon such as Cresselia. Heal Pulse is an interesting option that lets Latias heal a teammate, but should be used with caution; it will hit the opponent if your teammate goes down. Safeguard also deserves a mention, as it prevents the opponent from repeatedly using Thunder Wave, which is usually one of Tailwind's worst enemies. Reflect and Light Screen seem great for Latias on paper, but it is no Cresselia, and therefore has a hard time setting said screens up. Sunny Day and Rain Dance are options to help either support your weather team or disrupt problematic opposing weather teams. Role Play can also help perform this, as well as copying useful abilities such as Intimidate, but it is generally hard to consistently use effectively due to the move's gimmicky nature. Magic Coat is useful for bouncing back Taunt and Thunder Wave, but it is very situational. Swagger can be used in tandem with a teammate carrying a Lum Berry to boost its Attack for free; it can also be used to disrupt the opposition, but relying on coin flips is usually a terrible idea.</p>

<p>Latias can also pack a punch, so a fully offensive spread with 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe and a Timid nature is viable due to Latias having more bulk than Latios. The main moves for this set would be Draco Meteor, Psyshock, Hidden Power Fire, and Protect. Thunderbolt and Thunder could also be used to hit many bulky Water-types hard, and Grass Knot and Energy Ball could do the same against different Water-types. You could also opt to use Psychic over Psyshock, but because most Pokemon in Doubles invest in Special Defense rather than Defense, Psyshock hits most targets harder. Finally, Latias's humongous list of other options ends with a rather peculiar option: Mist Ball. This move works as a STAB move and a pseudo-Snarl at the same time, but Psyshock is a more consistent STAB Psychic-type attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Steel-types, such as Metagross and Bisharp, have no trouble walling Latias's attacks and can do a good amount of damage in return. Bug-types, such as Heracross, Genesect, and Scizor, can easily KO it with their STAB moves, and in Volcarona's case, even set up on Latias. Thundurus and Tornadus are problematic if Latias needs to set up Tailwind, as they can both Taunt it, the latter also being able to deal a big number with Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. Another huge problem for Latias is bulky or fast Dark-types, such as Tyranitar and Weavile, as they can take it out with a STAB move of choice. Most Trick Room setters can both wall Latias and undermine its speed control, especially bulky setters such as Cresselia and Dusclops. Chandelure succeeds in both setting up Trick Room and dealing super effective damage, making it one of the big thorns in Latias's side. Latios will win against Latias if it gets lucky; it needs to win the Speed tie and hope that Latias doesn't carry Haban Berry, but if the situation is so, Latias gets OHKOed easily by Draco Meteor, boosted or not. Finally, Sableye is a Pokemon that will make Latias rip its (non-existent) hair out, due to its ability to shut Latias down with Taunt and burn the potential physical attackers standing at its side.</p>
