[Overview]

<p>Mamoswine is a very underrated threat in the Doubles metagame. Its wonderful dual Ice- and Ground-type STAB attacks can defeat a plethora of common doubles threats, such as Latios, Heatran, Thundurus, and Landorus-T. This is improved even further by the fact that Mamoswine's STAB attacks also provide it with both spread and priority in Earthquake and Ice Shard, respectively. To top it all off, its new ability, Thick Fat, allows it to negate its Fire-type weakness and gain an Ice-type resistance. Along with a wonderful immunity to Electric-type moves, this makes it one of the best checks to the likes of Thundurus, which can give many teams a lot of grief.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Mamoswine, a mere base 80 Speed means that it finds difficulty facing faster threats, and Ice Shard doesn't have enough power to make up for this in most cases. Furthermore, weakness to Fighting- and Steel-type attacks leave it vulnerable to some of the most common physical attackers in the tier, such as Hitmontop and Metagross. It is also weak to common rain abusers, all of which can easily dispose of it with their Water-type STAB attacks. However, Mamoswine's ability to eliminate various top-tier threats makes it more than worth the slot on most teams, and working around its flaws usually won't be difficult.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to make the most of Mamoswine's offensive abilities, hitting as hard and fast as possible. Earthquake is Mamoswine's strongest Ground-type attack, hitting both of the opposing Pokemon at the cost of also hitting your ally. It is key for taking out Steel-type threats, particularly Heatran. Icicle Spear is Mamoswine's preferred Ice-type STAB option, as it can get past Yache Berries and Focus Sashes, which tend to be very common. However, Icicle Crash is also an option for more reliability and the ability to always OHKO Sitrus Berry Thundurus; it can also make use of an Ice Gem boost while Icicle Spear cannot and has a nifty chance to make the opponent flinch. Ice Shard provides useful STAB priority, and can deal a lot of damage to threats such as Thundurus and Latios. Protect is in the fourth slot as usual because it allows Mamoswine to burn time while its partner takes out something threatening.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Focus Sash is the best option for this set, as it allows Mamoswine to survive a powerful attack that comes its way and is not easy to break thanks to Mamoswine's immunity to both hail and sandstorm damage. However, Ice Gem allows Mamoswine to make the most of its powerful Ice-type STAB attacks. If you run Ice Gem, an alternative spread of 40 HP / 248 Atk / 44 Def / 176 Spe with a Jolly nature is preferred, as it allows Mamoswine to still be faster than Breloom while surviving a Life Orb-boosted Mach Punch from it 87.5% of the time. Life Orb is also an option for Mamoswine, as unlike Ice Gem it can be used alongside Icicle Spear, but it comes at the cost of even more bulk thanks to recoil, making it inferior to Ice Gem in most cases.</p>

<p>While Mamoswine usually can do what it needs to with its STAB attacks alone, Superpower is an option for this set should you find room for it. Superpower is Mamoswine's best option against Rotom-W, which otherwise completely walls it. Superpower can also hit Bisharp, Ferrothorn, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar harder than Earthquake can. However, in most cases you will not have room for Superpower in Mamoswine's limited moveslots.</p>

<p>This set heavily appreciates Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Ludicolo, or those with Sunny Day, all of which help against rain, which this set is very weak to. As Mamoswine also hates Intimidate, good answers to users of Intimidate, such as Rotom-W and Tornadus, also make excellent teammates. Rotom-W and Tornadus are also immune to Earthquake, allowing Mamoswine to use it without risk. Furthermore, Tornadus synergizes well with Mamoswine, taking out Fighting-type threats that threaten it. Due to its lacking Speed stat, Mamoswine also appreciates speed control; Tailwind, Icy Wind, and Thunder Wave all are very helpful for patching up Mamoswine's lackluster Speed. Finally, Heatran is a nice teammate, as it can use Heat Wave to take out Steel-types that threaten Mamoswine. Unfortunately, Heatran is very weak to Earthquake, so Mamoswine will have to play carefully when it is on the field.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulky Attacker
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Icicle Crash
move 3: Ice Shard
move 4: Protect
item: Ice Gem
ability: Thick Fat
nature: Adamant
evs: 208 HP / 244 Atk / 56 Def

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This spread aims to make the most of Mamoswine's bulk so that it can tank attacks and hit back hard. Earthquake is the Ground-type STAB of choice, providing a powerful spread attack and hitting common Steel- and Rock-types, such as Metagross and Tyranitar, hard. Icicle Crash is the Ice-type STAB of choice, as it becomes extremely powerful with an Ice Gem boost. To put things into perspective, an Ice Gem-boosted Icicle Crash can OHKO a Yache Berry Landorus-T even after Mamoswine's Attack is lowered by Intimidate. Ice Shard provides priority that can somewhat make up for this set's lacking Speed, as with an Ice Gem it can deal heavy damage to a variety of opponents. Furthermore, Ice Shard can actually OHKO Tornadus and offensive Thundurus 80% of the time with an Ice Gem boost. Protect takes its place in the fourth moveslot, protecting Mamoswine while its partner dispatches a potential threat.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread allows Mamoswine to tank a Superpower from Adamant Landorus-T, an unboosted Draco Meteor from Timid Latios, and anything weaker than those respective attacks. Notably, this includes Mach Punch from Breloom, which can be a big threat to frailer sets.</p>

<p>This set has a fair bit of bulk, so it doesn't fear priority as much as the other sets. Still, Tornadus makes for a great partner, removing troubling Fighting-types from the battlefield and discouraging Intimidate abusers from switching in. Additionally, Tornadus is immune to Mamoswine's Earthquake, allowing the mammoth to use it without risk. Heatran is also useful for removing Steel-types that would trouble this set. This set also appreciates Sunny Day support or anything that can handle common rain attackers, such as Rotom-W, Ludicolo, and Gastrodon. Cresselia gets a special mention, as it can provide Sunny Day support, speed control, take out Fighting-types with Psyshock, is immune to Earthquake, and can even use Helping Hand, which allows Ice Shard to gain a lot of OHKOs it normally couldn't on threats such as Hydreigon and Latios. Along with Heatran, Cresselia and Mamoswine can make for a great core, one that is particularly great at countering common threats in the metagame.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Icicle Spear
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Icicle Crash
move 4: Rock Slide / Superpower
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Thick Fat
nature: Adamant
evs: 224 HP / 120 Atk / 4 Def / 160 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a Choice Scarf, Mamoswine is capable of moving before fast threats. This allows it to use its stronger STAB attacks, such as Icicle Crash, to KO a lot of threats before they can attack, such as Latios, Thundurus, Tornadus, Thundurus-T, Landorus-T, and Yache Berry Garchomp. Icicle Crash is the preferred Ice-type STAB option, as it is more reliable and comes with a nifty 30% flinch rate; however, this set also runs Icicle Spear to get past common threats such as Focus Sash Landorus-T and Yache Berry Garchomp. Earthquake provides Ground-type STAB and is an ever-so-useful spread attack. The last slot depends on what you want to hit. Rock Slide can be used to OHKO Volcarona, which can be a big threat if it pulls off a Quiver Dance. However, Superpower can also be used, as it nails Ferrothorn and Choice Scarf Tyranitar hard and is also Mamoswine's strongest attack for Rotom-W.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread does a lot of important things. With 224 EVs in HP and an additional 4 EVs in Defense, Mamoswine can live a Fighting Gem-boosted Mach Punch from Jolly Breloom and an unboosted Draco Meteor from Timid Latios as well as anything weaker. The 160 Speed EVs allow Mamoswine to outspeed positive-natured Pokemon with base 111 Speed, when factoring in the Speed boost from Choice Scarf, and anything slower. The remaining EVs are packed into Attack so that Mamoswine can hit as hard as possible. If you are worried about Choice Scarf Landorus-T, an alternative EV spread of 208 HP / 84 Atk / 56 Def / 160 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used. This spread does all the things that the above spread does, but also survives an Adamant Superpower from Landorus-T at the cost of 36 Attack EVs. This spread does lose out on a notable amount of offensive power, unfortunately.</p>

<p>This set partners extremely well with Tornadus. Tornadus discourages Intimidate users from switching in, is immune to Mamoswine's Earthquake, and takes out pesky Fighting-types. The duo of Choice Scarf Mamoswine and Tornadus form a powerful fast-paced attacking core that can eliminate a wide array of common threats. As for all Mamoswine sets, this set appreciates both Sunny Day support and anything that can help check rain teams, such as Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Ludicolo. This set is particularly less fearful of Steel-types, as it can outspeed most of them and hit them with Earthquake. However, Heatran is still a nice partner for eliminating Steel-types. Finally, as this set is designed to take out Thundurus, Landorus-T, and Tornadus safely, anything that hates those threats will appreciate Choice Scarf Mamoswine's support.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Mamoswine doesn't have very many options to choose from. Endeavor can be used in conjunction with Focus Sash, as after the Focus Sash is broken, Mamoswine is able to bring an opponent down to 1 HP. This is hard to use in most situations thanks to the prevalence of priority attacks, however. Ground Gem can be used to OHKO Tyranitar with Earthquake, though other item choices tend to be superior. A Chople Berry can be used to endure powerful Fighting-type attacks should you lack a good Fighting-type counter on your team. A Choice Band can give Mamoswine's attacks a lot of power, but its lack of Speed and weakness to priority make a Choice Band an inferior choice in most cases. Bulldoze allows Mamoswine to provide its own speed control at the cost of a very noticeable drop in power. Finally, Substitute can be used with careful prediction, giving Mamoswine a useful burn immunity and extra protection against attacks.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Rain is Mamoswine's biggest enemy, as it cannot hit Water-types very hard and Swift Swim sweepers such as Kingdra and Ludicolo can crush it effortlessly. Bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent, Suicune, and Rotom-W, give it similar problems, as it cannot do anything to them and they can proceed to either decimate it or set up on it. Gyarados is one of Mamoswine's greatest enemies, as it lowers its offensive presence with Intimidate and can take it down with Waterfall. Kyurem-B and Kyurem are not as effective, but they can tank its attacks and proceed to decimate it with Dragon Claw and Draco Meteor, respectively.</p>

<p>Fighting-types, particularly Scrafty, Hitmontop, Conkeldurr, and Breloom, can hammer it with their powerful STAB attacks. The former two also weaken its attacks with Intimidate and can break Focus Sash with Fake Out if it has one while the latter two pack powerful priority. Additionally, Hitmontop can protect its allies against Earthquake with Wide Guard. Steel-types that don't mind tanking an Earthquake, namely Scizor, Metagross, and Ferrothorn, can proceed to take it out with powerful Steel-type attacks. Getting hit by Intimidate or getting burned will also neuter Mamoswine, as the loss of power will prevent a lot of OHKOs and make it less threatening in general. Finally, Cresselia can tank Mamoswine's attacks any day of the week while supporting its team with moves such as Icy Wind, Trick Room, and Sunny Day.</p>
