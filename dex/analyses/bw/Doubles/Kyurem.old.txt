[Overview]

<p>Kyurem is a menace to behold on the battlefield. Its immense 125 / 90 / 90 defenses are backed by equally intimidating base 130 offenses, and while base 95 Speed is by no means extraordinary, it is more than enough for Kyurem to work with. Kyurem's typing also gives it a powerful offensive presence, as Ice- and Dragon-type attacks are some of the most feared in the tier. There is a downside, though, as the Kyurem's Ice / Dragon typing leaves it weak to common attacking types such as Steel, Fighting, Dragon, and Rock. Fortunately, some useful resistances to Electric and Water help offset this somewhat, alongside Kyurem's stellar bulk.</p>

<p>However, as powerful as Kyurem might seem, Kyurem-B exists. This means the majority of Kyurem's roles are outclassed, as Kyurem-B sports higher bulk, a massive base 170 Attack, and Fusion Bolt. In fact, Kyurem's only real advantage is that it has a higher base 130 Special Attack. This is more than enough for Kyurem, though, as it allows it to spam one of, if not the, most powerful Blizzards in the metagame. This makes Kyurem a very popular choice to use on hail teams. While this may not seem like much of an advantage, Kyurem has earned its place as the face of hail in Doubles for a reason; underestimate it at your own peril.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to use Substitute to help Kyurem use its attacks with less risk,  while protecting Kyurem from harmful status such as paralysis and sleep. Blizzard is the preferred STAB option, as it is an insanely powerful spread attack that hits common threats like Thundurus and Latios for an OHKO. However, it requires hail support, so on the off chance you aren't using hail, Ice Beam makes for a solid option, dealing a similar degree of damage to only one opponent at a time. Earth Power is preferred in the second slot, as Draco Meteor is fairly redundant alongside Kyurem's Ice-type STAB move of choice and Earth Power is useful for hitting Steel-types such as Heatran that would otherwise wall Kyurem. Of course, Draco Meteor can still be used, as it is very powerful and hits bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Jellicent, for heavy damage. Protect rounds off the set, protecting Kyurem and giving its partner an opportunity to take out an opponent that could otherwise KO Kyurem.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread allows Kyurem to move before Adamant Landorus-T and the remaining EVs are packed into Special Attack and HP. Ice Gem is the preferred item, as it boosts Blizzard to massive levels of power. However, both Leftovers and Dragon Gem can be used, to allow for more Substitutes and to give Draco Meteor a boost should it be run, respectively. If you use Leftovers, an alternative spread of 36 HP / 248 SpA / 224 Spe with a Modest nature is preferable. The 4 extra HP EVs let Kyurem hit a Leftovers number, allowing Leftovers to heal as much HP per turn as possible at the lost of a very small amount of power. One last option you could consider is NeverMeltIce, as it can consistently give Blizzard a 20% boost, which can prove useful as Substitute can allow Kyurem to stay around for awhile. Ice Gem is preferred most of the time for more immediate power, however.</p>

<p>This set is built to be used on with hail support, so Abomasnow is obviously a stellar choice for a partner. Apart from hail support, Abomasnow can use its Grass-type STAB attacks to help take down bulky Water-types like Suicune and Rotom-W for Kyurem. Volcarona is a major threat to Kyurem that lack Draco Meteor, as it can set up multiple Quiver Dances on Kyurem while taking a pittance from anything Kyurem uses. Thus, Pokemon that can defeat Volcarona, such as Terrakion and Garchomp, are good partners. Even with Earth Power, this set still hates many common Steel-types such as Scizor and Bisharp, as well as Tyranitar. As such, teammates that can reliably handle Steel-types, such as Landorus-T, Heatran, Volcarona, Conkeldurr, Breloom, and Hitmontop, make for useful partners. Hitmontop in particular can make this set a true nuisance to work around, allowing Kyurem to get a Substitute up through the use of Fake Out while making Kyurem's Substitutes more difficult to break due to Intimidate, all while protecting Kyurem from dangerous spread attacks, particularly Rock Slide, through the use of Wide Guard. Breloom is also a useful partner, making it easier to get a Substitute up with Spore while also taking out troublesome bulky Water-types. Volcarona is yet another very useful partner, as it can redirect Steel- and Fighting-type attacks with Rage Powder that would otherwise deal heavy damage to Kyurem, though the pair must be wary of Rock Slide. While it cannot handle Steel-types, nor Tyranitar, like the majority of useful partners for Kyurem can, Cresselia is a great teammate for this set. It is capable of supporting Kyurem with Icy Wind and Helping Hand while taking care of troublesome Fighting-types that could otherwise ruin Kyurem's day. Finally, this set makes a nice choice on teams that struggles against rain teams, as thanks to its resistance to Water and efficient bulk, it can set a Substitute safely in front of many common threats that are used on rain teams such as Politoed and Ludicolo.</p>

[SET]
name: Choiced Attacker

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>By equipping itself with a Choice item, Kyurem can gain a useful boost to either its sufficient Speed or its already massive Special Attack, both of which make it all the more terrifying have to deal with. Blizzard is the highlight of the set, as with some hail support it can easily tear down unprepared teams, and even with a Choice Scarf equipped OHKOes common threats like Tornadus, Landorus-T, Latios, and Hydreigon. However, Ice Beam is an option if you are not using Kyurem with hail support, as it deals about the same degree of damage to only one target at a time. Draco Meteor is Kyurem's strongest Dragon-type STAB attack and can deal massive damage to a target. It also helps Kyurem work around bulky Water-types like Suicune and Jellicent to a degree, though if you aren't running Choice Specs Jellicent will still be a challenge to work around. Earth Power is preferred in the third slot, as it hits Heatran, which otherwise thoroughly walls this set. However, Hidden Power Fire is an option as it can OHKO Scizor. Note that if Hidden Power Fire is used, you will need to change this set's spread to 108 HP / 248 SpA / 156 Spe, as the use of Hidden Power Fire will lower Kyurem's Speed IV to 30. Dragon Pulse is preferred in the last slot to provide a Dragon-type STAB that won't force you to switch out; however, Hidden Power Fire is an option here as well, as running both Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire on one set ensures that Kyurem can deal solid damage to any Steel-type opponent it might run into.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Hidden Power Rock is an option against Volcarona if it poses a serious threat to your team, though Draco Meteor will still do plenty of damage regardless and Kyurem is not really the best way to counter Volcarona. The given EV spread allows Kyurem to always survive a Steel Gem-boosted Bullet Punch from Scizor, as well as any weaker attacks, which notably includes a Life Orb-boosted Mach Punch off of Breloom. The Speed EVs allow Kyurem to beat everything up to positive-natured Pokemon with base 130 Speed, which notably includes Shaymin-S, Thundurus, Tornadus, Landorus-T, and Latios. The remaining EVs go into Special Attack so that Kyurem can hit as hard as possible. An alternative spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe is an option, as while Kyurem a lot of bulk it can move before other Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom-W, Tyranitar, and Landorus-T. If Choice Specs is used, an alternative spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA can be used to make Kyurem as bulky as possible, though the same spread is preferred since because without Choice Scarf Kyurem still outspeeds Jolly-natured Breloom.</p>

<p>Abomasnow is a vital asset to this set, as it provides much-needed hail support, allowing Kyurem to spam Blizzard without risk of missing. As for other partners, this set in particular requires good offensive synergy to function, as it is going to be locked into a move and as such will often need a partner that can take out a threat that it can't. Steel-types, most notably Heatran, are major threats to Kyurem due to their resistances to its STAB moves. Tyranitar is also a large threat to Kyurem due to it removing Kyurem's weather advantage with Sand Stream. Some prime choices for eliminating Steel-types and Tyranitar are Heatran, Landorus, Hitmontop, and Terrakion. Hitmontop is additionally capable of further supporting Kyurem with Fake Out, Feint, Intimidate, and Wide Guard. Some additional threats to cover are bulky Water-types, particularly Jellicent, which can use Trick Room to completely cripple Kyurem for the course of 5 turns if it is holding a Choice Scarf. Rotom-W and Breloom are the best options to eliminate Jellicent and other bulky Water-types such as Suicune thanks to their respective Electric- and Grass-type STAB attacks. Breloom is also capable of doing some serious damage to Tyranitar and Steel-types with a Technician-boosted Mach Punch.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Even though Kyurem's main advantage is in its Special Attack, one must not overlook its wonderful bulk. This set aims to use that bulk to tank hits and then strike back with powerful attacks. Draco Meteor is preferred in slot one, as it gives Kyurem a ton of power, but because it means Kyurem will have to switch out, Dragon Pulse can be used for more consistency. Blizzard is Kyurem's most powerful Ice-type STAB attack, but if you don't have the room for the hail support it needs, Ice Beam is a reliable option to fall back on. Earth Power rounds off Kyurem's coverage, hitting Steel-types like Heatran and Metagross for some heavy damage. However, Hidden Power Fire can be used in Earth Power's place, as it is Kyurem's best option against Scizor, which would otherwise care very little about Kyurem's attempts to damage it. Protect rounds off the set, allowing Kyurem to guard itself from dangerous attacks and giving its ally an opportunity to take out the source of those attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Haban Berry is usually the preferred item, as most Dragon-types are faster than Kyurem, making the need to tank Dragon-type attacks larger. However, Chople Berry is a great option as well, particularly for taking Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combats from the likes of Hitmontop and Terrakion. With the given spread and the proper Berry mentioned above, Kyurem can always endure either a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor off of Timid Latios or a Fighting Gem-boosted Close Combat off of Terrakion. If Haban Berry is run, an alternative spread of 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 SpD with a Modest nature is an option, allowing Kyurem to survive more powerful Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteors from the likes of Modest Latios and Kyurem. However, this spread sacrifices a significant amount of physical bulk, not to mention Modest Latios are very rare, so it is not preferred.</p>

<p>Once again, Abomasnow makes an appearance as a key partner for Kyurem, providing the hail support that is necessary in order for Kyurem to operate at the peak of its potential. While this set's bulky nature allows it to get past numerable Pokemon that would normally counter it, it still appreciates allies such as Terrakion, Heatran, Hitmontop, Conkeldurr, and Landorus-T to take out Steel-types and Tyranitar that generally give Kyurem trouble. Volcarona is also a great option as it can redirect dangerous Steel- and Fighting-type attacks via Rage Powder while easily dispatching Steel-types for Kyurem, though be aware that Rock Slide will be a big problem for the duo. Due to this set's high bulk and lack of Speed, it will heavily appreciate speed control, especially Tailwind and Thunder Wave. If you run either of these, Heracross makes for a great partner, as it synergizes wonderfully alongside Kyurem offensively and the duo can OHKO a lot of common threats, including but not limited to: Landorus-T, Cresselia, Thundurus, Tornadus, and Tyranitar. Rotom-W and Breloom make for nice partners as well because they can get past bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Jellicent, which this set has trouble with. Finally, thanks to this set's ability to lure in Dragon- or Fighting-types and remove them, partners that have trouble with the aforementioned Pokemon, such as Heatran and Rotom-W, will appreciate its support. Note you can only lure out either Dragon-types or Fighting-types depending on whether Kyurem opts to run Haban Berry or Chople Berry, respectively.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>First and foremost, Glaciate is an option Kyurem has that can provide for a decent spread attack outside of hail while also providing for its own speed control. Blizzard is much more powerful and Kyurem tends to be fairly frail, unfortunately. As such, Glaciate should really be considered only on bulky sets because they can make more use of this move. Focus Blast is yet another option for hitting Steel-types, but Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire are preferred because they don't have Focus Blast's shaky 70% accuracy, making them more reliable options. Light Screen and Reflect are both options for Kyurem; Light Screen in particular is great if you are using Kyurem to help against rain teams, as it really holds the power of Water-type spread attacks like Muddy Water and Surf back. Imprison is an option as it allows Kyurem to lock the opponent off of Protect and Draco Meteor, which can make Kyurem even harder to work around. Life Orb can provide for a consistent power boost that doesn't lock Kyurem into a move like Choice Specs would, but the recoil that comes with it will make Kyurem heavily susceptible to Bullet Punch and Mach Punch. Hail allows Kyurem to provide hail support without Abomasnow's help and can be used alongside Abomasnow to win weather wars, but it is difficult to find room for such an option and Abomasnow can usually beat opposing Politoed and Tyranitar anyway. Finally, a physical set could be an option with Kyurem's base 130 Attack stat, but Kyurem-B outclasses this entirely. As such, the main merit of this set would be surprise value, though Kyurem is better off using a typical special set anyway.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Steel-types are usually the best checks to Kyurem because they can switch into Blizzard and Draco Meteor safely, though they must be played carefully due to Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire. Heatran can handle sets that run Hidden Power Fire with ease and can survive an Earth Power if it holds Shuca Berry, allowing it to hit Kyurem with Heat Wave. Metagross can tank both Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire assuming Kyurem isn't running Choice Specs and OHKO with Meteor Mash, as well as pick off weakened Kyurem with Bullet Punch. Scizor can also hit Kyurem hard with Bullet Punch, but most Kyurem are EVed to take that attack and can strike back with Hidden Power Fire, though Occa Berry Scizor can survive this assuming Kyurem isn't running Choice Specs. Bisharp is also a solid option as with 252 HP EVs it can tank an unboosted Earth Power 81% of the time and dish out heavy damage with Iron Head.</p>

<p>Fighting-types are also a good answer to Kyurem, especially Hitmontop, which can block Blizzard by using Wide Guard. Conkeldurr and Breloom are also good answers to Kyurem as they pack powerful Mach Punches that will can KO Kyurem if it has been weakened to half of its full HP or less. Terrakion is an option, as it can move before non-Choice Scarf Kyurem and OHKO non-Chople Berry Kyurem with Close Combat. It can also do some heavy damage with Rock Slide. On a similar note, Rock-types can also check Kyurem. Tyranitar in particular can tank any of Kyurem's attacks assuming sand is up and proceed to strike back with Low Kick or Rock Slide. Fire-types can tank Blizzard and strike back with their Fire-type STAB attacks. Volcarona is especially threatening, as Quiver Dance variants can boost up while only fearing Draco Meteor, which will give them another opportunity to Quiver Dance if it is used and fails to KO. Bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Suicune can easily tank any of Kyurem's attacks bar a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor and proceed to set up Trick Room and Tailwind, respectively.</p>

<p>While the best way to counter Kyurem is to have Pokemon that can tank its attacks, this is not always the easiest way thanks to its offensive power. Thanks to its only average base 95 Speed, an obvious way to handle Kyurem is to move before it and hammer it with powerful attacks. Faster Dragon-types, such as Latios and Hydreigon, are one of the easiest ways to do this, as a Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor will OHKO every Kyurem set except those that run Haban Berry, which will still take heavy damage. Life Orb Excadrill and Kingdra can outspeed even Choice Scarf Kyurem in sand and rain, respectively. Kingdra must be wary of Haban Berry sets, however, as they can strike back for an OHKO. Finally, one of the most effective ways to move before Kyurem is by the use of speed control, as Icy Wind, Thunder Wave, Tailwind, and Trick Room will all leave Kyurem all the more easier to deal with. Thunder Wave is particularly effective, as it will not time out or be remedied by Kyurem switching out, allowing you to cripple Kyurem for the rest of the match.</p>
