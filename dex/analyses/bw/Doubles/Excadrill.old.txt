[Overview]

<p>Excadrill is the king of the sand in Doubles, thanks to its amazing abilities, good typing, ability to fire off powerful STAB Earthquakes, and huge Attack stat. Not only does Excadrill become one of the fastest Pokemon in the game in sand but also it can take advantage of two very powerful spread moves, Earthquake and Rock Slide. Excadrill is also immune to both Thunder Wave and Toxic, so you can't slow this monster down the easy way.</p>

[Set Comments]

<p>Excadrill is an extremely one-dimensional Pokemon. It attacks, hits hard, and tries not to get hit hard. It's a Pokemon that can be used at any stage in the game to do major damage, as it can punch major holes at the start of the battle or clean up at the end. The two main moves on the set are Earthquake and Rock Slide, both of which are spread moves. Earthquake is used as a powerful STAB move, and Rock Slide is used to hurt Flying-types and Levitate users such as Zapdos and Rotom-W. The third slot can have a variety of moves. Iron Head can be used as a single target STAB, Substitute can be used on free turns with team support, and X-Scissor can be used as another single target attack to hit Pokemon like Hydreigon and Cresselia harder then Rock Slide can.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>Life Orb is the set's main item because it further boosts Excadrill's amazing Attack stat. A Chople Berry can also be used in order to survive Mach Punch from a Breloom that isn't holding a Fighting Gem. Adamant is the preferred nature in order to maximize Excadrill's damage output. The EVs on this set are very basic because Excadrill isn't trying to accomplish anything fancy. An EV spread of 52 HP / 252 Atk / 204 Spe with an Adamant nature can also be used. This spread allows Excadrill to outrun Choice Scarf Latios, but it loses to other Excadrill running max Speed.</p>

<p>Becasue Excadrill is a Pokemon that takes advantage of the fact it has a powerful Ground-type STAB, it's only fitting that its teammates should try to avoid being caught in the crossfire. Some of the better teammates Excadrill can ask for are fast special attackers such as Latios and Tornadus. Latios can seriously hurt Fighting-types that threaten Excadrill directly, and the threat of Defiant from Tornadus prevents Intimidate users from freely switching in. Other good teammates include Rotom-W, who has good STABs and bulk; Cresselia, because of Helping Hand and her Psychic typing; Pokemon that help deal with rain, such as Latias and Thundurus; and Tyranitar for its ability to summon the sandstorm that makes Excadrill so dangerous in the first place.</p>

<p>Excadrill can attempt to use a variety of items. Leftovers could be used to Substitute stall sandstorm and Life Orb damage, and a Gem could be used to deal large amounts of damage in a single turn. Focus Sash could be used to survive an otherwise-fatal hit and a Lum Berry could be used alongside a teammate such as Cresselia that has access to Swagger to further increase Excadrill's Attack.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A couple of interesting options Excadrill has involve giving it an immunity to Earthquake. Both an Air Balloon and Magnet Rise make Excadrill immune to Ground-type attacks, which can be useful in certain situations. Swords Dance is another move you could run, but it's not as easy to pull off in Doubles as it was in OU. Drill Run hits a single target harder then Earthquake would, as Earthquake only deals 75% of its normal damage due to being a spread move. Finally, Excadrill can run a Choiced Mold Breaker set, which would allow it to seriously hurt some of its counters, but it would be difficult to fit it into a team and might even be harmful in some situations.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pokemon that have good bulk and an immunity to Earthquake often find themselves countering Excadrill. Such Pokemon include Hitmontop, Landorus-T, Landorus, Scrafty, Rotom-W, Cresselia, and Gyarados, as they can all either Intimidate Excadrill or take middling damage from its moves. Wide Guard is a move that Excadrill isn't too fond of, and Pokemon such as Hitmontop, Mienshao, and Swampert can take advantage of it to prevent Excadrill from even doing any damage. Pokemon that can kill Excadrill before it can hurt anything are useful against it as well; Conkeldurr and Breloom come to mind with STAB Mach Punch. Lastly, the most obvious counter is rain, which makes Politoed extremely threatening to Excadrill because of its weather changing ability, which can render Excadrill useless.</p>
