[Overview]

<p>Suicune is one the unsung heroes of the Doubles metagame. With a great pure Water typing, excellent bulk, and a great movepool, Suicune can fit onto a variety of teams. It can provide great support and speed control to a team through Tailwind and Icy Wind, without being dead weight like some other defensive Pokemon. The only thing letting Suicune down is its mediocre base Speed. However, this isn't as big of a deal in Doubles as it is in Singles and can be mitigated easily.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With defensive investment and supporting moves, this set aims to reduce your opponent's team's offensive capabilities, in addition to still dealing damage and letting your teammates come in more easily. This set also tries to force switches from your opponents, disrupting their entire strategy. Snarl and Icy Wind are two great spread attacks with a 100% chance of lowering the opponent's Special Attack and Speed, respectively, which is a big deal in a metagame all about Speed and power control. Tailwind is something every person should consider when running Suicune, as it is easily one of the best users of the move in the game. Scald is the STAB move of choice due to its 30% chance to burn opponents, which makes for a total of three stat-reducing moves. Protect is the obvious choice in the last slot to prevent damage and effects for a turn; however, Rest allows Suicune to stick around longer and cause even more mischief.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Suicune's EVs are highly specific. After an Icy Wind, it outspeeds up to base 110s, a Speed tier most notably including Latias and Latios. Suicune's bulk allows it to live Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteors from Timid Latios and Modest Hydreigon with plenty of HP to spare. Coupled with Snarl, Suicune can further lower their Special Attack stats, crippling them and forcing them to switch. The item selection here depends on what role Suicune plays on your team and how long it needs to be around to do what you need it to. While Sitrus Berry is usually the better choice, Wacan Berry will give Suicune a one-time safety net from Electric attacks, while Chesto Berry can let Suicune Rest off any damage and ailments and get right back into the action. Between burns, Snarl and Icy Wind, Suicune's job is to cripple the opponent's offense and cause mayhem, which it does with aplomb. This Suicune works well with Intimidate support and Light Screen, making Hitmontop, Cresselia, Gyarados, and Salamence all good partners. Be wary of Tornadus and Bisharp, though, as their Defiant ability can make them very hard to deal with if you spam stat-lowering moves willy-nilly.</p>

move 2: Scald / Hydro Pump

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Suicune's Tailwind set is one of its better sets in Doubles. Access to Tailwind while being resistant to Ice-types moves gives Suicune a very important niche, thanks to all of the Icy Winds flying around. Tailwind support, although sometimes inferior to other forms of speed control, is a very solid and easy way to make everything on your team super-fast, giving average to low Speed Pokemon a chance to run over the opposing team for four turns, counting the turn Tailwind is used. The choice of moves following Tailwind is up to the player. Scald offers a good 30% burn chance, while Hydro Pump gives Suicune a huge punching tool, albeit a bit less accurate. Ice Beam gives it good coverage against everything but other Water-types. The last move depends on what your team needs. Protect is an obvious choice in Doubles, giving Suicune a full turn of protection from everything bar passive weather effects. Roar, however, has the interesting effect of being able to phaze out Trick Room-inducers just before they can set up, which is important as Tailwind teams usually fare horribly in Trick Room.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Suicune's EVs let it outspeed all positive-natured base 70s. This includes Politoed, Cloyster, and the ever-important Breloom. Outrunning Breloom lets Suicune get off a Tailwind before it can be Spored. Also, after Tailwind is up, Suicune outspeeds even Choice Scarf Latios. Maximum investment in Special Attack gives Suicune as much power as possible. There's nothing better than surprising your opponent with a very powerful Hydro Pump coming off what is usually seen as a wall. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP to complement Suicune's already high natural bulk. Suicune can also run a spread of 28 HP / 252 SpA / 228 Spe with a Modest nature for more power in exchange for bulk. Suicune can also run a spread of 252 HP / 120 SpA / 136 Spe with a Timid nature for a far bulkier set than the earlier mentioned one that still retains a punch.</p>

<p>The item choice here is usually dependent on what your team needs more. Wacan Berry is more useful overall, as Electric-type attacks are far more common than Grass-type attacks and Suicune's natural bulk can only let it take so much. After all, Sitrus Berry is of no use if you're already dead. Sitrus does have its uses though, especially on sand and hail teams where passive damage can add up quickly. Water Gem could also be used to give Suicune a powerful one-time nuke.</p>

<p>This particular set works well on bulky offense teams, where members hit really hard and can take hits but lack the Speed to do a lot of damage to the other team. Grass-types make really great partners in particular, as their STABs hit the main thing Suicune can't, namely bulky Water-types. Breloom is one of the best partners Suicune could ask for, as it forces the opponent to make it a priority while Suicune sets up, thus letting the two go to town on the opponent in tandem with one another. Amoonguss is another great partner, almost guaranteeing Tailwind being set up with the Rage Powder and Spore support it can provide. Amoonguss also gives your team a bit of cushion against Trick Room teams thanks to its low Speed. Abomasnow is also a good partner, as it lets Suicune use Blizzard over Ice Beam, thus giving Suicune a great spread attack. Abomasnow also provides a Grass-type STAB attack for dealing with bulky Water-types.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Suicune has a few other great options it can run, though they are usually better used by other Pokemon. It has the ability to set literally any weather manually, notably rain and hail, making it a good fit on weather teams who could use an additional bulky weather setter. Additionally, Suicune has access to Calm Mind, which can make for a very interesting last Pokemon situation with its ChestoRest set. Overall, any set that plays off of Suicune's excellent bulk will usually work well.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Suicune's biggest threat is Thundurus. With Prankster Taunt and Thunder Wave as well as a strong STAB Thunderbolt, Thundurus can hit Suicune hard, dealing massive damage, or just screw up any sort of set up Suicune attempts and paralyze a good majority of your team before it finally gets taken out. Other threats are faster attackers with super effective coverage, including, but not limited to, Shaymin-S, Ludicolo under rain, and Zapdos as well as Latios, Latias and to a lesser degree, Hydreigon, who all resist Suicune's STAB Water-type attacks; the last three can all hit Suicune hard with a Draco Meteor. Another threat is Ferrothorn, who hits Suicune super effectively, only really fears a burn from Scald, and doesn't care about Icy Wind and Snarl in the slightest. This is also true for Kyurem-B, as it almost always carries Fusion Bolt and is bulky enough to shrug off any attack Suicune carries. Gastrodon is a great bulky check, as it walls Suicune completely, absorbing its STAB Water-type moves. Chlorophyll users are another big threat, especially Sawsbuck and Lilligant. With their powerful Grass-type attacks, they can easily outspeed and subdue Suicune. Abomasnow also fits this description, being able to kill Suicune with Giga Drain or Wood Hammer. Finally, Defiant Pokemon cause trouble for any set that uses Icy Wind or Snarl; Bisharp is a notable example, gaining Attack boosts and threatening Suicune with powerful moves such as Sucker Punch.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Giving Suicune an immunity to powerful rain-boosted Water-type attacks and an additional source of healing, Water Absorb would generally be much more useful than Pressure if it were ever released, however unlikely that might be at this point.</p>
