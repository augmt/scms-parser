[Overview]

<p>Poochyena has many difficulties to face when trying to find a spot on a team. It not only has terrible stats, but also sports a largely unimproved movepool that limits its possibilities. Its one bright spot is its decent ability, Quick Feet, which allows it to outspeed many threats when afflicted with a status condition. That bright spot isn't nearly enough to make Poochyena decent, and it should never be seriously considered for a teamslot.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Poochyena reaches 21 Speed when Quick Feet is activated, outspeeding every unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup. If Poochyena can get a Howl boost on the turn Toxic Orb activates, it can become a fearsome sweeper. Sadly, Poochyena will rarely be able to do this, as most opponents will just stay in and attack. Facade is actually Poochyena's most powerful move when affected by status, while Crunch hits Ghost-types and is a solid STAB move that doesn't rely on the status boost. Fire Fang is the best move in the last slot to hit Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Magnemite super effectively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Sucker Punch is an option over Crunch if priority is desired, but it is quite unreliable and Poochyena should be outspeeding most threats anyway. Fighting-types that can take a hit, such as Scraggy and Mienfoo, easily beat Poochyena with Drain Punch or High Jump Kick. Timburr and Gastly are good teammates to check the two, respectively. Dwebble can take a Crunch from Poochyena and has the ability to KO with X-Scissor, making it a solid check. Staryu can handle Dwebble, as it has powerful Water-type moves to deal major damage, and it can also spin away any entry hazards. Scraggy is a good teammate to counter Aron, who resists Normal- and Dark-type moves and is neutral to Fire Fang.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Ice Fang and Thunder Fang are options, but they have little additional coverage with Poochyena's other moves. Iron Tail can hit Rock-types such as Dwebble, but has low accuracy and poor coverage otherwise. Super Fang could deal steady damage to most opponents, but most of Poochyena's moves do more. Poochyena learns quite a few support options, such as Roar, Taunt, Yawn, and Heal Bell, but is much too frail to take advantage of these moves. Snatch could be used with good prediction to steal a Dragon Dance from Dratini attempting to set up. Protect is a good option for Poochyena, as it can let Poochyena safely activate its Toxic Orb. Dig is useful to hit Steel-types that aren't weak to Fire Fang such as Aron, but it is easily countered since it takes two turns. Swagger could be used to give an opponent problems, but it is too unreliable, much like Poochyena itself.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fighting-types such as Scraggy and Mienfoo easily defeat Poochyena with their STAB moves. Rock-types, especially Aron and Dwebble, wall Poochyena if they have decent Defense, as Poochyena doesn't hit very hard. Priority moves in general will usually KO Poochyena, especially after a few turns of Toxic Orb damage.</p>
