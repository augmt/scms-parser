[Overview]

<p>Krabby is an interesting Pokemon to use in Little Cup, having an extremely high Attack stat as well as a very good base Defense. Krabby also has 2 excellent boosting moves in Agility and Swords Dance, a decent movepool granting it good coverage, and two very useful abilities in Shell Armor and Hyper Cutter. However, with the introduction of the item Eviolite, it has become tougher for Pokemon such as Krabby to sweep. Still, Krabby is capable of pulling off a sweep, and is an offensive threat which every team should watch out for.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Krabby can switch into a Pokemon it counters or whose attacks it resists and set up with Swords Dance or Agility as they switch out. This can prove to be dangerous for the opponent, since either will make Krabby extremely dangerous. STAB Crabhammer is a very useful tool to have, hitting many threats hard with good neutral coverage. Return has a high Base Power, and the combination of Water and Normal goes nearly unresisted in Little Cup. This set is useful as a late-game sweeper, taking out the opponent's weakened Pokemon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Oran Berry prevents Krabby from getting KOed by priority attacks and gives it more time to set up, though Life Orb boosts the power of Krabby's attacks and ensures a few crucial OHKOs that Krabby would otherwise miss out on. When using Life Orb, the 36 HP EVs should be shifted to Special Defense to minimize Life Orb recoil. Hyper Cutter is the better ability to use on this set, as it prevents Krabby's Attack from getting lowered, helping it in the long run. Brick Break or X-Scissor can be used over either boosting move to provide extra coverage, but they both decrease the flexibility of the set and can deprive you of the best stat-up move in certain scenarios. This set loves entry hazards support. Ferroseed is thus a good teammate, since it resists Krabby's weaknesses and can lay down Spikes and Stealth Rock. Vacuum Wave Croagunk can finish off Krabby with ease when it is weakened, making Pokemon such as Bronzor great teammates, as they also have great defensive synergy with Krabby. It should also be noted that Ferroseed and Frillish completely wall this set. The latter in particular is immune to both Crabhammer and Return thanks to Water Absorb and its Ghost typing.</p>

[SET]
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Crabhammer

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set makes full use of Krabby's massive Attack and coverage to hit a wide range of opponents hard, outright OHKOing a large portion of the metagame. Because Krabby is so slow, it should focus on hitting the Pokemon switching in very hard and before switching out. Slowpoke and Ferroseed are no longer good counters to Krabby here, as they are decimated by Superpower and X-Scissor, respectively. Again, Crabhammer and Return provide Krabby with excellent neutral coverage, while X-Scissor and Superpower serve to hit Pokemon which take little damage from its other two attacks, Slowpoke and Ferroseed in particular. Superpower also makes Krabby a great check to Dragon Dance Scraggy.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Using 0 HP EVs gives Krabby 19 HP, meaning Life Orb only has 1 HP of recoil per turn, increasing survivability in the long run. However, Speed EVs can be moved into HP, if desired. Shell Armor protects Krabby from critical hits, although Sheer Force can be used in conjunction with Rock Slide to hit some threats which Krabby cannot otherwise, but most of these Pokemon are faster than Krabby and will force it out anyway, making Sheer Force a bad choice. A Choice Band can also be used to grant Krabby a lot of power and the ability to KO max HP Ferroseed, but it generally appreciates the freedom to switch moves. Munchlax and Ferroseed make great teammates for Krabby, as they can check the fast special attackers that trouble it. Since Krabby can weaken a large range of threats, sweepers such as Scraggy and Croagunk make great teammates for it. Ghost-types can also switch into three of Krabby's moves freely and KO it, making Dark-types such as Houndour and Scraggy excellent options for teammates. Houndour also checks Snover, which can switch into Crabhammer and KO Krabby with ease.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Crabhammer
move 2: Return
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: X-Scissor
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Sheer Force
nature: Adamant
evs: 36 HP / 236 Atk / 36 Def / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Krabby's high Attack also makes it a great Choice Scarf user, as it can revenge kill a wide range of threats. With a Choice Scarf, Krabby hits 21 Speed, allowing it to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup. Once again, Crabhammer and Return grant Krabby great neutral coverage, allowing it to check a large number of Pokemon. X-Scissor allows Krabby to hit Slowpoke hard, making it a great coverage option. Because Krabby will now outspeed most of its opponents, Rock Slide is preferred over Superpower. Sheer Force boosts the power of Rock Slide, and is thus preferred over Krabby's other abilities, which are otherwise not as useful on this set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Superpower can be used over X-Scissor, but it is illegal with Sheer Force. If Sheer Force is removed, then Rock Slide will be weaker, which is not recommended. This set is not as sturdy as the other sets Krabby can use due to the lack of investment in Krabby's bulk. An Adamant nature buffs up Krabby's Attack, and is preferred over Jolly because Krabby's Speed is still boosted by Choice Scarf. Krabby's inability to change attacks means that it will be forced to switch out often, making Rapid Spin support highly useful. This set is also walled by Ferroseed and, to an extent, Slowpoke as long as it can avoid X-Scissor. Thus, Pokemon that can check these two Pokemon, such as Scraggy, also make great teammates for Krabby.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Thanks to Krabby's high base Defense and good HP stat, it could run a defensive set with Toxic, Knock Off, and Crabhammer, but the absence of a recovery move and Krabby's abysmal Special Defense make this a bad option. Brick Break can be used over Superpower on any of Krabby's sets, but the drop in power is significant. Krabby can also run a Flail set with Focus Sash, but the ubiquity of priority attacks in Little Cup would make it a liability to Krabby's team.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Frillish is public enemy number 1 for Krabby, as it is immune to all of its attacks barring Rock Slide and X-Scissor, and OHKOes it with Energy Ball. Slowpoke and Ferroseed will wall Krabby if it doesn't run X-Scissor or Superpower, respectively. Ghost-types such as Gastly will freely Substitute on Krabby locked into Return. Fast special attackers can exploit Krabby's terrible Special Defense and turn it into seafood with ease.</p>
