[Overview]

<p>Karrablast is an a typical physical sweeper in every regard. It has a good Attack stat backed up by the incredibly deadly Megahorn and a powerful boosting move in Swords Dance, but it is let down by its shallow movepool and unimpressive Speed stat. Although its moves offer poor coverage against Steel-types, the most notable ones, Ferroseed, Bronzor, and Pawniard, are all hit neutrally by Megahorn, so Rock-types are the real threats to Karrablast. Its ability, Shed Skin, though passively helpful, is usually better than the situational Swarm. Overall, Karrablast can be a helpful addition to your team if you are aware of and cover its weaknesses while building on its strengths.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Karrablast reaches a staggering 34 Attack after a Swords Dance, enough to OHKO most Pokemon with its powerful Megahorn. Return hits many Pokemon who resist Megahorn hard, though Double-Edge can be used for more power. The choice between Life Orb and Oran Berry really depends on what you're using Karrablast for: a suicidal death machine or a powerful Pokemon that can take a hit. Keep in mind that with a maximum Speed of 16, Karrablast cannot outrun some of the quicker LC Pokemon. Feint Attack is a useful move in that it allows Karrablast to hit Gastly, which 4x resists Megahorn, whereas Aerial Ace can hit Fighting-type Pokemon harder than Double-Edge, without the drop in health due to recoil.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb can be used for maximum power after a Swords Dance, but an Oran Berry will allow Karrablast to set up Swords Dance more easily. An Adamant nature can be used over Jolly if you want pure power instead of the extra Speed. Double-Edge and Return are interchangeable; again, this depends on what you're using Karrablast for.</p>

<p>Unorthodox Steel-types such as Aron and Magnemite can exploit Karrablast's lack of coverage, and anything fairly quick can make short work of Karrablast with its mediocre Speed.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice
move 1: Megahorn
move 2: Double-Edge / Return

move 4: Toxic / Rest
item: Choice Band / Choice Scarf
ability: Shed Skin
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 76 HP / 236 Atk / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The choice of item depends largely on whether Karrablast fits your team best as a physical sweeper or revenge killer; it can suit both roles well. Megahorn is a strong STAB as usual, while Double-Edge or Return and Aerial Ace are for coverage and shouldn't be used unless Megahorn is resisted.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Double-Edge is preferable on the Choice Scarf set, as Karrablast needs as much power as possible, but Return is better on the Choice Band set, so the recoil doesn't cause Karrablast's early demise. The last two moves are mostly filler. With its perfect accuracy, Aerial Ace can KO Sand Veil Cacnea in a sandstorm and finish off a weakened Cubchoo in hail. There are two options for the last moveslot. Toxic can be used to cripple Frillish, which doesn't take much damage from Karrablast's other moves. Rest, however, can be used to completely heal Karrablast, with Shed Skin giving it about a 66% chance of waking up early over three turns. A Jolly nature is recommended for the Choice Band set, while an Adamant nature works best with the Choice Scarf set.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Counter can be used for a surprise KO, but is unreliable. X-Scissor is a more accurate option over Megahorn, but hits for less damage on average. Pursuit can be used for hitting Ghost-types, as well as Psychic-types afraid of staying in and eating a Megahorn. Finally, a utility set with Eviolite, Shed Skin, and Knock Off might seem decent, but Karrablast has pretty mediocre defenses, making it a bad choice.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Defensively, many Steel- and Rock-types can easily take Karrablast's moves. Offensively, fast, hard-hitting Fire- or Flying-types can ruin Karrablast's day by hitting its mediocre defenses with their powerful STAB moves.</p>
