[Overview]

<p>Little Cup is a game where offense is nothing without Speed, and, unfortunately, Snubbull lacks Speed entirely. It does, however, have a way to remedy this via paralysis support. Using moves to lower the opponent's Speed such as Thunder Wave makes Snubbull a decent sweeper, as its raw power combined with the ability to strike first makes it hard to check. On the offensive, Snubbull has an excellent physical movepool, which means it can sweep effectively once its checks and counters have been dealt with. All-in-all, Snubbull is not to be taken lightly.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Using Thunder Wave to keep speedy opponents at bay, Snubbull can wreak havoc. Thunder Wave inflicts paralysis, which cuts the opponent's Speed by 75%. This allows Snubbull to easily outpace anything in Little Cup, barring fast Pokemon such as Taillow and Ponyta at +3 Speed. Snubbull is best used on a paralysis team with teammates such as Ferroseed and Slowpoke to spread status. Because of this, Snubbull might not need to use Thunder Wave itself and can instead have Bulk Up to raise its Attack and Defense before it sweeps.</p>

<p>Return is Snubbull's best attacking move; after STAB, it sits at 153 Base Power and has 100% accuracy. It also has good coverage in LC, only missing out on Ferroseed, Lileep, Gastly, Frillish, and very uncommon Pokemon. Crunch complements its coverage by hitting Ghost-type Pokemon that are immune to Return. Lastly, Snubbull is faced with the choice of Close Combat or Brick Break. The former works best with Thunder Wave, as it can KO Lileep and Ferroseed, while the latter is beneficial with Bulk Up, as it keeps Snubbull's defenses neutral and can even break through Reflect and Light Screen.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Snubbull's hold item, nature, and EV spread maintain a good balance of both offense and bulk with a bit of Speed. If you wish to sacrifice Speed EVs to add to Snubbull's bulk, feel free. The Fairy Pokemon has access to the elemental punches, but none of them hit any harder than Snubbull's other moves. It gets Wild Charge to hit Slowpoke and Frillish harder, but it's not worth the recoil. Earthquake might prove useful against Poison-types. Snubbull's special movepool is almost as good as its physical movepool, but unfortunately it doesn't have the stat to back it up.</p>

<p>Good teammates for any sweeper are Pokemon that can eliminate its counters. Mienfoo causes trouble for Snubbull, so Gastly is a good teammate to beat it. Shed Skin Scraggy is another problem; even if it is paralyzed, it has a 30% chance to remove its status every turn. Mienfoo is ironically not only one of Snubbull's best checks, but greatest teammates. It can beat Scraggy and lure Ghost-types for Snubbull to set up on or OHKO. Stealth Rock and Spikes are useful for Snubbull to beat Ferroseed, Lileep, and Scraggy.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Unfortunately, Snubbull isn't versatile at all. It has a variety of support moves to make use of such as Heal Bell and Reflect. While its defenses aren't exactly good, they're not terrible, and its typing is respectable from a defensive viewpoint. Last Resort is an extremely powerful move with STAB, and Snubbull can use it alongside Thunder Wave or Protect. A Choice Band set with Return, Crunch, Close Combat, and a filler move can be used to mild success as long as the opponent's Fighting-type Pokemon are removed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Really any Fighting-type is a good check. Timburr is especially great, as it even appreciates being paralyzed due to Guts. Scraggy has Shed Skin to alleviate Thunder Wave's effect, and it can easily OHKO Snubbull with High Jump Kick, but it must be wary of incoming Close Combat. Wynaut can come in on Close Combat or Bulk Up and beat Snubbull with an assortment of moves. Physical walls such as Slowpoke and Shelmet completely wall Snubbull, especially the latter, as it has access to Acid Armor and better Defense.</p>
