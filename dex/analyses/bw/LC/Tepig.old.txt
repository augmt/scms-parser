[Overview]

<p>Tepig comes into Little Cup as little more than a mostly outclassed Fire-type, having only very small differences to set it apart from others. It is the only Fire-type with both Superpower and Wild Charge, as well as the only Pokemon of the type to learn Head Smash. It has a good Attack stat, with passable Speed that can be boosted with Flame Charge. All of this means that Tepig may not be the best choice, but it can work if your team is in need of a physical Fire-type attacker.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Flame Charge allows Tepig to reach 21 Speed, which is just enough to outspeed all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup. From there, it can attempt to sweep with Flare Blitz, Tepig's most powerful STAB move. Wild Charge is there to do super effective damage to Water-types such as Slowpoke and Frillish, thus having good synergy with Tepig's Fire-type attacks. In the last moveslot, Superpower is preferred to deal massive damage to Houndour and Thick Fat Munchlax, though the drop in stats afterward can be troublesome. Flame Charge and Superpower combine to KO Eviolite Scraggy, which is quite useful as well. The alternative in the last slot would be Head Smash, which hits the aforementioned Houndour, along with other Fire-types. This is one of those rare times when Tepig's ability, Blaze, makes a good impact, as most of the moves on this set cause recoil damage that can wear it down very quickly.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Jolly nature could be used for the extra Speed, but Tepig appreciates the extra power Adamant provides, causing Jolly to be an inferior option. Hippopotas is a serious problem that Tepig needs help getting around, as it can take a Flare Blitz and KO with Earthquake. Choice Scarf Darumaka has trouble taking hits but can revenge kill with Rock Slide. As a result, Slowpoke and Staryu make fantastic teammates for Tepig, being able to check both of the aforementioned Pokemon. Wooper and Chinchou resist Fire and are immune to Electric, allowing them to check Tepig nicely. Ferroseed works as a nice check to those two, barring the use of Hidden Power Fire.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Tepig has a few other options, but none are very impressive compared to the moves listed. Toxic could be used, mainly to give Wooper problems in the long run. Magnitude needs a lot of luck to be worth using, but Chinchou is hit super effectively by it, as are Fire-types. Endeavor could work as a last-ditch move for Tepig when used with Flame Charge, as Tepig loses HP quite quickly and can make good use of it. Curse could be used to give Attack boosts, but Tepig has too many common weaknesses for it to work well. Lastly, Tepig has a few support moves, such as Yawn, Will-O-Wisp, Roar, and Taunt. However, it lacks the defenses to use them and is much better off attacking.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Hippopotas can take a Flare Blitz and KO Tepig with Earthquake, making it a solid check. Wooper and Chinchou resist Fire- and Electric-type moves, making them good checks as well. Tepig is also very prone to revenge killing. Choice Scarf Darumaka can revenge kill with Rock Slide. Any little bit of outside damage that Tepig takes severely limits its lifespan, meaning that just hitting it can be a very effective way of dealing with it.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Tepig gets Thick Fat from the Dream World. Tepig already resists Fire- and Ice-type moves, which means this ability would be mostly useless. Blaze is better on Tepig anyway, as it frequently gets low on HP, leaving Thick Fat as an inferior but usable option.</p>
