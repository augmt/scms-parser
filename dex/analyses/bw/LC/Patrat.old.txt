[Overview]

<p>Patrat isn't exactly a Pokemon one would look to for a slot on a team, mainly because of its very low stats. It has a decent physical movepool but it lacks the power and Speed to sweep effectively. However, Patrat has one main use in Little Cup, since it can fulfill the role of a decent Baton Passer with access to Swords Dance and Work Up. Also, it has interesting moves such as Hypnosis and Super Fang that could be useful in certain situations. Overall, Patrat is a weak Pokemon that has a very small niche in Little Cup and should rarely be considered for use on a team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Patrat has access to Swords Dance and Work Up, two moves that it can pass to a suitable sweeper. Swords Dance is usually preferred since it is better for physical sweepers, but Work Up is viable since it can be passed to both physical and special sweepers. Hypnosis is a good choice in the third slot because sleep can cripple a Pokemon, and it gives at least one more turn to set up. Substitute provides protection and is a good choice if the accuracy of Hypnosis is too low to be desired. In the last slot, Return is a decent STAB move, but Crunch can deal a good amount of damage to the otherwise dangerous Gastly.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Gastly can't be touched by this set outside of Hypnosis or Crunch and can easily set up a Substitute to take advantage of the situation. Pawniard and Houndour are good teammates for Patrat because they can both KO Gastly and benefit from the stat boosts Patrat provides. Faster Fighting-types such as Mienfoo can easily get in a super effective Drain Punch. Duskull can handle those Fighting-types, meaning that it can be an excellent teammate. Finally, Hippopotas and Vullaby can take a hit and phaze any stat boosts away, making Patrat basically useless.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Super Fang is an option, but Return usually does more damage after a Swords Dance boost, making it an inferior option. Patrat learns Dig, Iron Tail, Pursuit, and Revenge, but it lacks the Attack stat to do any sweeping with these moves. Mean Look may be an option for trapping Pokemon, although it is more likely that Patrat will trap a counter switching in on it. Toxic could be used to cripple bulky Pokemon, but Patrat is usually better off trying to attack. Endure and Flail could be used, but priority, Hail, and Sandstorm all ruin the strategy. A mixed or physically offensive set with Eviolite is an option, but other Pokemon are much better at it than Patrat is.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Ghost-types are great if Patrat lacks Crunch thanks to their immunity to Normal-type moves. Vullaby and Hippopotas can phaze Patrat away easily and can heal off any damage taken later in the battle. Fighting-types can KO Patrat quite easily, making them very solid checks. Dwebble with Shell Smash can easily set up a boost or two on Patrat and then sweep through the opposing team.</p>
