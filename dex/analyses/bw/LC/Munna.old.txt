[Overview]

<p>Like most Psychic-types in Little Cup, Munna is often overlooked due to its poor offensive and defensive typing. Even at second glance, Munna appears severely outclassed by its fellow Generation V Psychic-type, Solosis, who can perform the same roles with a higher Special Attack stat and better ability, Magic Guard. However, this bulkier Drowzee cousin is capable of distinguishing itself from other slow Psychic-types with 76/45/55 defenses and access to support moves such as Yawn, Magic Coat, and Hypnosis. All things considered, Munna is able to hold its own in the Little Cup metagame provided it does not attempt an outclassed role.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Munna's laughable Speed stat makes it an excellent user of Trick Room, turning the odds against the many Pokemon that rely on Speed to succeed. Psychic is Munna's strongest and most reliable STAB move and utilizes its acceptable Special Attack stat. Hidden Power Fighting gives Munna excellent neutral coverage bar opposing Psychic-types. However, attacking is best left to dedicated Trick Room sweepers since no EVs are invested in Munna's Special Attack, and you wouldn't want to waste precious turns dishing out inadequate damage. Yawn and Hypnosis are both used to cause an opponent to switch and prevent certain threats from setting up, and also allow Munna to use Trick Room in safety. Yawn is the preferred option due to its higher accuracy, but Hypnosis can be an option if you find the one turn wait unappealing. Eviolite adds to Munna's bulk, allowing it to reliably take a hit and set up Trick Room.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Relaxed nature is always used over a Modest or Quiet nature because Munna's bulk is one of two reasons to use it over Solosis to set up Trick Room. The other reason is Munna's access to sleep-inducing moves, allowing it to set up more easily than Solosis can. The EVs on this set are meant to give Munna as much overall bulk as possible and 2 Speed IVs give it the lowest Speed possible while maintaining a 70 Base Power Hidden Power Fighting. Psyshock is an option over Psychic for the usual reasons, specifically to deal with special tanks such as Munchlax and Mantyke.</p>

<p>After Sleep Clause has been activated, bulky opponents such as Scraggy can switch in and set up on Munna, easily tanking its unboosted attacks. Toxic in the fourth slot could possibly remedy this problem, but faster opponents and Guts sweepers will appreciate Toxic more than Hypnosis. Toxic Spikes also cripple Munna, so Natu and slow Poison-types make good teammates. Since Munchlax outspeeds Munna under Trick Room, a Fighting-type such as Timburr can be helpful.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Stored Power / Psychic
move 3: Hidden Power Fighting
move 4: Moonlight / Shadow Ball
item: Eviolite
ability: Synchronize
nature: Bold
evs: 228 HP / 224 SpA / 8 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>After just one Calm Mind, Munna reaches 27 Special Defense and 24 Special Attack, giving it a significant amount of bulk and offensive capability. Though Psychic is a more reliable STAB, Stored Power is the preferred option here, as it outdamages Psychic after two Calm Minds. Hidden Power Fighting gives Munna enough additional coverage to hit everything in Little Cup at least neutrally, bar opposing Psychic-types. Moonlight gives Munna recovery, but Shadow Ball can be used to hit those Psychic-types, as well as opposing Ghost-types, for super effective damage. A Bold nature gives Munna an even Defense stat, thus maximizing Eviolite's 1.5x boost, while its ability, Synchronize, can help to deter the opponent from using crippling status moves</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Munna's superior bulk separates it from Solosis, so it is important that you take advantage of what it has to offer defensively. Psyshock is another option to hit Munchlax and Manytke from the physical side, but as always, the lower Base Power should be taken into consideration. Hypnosis is viable over Moonlight or Shadow Ball to cripple opponents that wall Munna, but it is generally unreliable due to its shaky accuracy.</p>

<p>One of the easiest ways to counter Munna is to exploit its low Speed; users of Taunt, status, or super effective moves come to mind in this category. Weather that isn't sun also poses a problem for Munna if it uses Moonlight, so Hippopotas and Snover can revenge kill a weakened Munna without worrying about it healing off the damage. This set appreciates entry hazard support, so Ferroseed and other Spikes users can make good teammates. Munna also hates Ghost-types and other Psychic-types, so a strong Dark-type such as Scraggy or Pawniard can help deal with said threats. </p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Magic Coat
move 4: Yawn
item: Light Clay
ability: Synchronize
nature: Bold
evs: 228 HP / 76 Def / 60 SpA / 76 SpD / 4 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Munna's natural bulk lets it reliably set up dual screens. The choice of which screen to use first depends on the opponent's team; foes with high Attack warrant a Reflect first to provide more safety, whereas Light Screen does the same against opposing special attackers. Yawn can be used to prevent sweepers from setting up on Munna, and Magic Coat prevents it from being Taunt bait and having entry hazards laid down in front of it. With Magic Coat, Munna does not fear Taunt, so it does not mind the lack of attacking moves. </p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>4 Speed EVs allow Munna to outrun certain tanks without any Speed investment, such as Ferroseed and Bronzor. Despite its fear of Taunt being alleviated by Magic Coat, Munna needs a teammate who is capable of blocking Brick Break, so Ghost-type sweepers such as Gastly make good teammates. Munna also does not appreciate Toxic Spikes, so Natu or a grounded Poison-type like Stunky can function as a good teammate. Pokemon that benefit from the increased protection of dual screens such as Scraggy, Zorua, and Dratini pair well; the first two have added benefit of eliminating Dark- and Ghost-type Pokemon that scare Munna with super effective moves.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Munna doesn't have many other decent options other than RestTalk, Energy Ball, and Charge Beam. However, Munna is outclassed as a RestTalker by Mantyke and Munchlax. Energy Ball usually cannot find a slot due to its inferior coverage. Baton Pass can be used on Munna to pass on boosts from moves such as Calm Mind. Munna also can set up screens and then Baton Pass out, to be re-used again later in the game. Charge Beam is possible because it occasionally boosts Munna's Special Attack, but Munna is better off using Calm Mind to increase its bulk so it is not outclassed by Solosis. Furthermore, the lack of STAB on the move makes it relatively weak; thus, Charge Beam is best left to Electric-types such as Magnemite.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Houndour, Sandile, and Pawniard are all examples of Dark-types who can come in on a Stored Power or Psychic and deal heavy damage to Munna. Fighting-types with access to Brick Break counter the Dual Screens set but must watch out for Psychic; Scraggy gets a special mention because of its additional Dark typing, making it immune to Psychic and letting it threaten Munna with its STAB moves. Special tanks such as Munchlax and Mantyke won't mind taking a Hidden Power Fighting or Psychic and can deal a decent amount of damage to the Trick Room and Dual Screens sets. Opposing Psychic-types are also problematic for Munna if it lacks Shadow Ball.</p>
