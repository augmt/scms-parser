[Overview]

<p>Timburr is one of many Fighting-types running rampant in Little Cup. While it appears to be completely outclassed by Scraggy and Mienfoo, thanks to the former's higher defenses and the latter's higher offensive stats, one might wonder why anyone would ever use Timburr. Firstly, Timburr boasts a high Attack stat and has excellent moves to back it up, such as Drain Punch and Mach Punch. Secondly, Timburr is bulky; with a high base HP stat and Eviolite, Timburr has little problems switching into many of Little Cup's top-tier threats. Unfortunately, Timburr has a very low Speed stat, which means that it's rather easy to revenge kill. Don't let this fault discourage you from using this bulky monster, though, as it will prove to be an excellent member of your team if provided with the correct support.</p>

ability: Guts
nature: Careful
evs: 76 HP / 196 Atk / 236 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Timburr's best and most popular set. Bulk Up boosts Timburr's already high Attack stat to turn it into an offensive juggernaut, and at the same time lets Timburr take physical attacks exceptionally well. Drain Punch further increases Timburr's longevity by restoring its health, and also hits relatively hard. Mach Punch somewhat compensates for Timburr's mediocre Speed stat and allows it to take down speedy foes such as Snover, Murkrow, and Scraggy. Payback rounds off the set by giving Timburr a powerful option against Misdreavus; it 2HKOes the ghost on a predicted switch.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Guts is the ability of choice as it allows Timburr to switch into Scald and Will-O-Wisp without fear and boosts Timburr's Attack if it is burned. The given spread enables Timburr to check the likes of Snover and Misdreavus with Drain Punch and Payback, respectively. A more physically defensive spread of 76 HP / 196 Atk / 156 Def / 76 SpD can be used to set up on physical attackers, although the loss of special bulk is noticeable. Eviolite is the item of choice as it boosts Timburr's defenses enormously and transforms Timburr into a incredibly bulky attacker.</p>

<p>Timburr has some flexibility when it comes to other moveslots on this set. Rock Slide can be used over Payback to take down Larvesta, who hits hard enough to break through Timburr's defenses while resisting its Fighting-type STAB. Toxic is useful to cripple the likes of Vullaby, Slowpoke, Shelmet, and Duskull, who are all good Timburr counters.</p>

<p>As Timburr can easily take down Croagunk, one of the best Fighting-type counters in the tier, Fighting-types that appreciate the removal of Croagunk make for fine partners. Scraggy can sweep teams with ease after Croagunk is gone and will not have to waste a valuable moveslot on Zen Headbutt. Timburr can also easily get rid of Mienfoo, who is another one of Scraggy's biggest counters.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Timburr has a pretty good movepool to work with. It can use a Substitute + Focus Punch set, but forgoing Drain Punch, one of Timburr's best moves, is foolish. An all-out attacking Life Orb or Choice Band set can let Timburr hit incredibly hard, but those sets are outclassed to an extent by Mienfoo due to its higher Speed stat and access to High Jump Kick. Brick Break is cool for breaking screens, but Timburr is better off using Drain Punch because of its useful recovery effect. Hammer Arm hits incredibly hard and lowers Timburr's Speed, which almost always ensures that Payback hits at 100 Base Power, but the low accuracy is discouraging. A status Orb set that makes use of Guts lets Timburr hit absurdly hard for a short period of time, but drastically reduces Timburr's longevity. Timburr can also act as a bulky weather supporter as it has access to Sunny Day and Rain Dance.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Timburr's best checks are faster threats that can take it out with ease. Abra can take out Timburr with a swift Psychic and fears nothing from Timburr as long as it is holding a Focus Sash. Murkrow might take a lot of damage from a boosted Mach Punch, but it can dispatch Timburr with Brave Bird. Similarly, Taillow and Doduo can easily remove Timburr with Brave Bird.</p>

<p>There are some Pokemon that wall Timburr with ease. Vullaby can Taunt Timburr and proceed to finish it off with either Air Slash or Brave Bird. Shelmet can boost alongside Timburr with Acid Armor, then set up Spikes. Slowpoke takes little damage from any of Timburr's moves and can take it out with STAB Psychic. Larvesta can switch into any of Timburr's STAB moves and deal massive amounts of damage with Flare Blitz. Koffing takes very little from any of Timburr's moves, has access to Clear Smog to ignore stat boosts, and can use Sludge Bomb to hit Timburr on its weaker Special Defense stat. Although uncommon, Zubat can Taunt Timburr, Super Fang it to lower its health, and then proceed to Brave Bird it into oblivion while taking little damage from any of Timburr's moves. Duskull, though even less common than Zubat, takes very little damage from most of Timburr's moves and can take it down with a series of Shadow Balls.</p>
