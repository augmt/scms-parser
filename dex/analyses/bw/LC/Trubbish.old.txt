[Overview]

<p>Trubbish is unique in Little Cup as the only Pokemon with access to Clear Smog, Toxic Spikes, and Spikes, making it an excellent support Pokemon. It can stop set-up sweepers in their tracks whilst setting up entry hazards of its own. Additionally, it is one of the bulkiest Poison-types in the metagame, especially with Eviolite, making it an excellent choice for any stall or balanced team. Unfortunately, however, Trubbish lacks recovery outside of Oran Berry, and has a fairly limited movepool.</p>

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>With access to Toxic Spikes, Trubbish makes an excellent utility Pokemon. In a metagame where bulky, grounded Pokemon are staples, Toxic Spikes is a good addition to any team. Unfortunately, most of the Pokemon who can set them up cannot do much else besides that. Trubbish not only has the ability to set up entry hazards, but can also stop set-up sweepers in their tracks using Clear Smog, which removes all of the opponents stat changes. This makes it an excellent check for Pokemon such as Scraggy and Dratini, who can't do much in return.</p>

<p>Trubbish's moveset is quite straightforward. Clear Smog allows it to bring most sweeps to a standstill, whilst Payback is for coverage, considering that Psychic-types are one of this set's main counters. Trubbish being one of the few Pokemon who can set up Toxic Spikes. Being a grounded Poison-type, Trubbish can also remove Toxic Spikes from its side of the field. Explosion allows Trubbish to deal last-minute damage to dangerous threats and Pokemon which its team would otherwise struggle to beat.<p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>Haze is usable over Clear Smog, but it is generally not advised as Clear Smog also causes damage while having the same effect. Spikes could also be used over Toxic Spikes or Explosion. It is worth noting that Trubbish is the only pure Poison-type user of Spikes, and one of the few Pokemon with access to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Other than that, Trubbish doesn't have many viable options.</p>

<p>In terms of items, Eviolite is the superior option, as without the added defense boosts, super effective moves such as Earthquake would be able to OHKO Trubbish with ease, preventing it from laying hazards. Oran Berry can, however, be used if you prefer the recovery.</p>

<p>Frillish makes a superb teammate to Trubbish because it can act as a bulky spinblocker, preventing Rapid Spin users such as Staryu from blowing away the entry hazards that Trubbish sets up. Pokemon that benefit from Toxic Spikes, such as Lickitung, also make excellent partners to Trubbish. Diglett makes a superb partner for its ability to trap and KO Poison-types who would otherwise absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> 

[Other Options] 

<p>A Curse set consisting of Payback, Gunk Shot, and Return is possible; Trubbish's limited movepool and mediocre offensive stats, however, prevent it from being very effective. It could also make use of Stockpile, increasing its already impressive bulk. Trubbish also has the ability to set up Rain Dance and Sunny Day, being one of the few Poison-types to be able to do so.</p>

[Checks and Counters] 

<p>Due to its poor defensive typing, anything with a strong super effective move, such as Drilbur, can reliably beat Trubbish. Additionally, Pokemon who resist Trubbish's moves, such as Gastly, also set up on it.</p>

<p>Due to Explosion's nerf, Trubbish is completely useless against most Steel-types. Pokemon such as Bronzor and Ferroseed can switch into Trubbish with impunity and proceed to set up entry hazards or, in Bronzor's case, KO Trubbish with STAB Psychic. Perhaps the most dangerous Trubbish counter is Pawniard as it is unaffected by Clear Smog, allowing it to set up with Swords Dance in Trubbish's face. Other Poison-types such as Tentacool limit Trubbish's effectiveness greatly because they absorb Toxic Spikes.</p>
