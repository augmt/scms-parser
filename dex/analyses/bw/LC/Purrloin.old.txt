[Overview]

<p>Purrloin is one of the most underrated and unpredictable Pokemon in all of Little Cup. With exceptional early-game and late-game viability, Purrloin can be an intimidating threat mutilating the opposing Pokemon with status moves, aided by its ability, Prankster. The opponent will have to play with the constant annoyance of having their Pokemon locked into the same move by Encore, getting confused by Swagger, and inflicted with paralysis. Sadly, Purrloin is easily checked by many Fighting-types and sweepers abundant in the metagame. However, when played right, the little feline fits into a unique niche of utilizing U-turn and Encore, making it tough to beat. With many fearsome attributes, Purrloin can be beneficial on any team, providing good support and annoying the opponent senseless.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set can turn the tide of battle by utilizing Purrloin's ability, Prankster. With access to both Encore and U-turn, Purrloin can scout potential switches and provide its teammates with opportunities to set up on the opponent, all while dealing additional damage with U-turn. With 17 Speed, Purrloin can be played offensively with Swagger and Foul Play or as a supporter with Thunder Wave and Knock Off. Thunder Wave cripples threats, such as Mienfoo, that frequently switch out with U-turn. On the other hand, Swagger can possibly force the opposing Pokemon to deal a large amount of damage to itself while or force switches. Either option is best used after locking a Pokemon into Encore or on a predicted switch. Knock Off cripples Pokemon that rely on Eviolite to enhance their overall bulk, allowing your team's sweepers to break through them more efficiently.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs in HP and Defense with Eviolite allow Purrloin to tank more attacks than it usually could, providing acceptable longevity. Taunt can be used in the third moveslot if you would like a reliable way to counter entry hazards. Pursuit can be used in the final moveslot if you wish to play more aggressively and have problems with Ghost-type Pokemon, namely Gastly and Drifloon.</p>

<p>Purrloin works well when entry hazards are up because of its ability to force switches. Natu is a useful teammate to Purrloin since it can prevent status and entry hazards from crippling Purrloin and deal with Fighting-type Pokemon. Purrloin works well with setup sweepers such as Tirtouga and Scraggy as they need time to set up, something Purrloin can provide with its status moves. Strong Pokemon that deal with Fighting-types easily, such as Taillow and Abra, work well with Purrloin. Purrloin needs a team that can take hits, so bulky Pokemon, such as Misdreavus and Slowpoke, are also good teammates.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>An Unburden set may not be a bad idea on Purrloin if you're looking to throw off opponents with an unconventional sweeper. Rain Dance can be used to interrupt ongoing weather or to create a hybrid Rain Dance team. Trick with Choice Specs can be used to severely disrupt the opponent's sweepers, along with Pokemon reliant on their items.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Purrloin does not fare well against Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr because they can usually OHKO it with their powerful STAB moves. Physical setup sweepers such as Scraggy and Pawniard can counter Purrloin easily; however, they need to be wary of Swagger and Encore. Mold Breaker Drilbur and Magic Guard Abra are excellent counters to Purrloin due to their abilities and offensive presence. Shed Skin Dratini and Scraggy can be a problem for Purrloin, but they should focus on hitting with brute strength as their primary strategy. Natu's ability, Magic Bounce, can reflect Purrloin's status moves, but Purrloin's Knock Off can be troublesome, as Natu's defenses suffer a major drop when Eviolite is removed. However, all of its counters must be wary of Confusion hax.</p>
