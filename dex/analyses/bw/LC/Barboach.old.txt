[Overview]

<p>Although Barboach isn't one of the most common Pokemon in LC, that shouldn't mean it should be overlooked. Being one of the few Pokemon in Little Cup with access to Dragon Dance, in addition to two great STABs in Water and Ground, Barboach can inflict a lot of damage with only a single boost. However, that's where the list of proficiencies ends for Barboach. Unfortunately for Barboach, it can be taken down pretty easily by most Choice Scarf Pokemon as well as dedicated physical walls. In addition, Barboach's only viable item is Eviolite, as its defenses are quite low. This makes it harder for Barboach to sweep because it can't run Life Orb.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With Eviolite raising its defenses, Barboach's solid defensive typing, and a single weakness to Grass-type moves, Barboach can efficiently run a solid Dragon Dance set. Thanks to its typing, Barboach can set up on the likes of Bronzor, Dwebble, Magnemite lacking Hidden Power Grass, and Thunderbolt-locked Chinchou. Earthquake and Waterfall are great STAB attacks for Barboach, providing great coverage against the whole tier. Bounce is effective against most Grass-types that decide to stay in against Barboach, while Return provides more immediate damage and smacks Mantyke for a lot of damage. Eviolite is almost required on this set because it will give Barboach the ability to set up Dragon Dance easier. Anticipation is a reliable ability as it allows Barboach to see if the opponent has a super effective Grass-type attack, such as Hidden Power Grass.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Adamant nature is suggested because it will provide Barboach with more immediate power, while an Impish nature allows Barboach to tank hits better while setting up. Furthermore, it gives Barboach more staying power versus priority users, most notably Croagunk. Spikes and Stealth Rock are important for Barboach as they provide the crucial damage needed for Barboach to score KOs. Dwebble, Bronzor, and Ferroseed are all great examples of teammates, as all but the former resist Barboach's only weakness. A teammate who can stop Grass-types is also important, such as Ponyta and Houndour. Dual screen support is nice, as it will cushion damage from attacks while Barboach sets up.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Life Orb is always an option for additional power, but Eviolite is almost a necessity as it is an extremely helpful buffer against priority and weaker attacks. A Choice Scarf can be used to hit 24 Speed, but with only 14 Attack, Barboach's attacks will be quite weak. Toxic can be used against Lileep, but Fighting-type teammates are preferred. Hydration could be combined with Rain Dance and Rest, but the predominance of Hippopotas and Snover make it a poor choice. It could run a special attacking set with Hydro Pump, Earth Power, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power Fire, but it doesn't have the power to do much damage with those attacks. It has Aqua Tail, but the drop in accuracy, and the inability to potentially flinch, makes Waterfall the better choice. Finally, Spark kills Mantyke but is illegal with Dragon Dance.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Ferroseed and Lileep take neutral damage from Bounce, and easily tank Barboach's Earthquakes while KOing back with their STAB Grass-type attacks. Slowpoke and Frillish can also fend off hits and burn Barboach with Scald or Will-O-Wisp, respectively. A Choice Scarf Snover can KO Barboach with Giga Drain if Barboach hasn't boosted its Speed with Dragon Dance, while Wooper with Unaware can take anything Barboach can dish out and ignore any Dragon Dance boosts. Finally, Cottonee can Encore Dragon Dance and tank attacks courtesy of Cotton Guard, as well as paralyzing it with Stun Spore or sapping its health with Leech Seed.</p>
