[Overview]

<p>Hoothoot is not an impressive Pokemon at first glance, with meager stats outside of its decent HP and Special Defense. To make things worse, it needs to differentiate itself from Vullaby, which outclasses Hoothoot in nearly every role. Luckily, Hoothoot learns two useful moves, Reflect and Hypnosis, which allow it to do just that. Overall, Hoothoot isn't too good, but it's decent when taking advantage of the quirks that make it unique.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hoothoot's good special bulk and access to Reflect make it a solid defensive Pokemon. Reflect provides good team support, especially useful in a metagame filled with Fighting-types. Roost provides Hoothoot with a much needed form of recovery. Air Slash is Hoothoot's best attacking move, hitting Fighting-types super effectively. Hypnosis is the optimal move in the last slot, as sleep is a very potent status effect; it is also something else to set Hoothoot apart from Vullaby. Alternatively, Whirlwind is an option for phazing, and is useful if Hypnosis's low accuracy is undesired.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An EV spread of 196 HP / 36 Def / 228 SpD / 36 Spe can be used for added special bulk, but Hoothoot is 2HKOed by most special attackers anyway. The aforementioned EV spread, however, does make Hoothoot a good check to Hypnosis Gastly that lack Thunderbolt, so it can be useful if your team is weak to it. Lileep is a great teammate for Hoothoot, as it beats most Chinchou, a good counter to this set, handily. Magnemite has a useful 4x resist to Air Slash, so it is also another solid counter. Wooper and Hippopotas can deal with Magnemite rather easily. Magnemite itself is also a fantastic teammate for Hoothoot, as it resists all of Hoothoot's weaknesses. In return, Hoothoot is immune to the Ground-type moves that Magnemite fears.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hoothoot has Tinted Lens, which is normally a useful ability, but it is illegal with moves such as Heat Wave and Silver Wind. Hoothoot's Special Attack is also much too low for this to work well. It does, however, have Agility, Work Up, Psychic, Hidden Power, and Shadow Ball if you want to use Hoothoot offensively. Psycho Shift could work, mainly as a way to rid status inflicted on Hoothoot. Toxic is an interesting choice over Hypnosis if used on a stall team, as Hoothoot can stall out many Pokemon with its high defenses and Reflect. Mirror Move could be useful against Dwebble, allowing Hoothoot to set up Spikes or Stealth Rock as Dwebble does. If Reflect is up, even Rock Blast can be copied to deal major damage back. Feather Dance could also work against a physical Pokemon, but Hoothoot has Reflect, which is usually better. Magic Coat is always a great option, and Hoothoot can make good use of it. Finally, Hoothoot can set up Tailwind, though it can't use it effectively. Reflect and Tailwind are a great combination to help Scraggy set up, however, so it could be worthwhile.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Most of Hoothoot's potential counters need to watch out for Hypnosis, but once something is put to sleep, Hoothoot is much easier to deal with. Chinchou is the best counter, especially RestTalk variants that can absorb Hypnosis quite safely. Magnemite also easily beats Hoothoot thanks to its resistance to Air Slash and powerful STAB moves. Dwebble sets up on Hoothoot that lack Mirror Move or Magic Coat. Snover can't take Air Slash well, but its STAB Blizzard deals a great amount of damage.</p>
