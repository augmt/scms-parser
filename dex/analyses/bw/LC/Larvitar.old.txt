[Overview]

<p>With a fantastic ability in Guts and two good boosting moves in Rock Polish and Dragon Dance, Larvitar makes a great setup sweeper. Not only that, but Larvitar hits just enough Speed to outspeed all unboosted Pokemon after a Dragon Dance. It also gets near-perfect coverage with its dual STAB attacks. Unfortunately, Larvitar has weaknesses to common priority attacks such as Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, Vacuum Wave, and Bullet Punch, which really limits its effectiveness.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>As a set-up sweeper, Larvitar can run a threatening boosting set with either Dragon Dance or Rock Polish as its boosting move. Dragon Dance is the preferred option, as it allows Larvitar to muscle through Pokemon holding an Eviolite. However, you can also use Rock Polish to outspeed all Choice Scarf users that have 17 Speed or less.</p>

<p>When using Dragon Dance, a Jolly nature is recommended as Larvitar will hit 21 Speed after a Dragon Dance, which is enough to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon, while still reaching a huge 36 Attack stat. However, when using Rock Polish, an Adamant nature is recommended, as Larvitar needs all the power it can get. A Jolly nature is still an option, though, to at least tie with all Choice Scarf users with 19 Speed or less, such as Murkrow. Earthquake is Larvitar's most reliable STAB move and a staple on any set. Stone Edge is the main option in the third moveslot because of its high Base Power which is further boosted by STAB. Rock Slide can also be used instead of Stone Edge for the higher accuracy it provides, but it loses out on a lot of power. Crunch is a more reliable move for hitting Misdreavus, but Facade is also a great option in the last slot, as its Base Power is doubled to a huge 140 when Larvitar is afflicted with a status condition.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Larvitar is extremely weak to Water- and Fighting-type priority attacks, often getting OHKOed by them. An Eviolite can be used to help survive priority attacks, but Larvitar will lose out on a lot of power and struggle to break through the defenses of bulky Pokemon. You can also use a Toxic Orb if you think Larvitar is going to stay in for three turns or less, but as Larvitar is meant to stay in, set up, and sweep for as long as possible, Flame Orb is usually the better choice.</p>

<p>When using Larvitar, having teammates that can switch into Water- and Fighting-type attacks is recommended. Croagunk is a great teammate, as it also has a resistance to Grass-type attacks and can set up Bulk Up on the opponent's switch. Frillish and Mantyke can also switch into Fighting- and Water-type attacks, while also having a resistance to Bullet Punch.</p>

<p>Wynaut is a great teammate for Larvitar as it can trap and Encore opponents, giving Larvitar time to set up; Encore support will give Larvitar one free turn to set up either Dragon Dance or Rock Polish.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Substitute can help Larvitar take priority attacks and eases prediction, but comes at the cost of a moveslot. Larvitar is also immune to status anyway, courtesy of Flame Orb and Guts. Outrage provides good neutral coverage, but its secondary effect makes it a bad option. Superpower hits Bronzor the hardest out of all of Larvitar's moves, but the Attack drop is undesirable. Curse can be used along with Sandstorm support and an Eviolite, but Larvitar's common 4x weaknesses make it a bad choice.</p>

<p>Larvitar can also run a Choice Scarf set, as it then outspeeds all unboosted Pokemon, hitting 21 Speed. It also has Guts and a Thunder Wave immunity to set it apart from other Choice Scarf users, but its lack of power lets it down. Larvitar can also run a Choice Band set as it makes a good status absorber with Guts, but it is slow and Earthquake is a terrible move to be locked into.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pokemon with powerful priority attacks are Larvitar's best checks. Aqua Jet users such as Tirtouga, Totodile, and Kabuto, as well as Mach Punch users such as Timburr, are good examples. Murkrow is ubiquitous and deals a minimum of 59% with Sucker Punch.</p>

<p>Choice Scarf users with super effective attacks, such as Chinchou and Mienfoo, can revenge kill Dragon Dance Larvitar easily. The Rock Polish set is much harder to revenge kill, as only Choice Scarf users with 20 Speed or higher, such as Diglett and Elekid, can revenge kill it. Fortunately, it is much easier to wall Rock Polish Larvitar, so using a bulky Pokemon such as Bronzor, Frillish, or Ferroseed should suffice.</p>

<p>Bronzor is probably the best counter to Larvitar, as it resists both of Larvitar's STAB attacks and can OHKO it with STAB Gyro Ball.</p>
