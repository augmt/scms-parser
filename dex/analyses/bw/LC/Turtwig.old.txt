[Overview]

<p>Turtwig seems like an odd choice when considering how little it has to offer in the new generation. Even with its acceptable Attack stat and defenses, its low Speed and poor coverage tend to be its downfall. The introduction of Eviolite also severely weakened its offensive capability by making many of its enemies more difficult to take down. However, not all is lost for this unfortunate turtle, as it retains its role as the only Grass-type in Little Cup that can set up both Stealth Rock and dual screens. Without many new options to utilize, Turtwig has much trouble finding its way on a team in the BW Little Cup metagame.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its unique ability to set up both dual screens and Stealth Rock, Turtwig is capable of being an effective team supporter. The goal of this set is to set up dual screens, and then to set up Stealth Rock. Though this will cost one turn of dual screens, this ensures that faster enemies will have a more difficult time taking Turtwig down before it lays down its entry hazard. The last slot is reserved for Turtwig's one offensive move, to prevent it from being shut down by Taunt. Seed Bomb is Turtwig's only decent STAB move on the physical side, but Hidden Power Fire is useful to deal with Cottonee.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If Turtwig has Hidden Power Fire, a Bold or Calm nature is a better option because without Seed Bomb, Turtwig has no use for its Attack stat. Eviolite is an option over Light Clay to give Turtwig more bulk, but it comes with the disadvantage of reducing the Reflect and Light Screen's duration. Turtwig can also make use of Hidden Power Ice to hit Dragon- and Flying-types, including Gligar.</p>

<p>Cottonee is perhaps the biggest threat to this set because it can come in at any time and stop Turtwig in its tracks with priority Taunt and Toxic, or even with Hidden Power Fire. Snover makes an excellent teammate in this department to scare away Cottonee, but Cottonee isn't as common as it used to be. Brick Break users are problematic, but the most common one, Pawniard, can be countered with a strong Fighting-type such as Mienfoo or Timburr. Sweepers like Clamperl also make good partners, as under dual screens and with Stealth Rock in play they can be very frightening.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Turtwig has a variety of options, but few can be utilized effectively. Like many Grass-types, Turtwig is capable of using SubSeed, but just like most of the others, it is outclassed by Cottonee and Ferroseed. Turtwig also has access to Growth, Curse, and Swords Dance, but cannot put them to much use due to its poor movepool. A support set with Stockpile is a decent alternative, but Turtwig has few other options to use with it. Giga Drain and Synthesis provide recovery, but without enough bulk to take more than a few hits outside of dual screens, these moves are rendered inefficient. A RestTalk or Trick Room set could be a good option if Turtwig didn't have so little to offer with its unboosted attacks in a metagame filled with so many Eviolite users.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Even under dual screens, it isn't very difficult to find a counter to Turtwig. Anything that can take a Seed Bomb or Hidden Power Fire and strike back with a super effective move is capable of checking Turtwig, but there are a few that get special mention. Again, Cottonee stops Turtwig with priority Taunt and Toxic and is at worst 2HKOed by Hidden Power Fire due to Turtwig's low Special Attack stat. Scraggy is bulky enough to take a Seed Bomb or Hidden Power Fire and set up while recovering back HP with Drain Punch. Pawniard can shatter dual screens and scare out Ghost-types that might switch in to take a Brick Break. Rapid Spinners such as Tentacool and Staryu resist Hidden Power Fire and can remove Stealth Rock, but must watch out for Seed Bomb.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Turtwig's Dream World ability is Shell Armor, which stops critical hits, but like all starters, it only comes on a level 10 male, so it is illegal in Little Cup.</p>
