[Overview]

<p>In terms of Little Cup play, Gible hasn't changed much since DPP. With its excellent Dragon- and Ground-type STABs, Gible is able to hit a large portion of the metagame very hard. However, with other Dragon-types Axew and Deino now prevalent, Gible finds it difficult to carve out a unique niche. Its greatest advantage in the metagame is Sand Veil, which gives it an evasion boost in sandstorm that will potentially allow it to set up a free Substitute, much like its big brother Garchomp. Maximizing Gible's potential from Sand Veil is your best option when using this little dragon.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When Sandstorm is in play, Gible is able to take advantage of one of its few unique points, which is the evasion boost gained from Sand Veil. By switching into a Choice-locked Electric-type attack from Chinchou or Magnemite, or by being brought out after a KO, Gible can easily find time to set up a Substitute. Outrage is very powerful and Gible's strongest STAB move, hitting many walls for heavy damage. Earthquake is one of Gible's prime advantages over Axew, hitting Steel-types that resist Outrage for super effective damage. Fire Blast allows Gible to destroy Ferroseed, which would otherwise tank its attacks with ease. With some luck, Gible will be able to knock out a few Pokemon, with Sand Veil keeping its Substitute intact.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Support from Hippopotas is a must, as Sand Stream activates the Sand Veil boost. Hippopotas is also very useful in setting up Stealth Rock, which helps Gible in scoring KOs. Dragon Claw has some utility over Outrage to give Gible a chance against Pokemon such as Gastly, which can stall out Outrage with Substitute, though the enormous boost in power will be missed. Ferroseed makes a good partner, as it absorbs Dragon- and Ice-type attacks aimed at Gible and sets up Spikes. Bronzor also makes for a solid teammate, resisting both of Gible's weaknesses and setting up screens to aid Gible's meager defenses.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>When using Gible, you have to make sure the set you're using is not better done by another Ground- or Dragon-type. A Choice Scarf set is potentially viable, as Gible hits 14 Speed with a positive nature, although with a relatively low Attack stat, it may have trouble revenge killing. Choice Band is also possible, though Deino and Axew offer more power.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gible is not terribly difficult to check, as with its frailty, almost anything that outspeeds it is a threat. When it comes to counters, Bronzor is immune to Earthquake, resists Outrage, and can wear down Gible with Psychic or Flash Cannon. Duskull can cripple Gible with Will-O-Wisp, although it must be wary of its shaky accuracy while sand is up. Shellder is bulky enough to withstand an Outrage and can KO through Substitute using Icicle Spear. Snover is particularly notable, because it removes Gible's Sand Veil boost and can easily KO with Blizzard or Ice Shard, though it must watch out for Fire Blast when Gible is still behind a Substitute.</p>
