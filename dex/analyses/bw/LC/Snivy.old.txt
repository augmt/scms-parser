[Overview]

<p>Say hello to the newest Grass-type starter: Snivy. Snivy was blessed with a cool design, but unfortunately cursed with mediocre stats and poor coverage. Despite these flaws, however, not all is bad for Snivy. As the only Grass-type in Little Cup with access to both dual screens and Taunt, it is still worthy of consideration when making a team.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Taunt
move 4: Leaf Storm / Giga Drain
item: Light Clay / Eviolite
nature: Timid
evs: 236 HP / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Access to Taunt makes Snivy capable of performing its job well. With enough Speed to outrun common walls such as Slowpoke and Lickitung, Snivy can set up dual screens and avoid becoming setup bait. Leaf Storm is Snivy's most powerful Grass-type attack, while Giga Drain provides modest recovery.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread gives Snivy as much Speed as possible. Light Clay is the recommended item to maximize the effectiveness of dual screens, but Eviolite is an alternative to give Snivy more bulk, which is useful against faster opponents such as Houndour, who can OHKO Snivy before it sets up. Toxic is an option in the fourth slot to deal with special walls and opponents that resist Grass-type moves, but running it means sacrificing Snivy's only attacking move. An alternate EV spread of 236 HP / 76 Def / 76 SpD / 92 Spe can be used with a Bold or Calm nature to give Snivy extra bulk, but this comes at the cost of being outsped by fast walls. Snivy already outruns common walls, such as Ferroseed and Slowpoke, but if you are worried about becoming setup fodder for faster sweepers and dual screen users, such as Baltoy, Spoink, and Mime Jr., Snivy should run full Speed.</p>

<p>Cottonee is able to outpace Snivy with a Prankster Taunt, shrugs off a Leaf Storm or Giga Drain, and can even retaliate with Hidden Power Fire. To counter it, teammates such as Stunky and Houndour are appreciated. Ironically, Scraggy, who is among Snivy's worst enemies, is also a good teammate, as it enjoys dual screen support. While Scraggy fares exceptionally well under dual screens, it is weak to Fighting-type moves, including Brick Break, and shares a Flying-type weakness. Clamperl, Cranidos, and Agility Chinchou also enjoy dual screens and can take Fire-type attacks aimed at Snivy, who discourages the use of Grass-, Ground-, and Electric-type moves, giving these Pokemon more room to switch in.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Snivy has access to boosting moves such as Coil, Swords Dance, and Growth, but it lacks the offensive stats to put them to good use. Mean Look traps opponents, but Snivy cannot do much to them afterward. SubSeed is another alternative, but Cottonee and Ferroseed are far superior options in this role, and that move combination is illegal with Mean Look due to breeding restrictions. Glare is an option on the dual screens set, but Toxic is more useful for killing bulky threats. Snivy can also use Pursuit on the dual screens set, but it does laughable damage even to opponents that switch out. Mirror Coat can work with a Focus Sash, but a set using it would be very risky with the abundance of weather, entry hazards, and priority.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Due to its access to Taunt, there are few Pokemon who can prevent Snivy from performing its job before going down. However, Cottonee outpaces Snivy with a Prankster Taunt, and Magic Bounce Natu fears nothing from Taunt, setting up dual screens of its own while shaking off Leaf Storm or Giga Drain. Brick Break users, such as Pawniard, can shatter dual screens, and faster threats, such as Houndour, can outspeed Snivy and strike it down if it hasn't set them up yet. The rarely seen Mime Jr. can imitate Snivy's efforts and Taunt tactics and outspeeds bulky Snivy. Wynaut can hinder Snivy by trapping it but cannot do much in return.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Snivy's Dream World ability, Contrary, would be useful in conjunction with Leaf Storm, increasing instead of decreasing its Special Attack by two stages.</p>
