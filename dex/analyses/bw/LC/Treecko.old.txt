[Overview]

<p>Treecko has only gone further downhill since DPP. This unfortunate little gecko struggles to adapt against new threats such as Ferroseed and Larvesta as well as old enemies such as Houndour and Bronzor. Yet, with a passable base 70 Speed and base 65 Special Attack, Treecko stands out as one of the few attacking Grass-types in Little Cup that does not rely on the weather. Overall, Treecko might not always be the best choice for a team, but it's definitely worth considering for originality or to fulfill a particular niche.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Treecko's attacking lead set from DPP is still perfectly capable of functioning in the BW metagame. Leaf Storm is Treecko's most powerful STAB move and hits common leads such as Hippopotas very hard. Hidden Power Fire provides excellent additional coverage, smacking Grass- and Steel-types switching in to soak up Leaf Storm, such as Snover, Ferroseed, and Bronzor. Giga Drain serves as an alternative STAB that also provides recovery in a pinch. Quick Attack is used in the last slot to finish off weakened enemies and frail sweepers such as Wingull.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Hasty nature gives Treecko slightly more Special Defense, while a Naive nature brings both defensive stats up to 15 when using Eviolite. Eviolite is the preferred item here to help Treecko take more attacks, but Focus Sash can also be used to ensure that Treecko gets at least one hit in before going down.  Be aware, though, that priority and weather can render the Focus Sash useless. Endeavor and Counter can be used over Giga Drain and Quick Attack if Treecko is using a Focus Sash, but this strategy is often too risky for use.</p>

<p>Ferroseed and Bronzor can heavily dent Treecko with Gyro Ball and Hidden Power Ice, respectively, if they can avoid switching into an attack. Treecko also has problems with Dragon-types such as Dratini, which wall it. Meowth and Houndour, which were among Treecko's counters last generation, are still two threats that Treecko is unable to take on. Larvesta and Litwick can switch into any move Treecko has and retaliate with a super effective STAB move. Aron and other Rock-types can get rid of Larvesta and Meowth, while Houndour can be dealt with by using a bulky Water-type such as Omanyte.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Though Treecko has a higher Special Attack stat, access to Swords Dance and a better physical movepool make it a decent physical sweeper. Bullet Seed and Drain Punch both became more powerful this generation, allowing Treecko to use them more effectively. Bullet Seed is Treecko's best physical STAB move, and the fact that it breaks through Substitutes means that users of the move will be unable to effectively check Treecko. Drain Punch replaces Giga Drain as a source of recovery while still hitting most Steel-types hard. Rock Slide is the preferred option for superior coverage, but Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Dragon-types and opposing Grass-types harder.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>3 HP IVs keeps Hidden Power Ice at 70 Base Power while giving Treecko 19 HP, minimizing Life Orb recoil. Eviolite is an option over Life Orb for the extra bulk, but Treecko usually needs the increased damage output. A Naive nature should be used if Hidden Power Ice is used, while a Jolly nature is the recommended option if Treecko is using Rock Slide. Return and Acrobatics are other options in the fourth slot to hit Croagunk, but they offer less coverage than the aforementioned options. Substitute is an alternative to a coverage move in the fourth slot to avoid getting downed by priority and Choice Scarf users. The choice between Hidden Power Ice and Rock Slide determines what Treecko's teammates should be able to take down. If Treecko lacks Hidden Power Ice, then Croagunk will be able to take any of its moves with ease. However, if Treecko doesn't have Rock Slide, then Litwick and Larvesta will resist all of its attacks.</p>

<p>A good Fire- or Psychic-type can be used to scare away Croagunk, the former also being able to take the Fire-, Bug-, and Ice-type attacks aimed at Treecko. Litwick and Larvesta aren't very common, but nevertheless, Chinchou and Slowpoke are recommended to deal with these foes. As with any other sweeper, Treecko also likes dual screen and entry hazard support, and Baltoy and Turtwig have access to all of them. Both share an Ice-type weakness with Treecko, but this is usually covered by the previously mentioned teammates such as Chinchou, Slowpoke, and Houndour.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Choice items might seem like a good idea, but they are not recommended due to Treecko's average attacking stats. Crunch and Pursuit hit Ghost- and Psychic-types, but they offer inferior coverage to Treecko's other moves. Treecko also has access to Leech Seed and Synthesis, but its frailty prevents it from being able to use them effectively. Energy Ball is an excellent STAB move, but Giga Drain is superior because it provides recovery. Brick Break is another good option, but like Energy Ball, it is outclassed by a recovery move. Grass Whistle would be a good alternative on the Lead set if it weren't for its poor accuracy. Lastly, Treecko has Agility, which could work on its own set had Treecko been blessed with higher offenses.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Like many fast sweepers, Treecko hates priority users; Croagunk in particular resists most of its attacks on both sets. Treecko is also easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users such as Houndour and Chinchou. Litwick is problematic for both sets as it can take all of Treecko's attacks bar Rock Slide and the rarely seen Crunch and OHKO with a STAB Fire Blast. Bulky Poison-types such as Skorupi can come in on Bullet Seed and Drain Punch and strike down Treecko with a STAB attack. Ferroseed and Bronzor take even a Drain Punch comfortably and threaten a KO with Gyro Ball or, in Bronzor's case, Hidden Power Ice.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Treecko's Dream World ability is Unburden, which doubles its Speed if its item is used up or removed. This ability would be more useful than Overgrow for Treecko, but unfortunately, it only comes on a Level 10 male Treecko, making it illegal in Little Cup.</p>
