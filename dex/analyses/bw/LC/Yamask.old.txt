[Overview]

<p>At a glance, Yamask doesn't look particularly special. It has a generic Ghost typing, a shallow movepool, and low Speed. However, it does bring a few useful moves, such as Trick Room and Nasty Plot, and an interesting new ability to the table. With these tools in tandem with its great defenses and usable Special Attack, Yamask can play a couple of roles reasonably well, the most effective one being that of a Trick Room abuser. While Yamask certainly isn't winning any awards for creativity, it can at least become a dangerous sweeper when given the opportunity to set up.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Due to its great defenses and usable Special Attack, Yamask can effectively set up Trick Room in order to sweep the opposition while still supporting your team. Yamask's pure Ghost typing means that its only weaknesses are Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, providing it with ample opportunities to set up Trick Room repeatedly throughout a match. Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting provide perfect coverage, allowing Yamask to sweep without fear of being resisted. Once Trick Room is set up, switch out to your dedicated Trick Room sweeper or have Yamask start boosting its Special Attack with Nasty Plot. After a single boost, Yamask reaches 30 Special Attack, which is capable of denting even the strongest of walls, such as Munchlax. Oran Berry helps restore a significant amount of health once Yamask is weakened, giving it more chances to set up Trick Room and sweep.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Special Defense and HP EVs complement Yamask's naturally high Defense stat, making it fairly bulky. The rest of the EVs are placed into Special Attack to boost its offensive capabilities.</p>

<p>Since Yamask is likely to set up Trick Room, Trick Room sweepers are obligatory partners. Sweepers such as Porygon, Aron, and Wailmer can plow through the opponent's team under Trick Room. If you're using Yamask on a dedicated Trick Room team, then another Trick Room supporter such as Bronzor or Slowpoke is mandatory. Other slow, powerful Pokemon such as Munchlax and Cubone will find Yamask's Trick Room a blessing as well, as they can now outspeed most foes and put their attacking prowess to good use.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Hex
move 3: Hidden Power Fighting
move 4: Will-O-Wisp
item: Oran Berry

evs: 212 HP / 80 Def / 160 SpD / 40 Spe

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>By utilizing its respectful bulk, Yamask can accumulate multiple Calm Mind boosts and then sweep through the opponent's team. After just two Calm Minds, Yamask reaches 24 Special Attack and 30 Special Defense, making it quite bulky and threatening at the same time. Thanks to its typing and its ability, Mummy, the opponent will switch out more often than not when faced with Yamask, allowing it to net that extra Calm Mind boost. Will-O-Wisp and Hex is a combination that can cause havoc upon your foe. Will-O-Wisp drains the opponent's health, reduces their Attack, and doubles the Base Power of Hex, making it the ideal status move for Yamask's arsenal. Hidden Power Fighting provides flawless coverage alongside Hex by hitting Dark- and Steel-types for super effective damage. Oran Berry is there to restore a good chunk of health and hopefully give Yamask another chance at sweeping.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The HP, Defense, and Special Defense EVs are designed to take advantage of Yamask's natural bulk, boosting its ability to set up Calm Mind in the face of attacks, which helps Yamask fulfill its ultimate goal of sweeping. The remaining EVs are placed in Speed in an attempt to boost Yamask's meager base Speed and allow it to outspeed defensive threats such as Bronzor and Duskull.</p>

<p>This set can easily be checked by faster Ghost-types such as Gastly, which can KO Yamask before it has a chance to set up. For this reason, pairing Yamask up with other bulky attackers is not a bad idea. Munchlax is a great candidate as it is immune to Ghost-type attacks and has Pursuit to remove the mentioned threats. With Will-O-Wisp and Mummy, Yamask can help other members of your team, such as Pawniard, sweep easier as well. Encore users such as Cottonee are another major threat to this set, since Yamask's sweep will be ruined if one of its non-damaging moves gets Encored. As such, it is best to switch out to a heavy-damage dealer such as Aron to smash them. In the case of Cottonee, Paras is a suitable partner as it not only has X-Scissor to slice the cotton ball, but is also immune to Leech Seed.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Yamask has an incredibly limited movepool which gives it less variety and creativity. Hidden Power Fighting may be replaced by another attacking move, such as Psychic or Energy Ball, on the Calm Mind set. By doing this, Yamask has better coverage over the likes of Poison- and Fighting-types or Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types, respectively, but Hidden Power Fighting's overall coverage is much more desirable. Yamask also has access to useful support moves such as Grudge, Mean Look, and Destiny Bond, but finding a moveslot for them is difficult, and you're probably better off sticking to the listed options.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The best counter to Yamask is Cottonee, since it has priority Encore to mess up Yamask's sweep. It can then stall out Yamask's team with a combination of Leech Seed and Substitute. Other powerful attackers such as Machop may also give Yamask trouble due to its lack of recovery outside of Oran Berry. Pokemon that pack Sucker Punch, such as Houndour and Croagunk, are a pain to any Yamask. If Trick Room is not up, fast Ghost-types such as Gastly can easily smash Yamask with Shadow Ball.</p>
