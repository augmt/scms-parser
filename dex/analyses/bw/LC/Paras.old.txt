[Overview]

<p>Paras is unique in that it is one of the few Pokemon in Little Cup that have access to a 100% accurate sleep-inducing move, in the form of Spore. With the changes in sleep mechanics that BW brought, Paras's ability to help other Pokemon and set itself up with little risk is not just unique, but also useful. Paras's good defenses and Attack, along with its excellent STAB and support moves, makes it a very good Pokemon in the Little Cup metagame. Its Dry Skin ability makes it immune to Water-type moves, giving it ample opportunity to switch in for free and set up.</p>

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>Being the only 100% accurate sleep-inducing move, Spore is one of the best moves in the game. Having the ability to completely remove one of the opposing team's Pokemon is a superb tool to have, especially in a metagame that is as fast-paced as Little Cup. This set attempts to use all of Paras's strengths to its advantage: its good Attack and defenses, Spore, and its access to reliable recovery.</p>

<p>This set can be used to take out troublesome Pokemon, as well as help set up other Pokemon due to the switching that it forces. Paras is the best user of Spore out of the small pool of Pokemon that learn it. Bug Bite is a good STAB option, since it allows Paras to heal itself using the opponent's Berry. Bullet Seed hits through Substitute, Focus Sash, and Sturdy, causing significant damage over several hits, whilst Synthesis is Paras's only reliable recovery move.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>Paras can attempt a double status set by using Stun Spore in the last slot. Stun Spore takes advantage of the switches that Spore causes, allowing Paras to either hit an incoming opponent hard using its STAB moves or cripple it with status, rendering it useless. Due to the fact that Paras resists most priority attacks, it can take advantage of the paralysis it spreads and outspeed Pokemon which it would normally have difficulty beating. X-Scissor is a stronger STAB option for the second moveslot if you feel that Paras does not need the added boost provided by Berries or you dislike using the prediction involved in getting the boosts.</p>

<p>Oran Berry is the better item if you choose to run Stun Spore over Synthesis, as it gives Paras a form of recovery. However, when running Synthesis, the added bulk provided by Eviolite is preferable. The EVs provided maximize physical bulk and survivability while giving Paras an offensive edge.</p>

[SET] 
name: AgiliSpore
move 1: Agility
move 2: Spore
move 3: X-Scissor
move 4: Bullet Seed
item: Life Orb / Oran Berry
ability: Dry Skin
nature: Jolly
evs: 76 HP / 196 Atk / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is a more offensive take on Paras. After a single Agility, Paras reaches 26 Speed, which is more than enough to outpace all unboosted Pokemon and most Choice Scarf users. Paras's good bulk and immunity to Water-type attacks give it ample opportunity to set up unimpeded. Additionally, Spore allows Paras to completely remove a potential counter from the match or give itself time to set up if it needs to.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>Bug Bite is an option over X-Scissor, though the added power generally makes the latter a better option. Seed Bomb is also an option over Bullet Seed if you don't like the varying damage outputs and don't care about Substitute. The choice of item is a matter of preference. Life Orb gives Paras better sweeping capabilities but the recoil severely lowers Paras's survivability. Alternatively, Oran Berry does result in less immediate sweeping power, but allows for far greater survivability.</p> 

[Other Options] 

<p>Paras could a run a good special set, due to its wide movepool (including Energy Ball and Sludge Bomb) and decent Special Attack. However, this is usually better accomplished by Shroomish, which has better defenses. Psybeam can be used on both sets to OHKO Croagunk, a Pokemon which can cause problems for Paras.</p> 

<p>Paras can also utilize support moves such as Light Screen and Aromatherapy, which could allow it to pull off a defensive or support set. However, this is, once again, done better by other Pokemon. While Dry Skin is the preferred ability on Paras, Effect Spore could also be used to help spread status. This would be particularly effective with Paras's low Speed.</p> 

<p>Paras also has the potential to run both Swords Dance and Choice Band sets, with strong physical STAB moves and access to Pursuit and Spore. Similar to the Agility set, Paras would utilize Spore to set up multiple Swords Dance boosts and attempt a sweep. This would work best with recovery and Eviolite due to the fact that most of Paras's counters will be able to outspeed it. In terms of a Choice Band set, Paras could make use of Pursuit and its STAB moves to deal heavy damage.</p> 

[Checks and Counters] 

<p>Paras can be quite difficult to completely counter, due to its access to Spore. Most potential counters are easily incapacitated by sleep. This makes Pokemon who don't fear sleep moves and can KO in retaliation excellent counters. Doduo and Houndour are the prime examples, as Early Bird means sleep is less crippling to them. Houndour does have a better ability in Flash Fire, though. Additionally, thanks to its status Orb, Taillow is also a good counter. If Sleep Clause is active, most of Paras's counters will not have to fear Spore. Most Steel-types do not fear Paras's STAB attacks. However, with the exception of Aron, they cannot do much in return. Croagunk resists both of Paras's STABs and can use its strong priority moves to KO Paras in return, but needs to watch out for Spore.</p> 

<p>Fortunately, revenge killing Paras is easy. Any Fire-type with decent Speed, such as Magby, Ponyta, and Choice Scarf Houndour, can outspeed Paras and OHKO it with super effective Fire-type moves. The same is true for any fast Flying-type, such as Natu.</p>
