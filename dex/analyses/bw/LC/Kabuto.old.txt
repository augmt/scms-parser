[Overview]

<p>Kabuto is the best physical rain sweeper in Little Cup, which in itself is a great reason to use it. It has access to Swift Swim and a solid base 80 Attack, along with with a good base Speed. It also has good coverage in just its two STAB moves, with the only common Pokemon that resist Kabuto's STAB moves being Croagunk and Ferroseed. Unfortunately, Kabuto is weak to priority as it bypasses the Swift Swim boost. This is worsened by the fact that Kabuto is weak to Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, two of the most common priority moves. Kabuto can use Aqua Jet to bypass other priority, though. Kabuto can also function as a good lead with access to Stealth Rock, STAB priority in Aqua Jet, and Rapid Spin, though leading is now harder due to Team Preview. Overall, Kabuto is a dangerous threat which can run through teams if given the slightest chance to do so.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Kabuto can utilize rain by using Swift Swim to double its Speed, while at the same time powering up Waterfall. Waterfall is a reliable and strong STAB move, especially in the rain. Rock Slide gives Kabuto a strong secondary STAB, providing good coverage, and hits Snover and Mantyke for super effective damage, which are normally annoying for rain teams to take on. Both Rock Slide and Waterfall provide a nice flinch rate which could come in handy. STAB Aqua Jet gives Kabuto a valuable priority attack, allowing it to finish off weakened threats that have priority themselves. Rain Dance is used in case it stops raining or when Kabuto is being used as a standalone rain sweeper.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Even with an Adamant nature, Kabuto hits 30 Speed in the rain, outspeeding almost everything in Little Cup. Life Orb boosts the power of Kabuto's attacks, making it harder to wall. On the other hand, Eviolite allows Kabuto to take hits from strong priority moves easily and when it's setting up. If using Eviolite, invest 36 EVs into HP to marginally increase bulk; otherwise, having 19 HP reduces Life Orb recoil to 1 HP per turn. Hone Claws is an option over Rain Dance, but you'll have to ensure that teammates can reliably set up rain. Aerial Ace can be used to deal with Grass-type Pokemon and Croagunk. Earth Power is also an option to deal with Chinchou, Croagunk, and Tentacool. Kabuto appreciates entry hazard support, as it breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy, and helps Kabuto KO more Pokemon without having to take that extra hit. Ferroseed is a good teammate as it resists Grass- and Electric-type attacks and can set up Spikes, aiding Kabuto in its sweep.</p>

<p>Kabuto is a good lead because it has access to both Stealth Rock and priority in Aqua Jet, which helps Kabuto get rid of Focus Sash on opposing leads, as well as stopping the effect of Sturdy. STAB Rock Slide hits hard and has good coverage with Aqua Jet. Rapid Spin allows Kabuto to support its team by getting rid of troublesome entry hazards that might cripple a teammate, and can also finish off badly weakened Pokemon. Protect is useful for scouting and blocking Fake Out.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Focus Sash allows Kabuto to survive strong attacks which might OHKO Kabuto otherwise. Eviolite can also be used, as leading is harder with Team Preview. Waterfall is a viable option over Rock Slide as it hits Fighting- and Ground-type Pokemon harder, such as Hippopotas, Timburr, and Drilbur. It can also be used as a replacement for Rapid Spin as it gives Kabuto more coverage. Pokemon that can set up Rain Dance, such as Bronzor and Frillish, are good partners for Kabuto. Fast Pokemon such as Aipom or Voltorb can also set up Rain Dance.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Rock Polish is an option, but Rain Dance is usually superior as it boosts the power of Kabuto's STAB Water-type moves as well. Kabuto hits 15 Speed, allowing it to run a Choice Scarf and outrun Choice Scarf users with 14 Speed. Screech can work in a similar fashion to Swords Dance, but it wears off when the opposing Pokemon switches out. Therefore, entry hazard support is very useful to rack up damage during switches. Hidden Power Fire can be helpful in dealing with Ferroseed and Croagunk, but it is weak in the rain.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Kabuto has its fair share of counters. Ferroseed resists both of Kabuto's STAB moves and OHKOes with Bullet Seed. Kabuto is very weak against Croagunk, which can OHKO with STAB Vacuum Wave and resists or is immune to its STAB attacks. Snover can stop Kabuto's rain and can KO with Giga Drain, but must be careful when switching in due to Kabuto carrying Rock Slide. Lickitung can stop the rain and then set up on Kabuto but an untimely flinch will force Lickitung to switch out, making it a poor check.</p>
