[Overview]

<p>Bronzor is a unique Pokemon in Little Cup. With its Steel / Psychic typing, Bronzor is only weak to Fire- and Ground-type attacks; moreover, Ground-type moves can be negated with Levitate and the damage taken from Fire-type moves can be reduced with Heatproof. Bronzor's incredible defenses and myriad of support moves complement its defensive typing nicely and make Bronzor one of the best support Pokemon in the tier. While it might be offensively useless, don't let its cute, harmless exterior fool you; if you give Bronzor a free turn, you will regret it.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Bronzor is probably the most reliable Stealth Rock user in the history of LC. This set focuses on Bronzor's amazing defensive capabilities to generate that necessary turn to set up Stealth Rock. While Bronzor's offenses might leave something to be desired, it does require some attacking moves so it is not complete setup fodder. Its second move is a toss-up between Earthquake and Psychic. With Earthquake, Bronzor can hit Chinchou, Croagunk, Tirtouga, and most importantly Magnemite for super effective damage--thanks to the latter's Magnet Pull ability, Earthquake is Bronzor's only way of possibly coming out alive against Magnemite. However, if you are confident in your team's ability to handle Magnemite, Psychic is a fine alternative. In addition to STAB, Psychic hits much of the metagame for neutral damage and is also super effective against Mienfoo, Timburr, and Croagunk.</p>

<p>Flash Cannon should go in the third moveslot as no Pokemon is immune to it; it therefore allows Bronzor to at least do some damage to any foe. Flash Cannon always breaks Eviolite SubRoost Murkrow's Substitutes, which prevents it from capitalizing on Bronzor's lack of recovery to take it down, and also hits Dwebble for super effective damage. The last slot is reserved for Toxic. Bronzor's most reliable way of doing damage, it cripples most slow walls and frail sweepers that switch into Bronzor. Furthermore, the majority of Pokemon that are immune to Toxic are hit super effectively by either Earthquake or Psychic.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread focuses more on Bronzor's Special Defense; thanks to Gligar's banning, physical defense is not as necessary. With 25 / 24 / 27 defenses after Eviolite, Bronzor becomes the premier mixed wall of the tier. As Bronzor's offense presence is nonexistent, a Careful nature should be used even if running Flash Cannon; the lost point in Special Attack makes no difference whatsoever. If you decide not to use Earthquake, then a Calm nature is recommended. Hidden Power Ice is an option over Flash Cannon to hit Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon harder, but it is largely unnecessary without Gligar. As one of the few level-up moves that Bronzor can legally have at level 5, Hypnosis is a usable alternative over Toxic to cripple switch-ins; however, Toxic is Bronzor's best option against bulkier Pokemon, and Hypnosis is unreliable at best. Bronzor can utilize coverage moves such as Shadow Ball and Rock Slide to hit Misdreavus and Larvesta for super effective damage, respectively, but the listed moves are generally the best options.</p>

<p>It must be noted that just about every boosting sweeper in the metagame--Scraggy, Tirtouga, Dratini, Pawniard, etc--can set up on Bronzor. Thus, Pokemon that check physical boosters, such as Mienfoo, Koffing, Croagunk, and Wooper, make excellent partners, as they mitigate this unfortunate weakness. Ferroseed and Bronzor make difficult opponents; as they take very little from Bronzor's attacks and are immune to Toxic, they can set up on Bronzor with impunity. Pokemon such as Scraggy and Mienfoo, who can in turn set up on these Pokemon, make excellent partners in this regard.</p>

[SET]
name: Oran Berry + Recycle
move 1: Recycle
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Earthquake / Stealth Rock
move 4: Flash Cannon
item: Oran Berry
ability: Levitate
nature: Careful
evs: 220 HP / 4 Atk / 68 Def / 4 SpA / 148 SpD / 16 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This bad boy has got what it takes to bring the metagame to its knees. With Oran Berry and Recycle, Bronzor gets a relatively reliable source of healing and patches up its biggest weakness. Thanks to its natural bulk and incredible defensive typing, the loss of Eviolite is not particularly devastating when it comes to Bronzor's ability to tank hits. With access to recovery, Bronzor becomes a lean mean Toxic stalling machine, as it can focus on whittling things down and recovering the damage, and come out on top in the end. However, for this set to work, attacking moves are a necessity. Earthquake allows Bronzor to hit the two types that are immune to Toxic--Steel and Poison--for super effective damage, and is its only way to damage these. If you have no other place for it, Stealth Rock is a viable alternative over Earthquake. However, Bronzor will be almost entirely walled by Pokemon such as Croagunk and Magnemite.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread gives Bronzor 25 / 16 / 18 defenses, which are excellent for a Pokemon not using Eviolite. Once again, due to the lack of Gligar, Bronzor should focus more on its excellent special bulk, which enables it to more easily switch into Pokemon such as Misdreavus. Bronzor can safely use a Careful nature as this does not impact Flash Cannon's damage in the slightest. Psychic, Shadow Ball, and Rock Slide can be used over any of the attacking options to hit targets such as Mienfoo, Misdreavus, and Larvesta respectively harder. Aside from that, the moves on this set are rather set in stone.</p>

<p>As Bronzor lacks any offensive presence whatsoever, any boosting sweeper can set up on it even with the threat of Toxic. Shed Skin Pokemon such as Scraggy and Dratini can boost without fear, while Steel-types such as Pawniard also shrug off anything Bronzor does. Pokemon such as Koffing, Hippopotas, Mienfoo, and Wooper make excellent partners as they can check the powerful physical attackers that Bronzor attracts. Substitute users such as Murkrow and Misdreavus can also set up on Bronzor with ease. Accordingly, Shellder and Dwebble make powerful partners, as they can ruin Substitute users with their powerful multi-hit moves. Ferroseed and opposing Bronzor take nothing from Bronzor's attacks and can set up hazards with ease; this makes the likes of Scraggy, who can set up on these threats, good partners.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Bronzor has a ton of other options at its disposal. It has access to both Light Screen and Reflect, and is one of the bulkiest dual screen users in the tier. The tank set can utilize Rain Dance, Sunny Day, or Trick Room over Stealth Rock, depending on your team's needs. More offensive Bronzor sets are possible as well, as Bronzor has access to Calm Mind--or even Charge Beam--and a good special movepool. A Choice Specs set with Trick is also usable, its biggest draw being the ability to OHKO standard Mienfoo with Psychic. Outside of that, though, it's honestly not very good. Bronzor can run a RestTalk Eviolite set to give it a reliable means of recovery, and even combine offense and defense with a set of Rest, Sleep Talk, Calm Mind, and Flash Cannon, which is quite decent. Iron Defense can also be used on that set in place of Sleep Talk.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Unfortunately, even with its incredible defenses, Bronzor still has multiple checks. As previously stated, practically all boosting sweepers can set up on it without fear, Scraggy especially. Other threats include Tirtouga, Dratini, Pawniard, Mienfoo, and Misdreavus. Furthermore, Pokemon with strong Fire-type attacks, such as Larvesta, Darumaka, Ponyta, and Houndour, can easily dispatch Bronzor with their super effective STAB moves. Chinchou is problematic as it can easily Rest off any damage and threaten Bronzor with the possibility of a burn from Scald. Bulky walls such as Ferroseed and opposing Bronzor can easily set up without any fear. Natu can switch in without worry and use Magic Bounce to reflect Stealth Rock and protect itself from Toxic, and heal off any damage from Flash Cannon with Roost. Users of Taunt, most notably Cottonee, stop Bronzor in its tracks, as its attacking options are so pitifully weak. Finally, Magnemite can trap and easily dispatch of Bronzor with its powerful special attacks, and has Magnet Rise to gain an immunity to Earthquake.</p>
