[Overview]
 
<p>Panpour, at first glance, seems completely outclassed, having low stats which are eclipsed by many other Water-types. However, there is one move in its arsenal that makes it usable. Nasty Plot allows Panpour to quickly boost its Special Attack stat without lowering its defenses, meaning that it can take a hit much more easily than more common sweepers such as Clamperl. Though not great, Panpour's movepool is also good enough for it to take advantage of the boosts it acquires. Overall, Panpour might not be the best Pokemon, but Nasty Plot certainly makes it a usable choice for almost any Little Cup team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
 
<p>Nasty Plot is the only reason to use Panpour, and it reaches 28 Special Attack after one use, high enough to deal considerable damage. Hydro Pump is Panpour's preferred STAB move due to the power it brings, but Surf is also an option if its perfect accuracy is desired. Ice Beam is the main choice in the third slot, obtaining super effective coverage on Lileep and Dratini. However, the aforementioned Pokemon are not all that common; therefore, Substitute can be used in Ice Beam's place for extra protection. The last move depends on what Panpour needs to deal with. Hidden Power Grass is usually superior, as it ensures that Panpour's sweep isn't brought to an abrupt halt by Water-types such as Staryu, Chinchou, and Slowpoke. However, if Panpour's team has problems dealing with Ferroseed, Hidden Power Fire is usable as well.</p>
 
[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
 
<p>Life Orb could be used to boost Panpour's power even more, but the loss of Eviolite makes Panpour quite frail. If not using Hidden Power Fire, Ferroseed is a major obstacle in the way of Panpour's sweep. Therefore, a Magnemite with Hidden Power Fire works well as a teammate, as it can trap and KO Ferroseed quite easily. Tentacool is another problem, as it can deal with any move that Panpour typically carries. This makes Chinchou a great teammate for eliminating Tentacool. Snover, especially if holding a Choice Scarf, does well against Panpour as long as it doesn't switch in on Hidden Power Fire. Croagunk can switch in on Snover's STAB Grass-type attacks with ease and deal massive damage with Drain Punch while healing off any damage taken. Taillow can also rip Snover to shreds with STAB Brave Bird, but it will need to be careful when switching in, as Blizzard will OHKO.</p>
 
[Other Options]
 
<p>Panpour has very few other options beyond those listed. Hidden Power Ground can be useful, as it hits Chinchou, Croagunk, and Tentacool for super effective damage. Panpour learns Hone Claws along with physical moves such as Waterfall, Acrobatics, and Crunch, but the Nasty Plot set is far superior. Work Up is another option if using a mixed set, though it will rarely outperform Nasty Plot. Taunt is also an option, as it prevents opposing Pokemon from setting up on Panpour.</p>
 
[Checks and Counters]
 
<p>Ferroseed walls all Panpour lacking Hidden Power Fire quite easily, hitting back hard with Bullet Seed. Staryu and Chinchou both deal major damage to Panpour with Thunderbolt, and are safe against versions that lack Hidden Power Grass. Croagunk can take Ice Beam quite well, and Drain Punch will keep it healthy enough to beat Panpour. Tentacool is also a great counter thanks to its high Special Defense and resistances to Water-, Ice-, and Fire-type moves. Snover has problems switching in on Hidden Power Fire, but can take any other move while retaliating with Giga Drain.</p>
 
[Unreleased]
 
<p>Panpour receives Torrent from the Dream World. It can work well if Panpour is low on HP, and is definitely better than Gluttony if not using a pinch Berry. Gluttony Panpour could make nice use of Substitute and Salac Berry when the item is released.</p>
