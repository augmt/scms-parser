[Overview]

<p>Not many things happened for Gulpin in this generation. It still has a similar movepool and the same counters, but it can hold its own. With great HP, high defenses and access to Stockpile to boost them even higher, Gulpin can be a great wall. Along with great defensive stats, Gulpin gets a useful defensive ability, Liquid Ooze. This makes Pokemon take damage from absorbing moves such as Giga Drain or Leech Seed, which is useful against Pokemon such as Ferroseed. With the ability to run a decent amount of sets, it can fit its way into a variety of teams. Gulpin's Poison-type is very beneficial, as absorbing Toxic Spikes works out well in the long run and helps out teammates such as Wynaut and Thick Fat Munchlax, and gives Gulpin weaknesses to only Ground- and Psychic-type attacks. Thankfully, these are easily covered. All in all, it's a sure thing that this little venomous blob will keep marching on, devouring any foes that dare stand in its way.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Stockpile is probably the best and most effective set Gulpin can run. With access to Pain Split, Gulpin can heal itself and weaken its opponent at the same time. Encore can be useful for locking Pokemon such as Scraggy into set-up moves and then forcing them to switch out. Ice Beam is for hitting Flying-types for some nice damage. On the other hand, Sludge Bomb is Gulpin's strongest attack if the foe isn't weak to Ice Beam, also gaining STAB.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Liquid Ooze stops foes from using Leech Seed or Drain Punch, allowing Gulpin to last longer and deal damage indirectly. Eviolite paired with Stockpile and Pain Split provides a combo that can prolong Gulpin's longevity. If you decide to use this set in a Trick Room team, use a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Gulpin can run a variety of sets. While some are as not as effective as others, many still deserve a mention. A support set can be run, utilizing moves such as Encore, Protect, Toxic, and Giga Drain. Gulpin has the moves to run a Curse set, but is majorly outclassed by Grimer, which has a larger Attack stat and access to priority. A Toxic and Venoshock set is viable; with good defenses and STAB on the main move, it could work out in many situations. Gunk Shot and Poison Jab are both options, but Sludge Bomb outclasses both moves as it is stronger and more reliable. On the Stockpile set, running an Adamant nature with 12 Attack EVs and Fire Punch over Sludge Bomb is fine, allowing Gulpin to hit Steel-types such as Pawniard that will wall it otherwise.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Taunt users are a nuisance to Gulpin, shutting down three out of four moves on most sets. Pokemon such as Cottonee and Wynaut can shut down Gulpin with Encore and use it as setup bait.</p>
