[Overview]

<p>With overall terrible typing and stats, Ledyba is not always the best option for the standard team. However, Ledyba is not completely useless, as its decent Special Defense and a good support move in Encore help it to be viable. If paired with a spinner, Ledyba can even wall a few top threats, including Mienfoo and the ever-dangerous Scraggy.</p>

[SET]
name: Utility Wall
move 1: Roost
move 2: Encore

move 4: Bug Buzz
item: Eviolite
ability: Early Bird
nature: Bold
evs: 196 HP / 196 Def / 116 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Ledyba is adept at countering Fighting-types that lack a Rock-type move, such as Mienfoo, Croagunk, and most Scraggy (discounting rare Head Smash or Stone Edge variants). Roost is used for instant recovery, allowing Ledyba to regain its health from passive damage. Encore is used to prevent the opponent from using Ledyba as setup bait. Reflect allows Ledyba to patch up its weaker Defense stat, and after the boost, it will only take an average of 30% from a Scraggy's Crunch at +1. Bug Buzz, while weak with no investment, allows Ledyba to bypass Taunt and do mild damage to opponents. It also allows Ledyba to beat Scraggy one-on-one most of the time.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If the team already uses dual screens, Knock Off is a suitable replacement for Reflect, allowing Ledyba to remove the Eviolite many bulky Pokemon in Little Cup rely on. When using Reflect, one can opt to use a different EV spread of 196 HP / 196 Def / 36 SpA / 36 SpD with a Calm nature, trading one point in Defense for a point in Special Attack.</p>

<p>When running Ledyba, Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Staryu and Sandshrew is absolutely necessary to prevent Ledyba from losing 50% of its health when switching in. Hazard support from Pokemon such as Ferroseed is also useful due to the amount of switches Encore can cause. Other important teammates are useful to switch into Ledyba's common weaknesses. Steel-types such as Ferroseed can take the many Rock-, Flying-, and Ice-type attacks aimed at Ledyba, while Flash Fire Pokemon such as Houndour and Ponyta can take the multitude of Fire-type attacks aimed at it.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Ledyba has a few other options, although its low stats prevent it from using many of them efficiently. A full Baton Pass set is a plausible choice, allowing Ledyba to pass Agility or Swords Dance boosts to offensive threats such as Timburr, which might need a Speed boost, or fast Choice Scarf users, such as Taillow, that might need a power boost. Alternatively, a full Swords Dance set is possible using Swords Dance, Drain Punch, Bug Bite, and Roost, although Ledyba has a pitiful Attack stat.</p>

<p>Other viable moves Ledyba has include Air Cutter, which allows it to hit Fighting-types harder than a resisted Bug Buzz. Supersonic could be used to confuse opponents, although the low accuracy is unappealing. Being a Bug-type gives Ledyba a STAB U-turn to scout the opponent; however, Ledyba has better moves to be using, such as Knock Off or Encore. Finally, Tailwind could be used as a last ditch effort to pull off a sweep.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The biggest issue for Ledyba is Stealth Rock, which instantly removes 50% of its health on the switch. Besides that, Pokemon that prey on Ledyba's multiple common weaknesses can defeat it with ease. Flying-types such as Doduo and Taillow can hit Ledyba hard with STAB Brave Birds, while Houndour and Ponyta can burn Ledyba to a crisp with their Fire-type attacks. Although Ferroseed cannot directly threaten Ledyba, it can use Ledyba as setup fodder, as Encore does not stop Ferroseed from laying down Spikes.</p>
