[Overview]

<p>Petilil is one of the newly introduced Pokemon this generation. It possesses a great Special Attack stat, a good movepool, and when used in the sun, Chlorophyll grants it an amazing Speed stat. Petilil's typing also gives it a useful resistance to common Water- and Ground-type moves. Furthermore, it is one of the very few Pokemon in the LC metagame that have access to a sleep-inducing move. Alas, Petilil's only downfall is its bad defenses. Overall, Petilil is a lethal sweeper and certainly deserves a slot on any Sunny Day team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The goal of this set is to set up Sunny Day and proceed to sweep with Petilil's high Special Attack. Petilil hits 26 Speed with Chlorophyll, which allows it to beat every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame and a handful of Choice Scarf users, such as Cranidos and Growlithe. Solar Beam and Giga Drain are powerful STAB options: Solar Beam is a very powerful STAB move that should only be used in the sun, while Giga Drain is a weaker move that can be used in any weather condition to recover some HP. Hidden Power Fire benefits from Sunny Day and provides great coverage along with Petilil's Grass-type STAB. The fourth slot is a choice between utility and power. Sleep Powder puts the opponent to sleep, whereas Growth boosts Petilil's Special Attack stat by two stages in sunlight.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Eviolite improves Petilil's bulk, and even though Petilil has bad defenses, its Grass typing makes up for it. Life Orb can be used to grant Petilil more power, but it loses out on a significant amount of bulk. Chlorophyll should always be used over any of Petilil's other abilities, as Chlorophyll is the only niche Petilil has over other Grass-types. A Modest nature can be used over Timid for more power, but this makes Petilil slower than base 65 Speed Choice Scarf users, such as Houndour. Hidden Power Rock can be used over Hidden Power Fire to hit Flying-types, such as Taillow.</p>

<p>If you opt to use Hidden Power Rock, Petilil cannot do anything to Steel-types, such as Ferroseed, making Fire-types, such as Houndour, good teammates. In addition, Houndour can switch into Ice- and Fire-type attacks aimed at Petilil, while Petilil can take Water- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Houndour. If you're using teammates that set up Sunny Day, you can replace Sunny Day with Growth or Sleep Powder.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Although it's a little gimmicky, Petilil can run Synthesis to heal 2/3 of its health in the sun. Stun Spore provides additional team support by paralyzing an opponent, but Sleep Powder is generally better. Leaf Storm is Petilil's most powerful STAB move, and it hits Hippopotas that switch into a predicted Solar Beam. Petilil can also run Healing Wish to heal a teammate at the cost of its life. Energy Ball is a stronger STAB alternative to Giga Drain. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit troublesome Dragon-types such as Dratini. Lastly, Petilil can run a SubSeed set, but other Grass-types, such as Oddish, generally outclass it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Choice Scarf Snover is the best counter to Petilil. It can come in, change the weather to hail, outpace Petilil, and OHKO it with Blizzard. Although they have to be wary of Sleep Powder, Fire-types, such as Houndour, are good counters as they resist both of Petilil's common attacking moves and can hit back with a super effective STAB move. Dratini is another check to Petilil as it resists both of Petilil's offensive moves and doesn't care about Sleep Powder, thanks to Shed Skin. If Petilil isn't carrying Hidden Power Fire, Ferroseed becomes a solid counter. Ferroseed takes very little damage from any of Petilil's moves, and uses Petilil as setup fodder. Lastly, Hippopotas can be a problem if you decide to use Solar Beam over Giga Drain on Petilil.</p>
