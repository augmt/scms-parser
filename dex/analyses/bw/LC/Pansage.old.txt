[Overview]

<p>Pansage is another member of the monkey trio, and just like its brothers, Pansear and Panpour, it is outclassed by other Pokemon that can better fill the roll of a Grass-type. Don't think that Pansage is a bad Pokemon, though, as good Speed and respectable Special Attack mean that it should definitely not be looked over. Pansage can definitely be worth a teamslot if used correctly, and it can often surprise the user, as its power is often overlooked.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Leaf Storm

nature: Timid

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>There isn't too much Pansage can do with such a shallow movepool, but it can abuse Leaf Storm somewhat. Energy Ball is used to hit things without lowering Pansage's Special Attack stat. Hidden Power Ice hits Flying- and Dragon-types on the switch while dealing with other Grass-type Pokemon that may try to take a Leaf Storm. Nasty Plot is mostly filler, but can see use if you can somehow manage to scare out a Pokemon with Pansage. Substitute can be used over Nasty Plot to help ease prediction, while also protecting Pansage from priority moves and crippling status.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Pansage reaches a Speed stat of 17, so finding an opportunity to use Nasty Plot while Focus Sash protects Pansage from fainting is easy, and a STAB +2 Leaf Storm will cause huge damage. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Steel- and Grass-type Pokemon, instead of Hidden Power Ice. Water-type Pokemon such as Frillish and Slowpoke can take care of the Fire-type Pokemon that otherwise outright wall Pansage, and this is a big help for the monkey. A Rapid Spin user that can spin away entry hazards in order to preserve Focus Sash is useful if you're not one to want to lead with Pansage.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Offensively there isn't much else worth a mention here. Although Pansage gets Crunch, Shadow Claw, Seed Bomb, and Acrobatics, these are all bad options, as Pansage must utilize its mediocre Attack stat to use them. Pansage has a lot of support options such as Taunt, Toxic, and Grass Whistle, but lacks any sort of defensive stability to get any use from them. Protect can be useful for scouting, but it is a waste of a moveslot most of the time. Work Up makes a mixed set slightly viable with Crunch, a Hidden Power, and Leaf Storm.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any Fire-type Pokemon such as Slugma or Steel-type Pokemon such as Bronzor or Ferroseed will wall Pansage easily; however, Hidden Power Fire can be dangerous for the latter type. If Pansage doesn't have a Focus Sash or has taken any damage, any Pokemon that outspeeds it or has priority should be able to hit it very hard or knock it out altogether.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Overgrow will be a good alternative ability when released and it should replace Gluttony on almost every set.</p>
