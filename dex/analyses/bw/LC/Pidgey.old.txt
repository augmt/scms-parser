[Overview]

<p>Pidgey is the beloved Normal / Flying Pokemon introduced in RBY. Since then, lots of competition has been introduced, but our little bird friend still packs quite a punch, allowing it to fill a solid niche on almost any team. While Doduo, Starly, and Taillow are all superior to Pidgey, Pidgey can still be an effective Choice user. Pidgey reaches a Speed stat of 16 in Little Cup, which allows it to outspeed most of the Little Cup metagame. With a great STAB move in the form of Brave Bird, and a decent Attack stat of 14, Pidgey has enough speed and power to be a respectable member of any team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>It's no secret that Pidgey doesn't have much at it's disposal, but it can manage to pull off an acceptable attacker set. Choice Scarf is the preferred option here, as it allows Pidgey to act as your team's revenge killer. After the boost, Pidgey hits a Speed stat of 24, meaning that it outruns every non-boosted Pokemon in Little Cup, as well as a number that are boosted. Brave Bird allows Pidgey to hit pretty hard, even with no Attack boost; this means that Pidgey is a fantastic check to Scraggy, as well as other Fighting-types. U-turn is on the set as it helps to keep up the offensive momentum during the battle. Feint Attack is used to hit Ghost-type Pokemon hard without suffering recoil damage, although Brave Bird will still deal more damage to every Ghost-type in the tier. Return gives good neutral coverage while being a strong move without recoil.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Pursuit is a suitable option over Feint Attack as it allows Pidgey to trap and KO fleeing Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon. Steel Wing can be used over Return to help with coverage a bit, but Pidgey loses out on the raw power of Return in exchange for minor coverage. Ferroseed makes a good partner to Pidgey as it can handle any super effective move aimed at Pidgey. Fighting-type Pokemon such as Scraggy or Timburr that can deal with Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon will make it a lot easier for Pidgey to deal damage to the opponent's team.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Other Options? Pidgey doesn't really have many. It does have a few interesting special attacks, but its abysmal Special Attack stat means it can't make much use of them. Pidgey also gets Feather Dance and Roost, but Pidgey's terrible defenses make it difficult to use these moves effectively as well.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Basically any Steel-type Pokemon walls Pidgey, such as Bronzor or Magnemite. Most Rock-type Pokemon, such as Onix or Geodude, can handle Pidgey, although they must beware of taking repeated Steel Wings, as this will wear them down. Physical walls such as Slowpoke are able to take almost any hit and recover away the damage with Slack Off.</p>
