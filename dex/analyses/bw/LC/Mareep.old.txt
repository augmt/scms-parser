[Overview]

<p>Mareep is quite underwhelming in Little Cup, outclassed by other Electric-types offensively due to its low Speed. It has good bulk, however, and can set up dual screens quite easily. Basically, Mareep is okay at setting up Reflect and Light Screen, but shouldn't really be used for anything else in the Little Cup metagame.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Mareep has 25 HP, 14 Defense, and 12 Special Defense, which, when paired with a lack of a weakness to Dark-type moves, allow it to make for an effective dual screener that isn't afraid of Pursuit users such as Pawniard. Reflect and Light Screen are Mareep's way of supporting its team, allowing a frail teammate to set up safely. Thunderbolt is Mareep's reliable STAB move, and while Discharge could be used for the extra paralysis chance, its lower base power causes it to be an inferior option. Thunder Wave is preferred in the last slot, as it can reliably spread paralysis which could help a teammate sweep. Light Clay is the preferred item on this set, granting three extra turns on Mareep's screens. However, Baton Passers and some Pokemon that set up themselves don't need the extra turns. Therefore, Eviolite is a solid choice for the extra bulk it provides.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Any Pokemon with Brick Break can ruin Mareep's screens, but the move is rarely used, so it's not a major problem. Mareep pairs well with Baton Passers and Pokemon that can set up. Gastly is deadly when behind screens and is also immune to Ground-type moves aimed at Mareep. Dragon Dance Scraggy lacks the Ground immunity, but is incredibly bulky with screens up and can get many Dragon Dance boosts in before attempting a sweep.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Cotton Guard could be used for a huge defensive boost, but Mareep lacks a reliable healing move, so it's unable to stall for too long. Toxic cripples bulky Pokemon such as Hippopotas that may try to switch in, but conflicts with Mareep's paralysis-inducing moves. Safeguard is another team support option that Mareep learns, and can be helpful to stop a teammate from being crippled while setting up. Heal Bell could get rid of any statuses the team might take as well. Magnet Rise is a gimmicky option to get rid of its weakness to Ground-type moves temporarily. Agility could be used to try to sweep, but Mareep is generally outclassed in this role. Mareep's special movepool consists of Thunderbolt, Power Gem, Signal Beam, and Hidden Power, and a Choice Specs set could be used due to Mareep's good Special Attack and decent coverage.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any Pokemon that learns Brick Break ruins Mareep's purpose, though very few Pokemon both use it and can safely take Mareep on. Cottonee can be a major problem due to priority Encore. Diglett can trap Mareep easily, and if carrying a Choice Band, OHKOes Mareep without Reflect up. Life Orb versions KO with Stealth Rock or a layer of Spikes, and Mareep usually can't do anything back anyway. Ferroseed, Chinchou, and Wooper all wall Mareep but can't stop screens from going up. Phazers are actually the biggest issues a team with Mareep has, as they can get rid of stat boosts; Hippopotas with Roar and Munchlax that carry Whirlwind are good examples of problematic phazers.</p>
