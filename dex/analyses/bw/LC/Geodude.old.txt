[Overview]

<p>At first appearance, Geodude looks like a slower Dwebble. It shares many traits with the bug, including Sturdy, Stealth Rock, and a Rock typing. However, there are a few things that set Geodude apart from Dwebble. It has access to STAB Earthquake, Fire Punch, Thunder Punch, and Sucker Punch, as well as very high Defense and good Attack. Though its power was reduced, Explosion is another strong attack that Geodude possesses. Finally, Geodude has a way of remedying its awful Speed by using Rock Polish. All in all, Geodude is an underestimated threat that teams should take into account.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a decent support set that Geodude is easily capable of running. The primary selling points for using this set are Sturdy and Stealth Rock, with the former almost always guaranteeing the setup of the latter. Though at first it might seem that outclassed completely by Dwebble, it does have a couple of things that set it apart from its fellow Rock-type. The first thing is access to a STAB Earthquake, which provides Geodude with lethal coverage when used in tandem with Stone Edge. In addition, Geodude has higher overall Attack and Defense, which allow it to deal and take more damage before going down. Fire Punch is important on this set so Geodude won't be setup bait in the face of Ferroseed. Oran Berry is also important as it allows Geodude to heal itself after Sturdy kicks in.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Thunder Punch is another option on this set to give Geodude a more accurate attack for Mantyke than Stone Edge, despite the fact that Thunder Punch does equal damage on almost every Pokemon that Stone Edge and Earthquake can hit. However, Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon can better handle Water-types than Geodude, so they are preferred as teammates. A Grass-type Pokemon is especially important, as it will also most likely be instrumental in taking out Hippopotas, which beats this set without much trouble. Mixed sweepers are good teammates for this set, as they are the best Pokemon to make the most out of Stealth Rock. In addition, spinblockers such as Frillish and Duskull are also important, as they can prevent a spinner from blowing away Stealth Rock.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>One of Geodude's crippling downfalls has always been its Speed, but this set gives it a way to more than compensate for it. Rock Polish doubles Geodude's Speed, which gives it a good way to attempt a sweep. Stone Edge is an incredibly powerful STAB attack, giving Geodude excellent coverage and power, despite having poor accuracy. Fire Punch hits Grass-types more reliably than Stone Edge, as well as getting a super effective hit on both Ferroseed and Bronzor. Explosion allows Geodude to go out with a bang after it has completed its job, and will be Geodude's most powerful option for an attack despite the move's nerf. Sturdy is a very important ability, as it allows Geodude to almost always set up Rock Polish safely. For that reason, Oran Berry is the preferred item, as Life Orb would nullify Sturdy, one of the best reasons to use Geodude as a sweeper.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Special sweepers are the best partners for this set as Geodude, if played correctly, can easily rip through unprepared teams. In addition, Pokemon that can remove Scraggy are also good teammates, as it resists Stone Edge and can heal itself with Drain Punch, a 2HKO on Geodude. Bulky Fighting-types, such as Timburr and Mienfoo, are great at checking Scraggy. A Psychic-type is great for removing Fighting-types in general, and Abra is the fastest of all. Duskull is another good teammate as it's immune to two of Geodude's weaknesses and can spread burns with Will-O-Wisp. Pokemon with Aqua Jet beat this set without much trouble, and Seel and Squirtle have access to that move as well as Fake Out, allowing them to remove Sturdy and before finishing off Geodude with Aqua Jet. Adamant is the preferred nature, as it still allows Geodude to hit 22 Speed after a boost while getting more power, as Geodude should not be running Life Orb. Jolly allows Geodude to tie with Timid Choice Scarf Chinchou. The EVs are tailored to maximize Attack and Speed, with the rest going to Geodude's lackluster Special Defense.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Although Geodude doesn't have a lot of options, it does get a couple of other viable moves. It has Sucker Punch for Ghost-types, but many can predict around the move and either use Substitute or burn Geodude with Will-O-Wisp. Rock Blast hits Dwebble for super effective damage and breaks Sturdy and Substitute, but Stone Edge is a better move in almost every other case. Geodude has access to Rock Head and Double-Edge, but Sturdy is a better ability. It can use Flail alongside Sturdy, but Explosion does more damage, and Geodude's only priority attack is the unreliable Sucker Punch. It has Brick Break for dual screen users, but it doesn't get much, if any, additional coverage. Finally, Thunder Punch is always an option for a more accurate attack than Stone Edge on Flying-types, but in most cases, Stone Edge will suffice.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Seel and Squirtle, with their combination of Fake Out and Aqua Jet, can KO Geodude without much trouble. Bronzor is a decent check to Geodude as it is immune to Earthquake while resisting Stone Edge, but needs to watch for Fire Punch. Grass-types that resist Earthquake are usually good counters, as they can restore health from any damage by using Giga Drain, and Pokemon with Bullet Seed can usually KO Geodude through Sturdy. Shellder also works well with Icicle Spear, which breaks through Sturdy as well. Fighting-types threaten Geodude, as they resist Rock-type attacks and can KO with Drain Punch.</p>
