[Overview]

<p>Blitzle is quite the oddball in Little Cup. It has high Speed, but unfortunately, it falls short of the 19 Speed benchmark. It has decent Attack and Special Attack, but doesn't have a great movepool despite having access to a priority attack. Also, unfortunately, it will usually have a surefire counter depending on the Hidden Power that it's running. Its low defenses open it up to a multitude of attacks, and a super effective Earthquake will usually be enough to OHKO Blitzle. Overall, it's a decent Pokemon that could have been great if it had more moves to work with.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is an effective set for Blitzle to run, as it is a decent sweeper lategame. Agility is a great, reliable move for Blitzle to double its Speed, while Flame Charge is a coverage move that still increases its Speed. Wild Charge is the best STAB attack that Blitzle has access to, as its Attack is higher than its Special Attack, ruling out Thunderbolt for this moveslot. Hidden Power Ice allows Blitzle to attain BoltBeam coverage. Pursuit is a decent attack for Blitzle to trap weakened Ghost-types, while Quick Attack gives Blitzle a priority attack. Lightningrod is a great ability that will increase Blitzle's Special Attack if hit with an Electric-type attack.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A different Hidden Power can be used for coverage on different Pokemon, though it should be noted that Blitzle will be left vulnerable to others. Hidden Power Ground could be used over Hidden Power Ice for a decent attack on Chinchou, but it leaves Blitzle helpless against Hippopotas. If Flame Charge is not being used, Hidden Power Fire can be used for Ferroseed, though Chinchou will be able to walk all over Blitzle. Munchlax with Earthquake and Fire Punch is a good teammate for dealing with Chinchou and Ferroseed, respectively. The EVs on this set maximize Attack and Speed, and the rest are put into Special Attack.</p>

<p>Despite Blitzle's higher base Attack, it can also run a specially based set with Thunderbolt over Wild Charge in order to make the most out of Lightningrod. If so, 160 EVs from Attack should be moved to Special Attack. This set could be efficient with Double Kick in the final slot in an attempt to KO Munchlax, but even so, it will lose to Chinchou and Ferroseed quite easily.</p>

[SET]
name: Charge Beam
move 1: Charge Beam
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Hidden Power Ground
move 4: Flame Charge / Quick Attack
item: Life Orb
ability: Motor Drive
nature: Naive
evs: 36 Atk / 236 SpA / 232 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Because Blitzle has decent Speed without any boosts, Charge Beam is a viable move to help boost its power. Charge Beam is obviously the crux of the set, giving Blitzle a 70% chance to boost its Special Attack. Thunderbolt is its most powerful special STAB attack, while Hidden Power Ground is for Chinchou. Flame Charge is a Fire-type attack that will allow Blitzle to hit Ferroseed super effectively, as well as Snover on the switch. Flame Charge also comes with the added bonus of boosting Blitzle's Speed; however, Quick Attack is a useful priority attack if Pokemon such as Croagunk are troublesome for your team. Motor Drive is a good ability that gives Blitzle an immunity as well as a boost to its Speed should it be hit by an Electric-type attack.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Because Munchlax will be able to wall this set cold, Double Kick is an option for a super effective attack on it. However, a better idea is to use this set with Fighting-type teammates, and Timburr and Mienfoo are among some of the best options. Chinchou beats this set easily if Blitzle lacks Hidden Power Ground, so Snover is a good check to it unless Chinchou carries Hidden Power Fire; unfortunately, Life Orb recoil and Hail damage will quickly rack up on Blitzle. Hidden Power Grass is yet another option for Blitzle to beat Wooper, which ignores boosts because of Unaware. If Quick Attack is being used, Hidden Power Fire can be used as an option for Ferroseed.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Blitzle doesn't have many other options to run whatsoever. It can use Double Kick for a super effective attack against Munchlax, but it has to invest heavily in Attack to net a 2HKO. It can run a Choice Scarf set, but Chinchou does this much, much better. Return is an option for a physical attack with neutral coverage on a lot of Pokemon, and hits much harder than Quick Attack. Volt Switch can be effective for Blitzle to act as a scout, but again, Chinchou is a much better user. Finally, Blitzle has Thunder Wave, but doesn't really have the bulk to use it effectively, and a bad prediction could leave it helpless against a Pokemon with Substitute.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>If Blitzle is not using Hidden Power Ice, Hippopotas can easily dispatch it with Earthquake. Diglett can trap and KO it with Earthquake, but has to avoid Hidden Power Ice or Grass on the switch, and it must be wary of a Speed-boosting move. Munchlax only fears Double Kick, and will most likely not be 2HKOed by the move. Wynaut easily traps and KOes Blitzle, and Chinchou beats Blitzle if it doesn't have Hidden Power Ground.</p>
