[Overview]

<p>Aipom used to be useful in the days of DPP, when it was able to utilize its fantastic Speed and decent Attack to function as a lead. However, a new generation came along, and Aipom was pushed to the bottom of the barrel by stronger threats and new mechanics. Team Preview killed any chance Aipom had at being effective by ruining its surprise factor, and the introduction of Eviolite made Aipom's Attack stat pathetic by ushering in a more defensive metagame. Aipom can still do a decent job at being a lead, but don't expect it to be useful otherwise, because that's definitely not going to happen.</p>

[SET]

move 2: Return
move 3: Shadow Claw
move 4: U-turn
item: Life Orb
ability: Pickup

evs: 196 Atk / 76 Def / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is Aipom's best chance at contributing to its team. Aipom has the fastest Fake Out in the game, but it's rather weak. Return is its strongest STAB move, while Shadow Claw is used to fight off Ghost-types that are immune to Return. U-turn is good to get out of sticky situations, which are all too common when using Aipom. The recommended nature is Jolly, as it gives Aipom 19 Speed. However, if you want a bit more power, you can use Adamant at the cost of being slower than fast offensive threats such as Misdreavus and Murkrow.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With Life Orb, Pickup won't be of much help, but it can come in handy if Aipom somehow loses its item, and Aipom's other abilities are completely useless, anyway. Aipom hits 19 Speed but has only 16 Attack, so it can't do anything impressive. It has very bad defenses too, so it'll be gone pretty quickly if you're not careful. Brick Break is a decent replacement for U-turn if you want to hit Rock- and Steel-types. Aipom has a lot of counters, but Fighting- and Ghost-types stand out the most; Murkrow and Abra help to handle the former, while Houndour and Misdreavus can help with the latter.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Aipom can run a rather interesting set with Acrobatics, Flying Gem, and Pickup, allowing it to defeat Mienfoo. However, the power boost from Life Orb is greatly missed on all of its other attacks. There's also the possibility of a Nasty Plot and Baton Pass set, as Aipom is the only Pokemon in Little Cup capable of doing this outside of Togepi and Mime Jr. Sadly, Aipom has bad Special Attack and no moves to properly utilize it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fighting- and Ghost-types are the best counters to Aipom. Pokemon with the former type can OHKO with any super-effective move, and the latter is immune or resistant to almost all of Aipom's moveset and can also OHKO with Hidden Power Fighting or a coverage move of choice. Sandshrew and Hippopotas can take any of Aipom's attacks and hit back with Earthquake. In general, any Pokemon that can outspeed Aipom&mdash;with or without the aid of a Choice Scarf&mdash;will be able to take it down because of its paper-thin defenses.</p>
