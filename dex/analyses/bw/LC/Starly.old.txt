[Overview]

<p>Starly is a Pokemon that could be an effective sweeper if it weren't outclassed by other Flying-type Pokemon, namely Taillow and Doduo. Starly's Attack and Speed stats aren't very good, and its defenses aren't something to brag about either. Its ability is near useless, as Pokemon don't often rely on moves that lower accuracy. On the other hand, it does have two great STAB moves in Brave Bird and Return, which it can use to great effect.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Return
move 3: U-turn / Pursuit
move 4: Final Gambit
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Adamant
evs: 36 HP / 236 Atk / 36 Def / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the only set that Starly will be able to use effectively and competently. It has a great 120 base power STAB move in Brave Bird. Return is another decent STAB attack, as it does not cause recoil damage, unlike Brave Bird. U-turn is a nice move for scouting. Final Gambit can deal major damage to opponents that Starly has trouble defeating, such as Bronzor, Magnemite, and Slowpoke. Pursuit is good for trapping Ghost-types, such as Choice Scarf Gastly locked into Shadow Ball, as Starly has a helpful immunity to Ghost-type attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs maximize Starly's Attack and Speed, while the rest are put into its defenses. An Adamant nature is preferred, as Starly will then have a good boost to its power. Starly really appreciates Rapid Spin support, as Stealth Rock is crippling for it. Staryu and Tentacool aren't bad ideas, but Baltoy is perhaps the best option, as it is immune to Electric- and resists Rock-type attacks. Pokemon that can beat Bronzor, such as Ponyta and Houndour, are also good partners for Starly. Most attacks coming from Pokemon that are faster than Starly will do a number on it, as Starly has very poor defenses. A physically defensive Pokemon, such as Bronzor, can stall out Starly or set up entry hazards.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Starly gets Steel Wing for the rare Rock-types, such as Cranidos. Agility could be used, but Starly is unlikely to get a free turn to double its Speed. In addition, an Endeavor set could be used with a Focus Sash and Quick Attack, unless Stealth Rock is up, or damaging weather is happening, which is why this set should be used as a lead. Heat Wave and Hidden Power Ground can be used to do some damage to troublesome Pokemon, including Bronzor, Ferroseed, and Magnemite, but Starly's Special Attack stat is too low for them to be viable. Starly can abuse Roost, but its defenses let it be KOed rather easily. Starly could also use a Life Orb or Choice Band set, but it lacks the Speed to do so effectively. Revenge is another option, but in this metagame, priority attacks are in abundance, making it useless. Finally, Starly can use Toxic if it is being walled by the likes of Slowpoke, or Feather Dance to lower the power of Ferroseed's Gyro Ball, as this will reduce their walling capabilities.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bronzor resists both of Starly's STAB attacks, while U-turn or Pursuit won't be doing much damage, either. Most Steel-types, in general, also fare very well against Starly, since they resist both Flying- and Normal-type attacks. In addition, most Choice Scarf users that can outspeed Starly usually pack a super effective attack and can KO with said move. Choice Scarf Gastly outspeeds and OHKOs Starly with a STAB Sludge Bomb or Thunderbolt. Magnemite resists all of Starly's attacks and it destroys Starly with STAB Thunderbolt. Also, Slowpoke's defense is too high for any of Starly's attacks to do much damage, and it can easily stall out Starly's STAB attacks by recovering with Slack Off.</p>
