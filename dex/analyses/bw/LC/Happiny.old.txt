[Overview] 

<p>Happiny is nothing in comparison to its OU evolution: Blissey. Although Happiny has great HP and Special Defense stats, the rest of its stats are horrible, to say the least. It has access to a few usable support moves such as Heal Bell, Light Screen, and Thunder Wave, but other than that, Happiny's movepool isn't very good. Natural Cure removes status upon switching out, but it's mostly pointless if you are running Heal Bell or Aromatherapy. Happiny has no reliable recovery outside of Rest, so when it's crippled to the extent that it can't take hits, Happiny is just death fodder. In short, Happiny is an awful Pokemon, but it is rather cute.</p>

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>The only reason to use Happiny is because of its high HP and Special Defense stats. Thunder Wave can cripple speedy physical sweepers who switch into it, while Toxic is used to wear down opposing bulky walls, such as Slowpoke. Heal Bell is used to relieve its teammates of status, while Light Screen is handy for supporting Pokemon who need to set up. Flamethrower is mainly a filler so that Happiny isn't complete Taunt bait, but it won't be doing much damage to anything except a Level 1 Weedle.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>Happiny's base 5 Defense means it will need serious support on the physical side. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Duskull, Koffing, and Pineco are all good options, as they all have access to helpful support moves for your team. Wish support is helpful as Happiny's only recovery move is Rest, which is pretty unreliable. Natu and Cleffa can provide Wish support, and they can also set up dual screens or abuse Encore, respectively. Finally, a Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp can soften the blows of physical attackers. Duskull and Shuppet have access to Will-O-Wisp, and they can both switch into Fighting-type attacks aimed at Happiny.</p>

[Other Options] 

<p>Counter and Focus Sash can be used with Happiny's awful Defense and high HP, as it will surely KO a physical attacker, assuming Happiny hasn't taken previous damage. Charm can be used to lower an opponent's Attack stat, but this stat drop wears off after the opponent switches out. Gravity can support teammates by providing them with an accuracy boost, and it also grounds Levitators and Flying-types. Rest is Happiny's only recovery option, and it may be useful with Natural Cure or a cleric, but it's generally a poor choice. Lastly, Happiny can abuse Serene Grace with Thunder Wave and Headbutt, but this is luck-based and fairly gimmicky, especially with Happiny's base 5 Attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters] 

<p>Happiny isn't difficult to counter. All you have to do is avoid being statused upon switching in, and pummel it with anything physically-based. Happiny only has base 5 Defense, so it isn't going to survive a lot. Just watch out for Counter, even though it's unlikely you'll ever come across it. In short, Happiny isn't threatening at all.</p>
