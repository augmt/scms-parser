[Overview]

<p>Baltoy is a very underrated Pokemon. It can support its team very well with its access to Rapid Spin, Stealth Rock, Trick Room, and dual screens. Baltoy is also one of the few Pokemon that resists the EdgeQuake combination, allowing it to check a large number of Pokemon in conjunction with its large offensive movepool and decent offensive stats. Overall, though Baltoy might not have the best stats in the metagame, its movepool and typing give it a niche, making it a solid choice for any team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Baltoy's access to both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock allow it to support its team with competence. Earth Power should be used in the third moveslot to deal with Croagunk and Stunky, common switch-ins to Baltoy. However, one must note that Stunky can trap and revenge kill Baltoy with Pursuit if it survives Earth Power. Toxic can severely cripple common spinblockers such as Frillish, as well as putting sweepers on a timer, but Psychic is also an option for nailing Gastly, which is immune to the move.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread maximizes Baltoy's HP and weaker defense, making it a good mixed wall, especially when combined with a Bold nature. The remaining EVs are invested in Baltoy's Special Attack and Special Defense, granting one more point to each of those stats. Eviolite is the best choice for an item, as it allows Baltoy to tank hits with ease, thus making it easier to support its team very well. Oran Berry could be considered over Eviolite, as Baltoy has no form of recovery outside of Rest. A Relaxed nature can also be utilized on this set if you opt to use physical attacks.</p>

<p>Ghost-types, such as Frillish, are good teammates for Baltoy. They keep Stealth Rock in play thanks to their ability to block Rapid Spin, while resisting the Bug-type attacks that Baltoy is weak to. Mantyke is also a viable teammate as it resists Water-type attacks, while Baltoy is immune to Electric-type attacks and can spin away Stealth Rock, both of which devastate Mantyke. Snover deals with the Water- and Grass-types that trouble Baltoy, and also appreciates the removal of Stealth Rock. Pokemon that can deal with opposing spinblockers, such as Houndour and Stunky, also make good teammates for Baltoy.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Stealth Rock
move 4: Toxic / Explosion / Shadow Ball
item: Eviolite / Light Clay
nature: Impish / Bold
evs: 196 HP / 196 Def / 112 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The purpose of this set is to set up dual screens, which allows frail, offensive teammates to take attacks as they set up. Stealth Rock is used in the third slot, as it breaks the opponent's Focus Sash and Sturdy while further enhancing Baltoy's utility. Toxic is the best option for the last slot, allowing Baltoy to cripple opposing walls and ensuring that it doesn't become a sitting duck after it has set up. Shadow Ball and Explosion are also viable, as they prevent Baltoy from being shut down by Taunt. Explosion lets Baltoy go out with a bang, allowing a sweeper to switch in safely, but Shadow Ball is also an option for hitting Ghost-types attempting to negate an expected Explosion.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Eviolite allows Baltoy to set up dual screens with ease, and it is the primary option for Baltoy's item. However, Light Clay could also be used to make the dual screens last longer. An Oran Berry could be considered over Eviolite or Light Clay if Baltoy is not using Explosion, as Baltoy has no recovery moves outside of Rest. Earth Power for another STAB move, as it prevents Baltoy from being completely vulnerable to Stunky and other Dark-type Pokemon that can trap and revenge kill Baltoy with Pursuit.</p>

<p>It is very beneficial to have set-up sweepers on your team to make full use of the dual screens that Baltoy sets up. Thus, Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Scraggy, Bulk Up Timburr, and Shell Smash Clamperl pair up well with Baltoy. Some other good teammates for Baltoy are spinblockers such as Frillish, as if the Stealth Rock set up by Baltoy is removed, then a lot of hard work will go to waste.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There are a few other options that Baltoy can make use of. One of those options is to use Rain Dance on the dual screens set, making Baltoy a great option for teams dependent on rain. Baltoy can also utilize Trick Room decently with its relatively low Speed and respectable offenses. With Baltoy's decent base 55 Speed, it could run a Choice Scarf set. Baltoy hits a pretty fast 22 Speed with a Choice Scarf. However, Baltoy lacks the strong offenses that are needed to score significant KOs. A specially defensive EV spread can be utilized on the dual screen set to make use of Baltoy's large Special Defense.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Stunky is a good check to Baltoy, as it can switch in on any of its support moves and revenge kill it with Pursuit. However, it needs to be wary of Earth Power, which will do massive damage, or possibly even OHKO it. Fast Water-types such as Chinchou and Staryu can outspeed and OHKO Baltoy with their STAB attacks. Snover also makes a fine check, as it can OHKO Baltoy with either Giga Drain or Blizzard. Mantyke is immune to Earth Power, doesn't even get 3HKOed by Ice Beam, and can OHKO Baltoy with Hydro Pump, making it perhaps the best check to Baltoy.</p>
