[Overview]

<p>Shinx makes its way into the fifth generation with a few new tricks up its sleeve, the most notable of which being its new ability, Guts. It also gained a more powerful STAB move in the form of Wild Charge, which also has great coverage alongside its other moves, such as Crunch, Ice Fang, and Fire Fang. Sadly, not all is great for Shinx, as it is a bit slow, leaving it easily revenge killed. Despite that drawback, Shinx is a viable attacking choice to consider when building a Little Cup team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Shinx makes good use of Guts with this set, which reaches 16 Attack and 15 Speed. Facade is actually the most powerful option on this set after Shinx is afflicted with a status, and it has good neutral coverage. Wild Charge is nearly as powerful and hits opponents that are weak to it, such as Frillish, quite hard, though Shinx can faint quite quickly from combined recoil and status damage. Ice Fang is the main option in the third slot, as it hits Lileep for more damage than Facade. Fire Fang is the main choice for the last move as it lands a KO on Ferroseed and Snover. Another option in either slot is Crunch, which hits Ghost-types super effectively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Toxic Orb is usually the best item, as it is better if Shinx is expected to survive for three turns or less. Flame Orb is an option if Shinx is expected to last longer, however, as the burn damage is less for the fourth turn and onward. Drilbur in the sand is a major problem for Shinx, as it outspeeds and can easily KO Shinx, making Choice Scarf Snover a great teammate, as it can KO Drilbur with Blizzard after removing sand. Dwebble is also a good choice to pair with Shinx, as it can set up entry hazards to allow Shinx to obtain more KOs. Bronzor can come in on Ground-type attacks aimed at Shinx and can set up Stealth Rock. The main theats to Shinx are faster Pokemon that can deal heavy damage, so Choice Scarf users in general are good teammates.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Double Kick is a decent option to consider, but it gets inferior coverage compared to the other moves in its arsenal. Quick Attack is available as a priority move, though extra coverage is usually more valuable. Thunder Wave is an option along with Intimidate on a defensive set, but there are much better options for defensive purposes than Shinx. Protect is a good option, as it allows Shinx to safely activate its chosen status. Howl is a possibility, as after a Guts boost and one use of Howl, Shinx hits incredibly hard. Thunder Fang and Spark could be used as recoil-free alternatives to Wild Charge, though the power drop is unwelcome. Magnet Rise is an option to avoid Ground-type moves temporarily, though Shinx would rather hit the users of said moves on the switch. Finally, Shinx can reach 8 Speed, which is definitely slow enough to be used with Trick Room support.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Drilbur can switch in on Wild Charge, Crunch, or Fire Fang, and can proceed to KO it with STAB Earthquake easily. Choice Scarf Snover and Chinchou can revenge kill, as Shinx has quite low defenses. On that note, any Pokemon with a priority move, such as Timburr or Mienfoo, can come in after Shinx KOes something and KO back themselves.</p>
