[Overview]

<p>Stunky retains the same role it played in Generation IV: being one of the best checks to Ghost-types. It can take a Shadow Ball or Hidden Power Fighting with ease, and easily KO Pokemon such as Gastly or Misdreavus with a STAB Dark-type attack. It has above-average attacking stats and good Speed; however, it unfortunately misses the coveted 19 Speed tier by a single point. Its nice typing leaves it with only one weakness, which is to regrettably common Ground-type attacks. This allows Pokemon such as Drilbur and Diglett to serve as a near-surefire check to Stunky every time. Still, Stunky is a good Pokemon to use if Ghost-types are giving your team trouble.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Though Stunky may seem like an offensive trapper, the addition of Eviolite has given it the ability to act as more of a defensive trapper. With the given defensive spread, Stunky's HP and defenses rise to 24 / 18 / 21, which is very solid for any bulky Pokemon in Little Cup. Its typing is also great for trapping Ghost-types, being able to resist Ghost-type attacks while being resistant or neutral to the secondary typing of all Ghost-types in Little Cup, bar the rare Golett. Sucker Punch and Pursuit are very important moves to have, since they allow Stunky to act first if the opponent decides to attack and inflict double damage if they decide to switch, respectively. Crunch is a solid option on Stunky, as Crunch gives it a reliable STAB attack with decent power. However, Taunt is an option over Crunch to prevent Stunky from getting burned by Will-O-Wisps. Finally, Explosion gives Stunky the power to go out with a bang, but Fire Blast is always an option for hitting Steel-types, such as Ferroseed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Due to Stunky's typing and attacks, Scraggy will be a common switch in to this set after Stunky has done its job. Timburr, Mienfoo, and Croagunk are all great options to handle Scraggy, depending on the moveset that it runs. In terms of EVs, Stunky can run a more offensive spread of 12 HP / 252 Atk / 188 SpD / 4 Spe with an Adamant nature, as this only slightly limits Stunky's defensive potential, and in either case, 14 Speed is more than enough to outpace Ghost-types not named Gastly.</p>

<p>Since Stunky loses easily to Steel-types if it doesn't have Fire Blast, Magnemite is a great partner. However, they are both weak to Ground-type attacks, so a Flying-type partner or one with Levitate is also appreciated. Said Flying-types are also appreciated since they fare well against Fighting-type Pokemon that commonly switch into Stunky. Speaking of Fighting-types, Abra is a good teammate to have to handle them, especially since it has good synergy with Stunky because some Ghost-types give Abra trouble. Misdreavus will always outspeed this variant of Stunky and Will-O-Wisp it before it has a chance to use Taunt. For this reason, Lum Berry can be a gimmicky strategy that beats most Misdreavus but lacks general usefulness.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is Stunky's best chance at attempting a sweep. With the given moves, Stunky can easily beat Gastly, one of the biggest threats in the metagame. Pursuit is great for trapping Ghost-types. Crunch is Stunky's most reliable STAB attack, but Sucker Punch can allow it to OHKO numerous faster threats, such as Diglett. Fire Blast absolutely destroys Ferroseed, and does big damage to Bronzor as well. Flamethrower is a perfectly viable alternative if Fire Blast's poor accuracy is off-putting. Hidden Power Ground rounds out the set, allowing Stunky to get super effective coverage on other and most Rock-types, and beat Rock Polish Aron one-on-one. Life Orb is important, as it allows Stunky to get as much power as possible. For EVs, Attack and Speed are maximized, and since Stunky is incapable of hitting 19 HP, an extra point is added to HP.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Pokemon immune to Ground-type attacks are good teammates. Bronzor is a good partner, as it covers Stunky's lone weakness, and can remove opposing Diglett from the battle. It can also set up Stealth Rock, something that Stunky will enjoy. Eviolite Slowpoke is another decent partner, as Stunky can sponge Ghost- and Dark-type attacks aimed at it. Frillish and some other Ghost-types are nice teammates, since they have perfect synergy with Stunky. Wynaut is also good for trapping most of Stunky's counters.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Stunky doesn't have a lot of other options. It still retains Explosion, but it isn't as potent as it once was since it doesn't halve the opposing Pokemon's Defense. Hone Claws is Stunky's only viable boosting move, but in most cases, Stunky would rather have another attacking option. Stunky can feasibly run a Choice Scarf set, but the additional power and ability to switch attacks that Life Orb provides is better in most cases. Finally, Stunky can run a Lum Berry over Life Orb in order to cure a possible burn from Duskull or Frillish.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Though it must watch out for Crunch, Frillish can switch in and cripple Stunky with Will-O-Wisp. Bulky Choice Scarf users that don't take much damage from Sucker Punch also fare well against Stunky. Choice Scarf Magnemite can hit Stunky hard with Thunderbolt, and takes next to nothing from Sucker Punch (though Magnemite must watch out for Fire Blast or Hidden Power Ground on the switch). Hippopotas doesn't take much damage from it either, and though Hippopotas cannot outspeed Stunky, its high defenses and an Eviolite boost will allow it to take repeated hits and easily dispatch Stunky with its STAB Earthquake. Finally, bulky Fighting-types such as Timburr can use Stunky as setup bait.</p>
