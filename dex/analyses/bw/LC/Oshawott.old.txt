[Overview]

<p>Oshawott brings no surprises as the fifth useless Water-type starter Pokemon. Almost completely outclassed by every other Water-type out there, this otter finds stiff competition for anyone's team slot. It does, however, have a nice niche, which is the ability to run a mixed or a Swords Dance set with X-Scissor to defeat Lileep and Slowpoke. Oshawott's popular competition face problems this otter can overcome; Staryu is generally better, but it can't run a physical set. Totodile faces a similar problem, as it can't run a special set, although its Swords Dance capabilities trump Oshawott's. Piplup can't learn Aqua Jet, and Chinchou has horrible Attack. Oshawott does, however, have too many flaws, including mediocre stats and a less-than-average movepool, to become a strong force. All-in-all, Oshawott isn't that great, but it is certainly viable with proper support.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Oshawott can really only run a Swords Dance set without being outclassed by something else. Priority in Aqua Jet is very useful, as Little Cup contains a variety of fast, frail Pokemon such as Houndour and Taillow. Aqua Jet will OHKO Houndour pre-boost and OHKO Taillow post-boost, meaning powerful threats in Little Cup will have a hard time OHKOing Oshawott before it can hit them. Waterfall is Oshawott's main STAB move and will OHKO most threats it hits neutrally, such as Choice Scarf Mienfoo. A combination of Waterfall and Aqua Jet after a Swords Dance will even OHKO Eviolite Mienfoo. Since Oshawott will attract Slowpoke and Lileep with its Water-type moves, it gets time to set up on the switch. It can then proceed to strike either of them with X-Scissor and wreak havoc. If your team has a way to defeat the aforementioned walls, such as the combination of Wynaut and Diglett, Hidden Power Fire is recommended over X-Scissor to hit Ferroseed and Snover harder.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If you choose X-Scissor instead of Hidden Power Fire, use an Adamant nature. Otherwise, Naughty allows Oshawott to keep its decent Special Attack. Simply put, Adamant is for X-Scissor and Naughty is for Hidden Power. You can use Aqua Tail to OHKO Mienfoo after a Swords Dance, but it's not recommended, as 90 accuracy is always tricky, and Waterfall + Aqua Jet will 2HKO it on the switch. Lastly, Encore is useful to help Oshawott set up, but you lose either power or coverage, both things Oshawott really needs. If you're not using Hidden Power Fire, an EV spread of 236 Atk / 236 Spe will get you the same stats barring Special Attack, and may be used if you prefer a "cleaner" spread.</p>

<p>Teammates depend on what move you run in the last slot. If you use X-Scissor, a Steel trapper such as Magnemite or Nosepass to defeat Ferroseed is a good idea. If you opt for Hidden Power Fire, a combination of Wynaut and Diglett to kill Slowpoke and Lileep is ideal. Switching in on Recover or Slack Off allows you to lock them in that move with Encore and use Tickle to lower their Defense. Then, switch to Diglett and boost its Attack with Hone Claws. Finally, use Earthquake to OHKO them. Diglett also provides a switch-in to Electric-types, namely Chinchou, who resists both Water and Fire.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Using a specially oriented set isn't recommended, as Chinchou, Staryu, and even Piplup outclass it. After all, Oshawott only gets Grass Knot and Air Slash to differentiate it from other Water-types, and other moves are usually stronger anyway. Night Slash can be used for Slowpoke and Frillish, but Totodile plays that role much better. Revenge is an option for Ferroseed, but this fighting move is outclassed by Hidden Power Fire. Lastly, a combination of Substitute and Torrent can be used to raise the power of Oshawott's special attacks, but the high amount of weather and priority in Little Cup make this suboptimal.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Counters include Slowpoke, Lileep, Chinchou, Snover, Ferroseed, Croagunk, Eviolite Staryu with Thunderbolt, Wooper, and Frillish. Cottonee and Eviolite Magnemite are decent checks, as they can take a hit and OHKO Oshawott with a STAB move. Lastly, Poliwag can switch in on a Water-type move with Water Absorb, Encore it, and set up Belly Drum.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Both Torrent and Shell Armor are subpar, but Torrent is more useful because Oshawott doesn't want to be taking that many hits in the first place, and critical hits only have a 1/16 chance of occurring.</p>
