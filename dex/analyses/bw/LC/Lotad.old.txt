[Overview]

<p>Lotad is inferior to most Rain Dance sweepers because it is relatively weak and frail. It has mediocre stats all across the board, and there is little reason to use Lotad over the likes of Mantyke and Kabuto. What Lotad does have is good STAB attacks and coverage, allowing it to hit a good number of Pokemon for super effective damage. Unfortunately, it is still not that great, and is easily removed by other weather inducers. Overall, Lotad is hugely outclassed by other rain sweepers and will rarely find a place on one's team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>This is the only viable set Lotad can run, though it is still outclassed by its rivals. Rain Dance doubles its Speed, allowing it to attack before its opponent, which is very important as Lotad is frail. When backed by Life Orb, STAB, and the rain, Surf is quite powerful, even coming off of Lotad's mediocre Special Attack stat. Giga Drain provides secondary STAB, and hits opposing Water-type Pokemon such as Frillish for super effective damage, which would otherwise easily wall it. Finally, Ice Beam provides more coverage, hitting Grass- and Dragon-types who resist both of Lotad's STAB attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>With a Timid nature, Lotad reaches 26 Speed with Swift Swim, while hitting 24 Speed if a Modest nature is used. Generally, a Timid nature is more important so Lotad can outspeed more Pokemon, but Modest can be used for more power. Life Orb is a must in order to achieve certain KOs, and the loss in HP is not a great issue. With 0 HP IVs, Lotad only has 19 HP, meaning it only loses one HP from Life Orb per turn, as opposed to losing two HP if its IV is not reduced. The EVs maximize Lotad's most important stats, Special Attack and Speed, while slightly boosting its defenses. For a Pokemon such as Lotad, entry hazards are very important. Ferroseed can provide Spikes, and with the presence of rain, Ferroseed's weakness to Fire-type attacks is reduced. Bronzor is also a good teammate, as it can set up both Rain Dance and Stealth Rock, freeing up a moveslot for Lotad. Powerful Fighting-type Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Scraggy can take on walls such as Munchlax, allowing Lotad to continue its sweep. Chinchou can be useful in dealing with Mantyke, a Pokemon Lotad has trouble with.</p> 

[Other Options] 

<p>Lotad is a Pokemon that doesn't have too many other options. Scald can be used to burn the opponent, but Lotad is better off attacking with more powerful moves. A Swords Dance set with Waterfall, Seed Bomb, and Zen Headbutt is an option, though Lotad will find it difficult to set up Swords Dance, not to mention the fact that such a set would also be walled by Ferroseed. Toxic can be used to cripple the foe, but Lotad is too frail to use support options. Hidden Power Electric can be used over Ice Beam to hit Mantyke harder. Lotad can also set up Rain Dance itself, though coverage is more important for Lotad. It can also run a rain supporting set with a bulky spread and Eviolite or Damp Rock. Teeter Dance can be used to confuse opponents, but it is not reliable and Lotad is better off attacking. Lotad also has Own Tempo, but it is more or less useless.</p>

[Checks and Counters] 

<p>Choice Scarf Snover is a good counter to Lotad since it takes away rain and can defeat Lotad with Blizzard. Ferroseed is not weak to any attack from Lotad, and can take a rain-boosted Surf. It can set up Spikes and then finish off Lotad with Bullet Seed. Tentacool also isn't weak to any of Lotad's attacks and can easily KO it with Sludge Wave. It can also use a powerful STAB boosted Hydro Pump in the rain against Lotad's teammates, doing severe damage. Munchlax is also a good check since it can take a rain-boosted Surf and then KO with Return. Outside of rain, any relatively fast sweeper can defeat Lotad. It only hits 13 Speed max, so Pokemon such as Gastly can outspeed and finish it off.</p>
