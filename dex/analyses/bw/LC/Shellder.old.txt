[Overview]

<p>With access to one of the best boosting moves in the game and a superb ability to match, Shellder is a top threat in the Little Cup metagame. Shell Smash transforms Shellder into a dangerous sweeper, reducing its defenses while doubling its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed. This, in conjunction with what is effectively two 125 Base Power moves that hit through Substitute, Focus Sash, and Sturdy, makes Shellder a superb addition to any team. Shellder can also run an effective Choice Scarf set, reaching 21 Speed with a Scarf, which allows it to outspeed all unboosted Pokemon in the Little Cup metagame. This set is notable for being one of the few things that can revenge kill Murkrow and other Flying-types.</p>

<p>Despite its offensive prowess, Shellder does have some glaring weaknesses, the first one being its extreme frailty after using Shell Smash. Any faster Scarf user or one that uses a neutral priority move will revenge kill Shellder with ease. Thankfully, Shellder also has access to priority in the form of Ice Shard, and can utilize Eviolite to rectify its poor Special Defense after a boost.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Shellder is extremely difficult to wall after a Shell Smash. In fact, it reaches a prodigious 30 Attack, 22 Special Attack and 28 Speed after a single Shell Smash using the given EV spread. Rock Blast and Icicle Spear are both the equivalent of 125 Base Power attacks, and do enormous damage to anything that doesn't resist them. Additionally, the combination of the two attacks provides decent type coverage. The choice between Hydro Pump and Ice Shard depends on the rest of your team. If you want Shellder to be able to hit Steel- and Rock-types, run Hydro Pump. However, if your team is able to deal with the aforementioned threats, Ice Shard is the superior option.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>In terms of items, Eviolite boosts both of Shellder's defenses by one stage, giving Shellder more opportunities to set up. After a Shell Smash, due to the effects of Eviolite essentially canceling out the Defense and Special Defense drops, Shellder is still quite bulky. Alternatively, Life Orb can be used if you feel a need for a boost in power, allowing it to net some OHKOs that it ordinarily wouldn't. Oran Berry is also a viable option due to Shellder's frailty. Additionally, Lum Berry could be used to allow Shellder to set up on Pokemon that would otherwise cripple it with status.</p>

<p>Razor Shell can be used in place of Hydro Pump to provide a good physical STAB move. However, Hydro Pump is generally a better choice due to the sheer power it has. The EVs given to Shellder maximize its attacking potential while increasing bulk in order to give more setup opportunities. Since this is Little Cup, Shellder having 15 Atk deals the same damage as it having 17 Atk, and after a Shell Smash, all relevant threats are hit equally hard by 30 Atk or 34 Atk. Thus, a Speed enhancing nature should always be preferred on Shell Smash Shellder.</p>

<p>In terms of teammates, Pokemon such as Houndour and Magnemite are great choices, as they can eliminate Steel-types such as Ferroseed, which trouble Shellder. Stunky does an excellent job at trapping and KOing Frillish, another Pokemon that causes Shellder problems. Pokemon such as Wynaut and Cottonee can use Encore to give Shellder a free turn to set up. Bronzor can set up dual screens, which allow Shellder to set up more easily, while also being able to provide Rain Dance support, which increases the power of Hydro Pump.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set attempts to take advantage of Shellder's powerful multi-hit moves. Shellder can effectively attack and remove powerful, Substitute-abusing threats from a match with its multi-hit attacks. The EVs given allow Shellder to reach 21 Speed, outspeeding all unboosted Pokemon in the Little Cup metagame. Unfortunately, despite Shellder's niche, it is usually outclassed by Pokemon such as Mienfoo. It may seem peculiar that max Attack is not used; however, one point less does not actually make any significant impact on Shellder's power, and it allows Shellder to invest in Special Defense to soak hits from Croagunk. Rock Blast hits any Pokemon that doesn't resist it hard, and Icicle Spear does the same. It also provides astounding coverage on Larvesta, something that Shellder's rival Snover can't claim to do without Hidden Power Rock. Rock Blast and Icicle Spear have excellent synergy with each other, hitting a large portion of the metagame for at least neutral damage. Razor Shell hits the Pokemon that resist Rock Blast and Icicle Spear, which include Aron and Bronzor, and provides Shellder with a decent Water-type STAB attack.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Explosion can be used to let Shellder go out with a bang, doing immense damage to anything that doesn't resist or is immune to it. Hydro Pump trades the reliability of Razor Shell for power; keep in mind that a Naive nature should be used if this move is chosen. Return is also an option, providing good neutral coverage. While it might seem out of place on a Choice Scarf set, Ice Shard allows Shellder to hit faster Choice Scarf users hard and KO threats such as Rock Polish Archen, which would normally outspeed it.</p>

<p>Shellder faces stiff competition from Choice Scarf Snover, but has a few notable advantages, including the fact that it can break Substitutes and take on offensive Misdreavus with greater ease. Stunky makes an excellent partner for this set, as it can effectively remove Frillish, a Pokemon that counters Shellder quite effectively. Like the Shell Smash set, this set also benefits from having Steel-types such as Ferroseed that can hinder sweeps removed. This makes Pokemon such as Magnemite and Houndour superb partners. Fighting-types are good teammates, especially with Murkrow out of the picture. Scraggy is another example of such a Pokemon, and is a useful teammate as it can set up on Munchlax and Bronzor, two Pokemon that can handle most of what Shellder throws at them. Shellder can take care of most Pokemon with 19 Speed, including Abra and Murkrow, meaning a Misdreavus does not have to risk losing a Speed tie.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Surf can be used over Hydro Pump if accuracy is an issue. A special set could possibly be used since Shellder has access to Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, particularly in conjunction with Shell Smash. Shellder could potentially use Payback to hit Ghost-types hard on the switch in. On that note, Shellder also makes an effective Rapid Spin user, with access to Payback and a neutrality to Stealth Rock.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bronzor walls all Shellder that don't run Hydro Pump or Surf, and can easily set up on it or KO it with Psychic. Priority users, such as Croagunk and Pawniard, can prey on Shellder's weak defenses (especially after Shell Smash). Pokemon that hit above 28 Speed when holding a Choice Scarf, such as Elekid, outspeed it after a Shell Smash and can hit Shellder for super effective damage, but have trouble switching in. Slowpoke is also neutral to all of Shellder's attacks and can survive a Rock Blast. However, it can't do much back to Shellder. Frillish walls the Scarf set quite effectively, stopping any sweep it might attempt. Munchlax, through its ability Thick Fat, has no problem switching in to Shellder's most common move, Icicle Spear. Chinchou resists anything Shellder packs and can don a Choice Scarf of its own to revenge it. However, it cannot take repeated hits boosted by Shell Smash.</p>
