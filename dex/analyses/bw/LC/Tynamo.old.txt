[Overview]

<p>Tynamo is rarely seen in Little Cup, and for good reason; it learns only four moves, three of which are Electric-type. It may have no weaknesses thanks to Levitate, but low defenses prevent Tynamo from taking advantage of this. Access to Charge Beam means that Tynamo can do a little damage, but there is almost always a better option to consider before Tynamo when building a team.</p>

[SET]
name: Attacker
move 1: Charge Beam
move 2: Spark
move 3: Tackle
move 4: Thunder Wave
item: Eviolite
nature: Quiet
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is Tynamo's entire movepool, so this is literally all Tynamo can do. The best plan of attack is usually to use Charge Beam as much as possible, hopefully dealing more damage as time goes on. Spark hits specially defensive Pokemon such as Munchlax, and is slightly stronger and more accurate than Charge Beam initially. While Tackle would rarely see use, it is Tynamo's only move that affects Ground-types. Thunder Wave is available for paralysis, which supports Tynamo's team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Eviolite is preferred since it can give Tynamo more chances to use Charge Beam, but Life Orb is an option for more power. Ground-types, such as Hippopotas, wall this set to no end, as Tackle will barely do any damage to them. Staryu and Gastly are good teammates for Tynamo, as they check Ground-types handily. Ferroseed, Dratini, and Chinchou all deal with Tynamo easily, thanks to their resistance to Electric-type moves. Magnemite is a good teammate to handle Ferroseed, while Ferroseed itself is useful for beating most Chinchou. Slowpoke is a decent check to Dratini. Golett also gets a special mention as a counter, as it is immune to every move that Tynamo learns.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Tynamo has no other options, as it only learns four moves. While not recommended, a different item or nature may be preferred depending on the rest of your team. Or a different Pokemon.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Ground-types and Chinchou are the best counters, as they only take damage from Tackle. Ferroseed resists both Electric- and Normal-type moves, so it works as well. Dratini also resists Electric, and can set up on Tynamo thanks to Shed Skin. Finally, Golett, despite being quite rare, isn't even touched by anything in Tynamo's movepool.</p>
