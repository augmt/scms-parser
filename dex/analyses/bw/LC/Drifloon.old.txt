[Overview]

<p>Drifloon appears to be outclassed by other offensive Flying- and Ghost-types, particularly Murkrow and Misdreavus, because of its low offensive stats. However, Drifloon can create a niche for itself with the combination of Unburden and Flying Gem, doubling its Speed and powering its main STAB, Acrobatics, at the same time. Although its typing allows it to switch into common Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, Drifloon is rather frail without an Eviolite. In addition, with its weakness to Stealth Rock and priority moves such as Sucker Punch and Ice Shard, Drifloon's life span is limited. Despite this, Drifloon can wreak havoc on weakened teams, as its powerful Acrobatics combined with Unburden's speed boost is often game-ending.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to Unburden, once Drifloon has used its Flying Gem, it instantly becomes one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, tying with Sand Rush Drilbur. With the abundance of Fighting-types in Little Cup, Drifloon has plenty of opportunities to use Acrobatics, which will have an incredible Base Power of 247 when factoring in STAB and the Flying Gem boost. Shadow Ball is Drifloon's secondary STAB, offering good neutral coverage with Acrobatics and hitting Ghost- and Psychic-type threats, such as the extremely common Misdreavus and Abra, super effectively. Substitute is extremely useful for Drifloon, as it allows Drifloon to avoid Sucker Punch and status moves which would otherwise cripple it.</p>

<p>The final moveslot is up for grabs, as all three moves allow Drifloon to cripple its counters. Destiny Bond is a useful way to remove offensive threats, such as Magnemite and Chinchou, who can shrug off Drifloon's attacks and KO back with their super effective Electric-type moves. However, Destiny Bond is not as useful against defensive threats such as Porygon or Lileep, as they can avoid Destiny Bond with Recover and easily stall Drifloon out if sandstorm or hail is up. Hypnosis is far less situational than Destiny Bond, but is less reliable due to its 60% accuracy. Finally, Disable is an option that goes well with Substitute. It can potentially allow Drifloon to beat Pokemon that only have one attack to hit Drifloon with, such as Shadow Ball from Porygon or Misdreavus. It can also cripple Choice Scarf Magnemite, bypass Sucker Punch users such as Murkrow and Stunky, and stop Lileep and Porygon from using Recover.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Naive nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Drilbur or Speed tie with Jolly Drilbur in sand. A Naughty nature is better in most situations though, as it gives Acrobatics a bit of extra power and still allows Drifloon to Speed tie with Adamant Sand Rush Drilbur. Drifloon has a relatively wide movepool; there are a plethora of other options that can be used on this set. Hidden Power Fire, Hidden Power Fighting, or Hidden Power Ground can all be used to hit Steel-types, the choice depends on who you want to hit harder; Ferroseed is dealt with by Hidden Power Fire, Pawniard is taken down by Hidden Power Fighting, and Magnemite is destroyed by Hidden Power Ground. Due to Little Cup EV mechanics, if you are going to use Hidden Power, you will need to add 4 EVs onto each stat that has been lowered to 30 IVs. However, Drifloon already uses the full 508 EVs, so the best solution is to use 40 Special Attack EVs, 36 HP EVs and 8 EVs in each defense. Thunderbolt is another move that can find a place on this set, hitting Murkrow and Omanyte for super effective damage. Status moves besides Hypnosis are also viable; Will-O-Wisp can cripple Murkrow, Pawniard, Stunky, and other physical attackers, whilst Toxic allows Drifloon to cripple Lileep and Porygon.</p>

<p>Because of Drifloon's fantastic ability to remove its own counters, Pokemon that share similar counters can make good teammates. Misdreavus and Murkrow can both be used in tandem with Drifloon if it manages to take down a Pokemon that threatens them. Fighting-types make exceptional partners to Drifloon due to their ability to beat Steel-, Dark-, and Rock-types. They can also switch into Porygon with ease. Magnemite is another Pokemon that works well with Drifloon, as it can check Murkrow and remove Steel-types from the game. Entry hazard support is also appreciated, as Drifloon isn't the strongest sweeper. Ferroseed and Lileep can both fulfill this role, and they both have the ability to wall Chinchou, who Drifloon finds troublesome. Finally, Rapid Spin support from Staryu or Drilbur is useful due to Drifloon's Stealth Rock weakness.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A set with Substitute, Calm Mind, and an Oran Berry can be used to set up and activate Unburden instead, but it is very difficult to pull off due to Drifloon's frailness and lack of power, even at +1 Special Attack. This set could also be used in conjunction with Baton Pass to support a sweeper or as part of a Baton Pass chain. Sucker Punch can be used to move before opposing priority users, but Drifloon is already fast enough, and the coverage is redundant with its Ghost-type STAB. Thunder Wave is another viable status move, but again, this is often unnecessary with Unburden. Weather Ball is always an option if you're using Drifloon with Snover, although be mindful that this has legality issues with Destiny Bond. Charge Beam can be used if you want to raise Drifloon's Special Attack, but its low Base Power is unappealing. Finally, Memento is an interesting option if Drifloon is severely weakened and you want to give another teammate set-up opportunities.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Drifloon is often difficult to fully counter due to Destiny Bond, Hypnosis, and Disable, but there are many Pokemon that Drifloon struggles against. Many bulky Pokemon with access to reliable recovery, such as Lileep, Porygon, and Hippopotas, take very little from Drifloon's attacks and can stall it out with ease. Steel-types such as Magnemite resist both of Drifloon's STABs and can easily defeat it due to its abysmal defenses. Chinchou is another Pokemon that can hit Drifloon with a super effective attack and has enough special bulk to shrug off Shadow Ball. Dark-types with Sucker Punch, such as Murkrow, Stunky, Houndour, and Pawniard, are a massive pain to Drifloon and can often cause mind games with Substitute and Destiny Bond. Pawniard's secondary Steel typing makes it particularly effective, as Drifloon has no chance of breaking through it with its STAB moves. Tirtouga, Omanyte, and Shellder can all set up on Drifloon without fearing anything but Hypnosis. Tirtouga and Shellder in particular can use priority attacks to outspeed Drifloon. Snover is another notable user of priority that deals a minimum of 54% to Drifloon with Ice Shard, although it must watch out for Acrobatics.</p>
