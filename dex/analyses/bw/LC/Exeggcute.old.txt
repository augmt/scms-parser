[Overview]

<p>Exeggcute might have got a major boost this generation in the form of Drought Vulpix, but sadly, Vulpix is banned, so Exeggcute will once again have to rely upon Sunny Day support to sweep. Eviolite also makes Exeggcute much more bulky, and Exeggcute still has a reliable recovery move in Synthesis and useful resistances to common Fighting-, Water-, and Ground-type attacks.</p>

<p>But it's not all sunshine for Exeggcute. First of all, it has a pretty bad Special Defense stat of 45, and to go along with that, it has weaknesses to Ice-, Fire-, Dark-, and Ghost-type attacks. Exeggcute's movepool is also pretty lackluster, as it has few coverage options outside of its STAB attacks. All in all, Exeggcute is a decent Pokemon, but won't be seeing much use in LC. </p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The trait that best warrants Exeggcute's success is its extreme diversity. It isn't diverse in the sense that it can run many sets effectively, but rather that all of its best skills are available in one set. With no form of permanent sunlight in Little Cup, Exeggcute can't sweep well enough to be usable. It is outclassed as a physical wall by almost everything out there, including Lileep and Ferroseed. This does, however, leave Exeggcute one set and a few roles it can play exceptionally well without being outclassed.</p>

<p>This set can do quite a few things. First, if it is necessary to temporarily remove a threat from the game so one of Exeggcute's teammates can set up, Sleep Powder is close to the best thing there is. Leaf Storm is another way of doing this, as its sheer power is enough to OHKO some common offensive Pokemon such as Meowth, Chinchou, and Mienfoo. It also allows Exeggcute to counter Staryu, which is a huge threat to stall teams. Diverse Exeggcute works very well on such teams because of the combination of Sleep Powder's ability to cause switches and the egg Pokemon's ability to stall with Substitute, Oran Berry, and Harvest, which has a 50% chance of restoring a used berry. Furthermore, Exeggcute provides resistances crucial to stall teams, such as Fighting, Water, and Electric. Finally, Exeggcute uses Psychic as a STAB attack that doesn't lower its Special Attack, and to improve its coverage. It is also useful for Mienfoo that think they can come in and fire off a U-turn unharmed when Exeggcute has already used Leaf Storm.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Once Exeggcute is in safely, it can do all it needs on its own, so teammates aren't as important as they are on other sets. Exeggcute works very well with entry hazards, as it causes many switches. Omanyte is a great teammate because it has nearly perfect synergy with Exeggcute and can set up all forms of entry hazards. Dual screens are useful, but Exeggcute is still successful without them. Because Exeggcute will be switching in and out a lot, removal of entry hazards will be very helpful; Pokemon that can use Rapid Spin, such as Staryu and Tentacool, which both have great synergy with Exeggcute, are good teammates. The latter can set up Toxic Spikes to aid Exeggcute's stall and check Mienfoo if Exeggcute isn't behind a Substitute, but be wary that Toxic Spikes might interfere with Sleep Powder.</p>

<p>Pokemon that can lure in opponents checked by Exeggcute are good teammates, both offensively and defensively. Houndour is a great example, as it can lure in Croagunk, Timburr, and Staryu for Exeggcute to demolish. Likewise, it can OHKO Ferroseed and Levitate Bronzor with Fire Blast. Munchlax also lures in Croagunk and Timburr, and it can OHKO Gastly with Zen Headbutt or trap it with Pursuit. It also has Thick Fat to take the Fire- and Ice-type hits that Exeggcute are weak to.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Exeggcute isn't the best wall in LC, it can accomplish a feat that no other wall in LC can; it can outspeed most Choice Scarf users and tie with Choice Scarf Scraggy. It can almost heal itself fully with Synthesis in the sun, taking away the need for Rest. Other than that, Exeggcute also gets Giga Drain to heal itself. Leech Seed is good with Giga Drain, allowing Exeggcute to regenerate its health at a crazy rate. Hidden Power Fire hits Ferroseed, which would otherwise wall Exeggcute completely. Protect stalls for Leech Seed damage, and Toxic can be used with Hidden Power Fire to have another way of taking down the opponent's health.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Obviously for this set, Pokemon with Sunny Day support, such as Cherubi, are great partners to bring sun. Chesto Berry and Harvest can be used outside of sun, but that somewhat defeats the purpose of having a fast wall. Houndour is another great partner for Exeggcute, as it is immune to Fire-type attacks, and Exeggcute can take most Water-type attacks that aren't from Clamperl. Munchlax is a great partner, especially if it has Sunny Day, as it can take Ice- and Fire-type attacks coming at Exeggcute, while Exeggcute can sponge the Fighting-type attacks that trouble Munchlax. The EV spread gives Exeggcute maximum physical bulk while allowing it to outspeed common Choice Scarf users, such as Magnemite. However, Dragon Dance or Choice Scarf Scraggy is the best counter to this set, as it will outspeed Exeggcute by 1 point and KO it with Crunch.</p>

[SET]
name: Chlorophyll Sweeper
move 1: Giga Drain / Solar Beam
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Fighting
move 4: Sleep Powder / Synthesis / Sunny Day
item: Life Orb / Eviolite
ability: Chlorophyll
nature: Modest
evs: 116 HP / 236 SpA / 116 Spe
[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set may seem outclassed by Oddish and Petilil offensively, but Exeggcute has much better defenses and STAB Psychic-type attacks to boast. Giga Drain is the preferred option because with Solar Beam, a weather changer such as Snover can switch in without difficulty, resulting in the move becoming highly ineffective. Psychic gives Exeggcute another strong STAB option to smack Pokemon that resist Grass-type attacks hard, while Hidden Power Fire hits the Steel-types that resist Exeggcute's other attacks. On the other hand, Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit Houndour, which can otherwise destroy Exeggcute. Sleep Powder makes sure Exeggcute is not setup bait, while Synthesis gives Exeggcute more staying power.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Again, Sunny Day support helps Exeggcute immensely for the aforementioned reasons. Energy Ball can be used sometimes, but compared to the instant health regeneration from Giga Drain, it's outclassed on the whole. Hidden Power Ground hits both Steel-types and Houndour, but Bronzor then has an easy time walling Exeggcute. Life Orb gives Exeggcute a lot of power, but Eviolite makes it very bulky with Synthesis. Heat Rock can be used to have an elongated sweep with Sunny Day, but that can be provided by team members. A Timid nature can be used to Speed tie with +2 Scraggy, but Modest gives much more power. The EV spread makes sure that Exeggcute outspeeds +1 Scraggy, and the rest is put into HP.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>On the Chlorophyll set, Explosion can be used when Exeggcute is at low health for a quick escape, but as it does not pack the same amount of power in BW, it's not a recommended option. For some reason, Exeggcute gets Swords Dance, and can run a Swords Dance set with sun support. Exeggcute has physical options such as Seed Bomb, Return, Explosion, and Nature Power (which becomes Earthquake in Wi-Fi), but it does not have too many other options. A Trick Room support set with Trick Room, Light Screen, Reflect, and Giga Drain can be used, but Exeggcute is outclassed in that department by Natu. With Harvest, Exeggcute can use Oran Berry to regenerate half of its health, but Exeggcute will lose Eviolite and Chlorophyll. Heat Rock and Sunny Day can be used to give Exeggcute more Speed, but Exeggcute benefits more from getting it from a teammate.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Houndour is the best counter to Exeggcute, destroying it with its STAB attacks. Ferroseed can wall Exeggcute completely if it isn't packing Hidden Power Fire. Snover and Hippopotas can hamper it by taking away Exeggcute's sun. Stunky traps it with Pursuit and Sucker Punch, but needs to watch out for Hidden Power Ground. Scraggy takes hits with Eviolite and can KO Exeggcute with Crunch. Dratini also resists Grass-type attacks, and can revenge kill Exeggcute with Extreme Speed. Lickitung ignores the sunlight and laughs at all of its attacks, setting up Curse. Most Pokemon with U-turn, such as Choice Scarf Mienfoo and Gligar, are good counters as well.</p>
