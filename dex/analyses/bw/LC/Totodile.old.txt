[Overview]

<p>Totodile is certainly an underrated threat in the Little Cup metagame. In addition to a high Attack stat, it also has access to both Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, which make it a great physical sweeper. Totodile has a decent movepool, highlighted by the likes of Waterfall, Aqua Jet, Ice Punch, and Return. Unfortunately, Totodile's defenses are horrendous, and it is easily taken down by any move it doesn't resist. All in all, Totodile is a very dangerous offensive threat, especially if it is given a chance to set up.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Totodile has all the tools required to pull of a sweep: good Attack, decent Speed, and access to a boosting move in Dragon Dance. After just one Dragon Dance, Totodile reaches 21 Speed and outspeeds every non-boosted Pokemon in the LC metagame. Dragon Dance also increases Totodile's damage output considerably. Waterfall is Totodile's best STAB move as it is both powerful and accurate. It has a 20% flinch chance as well, which can prove game-changing. Ice Punch is essential as it hits Grass-type Pokemon, such as Shroomish or Lileep, who would otherwise wall Totodile; it is also Totodile's strongest option against Ferroseed. Crunch hits Ghost-types, mainly Misdreavus and Frillish, who can threaten Totodile with Will-O-Wisp or a STAB Shadow Ball. Alternatively, Rock Slide can be used to hit Shelmet, Mantyke, and other bulky Flying-type Pokemon for super effective damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given nature and EV spread maximizes Totodile's Attack stat, and also enables it to hit 21 Speed after a Dragon Dance. Life Orb helps Totodile a lot by giving it extra power, but also reduces its longevity; therefore, a Lum Berry can be used to cure Totodile of any debilitating status and let it set up more easily. However, note that Life Orb recoil can help activate Torrent, and not many Pokemon will appreciate taking a Dragon Dance-, STAB-, and Torrent-boosted Waterfall. Totodile can utilize coverage moves such as Aerial Ace and Brick Break; the former OHKOes Croagunk, while the latter hits Steel-types--mainly Ferroseed--for super effective damage. Aqua Tail is a more powerful but less accurate STAB move that can be used over Waterfall to OHKO Mienfoo and Misdreavus at +2, while Aqua Jet can be used over Waterfall to beat Murkrow after a boost, but the power difference between Waterfall and Aqua Jet is quite noticeable.</p>

<p>Entry hazards are essential if you plan to pull off a sweep with Totodile; Choice Scarf Misdreavus and Magnemite are OHKOed by Aqua Jet at +2 after a Stealth Rock switch in. In addition to providing both Spikes and Stealth Rock support, Ferroseed resists the Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Totodile. Totodile is extremely frail; therefore, dual screen support can help it better tank priority moves. Bronzor provides both Stealth Rock and dual screen support and resists Grass-type attacks. Totodile can be quickly worn down by Life Orb recoil, which means that Wish support is always helpful. Natu can provide Wish support, and can also bounce back Stealth Rock and Spikes. If Totodile isn't carrying a Lum Berry, cleric support from Misdreavus and Chinchou is very useful as it enables Totodile to sweep with greater ease. Lastly, as Totodile is affected by all forms of entry hazards, Rapid Spin users make good teammates. Drilbur and Staryu are two very effective spinners, but beware as both share weaknesses with Totodile.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is a more offensive one; its main goal is to set up Swords Dance and plow through the opposing team. With just one Swords Dance, Totodile's Attack stat reaches an immense 34, which enables it to hit very hard. Aqua Jet is a STAB priority move that allows Totodile to hit faster Pokemon such as Mienfoo and hopefully KO them. Ice Punch's targets are mainly Grass- and Dragon-types, such as Shroomish and Dratini, who resist Totodile's STAB moves, as well as Ferroseed, who is hit for neutral damage. Crunch hits Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Frillish, both of whom can cripple Totodile with Will-O-Wisp. Waterfall is a stronger STAB move that can be used alongside Aqua Jet to KO slower but bulkier Pokemon, such as Porygon and Omanyte. Waterfall also has a nifty chance to flinch the opponent's Pokemon, but this will not usually be of any use due to Totodile's low Speed stat.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is simple: maximize Attack and Speed to boost Totodile's overall offensive prowess. In particular, an Adamant nature allows Totodile to OHKO Mienfoo with +2 Ice Punch. A Jolly nature isn't necessary as Aqua Jet bypasses Totodile's low Speed. As this set needs all the power it can get, Life Orb is the preferred item. Life Orb recoil also helps activate Torrent, which enables Totodile's Aqua Jet to take out just about anything that doesn't resist it. A Lum Berry is viable to heal Totodile of burn or paralysis, both of which completely cripple it. Aerial Ace can be used over Ice Punch to hit Croagunk, whom Totodile loses to most of the time. Protect prevents Fake Out from Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Croagunk, and the like, while Substitute blocks status and is a good scouting move in general. Superpower and Brick Break are alternatives over Ice Punch; both KO Ferroseed at +2.</p>

<p>This set requires a lot of support in order to pull off a sweep. Entry hazard support is vital as they help Totodile nab several important KOs. Ferroseed and Dwebble can provide both Spikes and Stealth Rock support; the former also has good defensive synergy with Totodile. As Totodile is quite slow and frail, it appreciates dual screens support; Bronzor can provide this, as well as set up Stealth Rock. As both paralysis and burn completely cripple Totodile, cleric support from the likes of Chinchou and Misdreavus is very useful. Life Orb and entry hazards wear Totodile down very quickly, and make Wish support almost a necessity. Natu can set up Wish and also bounce back entry hazards and status moves with Magic Bounce. Finally, Rapid Spin support provided by Staryu and Drilbur can prevent Totodile from taking damage upon every switch-in.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Totodile's poor defensive stats mean it should generally stick to offensive sets. It can utilize a Choice Band for immediate power, but the listed sets are much more effective. Rain Dance can boost Aqua Jet, but Totodile is too frail to set it up reliably. Eviolite can fix Totodile's terrible defenses to an extent, but it still won't be able to take many hits. A specially based Life Orb set is viable as Totodile has access to moves such as Hydro Pump, Surf, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power Electric, but other Water-types, such as Chinchou, can run the set more effectively as they have a higher Special Attack stat. Toxic can be used to cripple walls, but Totodile cannot dream of Toxic stalling its opponents. A Counter + Focus Sash set can take down physical attackers, but it can only be used once, and needs Rapid Spin support to be effective.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Totodile is not very hard to counter, mainly because it possesses horrible defenses and does not have the best defensive typing for the LC metagame. Ferroseed is arguably the best counter to Totodile; it resists Totodile's STAB moves and can OHKO Totodile with Bullet Seed, or simply stall out Totodile with a combination of Leech Seed and Protect. Mantyke can take a hit from Totodile and KO it with Hidden Power Flying or Hidden Power Electric. Chinchou can handle Totodile very well, even though it takes a lot of damage from +2 Return. Choice Scarf Chinchou can outspeed even +1 Totodile, resists Aqua Jet, and can OHKO Totodile with STAB Thunderbolt. Thanks to its ability Dry Skin, Croagunk is an excellent switch-in to Totodile. Croagunk can quickly eliminate Totodile with a combination of Fake Out and either Vacuum Wave or Sucker Punch, KOing it before it gets a chance to move. Choice Scarf Snover can switch into Totodile's STAB moves and KO it with Giga Drain, thus healing most of the damage it might have taken from Totodile. Both Eviolite and Choice Scarf Mienfoo can take a +2 Aqua Jet and OHKO Totodile with High Jump Kick. Choice Scarf Electric-types can outspeed Totodile and OHKO it with a STAB move, but they generally aren't good switch-ins to Totodile. Priority moves often easily take Totodile out due to its low defenses. Omanyte can take any resisted hit Totodile throws at it, even if it is at +2, and can OHKO Totodile with Hidden Power Rock. It should be noted that Omanyte can survive one Waterfall.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Totodile gains Sheer Force in Dream World, a great ability that has its merits over Torrent. Sheer Force powers up Totodile's attacks in exchange for losing the secondary effects, which is a great trade-off. For example, Totodile's Waterfall will always have a boost in power, but it won't be able to flinch opponents; whereas Torrent will only boost Water attacks when Totodile is on low health. Sheer Force could be used on any of the offensive sets, as the additional power provided is very helpful. Overall, Sheer Force is a great ability on Totodile, and usually outclasses Torrent in every way.</p>
