[Overview]

<p>Chingling is a fairly unique choice in the Little Cup tier. It has stats that are rather crummy, bar a passable Special Attack. Unlike the other bulky Levitating Psychic-types Bronzor and Baltoy, it has an expansive defensive movepool, featuring such moves as Wish and Hypnosis, which are great on any team and rather hard to find. However, Chingling has little in the way of attacking and there are many other Psychic-type Pokemon that are more capable at sweeping than it is, limiting its roles to those of support.</p>

[SET]
name: Utility
move 1: Hypnosis
move 2: Reflect
move 3: Light Screen
move 4: Psychic / Wish
item: Eviolite / Light Clay
nature: Bold / Calm
evs: 236 HP / 156 Def / 116 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a basic utility set. Hypnosis is always great to have, as sleep can immobilize most foes as well as allowing other Pokemon on your team to set up more comfortably. Use Reflect or Light Screen depending on the Pokemon you're facing, judging on their use of physical or special moves, to soften blows to Chingling. The key factor is to make good use of your time while you have the dual screens up. Don't lollygag around with Chingling--switch to something that can set up with these barriers placed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Chingling can use Wish over Psychic; although this change leaves it without any attacks, passing Wishes is a nice option to have. This also gives you more incentive to use Chingling over other Levitating Psychic-types such as Bronzor and Baltoy, besides Hypnosis and less common weaknesses. If your team is solid in physical or special defense, you can use Wish over Reflect or Light Screen and keep Psychic.</p>

<p>There are several more options. Chingling could run Magic Coat, Recycle (while using an Oran Berry instead of an Eviolite), Knock Off, or even Taunt. A Calm nature can be used for taking special hits better instead of physical ones. Chingling's vast defensive movepool can lead to a variety of interesting movesets, but most besides the one listed above are impractical.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Chingling can stall with Toxic, Knock Off, Recover, and other such moves. However, it's not very sturdy and as such these sets aren't very worthwhile. Heal Bell is a cool utility move that not many Pokemon get, so if your team has status trouble, stick it on. Chingling gets Curse and Last Resort, so you could run them on the same set and hit foes with a 140 Base Power off a +1 Attack. Having a base Attack stat of 30 makes this dubious at best, however. Charge Beam would be a pretty decent move except that Chingling probably isn't bulky enough to make it worthwhile. If you have faith in it taking a couple of hits, then Charge Beam can work. Disable is typically a not very useful move, but is notable in the fact that Drilbur with Rock Slide and Earthquake can only hit it with one move. A Choice Specs set is usable, but there are better Pokemon for the role. The same goes for a Calm Mind set.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Steel-types laugh heartily at Chingling's offense. Both Dark- and Bug-types can wipe out Chingling in one hit with a STAB-boosted move, especially Pokemon such as Sucker Punch Pawniard and Megahorn Karrablast. Pokemon that use Toxic will lay Chingling to waste if it's not using Heal Bell. Meanwhile, those with Insomnia can feel free to set up without fear of being immobilized by sleep.</p>
