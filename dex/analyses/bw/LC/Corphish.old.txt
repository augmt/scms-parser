[Overview]

<p>Corphish is an offensive threat to watch out for. With its good typing, high Attack, and access to a great boosting move in Dragon Dance, it is a potent sweeper. Corphish's newly acquired Dream World ability, Adaptability, increases its STAB multiplier from the normal 1.5 to 2, and gives Corphish the strongest physical Water-type attack in the form of Crabhammer. After the Adaptability boost, Crabhammer has a Base Power equal to that of Hydro Pump, a truly astonishing fact. Although Corphish does not have the greatest Speed, it reaches an acceptable Speed stat of 14, which is a major jump point for any Speed-booster. Overall, Corphish is a great sweeper with its many unique qualities.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a phenomenal Attack stat, decent Speed, and access to Dragon Dance, Corphish makes a great physical sweeper. With good overall bulk along with an Eviolite, it can easily take a hit, set up, and proceed to sweep. Waterfall is the STAB move of choice for its perfect accuracy and chance to flinch; however, Crabhammer is also a great option because of its higher Base Power and high critical hit rate, though it is slightly less accurate. Superpower is an odd option on a set-up sweeper, but it allows Corphish to OHKO Ferroseed and Lileep, which is something Brick Break fails to do. Brick Break is still an option, however, as it will deal quite a bit of damage to said threats, and doesn't lower Corphish's stats. Return is the preferred option in the last slot to hit the many Pokemon that resist Corphish's STAB Water-type attacks for neutral damage. However, Crunch is an option to defeat both Slowpoke and Frillish, which are otherwise great counters to this set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Entry hazard support is quite useful for Corphish, allowing it to gain some OHKOs and 2HKOs that it would otherwise miss out on. Although this set is quite powerful, bulky Water-types, such as Chinchou and Staryu, can easily tank a hit if they are not significantly weakened by entry hazards, and OHKO back with Thunderbolt. Snover is a great partner to counter those Pokemon, and also provides residual damage with hail. Eviolite is the preferred item for the great bulk it gives Corphish, although Life Orb can be used for more power; if Life Orb is used, you should remove the HP EVs and use 0 HP IVs to minimize Life Orb recoil.</p>

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>Although Corphish is usually seen as an offensive Dragon Dancer, Corphish can easily pull off a bulky Dragon Dance set. The given EV spread gives Corphish great bulk, and allows it to easily gain two boosts. Even with no Attack EVs and little investment in Speed, Corphish reaches 24 Speed and 33 Attack after two Dragon Dances. Waterfall is the primary STAB move, as it is boosted by Adaptibility and is 100% accurate, unlike Crabhammer. Brick Break is also the preferred option as it has no drawbacks. Return and Crunch are great options to fill the last slot, but Return is recommended for its greater neutral coverage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Entry hazard support is very important for Corphish even when running a bulkier set, as Corphish is not really threatening before it attains two boosts. Bulky Water- and Grass-types such as Staryu and Ferroseed, respectively, are quite capable of walling this set, so Chinchou and a strong Fire-type such as Larvesta are great teammates to counter each respective Pokemon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Corphish has many other options, but they are generally outclassed by the main sets provided. Swords Dance can be used over Dragon Dance, but then it is outclassed by Krabby, and Corphish will be too slow to sweep. In the same vein, a Choice set with either a Choice Scarf or a Choice Band can be used, but sweeping with Dragon Dance is usually much more effective. Lastly, Body Slam or Double-Edge can be used over Return, but Body Slam does not hit hard enough for a set-up sweeper such as Corphish, while Double-Edge has unwanted recoil and puts Corphish's great bulk to waste.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Slowpoke and Frillish are, hands down, the best checks to Corphish. They both either resist or are immune to Corphish's common attacks, and can even tank a +1 Crunch. Croagunk is immune to Waterfall and laughs at Superpower while being able to KO Corphish with its STAB Fighting-type attacks, but it cannot take repeated Returns, especially when boosted by Dragon Dance. Bulky Water-types such as Staryu and Chinchou can also easily check Corphish, but with enough residual damage, they can be defeated. Most Choice Scarf users can easily check Corphish as well, as the latter is slow, reaching only 21 Speed, even after a boost.</p>
