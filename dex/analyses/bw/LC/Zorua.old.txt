[Overview]

<p>Zorua is one of the many unique new threats introduced in BW. With base 80 Special Attack, base 65 Speed, and subpar defenses, Zorua appears to be a canine similar to Houndour without the STAB Fire Blast and Flash Fire to worry about, making it seem underwhelming in comparison. However, looks can be very deceiving thanks to Zorua's signature ability, Illusion, which allows it to masquerade as a teammate in the user's party. Sadly, with Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo running around with strong Fighting-type priority moves, Zorua must also tread carefully to not make a fatal mistake. Despite its weaknesses, opponents must still be on their guard with this mischievous little fox now running around the ranks of Little Cup.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Dark Pulse
move 2: Sucker Punch
move 3: Hidden Power Fighting
move 4: Extrasensory
item: Life Orb
nature: Naive
evs: 40 Def / 200 Atk / 240 Spe
ivs: 2 HP

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With the element of surprise on its side, Zorua is easily capable of taking out an unsuspecting opponent or tricking them into switching out. Dark Pulse is Zorua's second strongest STAB move on the special side next to Night Daze, but the former should be used for its flinch rate and higher accuracy. Priority in the form of STAB Sucker Punch hits like a truck against anything that does not resist it. Hidden Power Fighting hits everything that Dark Pulse does not for at least neutral damage, bar Croagunk, who is OHKOed by Extrasensory.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice of Zorua's disguise should be something that shares at least one move with this set. Croagunk is generally one of the best choices because it lures Psychic-type attacks, resists Fighting and Bug, and has shared access to Dark Pulse. A 2 HP IV is the lowest possible to maximize Hidden Power Fighting's Base Power while getting Zorua to 19 HP for minimized Life Orb recoil. Night Daze has a higher Base Power than Dark Pulse, but is Zorua's signature move, so using it will automatically give away its disguise. Pursuit and U-turn can be useful on this set, but Zorua can't afford to give up a slot for them.</p>

<p>Fighting-types tend to be the most problematic for Zorua, especially those with access to Mach Punch, such as Timburr. Scraggy is immune to Extrasensory and can tank Hidden Power Fighting while recovering with Drain Punch. Residual damage also really hurts Zorua mostly because it has a chance to expose its disguise. When your opponent sees a Croagunk becoming poisoned by Toxic Spikes, chances are that they will become suspicious of Zorua's Illusion. For this problem, Magic Bounce Natu makes a great partner, sporting a 4x resistance to Fighting and being capable of setting up dual screens to increase Zorua's chances of survival. Ghost-types such as Gastly can switch into Bug-type and Fighting-type attacks aimed at Zorua. Wynaut counters Choice Scarf users, which can revenge kill Zorua provided that they are aware of Zorua's Illusion. Entry hazards of your own are also greatly appreciated, so Ferroseed and Bronzor are great partners to lay them down for Zorua.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Dark Pulse / Night Daze
move 2: Hidden Power Fighting / Hidden Power Fire
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Pursuit / Extrasensory
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Naive / Hasty
evs: 36 HP / 200 SpA / 240 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Zorua is also capable of utilizing a Choice Scarf to be an effective revenge killer. Dark Pulse is used in the first slot primarily for the flinch rate, but Night Daze is still another choice for the chance to lower accuracy. Hidden Power Fighting in conjunction with Zorua's STAB Dark-type move gives him near perfect neutral coverage against everything in Little Cup that isn't named Croagunk. U-turn is used for scouting and allows Zorua to make a quick escape if the opponent switches to a potential counter. The last slot is mainly filler, but Pursuit is generally recommended to cripple fleeing Psychic-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Naive or Hasty nature is used here to avoid decreasing the power of U-turn and Pursuit. Since Zorua will be locked into one move anyway, fooling the opponent is not as important, but the element of surprise is still valuable on the switch in. However, to make it more effective of a revenge killer, its disguise should make the opponent oblivious to its role as a revenge killer. In this case, a slow and bulky teammate such as Yamask can work to trick the opponent into staying in or switching to a potential counter, thinking they can set up. Hidden Power Fire can also be used if you want to hit Ferroseed and Bronzor for super effective damage, but Zorua's role for this set is more inclined towards revenge killing weakened sweepers. Extrasensory can also fit in the last slot to deal more damage to Fighting-types with Illusion still intact, but being locked into a Psychic-type move makes room for Dark-types such as Scraggy to switch in.</p>

<p>Like the mixed set, this set appreciates a lack of entry hazards on your side of the field to preserve the element of surprise upon switching in. Choice Scarf Zorua also switches in and out more often, so to keep Zorua alive, it is best to have a teammate that can prevent entry hazards, such as Magic Bounce Natu. Rapid Spin users such as Staryu can also help remove entry hazards for Zorua. Again, Wynaut works well here to kill faster Choice Scarf users, but it must be cautious around opponents with strong STAB Dark moves such as Houndour and Sandile.</p>

[SET]
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Dark Pulse / Night Daze
move 3: Hidden Power Fighting
move 4: Extrasensory / Sucker Punch
item: Life Orb
nature: Timid / Naive
evs: 40 Def / 200 SpA / 240 Spe
ivs: 2 HP

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Zorua's high Special Attack stat makes it capable of utilizing Nasty Plot. Dark Pulse is the recommended option here as its STAB move, being capable of dealing heavy damage to, if not OHKOing, any Pokemon that does not resist it after a boost. Hidden Power Fighting hits Steel- and Dark-types that Dark Pulse cannot, while Extrasensory deals with Croagunk.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Night Daze can be used over Dark Pulse, but be aware that using its signature move will expose its Illusion. Sucker Punch is another option to consider in place of Extrasensory to hit specially defensive attackers on their weaker defense stat if you do not fear Croagunk. In this case, a Naive nature should be used to keep Sucker Punch from losing power.</p>

<p>There are many choices for Zorua's disguise, but for the best results on this set, it should appear as a teammate that discourages the opponent from hitting Zorua with priority or a super effective attack, such as a slow Ghost-type such as Yamask or Flying-type such as Swablu. This type of Zorua generally has a harder time setting up as even one extra turn given to the opponent can be a turn when Zorua's disguise is at risk. Like the previous sets, partners such as Natu can function to prevent entry hazards and Wynaut defeats Scarf users that threaten Zorua. Physical attackers such as Timburr and Mienfoo are also appreciated to deal with special tanks such as Munchlax and Mantyke. Dual screen support is also an option to give Zorua more room to set up. Be cautious when using this set, as many faster enemies can come in and cripple Zorua with even a neutral attack.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Zorua has access to Swords Dance and Agility, but is hindered by a shallow physical movepool and low defenses. A set utilizing Work Up could be passable, but it would be inferior to the mixed set. Its movepool also includes Taunt, Torment, Memento, and Substitute, but Zorua is better off attacking.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything that can deal heavy damage with a priority move is a problem for Zorua, especially Timburr and Croagunk, which have a good chance of OHKOing Zorua with Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, respectively. Scraggy can tank Hidden Power Fighting and hit back even harder with Drain Punch while restoring health. Faster enemies, specifically Diglett and Choice Scarf Mienfoo, have an easy time revenge killing Zorua after its Illusion is exposed, or even before if the opponent is not fooled. Special tanks such as Munchlax and Mantyke that have offensive power can also take advantage of Zorua's mediocre defenses and rip through the fox with a powerful STAB move.</p>
