[Overview]

<p>Chimchar has a great movepool, with access to stat boosting moves such as Swords Dance, Nasty Plot, and Flame Charge, but it is held back by its mediocre stats. Chimchar does, however, make a great lead, because it can either set up Stealth Rock, or deal massive damage to the opponent's lead with a combination of Fake Out and Overheat. However, after using Overheat, Chimchar will be left at a disadvantage, because it can either be easily revenge killed or set up on, since its Special Attack is cut in half. Team Preview has not been kind to Chimchar either, as the opponent will see Chimchar as a lead and rearrange his Pokemon accordingly to give it an outright disadvantage. Chimchar still makes a great lead though, and is not to be underestimated.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Chimchar's most effective set, where it plays the role of a "suicide lead." Chimchar can either set up Stealth Rock quickly, or deal massive damage to the opponent's lead. Fake Out breaks opponents' Focus Sashes or Sturdy, allowing you to KO them with Overheat, which hits very hard thanks to its high Base Power and STAB. However, the Special Attack drop can be problematic, because some Pokemon can take advantage of it by setting up on or revenge killing Chimchar. Hidden Power Grass is useful for hitting the pesky Water-type Pokemon which resist Overheat for super effective damage. The EVs are quite simple; max out Chimchar's Speed and Special Attack to improve its usefulness as a lead. Luckily for Chimchar, it needs only 4 EVs to raise its HP and Special Defense stats by 1 point each. The remaining EVs are invested into Attack to increase Fake Out's power.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Team Preview can sometimes give Chimchar a bad lead matchup, so sometimes it is counterproductive to use it as your first Pokemon. For this reason, a Life Orb can be used instead of a Focus Sash. The extra power is welcomed, and if you neglect to use Chimchar as your lead, there is a good chance that it will take damage from entry hazards and lose its Focus Sash when it does switch in. Additionally, Fire Blast can be used instead of Overheat for more consistent damage, because if Chimchar is used mid-game, it won't be acting as a suicide lead and will appreciate the absence of the Special Attack drop. Taunt is a good option for stopping other leads that try to set up their entry hazards or dual screens. Protect is a another option to prevent faster leads with Fake Out, such as Meowth, Aipom, and Buneary, from breaking Chimchar's Focus Sash.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Nasty Plot can be used to some success as Chimchar has access to a special priority attack in Vacuum Wave, but Ghost-type Pokemon will stop Chimchar cold thanks to their Fighting-type immunity. U-turn can be used for scouting, but finding a moveslot for it can be difficult. Flame Charge can be used to attempt a sweep; reaching 22 Speed after a boost, Chimchar can pose a threat to Pokemon that it wouldn't have before. However, Chimchar is very fragile, and is weak to priority, which gives it a hard time sweeping. Endeavor is an interesting move which Chimchar can use fairly well once it has been brought down to 1 HP, courtesy of its Focus Sash; it can then bring opposing Pokemon down to 1 HP as well, making them easy to pick off. While Chimchar is a bit too slow for the Endeavor strategy, it can work well against opponents bringing in a counter to a predicted Overheat.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fake Out leads, such as Meowth, Aipom, and Buneary, can break Chimchar's Focus Sash, outspeed it, and KO it with their STAB attacks. Diglett is a problem as it can prevent Fake Out with Protect and bring Chimchar down to its Focus Sash with Earthquake. In this case, Chimchar must choose between setting up Stealth Rock or bringing Diglett down to its own Focus Sash with Overheat. Once Chimchar's Special Attack has been cut after an Overheat, many set-up sweepers can take advantage of it. Dragon-type Pokemon such as Dratini and Bagon can freely set up with Dragon Dance, since they resist Fire-type attacks.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Iron Fist is a nice ability, boosting the power of Chimchar's "punching" moves. Unfortunately, Iron Fist Chimchar is illegal in Little Cup for the time being.</p>
