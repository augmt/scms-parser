[Overview]

<p>At first glance, Spheal looks like a pretty bulky tank. Its relatively high HP and average defenses, coupled with its good support movepool, stick out to make this baby walrus appealing. Similar to last generation, Spheal can pull off a stall set with the help of Ice Body healing it in the hail, but there are things holding Spheal back. New Fighting-type Pokemon such as Timburr, Mienfoo, and Scraggy represent a huge hindrance to Spheal's stalling attempts. It also sports a really bad defensive typing, with four weaknesses and only two resistances, including a weakness to Stealth Rock. Overall, Spheal is rather mediocre this generation, and should only be used on a hail-based team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Spheal performs much like Walrein does in the upper tiers, using Substitute and Protect to stall out many threats. With hail falling, Spheal's Ice Body will activate, which when used in tangent with Leftovers, heals most of the health lost from Substitute. Aqua Ring allows it to heal all the health loss over two turns, making this set work even more effectively. Super Fang is a great move in the last slot, as it takes out half of the opponent's health, making it much easier for hail to knock the opponent out. Blizzard and Surf are both reliable STAB options. Blizzard has better coverage and is also more powerful, while Surf has more PP and can be used to hit Rock-type Pokemon hard, who would otherwise pose a threat to Spheal. Finally, Toxic is also a viable option, allowing it to slowly whittle away at the opponent's health.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Toxic Spikes support is greatly appreciated if Spheal lacks Toxic as it makes stalling opposing Pokemon much easier. Tentacool is a great teammate, being able to set up Toxic Spikes, as well as Rapid Spin, alleviating Spheal of its Stealth Rock fears. Tentacool also has access to Blizzard, which is a benefit since it is being used on a hail team. Ice Beam and Frost Breath are options over Blizzard, but the extra power that Blizzard has can be helpful in certain cases. The choice of nature is mainly up to preference. If Spheal is meant to tank better from the physical side, a Bold nature should be used, while a Calm nature is the preferred option if Spheal is meant to take special attacks. Spheal can run maximum Speed in order to tie with Croagunk and Timid Clamperl, but the loss in bulk greatly hurts its ability to stall. Encore is also an option to give Spheal an easier time setting up.</p>

<p>Snover is a necessary teammate as its able to set up permanent hail, which is critical to Spheal's success. Litwick pairs up well with Spheal, being resistant to Grass-type attacks, immune to Fighting-type attacks, and able to knock out Pokemon who can defeat Spheal such as Magic Guard Solosis. Note that both Pokemon are weak to Rock-type attacks.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hail may be useful if your team lacks Snover or as a back up in case Snover faints and hail is gone. However, if Aqua Ring is not used, then Spheal only heals a small amount of health each turn. A different EV spread can be used to be more bulky in one defensive stat, but makes it more vulnerable in its other stat. Thick Fat can be used if Spheal is not used on a hail team. With Thick Fat, it can switch in to any Ice-type attack with impunity, and take Fire-type attacks well. Encore can be used to lock an opponent into a move, either forcing it to switch out or allow you to take advantage of it by sending in a set-up sweeper. Yawn can be used to phaze opponents, but is generally inferior unless you're running entry hazards.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>First of all, any Pokemon who can change the weather immediately becomes a counter because Spheal hates any weather other than hail. Hippopotas can change the weather by switching in, making it much easier to deal with Spheal. Other than weather changers, most Pokemon who don't get hurt by hail can be called a counter. Solosis does not get hurt by hail thanks to Magic Guard and can set up Calm Mind, rendering Spheal's special attacks useless. Likewise, Abra is a threat if Blizzard or Surf is not present. Finally, other Ice-type Pokemon can deal with Spheal, especially if it runs Blizzard, as Ice-types resist Blizzard.</p>
