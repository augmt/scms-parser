[Overview]

<p>Litwick is a unique Pokemon that has the exclusive Fire / Ghost typing, which grants it three immunities when combined with the Flash Fire ability. That seems nice, but sadly the typing is also a curse for Litwick, with weaknesses to very common types in Dark, Ghost, Water, and Ground, as well as taking extra damage from Stealth Rock. It is also quite slow, meaning it needs Trick Room support to work well. Despite the many drawbacks, Litwick still hits hard and has a good movepool, which allows it to work as a good sweeper under the effects of Trick Room.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Litwick's good Special Attack and low Speed make it a great sweeper on a Trick Room team. Fire Blast is Litwick's most powerful STAB move, dealing massive damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Shadow Ball has very good coverage alongside Fire Blast, and perfect accuracy. Hidden Power Ground is used in the third moveslot, since it allows Litwick to hit Chinchou and Houndour for super effective damage. In the last slot, Energy Ball is the best option if Litwick's teammates are providing Trick Room, as it hits Water-types, most of which can take a Shadow Ball. Trick Room could be set up by Litwick itself if it can come in on something threatened such as Ferroseed, though it is very unreliable because of Litwick's frailty.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Stunky is a huge problem for Litwick, being able to use Sucker Punch or Pursuit to put Litwick into a checkmate situation. Trapinch can trap Stunky in Trick Room, and while Cubone can't trap it, it forces Stunky's team to think long and hard about what to switch in due to its incredible power. Slowpoke, Porygon, and Bronzor make good teammates for Litwick to set up Trick Room, freeing Litwick to use four attacks instead of having to set the effect up by itself. Ferroseed's low Speed lets it work well in Trick Room; it also has amazing synergy with Litwick, allowing it to be a solid defensive teammate. It also works well with Slowpoke as a makeshift defensive core for a Trick Room team. Solosis can sweep alongside Litwick, as the two can weaken each other's counters. Lastly, Tentacool is a good teammate for its decent synergy outside of a shared Ground-type weakness; it can also set up useful Toxic Spikes that wear down defensive Pokemon such as Munchlax and Frillish.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Litwick has a few good other options in its movepool to consider. Calm Mind could be used to try to set up, but Litwick is better off hitting as hard as possible under the limited turns granted by Trick Room. Psychic is an option to hit Fighting-types, although Fire Blast hits them just as hard. Flamethrower is available as a reliable STAB move, but Fire Blast provides the power that Litwick badly needs. Overheat is a powerful move, although Litwick has to switch after using it and use up a valuable turn of Trick Room. Sunny Day support is an interesting option, as it boosts Fire Blast to incredible levels of power. Memento could be used as a last-ditch effort to do something when Litwick is about to faint and could give a teammate an opening to set up. If Toxic Spikes is being used, Hex is an option, as it is more powerful than Shadow Ball on a poisoned Pokemon. Lastly, Litwick has a large support movepool, with moves such as Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, Haze, Pain Split, Confuse Ray, Taunt, Acid Armor, and Clear Smog, but Litwick is much too frail to take advantage of these normally useful moves.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Munchlax can easily take any move that Litwick carries and can trap with Pursuit or just KO with Earthquake, making it Litwick's best counter. Stunky is a good check with Sucker Punch and Pursuit, which means Litwick has to play a guessing game to survive the encounter. Houndour can do a similar job with Flash Fire, but takes major damage from Hidden Power Ground, which makes it a bit more shaky. Bulky Staryu and Chinchou take heavy damage from Energy Ball but easily KO Litwick with their Water-type attacks. Deino resists both of its STAB moves and possesses a powerful Crunch, which easily deals with Litwick. Trapinch can trap and KO Litwick in Trick Room, and Diglett does the same outside of it. Lastly, basically any Pokemon with a super effective move can beat Litwick when Trick Room isn't up due to its low defenses.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Litwick gets Shadow Tag from the Dream World, which is an incredible ability. If and when it is released, it will become by far the best ability Litwick can use, which could be used to remove a troublesome Ferroseed or could just allow Litwick to set up on something that can barely touch it.</p>
