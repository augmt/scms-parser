[Overview]

<p>Without further ado, I present to you the only Bug / Water type Pokemon Surskit. With amazing Speed that gets even more amazing in the rain, this water strider can outpace almost anything in the LC metagame. Surskit's decent Special Attack can make it a great special sweeper, while it can also make a great baton passer with Agility. However, Surskit can only be at its best when in the rain, as its Speed rises to huge levels. Surskit's only real drawback is its terrible Defense, which makes it weak to almost everything. So when you encounter this tiny water strider, make sure you squash it before it squashes you.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With astounding Speed and good Special Attack, Surskit has all the tools required to be a deadly special sweeper. This set's effectiveness rises greatly when used in the rain. Hydro Pump is a great STAB move that can hurt almost anything, while Signal Beam is another STAB move that has a chance to confuse the enemy. Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Fighting both counter Steel-types that might try to wall Surskit. If you plan on using Surskit in the rain, Hidden Power Fighting must be used. Last but not least, Giga Drain hits almost any Water-type hard.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes Surskit's Special Attack and Speed, while slightly buffing Surskit's Defense and Special Defense. The IV spread makes Hidden Power Fire legal, and decreases the amount of Life Orb recoil taken, allowing Surskit to stay in battle longer. A second IV spread, 19 HP / 30 Atk / 30 SpA / 30 Spe, can be used for Hidden Power Fighting, decreasing Life Orb recoil taken as well. Speaking of Life Orb, Surskit's moves increase in power significantly, sometimes ensuring a kill. Faster Flying-type Pokemon can easily OHKO Surskit due to its bad defenses, making Nosepass a great partner. Pokemon that are also able to summon rain make good teammates, as they allow Surskit to become much faster due to its ability, Swift Swim.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Agility
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Hydro Pump
item: Eviolite / Oran Berry
ability: Swift Swim
nature: Calm
evs: 116 HP / 20 Def / 18 SpD / 156 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Surskit can Baton Pass effectively due to its high Speed. The main goal of this set is to Baton Pass an Agility or two to a slower sweeper. Substitute is another move that Surskit can Baton Pass to another Pokemon, and can be used to block status. Since the first three moves can be prevented by Taunt, the move in the last moveslot is STAB Hydro Pump, which gives Surskit an attacking option. Hydro Pump hits opposing Ground-, Fire-, and Rock-type Pokemon hard, even without any Special Attack investment.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>In order to survive longer, the EV spread used buffs up Surskit's defenses. A Calm nature further increases Surskit's Special Defense to ensure better survivability against special attackers. Eviolite allows Surskit to survive one or two hits, while Oran Berry allows Surskit to recover and set up more Substitutes. This set works better in the rain because Surskit will become faster, forcing the opponent to make a switch. Once Surskit sets up Agility and Substitute, they can be Baton Passed to slower teammates such as Cubone, Litwick, and Solosis. As for teammates, Flying-type resists such as Aron can greatly help Surskit.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Surskit is able to utilize a few other moves. On the Baton Pass set, Aqua Jet can be used for priority. This becomes rather redundant though, as once Surskit sets up an Agility it will be able to outspeed most threats anyway. Ice Beam can be used over Giga Drain in order to deal with Dragon-type Pokemon. Haze can be used to stop a Pokemon from sweeping, but it should never be used on the Baton Pass set. Surskit does have access to Rain Dance, which is a viable option. In most cases, Surskit will get easily OHKOed or 2HKOed because of its fraility, making teammates that can set up rain a much better option. Unfortunately, Surskit's movepool lacks Surf. This means that Surskit's only other usable special Water-type move is Scald. Hidden Power Electric can be used to hit Flying-type Pokemon such as Rufflet. </p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Flying-types with a Choice Scarf can easily outspeed Surskit outside of rain and can OHKO with a STAB move such as Brave Bird. Stealth Rock is also a problem for Surskit, as it takes 25% damage each time it switches in. Physical attackers that outspeed Surskit can be problamatic as most of them will OHKO Surskit with a STAB move. Since Surskit is one of the more frail Pokemon, it can be easily revenge killed or OHKOed by priority. Mantyke can wall Surskit with ease and OHKO it with a Hidden Power Flying. Choice Scarf Snover is also a problem, as it can come in, induce hail, and possibly OHKO back with a STAB Grass-type move.</p>
