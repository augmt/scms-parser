[Overview]

<p>Buizel's stats are better than most Pokemon, and its Water typing makes it weak to only Grass- and Electric-type attacks. Buizel pairs those stats with a great movepool that lets it get past many Little Cup Pokemon. Unfortunately for the sea weasel, every advantage comes with a downside; in this case, the downside is its terribly low defenses. Buizel is best used in the rain, as one of its abilities, Swift Swim, doubles its Speed when the skies are open. With its great ability to sweep and 38 Speed in the rain, Buizel can be a great addition to a team.</p>

[SET]
name: Life Orb
move 1: Aqua Tail
move 2: Return
move 3: Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Aqua Jet
item: Life Orb
ability: Water Veil
nature: Jolly
evs: 236 Atk / 240 Spe
ivs: 30 Def / 30 SpA / 30 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Aqua Tail, Buizel's strongest physical STAB attack, can 2HKO many more Pokemon than Waterfall, namely Scraggy and bulky Mienfoo. Aqua Jet gives Buizel a STAB priority attack that can revenge kill most Pokemon, but Buizel must watch out for Lileep and its ability, Storm Drain, as it will often switch in to absorb the attack. Return has the ability to 2HKO Eviolite Staryu, but comes up short against Eviolite Chinchou at full HP. Buizel running a Jolly nature can 2HKO Ferroseed with Hidden Power Fire without a Life Orb. If you decide not to use Hidden Power Fire, it frees up 36 EVs that could go into Buizel's lacking Special Defense stat. A Swords Dance pass is very appreciated, as it makes Buizel a much bigger threat.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Crunch is a viable option, as it is a more reliable move to OHKO full HP Gastly without Eviolite, but the frequency of Eviolite Gastly makes it a lot less useful. Iron Tail can be used to 2HKO Lileep, in which case the rest of the EVs should be placed in Special Defense, but it has poor accuracy and cannot be used with Water Veil. Brick Break, unfortunately, is unable to 2HKO Lileep and Ferroseed at full health. Ice Punch does not 2HKO most Eviolite Grass-types, such as Foongus, Cottonee, and Lileep, and is also illegal with Water Veil. The EV spread maximizes Buizel's Speed and Attack, but unfortunately cannot use the remaining EVs. Buizel with maximum Speed is able to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Gastly. Snover is a good partner, as it resists Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Buizel, can 2HKO Lileep, and can OHKO Foongus and Cottonee after Stealth Rock and hail damage. Chinchou hard-counters this set if Buizel is not running Hidden Power Grass thanks to Chinchou's typing and STAB Thunderbolt. If a Choice Scarf Snover switches into a Waterfall or Aqua Jet, it can easily OHKO Buizel with a STAB Giga Drain or Energy Ball.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Waterfall / Aqua Tail
move 2: Return
move 3: Switcheroo / Brick Break
move 4: Aqua Jet / Switcheroo
item: Choice Band
ability: Water Veil
nature: Jolly
evs: 236 Atk / 36 SpD / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Waterfall can now 2HKO Scraggy and bulky Mienfoo with the boost from the Choice Band, but Aqua Tail's extra power is always appreciated as both Fighting-types have Drain Punch. Return 3HKOs Chinchou, even the RestTalk set, which usually only has Scald as its attacking move. Buizel must watch out for Thunder Wave, though. Brick Break usually 2HKOs Eviolite Ferroseed and Lileep. Switcheroo can cripple counters to Buizel, such as Slowpoke, Lileep, Staryu, and Chinchou, all of which are special sweepers. It will even beat Scraggy and Mienfoo, as it can lock them into an undesired move and take away their Eviolite.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Ice Punch, although illegal with Water Veil, can now 2HKO Lileep, Foongus, and non-Cotton Guard Cottonee, although Buizel must watch out for Giga Drain. Crunch can 2HKO Frillish and can OHKO Eviolite Gastly at full HP. Magnemite is a good partner, as it resists Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Buizel, while countering bulky Water-types not named Chinchou. Chinchou can absorb Electric-type attacks and can counter bulky Water-types as well. Snover still counters this set with a STAB Giga Drain.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Passer
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Bulk Up
move 3: Agility
move 4: Waterfall
item: Eviolite
ability: Swift Swim
nature: Jolly
evs: 76 HP / 196 SpD / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p> This set is excellent for Baton Passing boosts to a potential physical sweeper. Bulk Up provides not only boosts to Attack, but also to Defense, which can be essential in a Baton Pass chain. Agility provides boosts to Speed, which is mandatory in a Baton Pass team and useful if you only want to set up a sweeper. Waterfall is in the last spot so that Buizel can actually deal damage to the opposing Pokemon. In this set, Buizel reaches 19 Speed, outspeeding almost every non-scarfed Pokemon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With the given EVs and an Eviolite, Buizel will usually survive a Modest Chinchou's Thunderbolt at full HP, which means Buizel can get a single boost to Baton Pass, even against a Scarf Chinchou. The given EVs maximize Speed, raise Attack and Defense by one point, and Special Defense by two, averaging out its stats. Physical sweepers have a tough time against this set, as their attacks won't do nearly as much if Buizel uses Bulk Up a couple of times. Chinchou walls this set hard, as its Thunderbolt will do major damage to Buizel and Buizel can only strike back with a weak Waterfall. Again, Chinchou and Magnemite are good partners, as both resist Electric-type attacks.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Toxic can be used in the Life Orb set but not the Choice Band set, as it already has Switcheroo to harm its walls. Buizel can run Quick Attack to revenge kill anything at low health, but Aqua Jet does more damage except against Lileep, Frillish, and other Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks. Buizel could run Mud-Slap to lower an opponent's accuracy so that it can't hit it, but it is generally luck-based, weak, and it doesn't hit Flying-types.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Chinchou counters Buizel hard with a STAB Thunderbolt, and Slowpoke walls all of Buizel's attacks and can then cripple it with Toxic or Thunder Wave. Without a Choice Band, Buizel is countered by Lileep, taking huge damage from its Energy Ball. Ferroseed can Leech Seed Buizel and alternate between Protect and Spikes, even if it is against the Choice Band set. Choice Scarf Magnemite can OHKO Buizel with a STAB Thunderbolt.</p>
