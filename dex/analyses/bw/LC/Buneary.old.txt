[Overview]

<p>Sporting great Speed and Attack stats along with a formidable offensive movepool, Buneary is a contender to rival some of Little Cup's best Normal-types, such as Meowth and Aipom. Although Meowth does carry Technician and Aipom has a great Attack stat, Buneary can function just as well with moves such as Encore and Switcheroo. Although Buneary has a complete lack of resistances and immunities barring its Ghost-type immunity, it performs well offensively with a powerful STAB Return. While Run Away is useless competitively, Klutz does have its uses with Switcheroo if you are willing to "throw away" Buneary's item slot. It might face competition from its fellow offensive Normal-types, but Buneary is a sure threat to be wary of and a strong team contender.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Buneary can function very well as a fast lead. Fake Out is a wonderful move to break Focus Sash or Sturdy. Switcheroo is a good move to carry as it can cripple many Pokemon. Flame Orb burns the opponent, cutting its Attack stat and dealing damage over time. Choice Scarf's ability to lock opponents into one attack can be truly debilitating to many enemies, especially defensive Pokemon that rely on Eviolite. Return is Buneary's primary STAB move. It has a high Base Power and good neutral coverage, but has issues with Ghost-type Pokemon that are immune to it. Encore is useful for locking the opponent into a move--it is intended to be used with Flame Orb, as its function is rather repetitive alongside Choice Scarf Switcheroo. Locking the opponent into a move can give teammates such as Scraggy opportunities to set up. Thunder Punch provides neutral coverage against all Ghost-types excluding Golett, which is very rare.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs and nature enable Buneary to achieve the high Speed stat of 18, which allows it to outspeed most Pokemon. An Adamant nature works well to increase power in exchange for Speed, but Buneary must watch out for Ghost-types such as Golett and Frillish, as they will shut it down if it's not running Ice Punch or Thunder Punch. Gastly is a useful teammate, hitting Ghost-types hard with Shadow Ball along with being immune to Fighting-type moves, while in return Buneary is immune to Ghost-type moves and can cripple many bulky Pokemon that may stand in Gastly's way. Slowpoke too is a good teammate, with a large Defense stat and a resistance to Fighting-type moves that can be helpful to Buneary in many situations.</p>

[SET]

move 3: Thunder Punch
move 4: Switcheroo / Quick Attack / Fire Punch
item: Choice Band

nature: Jolly
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Buneary has a fairly wide physical movepool with access to moves such as Ice Punch, Fire Punch, Jump Kick, and Drain Punch, giving it great potential for a Choice Band set when used in conjunction with its high Speed stat. Return is the STAB move of choice, dealing heavy damage to all but the bulkiest foes which lack a resistance. Carrying Thunder Punch allows Buneary to hit Ghost-types neutrally, which it wouldn't be able to do otherwise. Switcheroo is useful if Buneary can swap over its Choice Band to the right Pokemon, potentially crippling it; Pokemon such as Gastly are severely hindered by Choice Band. Drain Punch or Jump Kick is useful for hitting Rock- and Steel-types that resist Buneary's STAB. Drain Punch has the benefit of replenishing some of Buneary's health, while Jump Kick has a higher Base Power but unfortunately also has only 95 accuracy and deals recoil damage to Buneary when it misses.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band and Buneary's variety of powerful attacks allow it to hit a wide range of Pokemon very hard. Buneary's high Speed stat allows it to outspeed a large percentage of the Little Cup metagame. Having the ability Limber prevents Buneary from being paralyzed, a tremendous boon to any speedy offensive Pokemon. Slowpoke is a good teammate, with a large Defense stat and a resistance to Fighting-type moves that can be useful to Buneary.</p>

[SET]
name: Support
move 1: Encore / Sweet Kiss
move 2: Circle Throw
move 3: Healing Wish / Heal Bell
move 4: Ice Punch / Thunder Punch
item: Eviolite
ability: Limber
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 96 HP / 148 Atk / 96 Def / 156 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Buneary has the moves and stats to pull off a support set adequately. With access to moves such as Encore and Healing Wish, it can be a huge asset to your team. Using Encore with Circle Throw is a great combination when set up correctly. Encore has a lot of potential to force switches, which can be extremely frustrating when Circle Throw is used against the switch-ins to further scout the opposing team. When used in conjunction with entry hazards, this set can actually break through stall. When Buneary gets down to low HP, it can use Healing Wish to sacrifice itself to fully heal one of its crippled or weak teammates. Heal Bell is a useful move, as it will rid your team of all status problems. Carrying Ice Punch or Thunder Punch assures that Buneary isn't walled by Ghost-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Running an Eviolite boosts Buneary's defenses, which is pretty important considering this is a support set. With the given EVs, Buneary hits 18 Defense and Special Defense. Running an Adamant nature increases Buneary's damage output and goes along well with its already high Speed stat. Entry hazards such as Stealth Rock or Spikes are integral to bring out this set's full potential. Due to most Little Cup Pokemon having low HP stats, they won't take as much damage, but hazards are still very effective to cut away at their HP, making them easy to KO later on. When using a set such as this, one should keep in mind Buneary's meager defenses, and consider its advantages against Pokemon such as Togepi. Gastly is a good teammate to Buneary. Not only is it immune to Fighting-type moves, it can also hit other Ghost-types with moves such as Shadow Ball. Buneary is immune to Ghost-type moves which allows it to act as a great partner to Gastly.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Agility
move 3: Encore
move 4: Substitute / Return
item: Oran Berry
nature: Jolly
ability: Limber
evs: 236 HP / 4 Def / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Buneary's considerably high base Speed allows it to outspeed quite a few Pokemon, making it a decent Baton Passer; its average defenses allow it to take 1-2 hits from weaker Pokemon. The main goal of this set is to set up an Agility or two and pass it the boosts on to a slower sweeper, such as Cranidos and Solosis, to help them perform a sweep. Encore can cripple walls, while Substitute can help Buneary Baton Pass, as it blocks status and allows Buneary to survive hits it otherwise could not. Buneary can also Baton Pass a 6 HP Substitute with the listed EV spread. Return is a strong STAB move that can be used if you feel the need to use an attacking move.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread used maximizes Buneary's Speed and HP stats, allowing it to outspeed various threats and take hits better. Buneary can run a more offensive spread of 236 Atk / 4 Def / 236 Spe with Focus Sash. This will allow Buneary to hit harder with its STAB Return. Dizzy Punch can be used over Return for its nifty chance of confusing opponents. Work Up can also be used in conjunction with Baton Pass. Switcheroo + Trick can be used on this set to cripple Pokemon that may feel safe switching into Buneary. As for teammates, slower sweepers such as Cranidos, Litwick, Karrablast, and Solosis are good options, as they are decent Baton Pass receivers. If using a Focus Sash with a more offensive spread, Rapid Spinners can prove to be quite helpful. Also, because faster Taunt users completely shut this set down if Buneary is not carrying an offensive move, Natu makes an excellent partner. Lastly, Shelmet is a good wall that can take Fighting-type moves directed at Buneary. Shelmet can also contribute to a possible Baton Pass chain with Acid Armor.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>Buneary can also run a Choice Scarf set. Even when no EVs are invested, Buneary still hits 22 Speed with a Choice Scarf, outrunning all unboosted LC Pokemon as well as many of the Choice Scarf users which usually have only 21 Speed. While Switcheroo is a great move with Choice Scarf, Buneary often finds itself outclassed in LC as a simple Choice Scarf user.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Buneary has below average defensive stats and an unfortunate weakness to common Fighting-type attacks, thus making Drain Punch users such as Scraggy great checks. Priority users of Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave are a nuisance, ignoring Buneary's great Speed and destroying the fragile bunny with super effective damage. Gastly is a good check, as it is immune to Normal-type moves and can retaliate with Hidden Power Fighting, though it must be wary as the majority of its sets will be severely disabled by a Choice Scarf or Choice Band via Switcheroo. Pawniard is a good counter, resisting Normal-type attacks and having the potential to set up a Swords Dance. It must watch out for either Flame Orb or Choice Scarf. Cottonee is also a counter to Buneary, as it has access to priority Encore and Substitute, which can force Buneary to switch out often. However, it must watch out for a Choice Scarf set, which can outspeed and KO it.</p>
