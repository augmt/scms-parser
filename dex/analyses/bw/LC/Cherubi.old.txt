[Overview]

<p>While Cherubi might not be the best Chlorophyll sweeper in Little Cup, it has a niche that only it can claim: the combination of better overall bulk, Chlorophyll, Growth, and Weather Ball. The fact that it has a impressive base 62 Special Attack makes sweeping seem even easier. However, Cherubi is widely outclassed by many other Chlorophyll sweepers, such as Bellsprout and Petilil. It also lacks important Grass-type moves including Sleep Powder. Still, with the ability to outspeed plenty of foes under the sun, boost quickly, and cover a wide range of threats, Cherubi can become a dangerous sweeper that will be hard to stop.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Under the sun, Cherubi can be a excellent special sweeper when given the chance. Once it sets up a single Growth, Cherubi is able to OHKO or 2HKO most Pokemon except Cloud Nine Lickitung and Munchlax. It also has better Special Defense than Bellsprout, which gives it massive competition as a Chlorophyll sweeper. Cherubi's pure Grass typing gives it certain advantages, such as a resistance to Ground-type attacks and neutrality to Psychic-type attacks, giving it more opportunities to set up. Solar Beam is Cherubi's primary sweeping attack due to STAB and high Base Power. Giga Drain provides valuable recovery, and also deters Hippopotas from switching in. Weather Ball is a useful move to have as it can hit a lot of Pokemon which are neutral to Normal-type moves, and can sometimes take advantage of Snover's and Hippopotas's weather-inducing presence in the metagame. Hidden Power Rock helps damage Fire-type Pokemon that would otherwise completely wall Cherubi, and also hits Snover where Weather Ball would fail to cause serious harm.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb is an option over Eviolite, providing more power and can convert previous 2HKOs to OHKOs, though this would make Cherubi extremely vulnerable to priority moves and make it much harder to set up. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed most Chlorophyll sweepers and Choice Scarf users with 18 Speed at the cost of requiring Stealth Rock or Spikes support. Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Ground are possibilities, but in comparison with Hidden Power Rock, they provide worse coverage. Fighting-types or Pokemon that can handle Lickitung are good teammates for Cherubi. Stealth Rock or Spikes support is always handy even if you don't run Timid, as it can help Cherubi achieve more OHKOs.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Cherubi can run a SubSeed, Synthesis, Aromatherapy, and possibly a mixed attacking Growth set, though such sets will usually perform poorer than the standard set. Healing Wish over Hidden Power can be used to restore a fellow teammate's HP and status, but Cherubi is better off attacking to the last of its breath. Aside from that, Cherubi doesn't have the ability to pull off other sets as it would be outclassed by other Pokemon.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Due to Cherubi's access to Growth and great coverage, it is actually somewhat hard to truly counter. However, it has various checks. Lickitung and Swablu both have Cloud Nine, and as such, can check Cherubi by eliminating the effects of weather. Snover and Hippopotas can give Cherubi trouble by getting rid of sun, though they will be affected by Hidden Power Rock and Giga Drain, respectively. Faster Chlorophyll users and Pokemon that run a Choice Scarf, such as Bellsprout and Houndour, can also be good checks to Cherubi. Priority moves such as Ice Shard, Sucker Punch, and Mach Punch can be trouble for Cherubi as they will hit Cherubi before it can make a move and can easily 2HKO it, preventing Cherubi from setting up.</p>
