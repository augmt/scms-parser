[Overview]

<p>Staryu is one of the most commonly seen Pokemon in Little Cup. As the best Rapid Spin user, Staryu often spins away hazards before Recovering and removing status with Natural Cure. In addition, Staryu is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, reaching a blazing 19 Speed. With a powerful STAB attack in Hydro Pump and good coverage moves, it can also be a devastating sweeper. In general, Staryu is a fantastic Pokemon and should be considered whenever your team has a weakness to entry hazards or simply needs a fast sweeper.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is by far Staryu's most common set, and for good reason. Staryu's good bulk and Eviolite combined makes it nearly impossible to OHKO, and STAB Hydro Pump 2HKOes almost everything that doesn't resist it. Thunderbolt allows Staryu to hit Water-types that resist Hydro Pump and is an accurate move to finish off weakened Pokemon. Staryu is the best Rapid Spin user in Little Cup, as the combination of Hydro Pump and Thunderbolt allows Staryu to easily beat every Ghost-type Pokemon in Little Cup. If entry hazards are not a problem for your team, Hidden Power Fire can be used instead to hit Ferroseed and Snover, two Pokemon which resist both Hydro Pump and Thunderbolt. Recover, when combined with Eviolite, makes Staryu difficult to KO with conservative play. Staryu can force many Pokemon out and use the free turn to Rapid Spin or Recover.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs maximize Staryu's Special Attack and Speed so it can hit as hard as possible with Hydro Pump. Ice Beam is an option over Rapid Spin or Hidden Power Fire, as otherwise this set is walled by Dragon-types. However, Dragon-types are much more rare than Ferroseed and Snover. Good teammates for Staryu include Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards. With Stealth Rock removed via Rapid Spin, Larvesta can wall the common Fighting-types extremely well. Staryu is extremely weak to the common Chinchou, so a Chinchou of your own can be helpful to wall opposing ones. Diglett can switch in on Chinchou's Volt Switch and Thunderbolt and OHKO it with STAB Earthquake. A Fighting-type such as Mienfoo can take out Munchlax, which walls Staryu. Mienfoo also appreciates the removal of entry hazards, as it allows its ability, Regenerator, to be much more efficient.</p>

[SET]
name: Life Orb
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Ice Beam / Recover
item: Life Orb
ability: Natural Cure
nature: Timid
evs: 200 SpA / 240 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While the Eviolite set takes a more balanced approach, this set sacrifices Staryu's bulk for sheer power. Hydro Pump hits incredibly hard with 16 Special Attack and a Life Orb. Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Fire hit Water- and Grass-types, respectively, for super effective damage. Ice Beam hits Dragon-types, while Recover allows Staryu to have more longevity. Life Orb and the lack of bulk will wear down Staryu very quickly, so Recover can help to offset that.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs give Staryu as much Special Attack and Speed as possible. No HP EVs are used on this set to give Staryu 19 HP, which means it will only lose one HP per attack from Life Orb. If you do not choose to use Hidden Power Fire, an EV spread of 76 Def / 196 SpA / 236 Spe can be used instead. Surf can be used over Hydro Pump if you are concerned about accuracy, but Hydro Pump's power is preferred. Toxic can hit bulkier Pokemon such as Lileep or Munchlax, which Staryu cannot directly defeat.</p>

<p>Like any sweeper, Staryu appreciates entry hazards. Ferroseed is an excellent partner for Staryu, resisting the Electric- and Grass-type attacks that Staryu hates. It can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes and is also able to Thunder Wave Pokemon with Choice Scarf that outspeed Staryu. Like the Eviolite set, Diglett can OHKO Chinchou, which walls this set. Wynaut can take out Choice Scarf Pokemon with ease due to Shadow Tag, which would otherwise outspeed and easily take out this set. A Choice Scarf user of your own can help to take out Elekid and Diglett, both of which naturally outspeed Staryu. Snover, with its ability, Snow Warning, allows Staryu to use Blizzard over Ice Beam. It also resists Electric- and Grass-type attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: Rain Dance
move 1: Rain Dance
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Thunder
move 4: Recover
item: Eviolite
ability: Natural Cure
nature: Timid
evs: 36 HP / 196 SpA / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Staryu makes for an excellent Rain Dance supporter, as its combination of bulk and Recover allows it to set up Rain Dance multiple times. In addition, STAB Hydro Pump in rain does even more damage than the Life Orb set would. Thunder gains perfect accuracy when it is raining and easily OHKOes opposing Staryu. This Staryu is meant to be played conservatively to set up Rain Dance over and over again&mdash;it should be keeping its health high via Recover instead of going for KOs. However, with 19 Speed, Staryu will often find opportunities to pick off weakened Pokemon with Hydro Pump or Thunder.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Good teammates for this set include Pokemon that take advantage of Rain Dance, such as Omanyte and Mantyke. In rain, both reach very high Speeds and hit incredibly hard with their STAB attacks. Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo, also help this set and rain teams in general by taking out Lileep, which walls Staryu. Mienfoo can also set up Rain Dance itself. Chinchou is another obstacle that completely walls this set. Again, a Chinchou of your own can not only wall opposing Chinchou, but also set up Rain Dance and sweep under it with STAB Hydro Pump and Thunder. Ferroseed is still a great partner, as it sets up entry hazards for your rain sweeper(s). Moreover, its Fire-type weakness is reduced while rain is falling on the field.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Aside from the listed options, Staryu has some moves that can be of use. Thunder Wave can allow Staryu to cripple sweepers, but Staryu does not particularly benefit from paralysis due to its naturally high speed. Hidden Power Grass hits Chinchou super effectively but has little use otherwise. Cosmic Power can boost Staryu's Defense and Special Defense, making it a potent staller when combined with Recover. Staryu is one of the few good Gravity users in Little Cup and has Hydro Pump, Blizzard, and Thunder to abuse it. Reflect and Light Screen are options, but Natu usually performs the role better. A slow Staryu with Analytic can be used to make it much stronger, but Staryu enjoys going first much more. Rest can be used with Natural Cure to fully heal Staryu, but Recover is more reliable.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Chinchou is the best Staryu counter, easily taking any attack that Staryu carries and retaliating with STAB Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. Munchlax, with its gargantuan HP and Special Defense, walls Staryu all day and hits it with Return or Pursuit as it tries to switch out. Dragon-types, such as Dratini, can switch in on any Staryu set not running Ice Beam and proceed to set up with Dragon Dance. Storm Drain Lileep can even wall Ice Beam with the correct EV spread and retaliate with Energy Ball or proceed to set up with Stockpile. Ferroseed and Snover, while fearing Hidden Power Fire, wall Hydro Pump and can seriously put the hurt on Staryu with their own STAB Grass-type attacks. Finally, bulky Grass-types such as Shroomish and Chikorita can survive Ice Beam or Hidden Power Fire and Giga Drain (or Spore in Shroomish's case) to incapacitate Staryu.</p>
