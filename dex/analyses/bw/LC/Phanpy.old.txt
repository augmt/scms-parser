[Overview]

<p>Although often overlooked due to the influx of many powerful threats and walls, Phanpy can still support its team pretty well. Its wonderful base 90 HP and base 60 Defense, along with a usable base 60 Attack, allow it to both take physical hits and hit back strongly. Access to support moves such as Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Roar also makes Phanpy a nuisance to the opponent's physical set-up sweepers. Its offensive movepool is not to be ignored, either, as Phanpy can pose a threat with STAB Earthquake and useful priority in the form of Ice Shard. Sadly, despite its cuteness, Phanpy has its share of flaws. Phanpy's poor base 40 Special Defense will rarely allow it to survive strong special attacks. This is compounded by the fact that Phanpy is weak to common Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks. Phanpy also faces massive competition for a teamslot from Hippopotas, who can also support sandstorm teams in addition to making a great check to many physical attackers, thanks to its immense physical bulk and access to Slack Off. Still, Phanpy is a supportive teammate and should not be underestimated.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Phanpy's bread-and-butter set, and unfortunately the only one it can run effectively. Phanpy's nice overall defenses and decent Attack allow it to support its team well. Stealth Rock is a given for almost any support Pokemon that has access to it, making it easier for Phanpy's teammates to sweep thanks to residual damage. STAB Earthquake is Phanpy's main form of offense, hitting anything that doesn't resist it pretty hard. Knock Off is the preferred item in the third slot due to the tier's massive dependence on Eviolite. However, Ice Shard complements Earthquake well, allowing Phanpy to pick off weakened Pokemon while also giving it decent coverage. Toxic and Roar are both good options in the last slot, and it's really up to the user. While Toxic allows Phanpy to cripple walls, Roar enables it to put a full stop to most physical set-up sweepers.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread, along with an Impish nature and an Eviolite, gives Phanpy excellent physical bulk while bringing its Special Defense to acceptable levels. A different EV spread of your choice can be used as well, but a physically defensive spread is more useful most of the time. Ferroseed works exceptionally well with Phanpy, as the two cover each other's weaknesses very well; Ferroseed can also set up Spikes to go with Stealth Rock. Tentacool has great defensive synergy with Phanpy too, can set up Toxic Spikes, and thanks to its wonderful special bulk and resistances, easily sponges the Water- and Ice-type special attacks that trouble Phanpy.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There are quite a few other interesting moves available to Phanpy. Like most physically bulky Pokemon, Phanpy can put a Counter set to good use. It also has access to physical moves such as Seed Bomb and Superpower, which can catch an unsuspecting counter off-guard on the switch. Phanpy's decent physical movepool and good base 60 Attack also make a Choice Band set an option, but it is outclassed by more powerful Pokemon. Gunk Shot hits Grass-types harder than Phanpy's other moves, but has little use otherwise and is also inaccurate. Head Smash can decimate the Flying-types who can switch in for free on Earthquake, but as with Gunk Shot, serves no other purpose.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any bulky Water- or Grass-type can come in and pose an immediate threat to Phanpy, although they need to watch out for Toxic. Ghost-types immune to Earthquake, such as Gastly, can switch into Phanpy with ease and wreak havoc. Ferroseed can switch into Phanpy and proceed to set up without much worry due to its high defenses and immunity to Toxic. Bronzor laughs at all of Phanpy's moves, and can hurt it significantly with Psychic, making it a great check as well.</p>
