[Overview]

<p>Although still stricken with a barren movepool and low HP, the advent of Eviolite has allowed Duskull to more effectively fill its role as a powerful wall. With access to Will-O-Wisp, Ice Beam, and Pain Split, a very useful Ghost typing, and massive defenses courtesy of Eviolite, Duskull is capable of taking on many of the premier attackers of Little Cup.</p>

move 1: Will-O-Wisp

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>This set allows Duskull to take advantage of its Ghost typing to freely set up Substitutes. From behind a Substitute, Duskull has access to a variety of tools to cripple its opponents. Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical attackers, as well as inflict residual damage on other defensive Pokemon. Pain Split gives Duskull both a means of recovery and dealing damage, increasing Duskull's survivability. Icy Wind keeps Duskull from being complete Taunt bait, and prevents Pokemon such as Scraggy from setting up on it with ease.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread gives Duskull 27 Defense and Special Defense (factoring in Eviolite), which, in conjunction with Pain Split and Will-O-Wisp, allow Duskull to function as an excellent wall. With two immunities and such strong defenses, Duskull can set up Substitutes without any investment in Speed. Regardless of investment in Speed, Duskull outspeeds Pokemon such as Ferroseed or Slowpoke. If you intend to use Duskull for stalling rather than crippling physical attackers, Toxic can be used instead of Will-O-Wisp.</p>

<p>This set works best with Pokemon that can take advantage of Duskull's ability to cripple physical attackers. Ferroseed is an excellent example, as it can set up hazards more easily on previously threatening physical attackers and even stall them out with Leech Seed and burn damage. Yet, at the same time, Houndour and Gastly can completely defeat this set, as they are not especially damaged by Icy Wind nor crippled much at all by Will-O-Wisp, especially in the case of Houndour, which is immune to the move altogether. RestTalk Lickitung also has no problem doing away with this set, thus making possessing a powerful Fighting-type on Duskull's team advisable. For this reason, having Scraggy or Houndour on your team in order to counter enemy Gastly or Houndour is a good idea, as with a surefire check such as Scraggy on Duskull's team, Duskull can can avoid being shut down by its counters, and even lure them in to be dispatched by whatever counter Duskull's team is packing.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Trick Room is usable in place of Substitute to further shut down speedy Pokemon or Speed-boosting sweepers. However, if Trick Room is used, Ice Beam should be used over Icy Wind, as its effect would only be detrimental. Return can also be used in the fourth slot to prevent Pokemon such as Houndour from setting up Substitute on Duskull. Shadow Sneak is also an option in the fourth moveslot to help Duskull deal good damage to frail attackers such as Gastly. In the same vein, Hidden Power Fighting allows Duskull to do an acceptable amount of damage to Pokemon such as Lickitung, which would otherwise wall it. Also usable is Disable, as, when paired with Substitute, it allows Duskull to Disable an attacker's only means of hitting it for significant damage and get off a free move, be it Substitute, Will-O-Wisp, or Icy Wind.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Duskull's best counters are Fire-type Pokemon such as Darumaka or Houndour, as they can easily switch into any of Duskull's moves and proceed to force it out while taking only minimal damage from a resisted Icy Wind or Ice Beam. Other Pokemon such as Timburr can also avoid the crippling effects of Will-O-Wisp, take minimal damage from Duskull's attacking move of choice, and force Duskull out. Duskull is shut down by most Pokemon that carry Substitute unless it chooses to use Shadow Ball or Shadow Sneak over Icy Wind or Ice Beam, as without any investment, Duskull's Speed stat is abysmal, leaving it outsped by nearly any Pokemon with Substitute, including Frillish and Houndour.</p>
