[Overview]

<p>Meet Rufflet, the cute little furry eaglet. Sporting a high base 83 Attack stat and decent base 60 Speed, Rufflet can cause quite a bit of havoc if used correctly. Its movepool, while not large, is big enough for it to pose an offensive threat to any team. Rufflet also has the defensive stats to take the odd hit or two while scouting or setting up. Unfortunately, Rufflet's Flying typing gives it undesirable weaknesses to common Electric-, Rock-, and Ice-type attacks, as well as Stealth Rock, which limit its offensive capabilities. Its Speed, although decent, leaves it outsped by threats such as Chinchou and Archen, who can bring down Rufflet in a flash with their STAB attacks. Rufflet might also have a hard time dealing major damage to the opponent because of its lack of strong, reliable STAB moves. Despite these flaws, Rufflet isn't to be underestimated, as with the right support, it can run through entire teams with ease.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With 16 Speed and access to U-turn, Rufflet can run a Choice Scarf set very well. Pluck and Return are Rufflet's best STAB moves, allowing it to hit a wide range of threats very hard. STAB Pluck is also a boon in a metagame in which Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo see a lot of usage. Superpower is Rufflet's way of hitting Rock- and Steel-types that would easily wall the rest of its moves. Rock Slide can be used instead of Superpower to hit Flying-types harder than Rufflet's other moves, as it is boosted by Sheer Force. It also ensures that Archen, who otherwise walls Rufflet, doesn't pose a big threat. U-turn is a given for any Choice Scarf set, giving Rufflet the ability to scout your opponent's switch-in.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is very simple. 252 Attack EVs maximize Rufflet's Attack, while 236 Speed EVs along with a Jolly nature give Rufflet 16 Speed, allowing it to tie with other Choice Scarf users having 16 Speed. However, if these Pokemon can be dealt with by Rufflet's teammates, an Adamant nature can be used to boost Rufflet's Attack further. The ability slash is based on the move selected in the last slot. If using Superpower, no move is boosted by Sheer Force, so Keen Eye is better. If using Rock Slide, Sheer Force is definitely superior. Thrash might appear to be a good alternative option for a Normal-type STAB, since it now has 120 Base Power, but Rufflet won't be able to switch out, meaning it will be used as setup bait by Steel-types such as Ferroseed, or KOed by faster Choice Scarf users such as Chinchou.</p>

<p>Even though Rufflet checks a large number of threats, it needs team support to function properly. Because this set switches frequently, Stealth Rock will hinder it greatly, making Rapid Spin support a necessity. Sandshrew is a great choice, as it packs Rapid Spin, a useful immunity to the Electric-type attacks Rufflet fears, and STAB Earthquake to deal with the Rock-types that resist Rufflet's STAB moves. It does, however, add to Rufflet's Ice-type weakness. Staryu also packs Rapid Spin and a resistance to Ice-type moves, and can deal with Rock- and Steel-types that wall Rufflet with Surf and Hidden Power Fire, respectively.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, Steel-types such as Bronzor give Rufflet a lot of grief, as they take almost no damage from all of its attacks other than Superpower, which turns Rufflet into setup bait. Magnemite aids Rufflet immensely in this regard, forming a potent combination by trapping and KOing the Steel-types that Rufflet lures in with Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fire. Fire-types work well too, but they compound Rufflet's Rock-type weakness.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Return
move 3: Pluck
move 4: Roost / Substitute
item: Eviolite / Oran Berry
ability: Keen Eye
nature: Jolly
evs: 36 HP / 12 Atk / 36 Def / 196 SpD / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rufflet can also run a Bulk Up set pretty well. The idea is to switch into a weak physical attacker such as Ferroseed and set up with Bulk Up. Roost lets Rufflet shrug off any damage it accumulates as it sets up, and lets Rufflet heal itself so it can continue to set up or attack. Substitute can also be used, as it makes it easier for Rufflet to set up, and protects it from nasty status as well as attacks that could otherwise KO it, meaning Rufflet won't be stopped by faster Pokemon. Return is Rufflet's main STAB attack, hitting anything that doesn't resist it very hard after a Bulk Up. Pluck is Rufflet's secondary STAB move, giving it some form of super effective coverage. It also allows Rufflet to cripple Pokemon that rely upon Oran Berry to avoid certain 2HKOs.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes Rufflet's Speed and Special Defense, allowing it to set up more easily. The remaining EVs are invested in Attack, Defense, and HP to give Rufflet one more point in each of those stats. As Rufflet needs all the speed it can get to set up against the numerous Pokemon in its Speed tier, you should choose a Jolly nature. If Rufflet chooses to use Roost, it should carry an Eviolite, to provide it with a permanent boost in defenses that will help it sponge attacks as it sets up. If Rufflet chooses to run Substitute, an Oran Berry is the preferred option as it gives Rufflet a form of recovery, and ensures that its sweep won't be cut short by a critical hit. It goes without saying that Rufflet needs team support to pull off a sweep, as Steel- and Rock-types wall it completely. Magnemite can trap and KO most Steel-types with ease, and can exploit the low Special Defense of most Rock-types to check them as well. Choice Scarf Diglett, while unable to deal with Bronzor, can trap and eliminate Rock-types as well as other fast Choice Scarf users, such as Chinchou, that trouble Rufflet. Entry hazard support from Tentacool and Ferroseed also aids Rufflet enormously, as it loves having its checks weakened. The former can also remove Stealth Rock from the field with Rapid Spin, making it a great teammate.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Rufflet does have a few other options. A Life Orb set might look viable on paper, as Rufflet likes having the freedom to switch moves while maintaining its decent coverage. However, Rufflet's lack of Speed and generally weak attacks makes this a poor choice. A Choice Band set can be used to hit very hard, but once again, Rufflet can easily be walled and set up on. Rufflet also has access to Work Up and special attacks such as Air Slash and Heat Wave, but its terrible base 37 Special Attack stat makes this a bad idea.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Rufflet is not at all hard to counter because of its poor coverage options. Bronzor is the bane of Rufflet's existence, as it laughs at all of Rufflet's attacks, including Superpower, and can retaliate with a powerful STAB Gyro Ball. Similarly, Rock-types such as Roggenrola and Onix can sponge choice-locked Rufflet's attacks with ease and OHKO it with their STAB Rock-type attacks. Faster Choice Scarf users such as Gastly, Abra, and Chinchou can outspeed and dispose of Rufflet easily with their STAB attacks. Although uncommon, Archen only dislikes taking a Rock Slide, and can outspeed and OHKO Rufflet with its own Rock Slide. Cottonee can render the Bulk Up set useless with Encore if it switches in safely. Wooper also makes a fine check to the Bulk Up set, as it ignores Rufflet's stat boosts thanks to Unaware and can severely weaken it with Waterfall.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Rufflet gets a gift from the Dream World in the form of Hustle, which strengthens its offensive clout and makes it a dangerous Choice Scarf user on par with the likes of Darumaka.</p>
