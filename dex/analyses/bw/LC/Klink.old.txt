[Overview]

<p>Klink is a prime example of a weak Pokemon, complete with low stats and a terrible movepool. To make it worse, Klink is genderless, meaning its best moves are illegal in Little Cup since they are level-up moves learned later than level 5. If that wasn't enough, Klink is weak to common types such as Fire and Fighting. While it does have some useful resistances, there are many better Steel-types in the tier, and Klink should almost always be left off any serious team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rock Polish raises Klink's Speed to 24, just enough to attempt a sweep. Flash Cannon is the main attacking move on this set, as it is Klink's best STAB move. Thunderbolt provides good coverage alongside Flash Cannon and is a powerful move in general, which is why it is the main choice in the third slot. Charge Beam is a much weaker alternative, but it has a good chance of raising Klink's Special Attack, which can be very useful if somehow it has the time to use it. For the last move, Hidden Power Ground is used to deal serious damage to Chinchou and Magnemite.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Ferroseed is the biggest obstacle to this set, walling every move easily. Therefore, Houndour is a good teammate for Klink, as it easily beats Ferroseed. Munchlax and Lickitung also take every attack Klink can use, thanks to their high Special Defense. Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Scraggy are good checks to these two because of their super effective STAB. Gastly is also a great teammate, as it is immune to the Fighting- and Ground-type moves that Klink is weak to.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Toxic is a decent option, as it can inflict crippling status on a bulky Pokemon such as Chinchou. Volt Switch can deal a little damage as Klink switches out, so it is always an option. Thunder Wave could provide paralysis support for Klink's team, though there are plenty of better options for the move. Finally, Hidden Power Fire is a good choice if Ferroseed is more important to hit than Chinchou.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fighting-types are solid checks to Klink, KOing it easily with their STAB moves. Ferroseed walls Klink that lack Hidden Power Fire and can set up hazards. Munchlax and Lickitung also wall Klink, and can hit back with Fire-type moves or Earthquake.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Klink gets Clear Body from the Dream World. It is a good ability, and because Plus and Minus do nothing in single battles, Clear Body is vastly superior.</p>
