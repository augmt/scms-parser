[Overview]

<p>With piercing eyes and a nose that can sniff out its prey from miles away, Growlithe comes into this metagame with the same cocky smirk it has always had. Growlithe is a rather unappreciated Fire-type simply for the reason that it's outclassed by every other Fire-type available. Ponyta and Darumaka are better physical attackers, and Houndour is a better special attacker. Even as a wall, it still faces trouble due to Fire being a bad defensive typing. However, Growlithe is an excellent defensive check to physical attackers thanks to the combination of Intimidate and Will-o-Wisp, which provides a double Attack drop for threats that stay in. Don't underestimate Growlithe, because his bite is worse than his bark.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to Intimidate, Growlithe can be a decent defensive pivot for some teams. Sadly, it doesn't have much of a good movepool to back up its amazing ability in Intimidate, though it does have good coverage in Flare Blitz and Wild Charge. Another option over Wild Charge is Return, which lets Growlithe dent Chinchou, at the expense of some super effective hits that Wild Charge grants. Morning Sun is on Growlithe to give it some form of recovery and prevent it from being worn down. Lastly, Will-O-Wisp helps you burn the physical attacking threats that Growlithe can wall such as Croagunk and bulky Mienfoo.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV investment lets Growlithe cover both physical and special attacks with defensive stats of 22 HP / 19 Def / 22 SpD with Intimidate to back it up. The rest of the EVs are placed in Attack to damage the opponent as much as possible with Growlithe's STAB and coverage move. Growlithe is greatly troubled by Stealth Rock, making a spinner almost mandatory when including Growlithe on your team. Staryu works best here because it also helps Growlithe deal with Ground- and Rock-types. Growlithe is also rather weak to sand teams; as Snover hampers Growlithe's recovery, Shroomish instead works as an excellent partner to Growlithe to check sand teams without hampering its recovery.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Growlithe can't really do much without being outclassed by another Fire-type. Flash Fire can help if you are weak to Fire-types, but it faces massive competition from Ponyta in that role. Flame Charge can also be used to increase Growlithe's Speed and attempt to sweep, but Growlithe's niche is defensive, not offensive. Sunny Day can also help to increase the power of Flare Blitz and improve Morning Sun's recovery, while possibly stopping opposing sand teams. Lastly, Flamethrower and Fire Blast are viable but weaker attacking options should you dislike Flare Blitz's recoil or wish to attack physically defensive threats more effectively.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Growlithe isn't that hard to counter, as it is rather weak. There are several Water-types that can survive a Wild Charge and retaliate back with a super effective Water-type move. The Pokemon that stands out here is Chinchou, which is immune to Wild Charge and resistant to Flare Blitz. Growlithe also struggles against sand teams, as it is weak to Earthquake. Stone Edge Mienfoo may surprise Growlithe attempting to wall it. Lastly, Timburr can set up on Growlithe while gaining a boost from Will-O-Wisp thanks to Guts.</p>
