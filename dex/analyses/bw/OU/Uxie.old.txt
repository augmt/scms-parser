[Overview]

<p>Uxie is an interesting Pokemon with impressive defenses and a base Speed of 95, which is unusually fast for such a defensive Pokemon. It also comes along with a wide array of support moves, which it will have no problem using as it usually laughs at the foe's pitiful attempts to damage it. However, Uxie faces stiff competition for the role of a defensive Psychic-type, as there are plenty of other choices, such as Cresselia and Reuniclus, both of whom have the advantage of recovery moves. Uxie is also prone to attracting users of Taunt, who will often force it out. Despite this, the little pixie always has a trick up its sleeve, so one would do well not to underestimate it.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Given Uxie's great bulk and wide array of support moves, it is a natural contender for a utility set. The goal of this set is to sponge incoming attacks from both sides, and then either set up Stealth Rock, cripple the opponent with a status condition, revitalize your team with Heal Bell, or scout with U-turn. Stealth Rock deserves an important mention; it is no longer a TM move, and for most Pokemon, is often incompatible with an important Egg move or Dream World ability. Uxie has neither concern, and can happily lay down Stealth Rock and U-turn away to escape the inevitable Dark-type switch-in. U-turn is also useful for escaping the rare but annoying Wobbuffet. Despite Uxie's below average Special Attack, using Psychic is recommended to ensure that it does not become Taunt bait. However, if Taunt does not bother you, then Heal Bell is a good option to aid Uxie's teammates. The last moveslot is all about crippling the opponent's team with status. Thunder Wave is very effective against offensive teams by taking away their Speed. Yawn is more useful in phazing out a troublesome Pokemon. Although not listed here, Toxic is a viable alternative to take care of stall teams.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs enable Uxie to take on physical attacks from things like Terrakion easily, though if special attackers like Latios, Rotom-W, and Starmie are more troublesome, then an EV spread that focuses more on Uxie's Special Defense can be used. In addition, one may wish to take advantage of Uxie's Speed and use a spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature, although Uxie's lack of recovery outside of Rest and Leftovers may make this unappealing.</p>

<p>Uxie can fit on a large number of teams, but this set is most appreciated on offensive teams, who welcome Uxie's bulk. Thus, it would be appropriate to pair Uxie up with frail Pokemon such as Lucario, who appreciates Thunder Wave support given its sub-par Speed. Uxie also appreciates Pokemon who can pass Wishes to it. Chansey, Blissey, Vaporeon and Jirachi all excel at doing this.</p>

<p>Uxie absolutely hates Pokemon who can Taunt it, such as Gyarados, Tornadus, and Gliscor. In these cases, it is best to have Uxie U-turn to an appropriate check or counter. Uxie also cannot take on too many repeated hits since it has no reliable means of recovery, although pairing it with one of the passers of Wish listed above will solve this problem.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Memento
move 4: U-turn
item: Light Clay
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Like many of its Psychic-type brethren, Uxie can use a dual screen set effectively. Uxie has a few advantage over other dual screeners, namely its bulk and access to Memento, Uxie's ace in the hole. With Reflect, Light Screen, and Memento combined, the unfortunate Pokemon facing Uxie essentially has its Attack and Special Attack halved, forcing it to switch. This also allows even the most fragile sweeper to easily switch in and set up, making Uxie a godsend to heavy offense teams. However, using Memento immediately after setting up both Reflect and Light Screen may not always be practical. In some cases, it may be better to leave Uxie alive and use Memento later in the match. If this happens, then Uxie can quickly scoot away with U-turn instead.<p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs allow Uxie to laugh at physical attacks as it sets up, and with Light Screen, most special attacks will hardly be able to dent it. However, one may wish to use an alternative spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature. Unlike the support set, Uxie can use this spread with ease because Reflect and Light Screen will cover up the loss in Defense. This spread also allows Uxie to outspeed the standard Gliscor set and Skarmory, two common Taunt users who would otherwise shut Uxie down. If either Memento or U-turn are not appealing, Uxie can use a variety of alternate options instead. For example, Thunder Wave is a good option to cripple enemy sweepers, Yawn is useful for phazing out troublesome Pokemon, and Heal Bell can rid Uxie's teammates of nasty status conditions.</p>

<p>Although Dual Screen Uxie can fit on a variety of teams, the teams that appreciate it the most are heavy offense and SmashPass teams. Heavy offense teams generally consist of powerful but frail sweepers, such as Lucario and Salamence, who would greatly enjoy screen support. SmashPassers like Gorebyss and Smeargle run the risk of passing a -1 Defense and Special Defense, so dual screens would help them and their receivers take hits more easily.</p>

<p>Defensive Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn and Blissey, can set up on Dual Screen Uxie quite easily since they do not fear the drops caused by Memento. Pokemon that use Taunt, such as Tornadus or Gliscor, therefore make great partners to Uxie. Taunt itself is a great thorn in Uxie's side, as it renders the pixie nearly useless. Each Pokemon who runs Taunt has its own set of checks and counters, though Magic Bounce Espeon and Xatu are a good way to keep most Taunt users at bay, although having two Psychic-type Pokemon on the same team may cause some large, overlapping weaknesses.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There are a few more tricks that Uxie can use, such as a Trick + Choice Scarf set. This set is most effective as a general lead, and can cripple defensive Pokemon who try to set up on it. Uxie is also a great candidate for setting up Rain Dance and Trick Room, due to its great bulk. It is best to have one or two more Pokemon who can set up Rain Dance/Trick Room along with Uxie. A Calm Mind set could work, since Uxie has the bulk to pull it off, although Pokemon such as Jirachi, Mew, and Reuniclus will give it stiff competition since they have access to reliable recovery while Uxie does not. Finally, Uxie can run Magic Coat to punish Pokemon who attempt to Taunt it or set up hazards on it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Uxie absolutely hates being Taunted, and is especially susceptible to faster Pokemon such as Gliscor, Aerodactyl, and Azelf, since they can shut down most sets just by using Taunt, and Uxie's pitiful Special Attack stat means that it cannot do much damage to them in return. Toxic also shortens Uxie's lifespan quickly. Fling + Toxic Orb Gliscor deserves a special mention here since it can also Taunt Uxie and is immune to status effects once Toxic Orb activates. Most defensive Pokemon can easily sponge Uxie's attacks and set up, although they will have to watch out for Magic Coat. Finally, it is important to remember that, despite Uxie's bulk, its lack of a reliable means of recovery means that repeated blows will quickly wear it down.</p>
