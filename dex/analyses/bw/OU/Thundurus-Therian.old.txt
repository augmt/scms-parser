[Overview]

<p>Although not at the level of its Incarnate form, mainly due to the drop in Speed, Thundurus-T is not to be underestimated. Its base 145 Special Attack is nothing to scoff at, considering it's the highest among all Electric-types and one of the highest in the entire game. It also has an amazing ability in the form of Volt Absorb, which means that your opponent must think twice before using an Electric-type attack, lest they give you a free switch and potentially regained health. Rain being the dominant weather is good news for Thundurus-T too, as it can use the more powerful Thunder without issues.</p>

<p>However, every Pokemon has its flaws, and Thundurus-T is no exception. Base 101 Speed is quite good and better than the majority of the metagame, but it does allow Thundurus-T to get outpaced by several faster threats in the metagame, with Pokemon such as Terrakion, Keldeo, Garchomp, and Latios. Thundurus-T is also quite frail, meaning it cannot switch in on many attacks, and is Stealth Rock weak. However, with access to several boosting moves, a sky-high Special Attack stat and the potential to rip just about any defensive Pokemon to shreds, Thundurus-T is a worthy consideration for any offensive team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Thundurus-T may not sport the most impressive defensive stats, it can take a surprising amount of hits when it has investment in bulk. This allows it an extra turn to do what it needs to do, and most teams cannot afford to give something as dangerous as Thundurus-T any more free turns than necessary. Agility allows you to outrun just about everything, while Nasty Plot jacks Thundurus-T's Special Attack up to an impressive 854. This set's surprising bulk is what really makes it fearsome; against defensive teams it can often survive weaker attacks to boost its Special Attack even further, while against offensive teams it can use Agility to outrun everything and tank a hit from something like Choice Scarf Jirachi's Ice Punch to Nasty Plot again and OHKO everything. On the occasion that it gets both boosts, it is often "gg" right then and there.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>There aren't many things that can safely counter this set. Mamoswine is the biggest obstacle, as it has strong super effective priority in Ice Shard, as well as completely walling both of Thundurus-T's attacks as Thick Fat grants it an Ice resistance. Tyranitar is barely scratched by any of Thundurus-T's attacks and can retaliate with STAB Rock moves. Stealth Rock limits how much Thundurus-T can switch in and how many attacks it can take, which is part of why Rapid Spin support is so important in helping Thundurus-T play to its fullest potential. Gastrodon walls both attacks and can strike back with Ice Beam. Specially defensive Hippowdon is immune to Electric STAB and tanks Hidden Power Ice relatively well, being able to phaze Thundurus-T out or strike back with Ice Fang. Breloom is a good teammate, as it can easily switch into the aforementioned checks, and threaten them with it's STAB moves or Spore.</p>

<p>While it is not necessary, Rapid Spin support helps Thundurus-T's survivability. Starmie and Tentacruel are good options; they are reliable, can draw Electric attacks for Thundurus-T to switch in on and gain HP from, and fit well on rain teams, which Thundurus-T is most often found on, as Politoed's Drizzle allows it to use the more powerful Thunder with perfect accuracy. This set is also more than usable on sand and weatherless teams, where Starmie also fits well. Gothitelle is also a good partner, as its versatility allows it to cripple just about all of Thundurus-T's checks/counters with an appropriate set. Pokemon that invite defensive Water-type Pokemon such as Jellicent in are also good partners because Thundurus-T can scare them out to set up a boost. Scizor can lure in Skarmory, U-turn out of it, and provide a similar easy setup scenario, while also checking Latios and Latias, both decent stops to Thundurus-T.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Thundurus-T variant eschews bulk in favor of added coverage and power. It has a harder time setting up and is more vulnerable to being worn down but it has the advantage of being able to kill some of the double booster's usual checks with its added coverage and has more power behind its attacks as a whole; Life Orb-boosted base 145 Special Attack (a 427 stat with maximum investment and a positive nature) is nothing to laugh at. While this set is more hard-pressed to set up and sweep due to its comparative lack of bulk, it can kill a lot of its usual checks with relative ease. Gastrodon, Hippowdon, Tyranitar, and Mamoswine all fall to Grass Knot, although the latter must be hit on the switch; Focus Blast guarantees an OHKO against Tyranitar while still beating Mamoswine switch-ins and also hitting Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Kyurem-B hard.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Chansey does well against this set, being able to stall Thundurus-T with repeated use of Soft-Boiled while hits from Life Orb wear the genie down. Specially defensive Jirachi and Celebi can function in a similar matter. Weakening or eliminating the aforementioned threats is necessary if you want to sweep. Thundurus-T's partners don't vary too much from the double booster set. Spinners help with its Stealth Rock weakness; Politoed powers up Starmie and Tentacruel (which bait Electric attacks for Thundurus-T to switch in on) while allowing Thundurus-T to use Thunder over Thunderbolt without worrying about accuracy. Scizor takes on some Pokemon that give Thundurus-T a relatively hard time and can lure in Pokemon such as Skarmory, U-turning out of them to give Thundurus-T a free switch.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set eschews boosting for pure, all-out wallbreaking efficiency. Several of Thundurus-T's usual checks or counters can be dispatched with this set, especially with a potential Choice item bluff. For example, if Celebi switches in on a Thunderbolt, it will unexpectedly be destroyed by the following U-turn, which also takes advantage of Latias or Latios switch-ins. Chansey, normally a relatively safe counter to most Thundurus-T sets, is surprised by Superpower, especially if it has switched into Stealth Rock and an attack prior. Grass Knot, as always, is effective to surprise Gastrodon and Hippowdon while also hitting Tyranitar. Stall teams in particular have trouble dealing with this set. However, without Agility to boost its Speed, Thundurus-T, although not exactly slow, will be revenge killed by several faster Pokemon found on offensive teams, such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Garchomp. Because it offers very little defensive utility, it is advised to have a strong backbone so you are not run over by these quicker powerhouses.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As usual, Politoed and spinners are the best partners. The former allows Thundurus-T to use Thunder safely and the latter allow Thundurus-T to switch in and out with greater ease, which it will be doing with more frequency than other sets due to U-turn. This set specializes in luring and killing some of its usual counters, so Pokemon that share counters with Thundurus-T are good partners; Breloom in particular enjoys Celebi, Latios, and Latias out of the way. Keldeo is also much more effective with these Pokemon as well as Gastrodon out of the way.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Flying
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: U-turn / Volt Switch
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Naive / Timid
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thundurus-T is a unique Choice Scarf user. It outruns two Pokemon more commonly used for the role, Jirachi and Salamence; by extension, it revenge kills just about everything they do, namely Dragon Dancers such as Dragonite and Haxorus, and in general fast Pokemon such as Keldeo and Terrakion. Another perk it has is the ability to keep momentum in its team's favor by using U-turn or Volt Switch on a predicted switch. Volt Switch has STAB, but U-turn is usually the better option because it isn't blocked by Ground-types, as well as getting nice damage against some of Thundurus-T's usual switch-ins, Celebi and Latias. Hidden Power Flying is a neat secondary STAB option but Thundurus-T loses the ability to get secured OHKOs on the quad-weak Dragons that it normally has no trouble revenge killing.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As usual, Politoed and spinners are the best teammates. Keeping Stealth Rock off the field is even more essential than usual, because the restrictions of a Choice item mean that Thundurus-T is going to be switching in and out a lot; if you cannot fit in a Rapid Spinner, it is most likely not worth using Thundurus-T as your revenge killer, because it will be getting worn down way too easily for it to be effective. It can use its extra Speed to clean up nicely late-game once its checks have been weakened or removed; it can use switch moves to get free switch-ins for trappers such as Gothitelle that can remove these threatening Pokemon.</p>

[SET]
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Hidden Power Ice
move 3: Focus Blast / Grass Knot / Substitute
move 4: Nasty Plot
item: Life Orb / Lum Berry / Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is similar to the Agility in the vein that it eschews bulk for coverage and extra power, except this set uses Nasty Plot as its boost of choice. It isn't as effective in a metagame filled with faster offensive Pokemon, but against slower teams it is absolutely devastating. Nasty Plot in conjunction with Life Orb jacks its Special Attack up to frightening levels capable of killing everything in the game. Lum Berry gets rid of status, most notably specially defensive Jirachi's Body Slam paralysis, while allowing room in Thundurus-T's moveset for Focus Blast or Grass Knot. Leftovers allows Thundurus-T to stick around longer than it usually would, especially if it's using Substitute, which is used to block revenge killers, status, and Leech Seed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Nothing different as far as teammates are concerned here; Politoed and spinners are as good as it gets in terms of supporting this set. A good defensive core will go a long way in holding up against the faster Pokemon that tend to revenge kill Thundurus-T, and Scizor in particular baits in things that Thundurus-T can set up on while dealing with some of its checks. This set is most effective against slow, defensive teams that don't dish out very much damage.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There really isn't much else that hasn't already been mentioned. A Choice Specs set is immediately threatening but it is generally outclassed by Jolteon; the loss in power is made up for by the extra Speed and lack of a Stealth Rock weakness. Taunt is viable to stop stall teams' defensive Pokemon from recovering after taking a hit but you're usually better off using Nasty Plot and outright killing them.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Specially defensively-oriented Pokemon are generally the best defensive measures against Thundurus-T. Gastrodon and Hippowdon in particular are generally solid choices against any set lacking Grass Knot. Latias can take almost any attack, really only fearing U-turn, and either hit Thundurus-T with a Draco Meteor or set up with Calm Mind. However, Thundurus-T possesses the tools to blow past any of its more defensive counters, so it is often more advisable to beat it offensively. It is outsped by a lot of faster offensive Pokemon and doesn't have the bulk or typing to switch in on too many attacks. Terrakion, Keldeo, Garchomp, Latios and most Choice Scarf Pokemon do a good job at stopping Thundurus-T's assault.</p>
