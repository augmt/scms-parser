[Overview]

<p>Dusknoir returns to the latest generation in an unfamiliar position. Originally one of the best spinblockers in the DPP era, Dusknoir faces stiff competition from newcomers such as Cofagrigus, Jellicent, Chandelure, and Golurk, each boasting an impressive ability, a secondary typing, or sometimes both. In addition, the introduction of Eviolite gave its pre-evolved form, Dusclops, a new lease of life, as Dusclops can better perform some of the duties Dusknoir can with a 50% boost to both its Defense and Special Defense.</p>

<p>Still, don't let that discourage you from using Dusknoir, as its defenses still rank high compared to most Ghost-types, especially with the absence of the Rotom appliances' Ghost typing. Though Dusclops can perform the same duties Dusknoir can, Dusknoir does have decent Attack, meaning it can cause damage while taking it, instead of relying on Night Shade or Seismic Toss. And unlike some of the newer Ghost-types, Dusknoir boasts a plethora of status and niche moves it can make use of with its defenses, such as Gravity, Will-O-Wisp, Grudge, Destiny Bond, Skill Swap, Memento, Trick Room, and Toxic. Dusknoir may have taken a hit this generation, but it still serves as a great spinblocker who can hit back.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The standard wall from last generation returns, granted, with a few bumps on the road. Despite this, Dusknoir serves as a good spinblocker, and with Will-O-Wisp around, most physical attackers will struggle to defeat Dusknoir after the burn. Though Leftovers is around, Pain Split is needed to recover health, especially with Dusknoir's pitiful HP. This can be beneficiary though, as it cuts Blissey's and Chansey's health in half while Dusknoir fully recovers, leaving the door open for stronger physical attackers to jump in and finish either one off.</p>

<p>The last two slots are reserved for taking on potential counters. Earthquake is necessary for two reasons this generation: Heatran and Chandelure. Both will enjoy absorbing Will-O-Wisp thanks to their ability and both will surely OHKO Dusknoir after the boost. Heatran is OHKOed by Earthquake whereas Chandelure gets 2HKOed. The last move slot is up for grabs; Fire Punch is useful against foes such as Skarmory, Forretress, and Ferrothorn whereas Shadow Sneak can pick off weakened foes. It should be noted, however, that a Chandelure weakened by Earthquake is subsequently KOed by Dusknoir's Shadow Sneak afterwards. In addition, Stealth Rock and maximum damage from Shadow Sneak can 2HKO Chandelure on the switch.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With Eviolite Dusclops pulling off a similar set with better defenses, it would seem odd to choose Dusknoir for a role of tanking. That's far from the case, however. Despite the fact that it lacks a 50% boost to both defenses, Dusknoir's defenses are still naturally high, and having an item slot free means Dusknoir can slowly recover health with Leftovers. In addition, Dusknoir has a decent base 100 Attack to fight back against other Pokemon. Those 28 Attack EVs are required to OHKO Heatran with Earthquake, something Dusclops wishes it could do. There are other options in the last slot, such as Ice Punch to combat Poison Heal Gliscor, who will most likely avoid Will-O-Wisp due to Toxic Orb and / or Taunt. It also helps against the myriad of Dragon-types, and retains coverage on Whimsicott. The other option is Thunder Punch, which covers Gyarados nicely, as it too will avoid Will-O-Wisp with Taunt. Thunder Punch also retains coverage on Skarmory and hits Jellicent harder than any other attack Dusknoir launches.</p>

<p>This set has much to fear from Guts users, particularly Conkeldurr, who will enjoy burn and can easily set up or beat you outright with Payback after the boost. For that reason, sturdy Flying-types such as Gliscor and Skarmory can handle some damage and either Taunt it to prevent potential Bulk Ups, phaze with Whirlwind, or damage it with STAB Flying-type attacks. If it gets in unscathed, Reuniclus makes a great partner, being able to scare away Conkeldurr with STAB Psychic.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Many will scoff at the idea of SubPunching Dusknoir making an impact when the Iron Fist variant of Golurk can hit harder, but Dusknoir can still effectively pull off the set with some notable advantages. For one, Dusknoir is pure Ghost-type, limiting its weaknesses to two; Golurk will struggle in setting up due to its Grass-, Water-, Ghost-, and Dark-type weaknesses. Also, common Rapid Spin users such as Starmie are beaten by this Dusknoir thanks to priority Shadow Sneak. In addition, Dusknoir has access to the elemental punches, meaning it has broader coverage. Lastly, Dusknoir has priority in the form of Shadow Sneak, something devoid in Golurk's moveset.</p>

<p>Substitute should be used as soon as possible so Dusknoir can whack foes with Focus Punch, in addition to protecting from status. With Ghost- and Fighting-type attacks, everything is hit at least for neutral damage. The final moveslot is up for grabs with the choices of Ice Punch, Will-O-Wisp, and Thunder Punch. Ice Punch covers Gliscor, who takes very little damage from anything Dusknoir launches otherwise; Will-O-Wisp weakens physical attackers, helping Dusknoir's Substitutes survive longer; finally, Thunder Punch covers Gyarados and other bulky Water-types, in addition to granting coverage against Skarmory.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The reason Fire Punch wasn't included is because Focus Punch does the same amount of damage to Ferrothorn. In any case, it would be much better to burn it with Will-O-Wisp to prevent it from breaking Dusknoir's meager Substitutes. The only other worthwhile physical Ghost-type move is Shadow Punch; however, while more powerful than Shadow Sneak, Dusknoir prefers the priority from Shadow Sneak to pick off foes weakened by Focus Punch and / or its additional coverage move. Speaking of priority, Sucker Punch is more powerful, but it is a very risky option due to its unreliability.</p>

<p>Wish support is appreciated to recover Dusknoir's health, seeing as Leftovers will cover little to offset Substitute's uses. Entry hazards will also be of help to Dusknoir, as they help achieve easier KOs. However, it should be noted that Conkledurr again walls Dusknoir with this set, so Gliscor or Reuniclus are great partners to consider. Blissey and Eviolite Chansey are great partners to provide Wish support, and can take Ghost-type moves aimed at Dusknoir. Meanwhile, Wish Jirachi with Psychic can make quick work of incoming Conkeldurr. Finally, Ferrothorn enjoys taking Ghost- and Dark-type moves aimed at Dusknoir, while providing useful entry hazards.</p>

<p>To show the viability of a SubPunching Dusknoir, here are some calculations on commonly seen foes:</p>

<ul class="damage_calculations"><li>Focus Punch vs. 252 HP / 48 Def Relaxed Ferrothorn = 59.1% - 69.9%</li>
<li>Fire Punch vs. 252 HP / 48 Def Relaxed Ferrothorn = 59.1% - 70.5%</li>
<li>Shadow Punch vs 4 HP / 0 Def Timid Starmie = 78.6% - 93.9%</li>
<li>Shadow Sneak vs 4 HP / 0 Def Timid Starmie = 52.7% - 62.6%</li>
<li>Sucker Punch vs 4 HP / 0 Def Timid Starmie = 69.5% - 82.4%</li>
<li>Shadow Punch vs 4 HP / 0 Def Timid Gengar = 103.1% - 122.1%</li>
<li>Shadow Sneak vs 4 HP / 0 Def Timid Gengar = 69.5% - 82.4%</li>
<li>Sucker Punch vs 4 HP / 0 Def Timid Gengar = 92.4% - 109.2%</li></ul>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With Dusclops's improved defenses thanks to Eviolite, many people will scoff at the idea of using Dusknoir in a similar role. However, Dusknoir still has merit with Gravity; its base Attack is 30 points higher than Dusclops, making Dynamic Punch, with an 83% accuracy thanks to Gravity, an almost surefire KO against enemy Tyranitar that do not invest in HP and / or Defense, something Dusclops wishes it could do. Shadow Sneak helps in picking off weakened foes that Dynamic Punch nearly finishes off. It also forms the Ghost / Fighting duo that provides unresisted coverage. The last slot is reserved for Pain Split, which helps Dusknoir recover health as it keeps up Gravity for its fellow teammates.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Will-O-Wisp can go over Shadow Sneak; 100% accurate Will-O-Wisp may be too hard to pass up. However, this leaves you with Dynamic Punch. If that's the case, Earthquake becomes the premier option, as in this way, Dusknoir will be able to hit practically everything, bar Shedinja (whom would easily fall prey to 100% accurate Will-O-Wisp). Be sure to move 28 Defense EVs to Attack to score some key OHKOs and 2HKOs on certain Pokemon, such as Heatran and Chandelure.</p>

<p>This set appreciates the use of entry hazards, such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Since all foes will be grounded thanks to Gravity, Dusknoir can further weaken them with Dynamic Punch, causing confusion, or proceed to weaken them with Earthquake. As such, great partners for this set include Ferrothorn, as it can take Ghost- and Dark-type attacks aimed at Dusknoir and proceed to set up Spikes. Ground-type Earthquake users appreciate Gravity, ensuring that their STAB moves will always hit.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A Calm Mind set is not out of the question; a 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD EV Spread with a Bold nature and a moveset of Calm Mind, Pain Split, Shadow Ball, and Focus Blast / Hidden Power Fighting gives great all-round coverage. Of course, Spiritomb, Chandelure, and Cofagrigus make better use of Calm Mind due to their higher base Special Attack, but Dusknoir can effectively wall both physical and special attacks after a Calm Mind or two. The other notable advantage Dusknoir has is access to Ice Beam and Blizzard. Trick Room on a defensive Dusknoir is largely outclassed by Eviolite Dusclops, who can come in multiple times to set it up thanks to Eviolite. The only advantage Dusknoir has over Dusclops is healing through Leftovers. Offensive Dusknoir can make use of it, but the power output of such a set is lacking.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, Dusknoir has many supporting moves, such as Destiny Bond, Grudge, and Skill Swap. Destiny Bond can force switches if your opponent fears KOing Dusknoir which in the process takes out their own Pokemon. Grudge depletes the PP of an opponent's move if Dusknoir is knocked out; however, Dusknoir is very slow to fully utilize it and it also comes at the cost of Dusknoir's life. Finally, Skill Swap deserves some mention, in the fact that it can rob an opponent of an important ability, so long as it stays in.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Taunt has been the bane to most Dusknoir; shutting off the ability to use a status move or heal is a detriment to most walls, and Dusknoir is no exception. However, if one desires a more straightforward approach to eliminating Dusknoir, Conkeldurr is the primary candidate. Conkeldurr adores being burned, and Dusknoir can do very little back, especially after a Bulk Up. If Chandelure comes in on a predicted Will-O-Wisp, it will win outright against most sets. Beware of Earthquake though, especially if it comes from a rare Choice Band set, which will OHKO.</p>

<p>In terms of defensive Pokemon, Spiritomb tops the list, having nothing to fear from Dusknoir, bar a status move. Next, Blissey and Eviolite Chansey have no fear of Dusknoir's chosen status move and take minimal damage from most attacks, outside of Focus Punch.  Finally, as a wall, Dusknoir greatly fears Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. The former increasingly damages Dusknoir turn after turn; the latter damages it consistently but also cuts its Attack. Meanwhile Dusknoir will struggle to keep up its health outside of the risky Rest, which makes it setup fodder for powerful sweepers.</p>
