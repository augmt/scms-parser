[Overview]

<p>As one of the few vanguards of two oft-maligned types in OU, Volcarona is one hot Pokemon. Despite what would normally be considered a crippling Bug / Fire typing, Volcarona has the perfect combination of stats, movepool, and typing to make it a top-tier threat. With a whopping 135 base Special Attack, 100 base Speed, great dual STAB, and access to one of the best boosting moves in the game in Quiver Dance, Volcarona has everything it needs to make a huge impact. While it operates best in the sun, it can even take charge in the rain, and still has plenty of tools in sand as well.</p>

<p>That said, even with everything Volcarona has going for it, it's not some kind of magic bullet in the metagame. It's quite frail on the physical side, and while it resists most of the priority attacks in the metagame, it's still hard-pressed to deal with anything it can't kill in one hit or outspeed. It also possesses a crippling Stealth Rock weakness, so if it doesn't sweep the first time through, it rarely gets a second chance. Still, if it gets any space to do its thing, it can make any game a runaway. The game is never over when Volcarona's around.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set makes full use of Volcarona's massive offensive potential. Between an obscene 135 base Special Attack, Quiver Dance, Life Orb, and a STAB Fire Blast or Bug Buzz, Volcarona hits with nuclear force, wiping most foes off the map in one hit. Bug Buzz is the primary STAB, since it's powerful, accurate, reliable, and weather-independent. Fire Blast is the preferred secondary STAB due to its power, but Fiery Dance gives it a 100% accurate Fire-type move, as well as a 50% chance to boost its Special Attack even further. Finally, Giga Drain is the most powerful option against rain teams (and especially Politoed), and can help heal off Stealth Rock damage and preserve Volcarona's decent bulk. However, Hidden Power Ground is an option in the last slot, as it hits Heatran and Tentacruel, two common Pokemon in OU that resist Volcarona's dual STAB.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Hidden Power Rock is a decent choice for the fourth slot, as it hits the many Fire-resistant Flying types in OU, such as Salamence, Dragonite, and Gyarados. Substitute is a solid option for sun teams that can control the weather and simply muscle through opponents and would rather have a way to gain or keep momentum. As for items, Life Orb is the preferred item, as it provides Volcarona with the power it needs to secure OHKOs with its neutral moves. However, Lum Berry can allow Volcarona to set up on Body Slam, Thunder, or Thunder Wave, as well as random sleep moves and Toxic. Timid is the preferred nature for straight up speed, but if you really want to crank up the power, Modest not only guarantees that +1 Giga Drain OHKOes Choice Specs Politoed, but also combines with Life Orb to secure a 2HKO on 252/252+ Chansey in the sun with Fire Blast.</p>

<p>A specialized version of this set is also viable; with a spread of 100 HP / 48 Def / 252 SpA / 108 Spe with a Modest nature and a Passho Berry, Volcarona can lure in and set up on numerous Water-types eager to counter it. Specifically with one boost, Volcarona can survive a Hydro Pump from Choice Specs Keldeo (or Choice Scarf Keldeo in the rain) without Stealth Rock, and recover its lost health with Giga Drain. An alternative spread of this is 136 HP / 16 SpA / 248 SpD / 108 Spe, which gives Volcarona an 87.5% chance of surviving Specs Keldeo's Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock at +1.</p>

<p>Ninetales is the most obvious teammate, providing sunlight to fuel Volcarona's powerful Fire-type attacks. Beyond that, the main targets for teammates are anything not covered by the move in the fourth slot. With Giga Drain, Dugtrio becomes a top tier teammate, as it can eliminate Heatran and Tentacruel to secure a sweep. With Hidden Power Ground, anything that can wear down bulky Water-types is important. This includes entry hazards, specifically Stealth Rock, since it's important to deal with dangerous Flying-types, especially the ones mentioned above. Regardless of the last move, two things are needed above all: something to deal with Chansey, and something to deal with Stealth Rock. Strong physical attackers can deal with Chansey, though they have to be wary of Toxic or getting whittled down by Seismic Toss. Stealth Rock can be eliminated by a solid user of Rapid Spin, such as Forretress (which also provides hazards of its own), Tentacruel, or Donphan, the latter of which works especially well on sun teams. It can also be kept off the field by a Magic Bounce user, such as Xatu or Espeon. Finally, a strong check to Scarf Terrakion is suggested, as it can switch in on any of the first three moves with impunity, outspeed, and OHKO Volcarona with ease. Landorus-T is an impeccable one, sponging Terrakion's attacks with relative ease, laying down Stealth Rock, and seizing momentum with U-turn.</p>

[SET]
name: Hurricane
move 1: Quiver Dance
move 2: Bug Buzz
move 3: Hurricane
move 4: Fire Blast / Hidden Power Water
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
nature: Modest / Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While this bug seems like more of a sun-lover, it's perfectly at home in the rain as well. Hurricane gives it a strong attack to use in the rain, plowing through rain teams that think they've effectively neutered Volcarona. Bug / Flying is remarkably effective coverage, and when in the rain, Hurricane is one of Volcarona's strongest tools. Fire Blast may seem like an odd choice, but it wards off Skarmory, Jirachi, Forretress, and other Steel-types that would otherwise wall you in the rain, and gives dual STAB in case of sand. However, Hidden Power Water gets pseudo-STAB in the rain, and also hits a number of notable Pokemon. It KOes Terrakion in the rain at +1 with Leftovers, hits Landorus-T hard, and prevents Heatran from walling Volcarona both in and out of the rain.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Substitute is a solid choice in the last slot, as it eases prediction and can be helpful against Heatran. Giga Drain can make Volcarona more effective against opposing rain teams, and is best used over Bug Buzz with Hurricane as the primary attack. Leftovers are the preferred item, as this is a more supportive sweeper and may need to switch in multiple times or sponge an attack or two while setting up. However, Life Orb is still a solid choice for power at all costs. Note that Hidden Power Water is most important alongside Leftovers, as Life Orb's power allows this Volcarona to pick up some crucial KOs with just its STABs and Hurricane. Since this set relies on a non-STAB Hurricane as its primary offensive tool, Modest is the preferred nature in order to squeeze out as much damage as possible. However, Timid is still effective, especially against teams where Volcarona can't pick up more than 1 boost.</p>

<p>As this is a rain-based Pokemon, Politoed is an obvious supporter. However, if you're just looking for a Volcarona that takes advantage of opposing rain, Politoed isn't necessary. As with every Volcarona set, a way to keep Stealth Rock off the field is important. Forretress can also take advantage of Rain to diminish its Fire weakness, letting it take weaker Hidden Power Fires. It also provides entry hazards, which are important to allow Volcarona to achieve as many Hurricane KOs as possible. A check to Scarf Terrakion is also hugely important, as it can switch into either Quiver Dance, Fire Blast, or Bug Buzz and shut Volcarona down. Landorus-T is an exceptional offensive check to Scarf Terrakion, both threatening it and tanking its attacks with ease. Since this set is almost 100% walled by Heatran, it's important to have something that can deal with Heatran. Dugtrio can trap and kill it, and can even potentially take a weaker Fire attack in the rain. Alternately, Tentacruel can ward off Heatran, carries Rapid Spin, and benefits greatly from the presence of rain. Finally, Starmie can resist Heatran's STAB, Recover off the damage, and spin away entry hazards.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulky Quiver Dance
move 1: Quiver Dance
move 2: Fiery Dance
move 3: Bug Buzz
move 4: Roost
nature: Timid
item: Leftovers 
evs: 240 HP / 252 Def / 16 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Quiver Dance makes Volcarona an absolutely incredible offensive sweeper in its own right, its combined offensive and defensive buff also makes another option available to Volcarona. 85 base HP is remarkably good, and with heavy defensive investment and Roost, Volcarona can buy itself plenty of time to boost up and blaze through the opposing team. While Volcarona is still susceptible to burst damage from offensive teams, defensive investment and Roost allows it to outlast a number of more defensive checks, and with enough Quiver Dances, Volcarona has the power to blow through pretty much everything. To top it off, the durability of this set means that Flame Body has a chance to kick in, and if the opponent's physical Volcarona check gets burned, the game could be over then and there. Bug Buzz is the primary STAB, being the most reliable offensive option that Volcarona has. Fiery Dance gets the spotlight here as well, as it allows Volcarona to keep amping up its offense once it's got a couple Quiver Dances under its belt.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As always, Fire Blast is available if the power is really necessary, but since this set aims to set up slowly and reliably, it can afford the drop in power. A mono-attackin set is also an option, replacing either attacking move with Substitute. Fire is the preferred STAB when used alongside Ninetales, but Bug is useful for its lack of immunities. EV-wise, this set has a fairly simple spread. 16 Speed with a Timid nature allows Volcarona to outspeed base 130s at +1, or +1 base 110s at +2&mdash;the latter is especially effective for preventing Choice Scarf Latios from stopping a sweep. Defense is maximized, and the rest goes into HP, to provide the maximum physical bulk.</p>

<p>As with every Volcarona set, sun support is extremely useful, as it gives Volcarona a much needed punch on its Fire attacks, and also dampens the effectiveness of Water-type attacks. This is especially notable for a set like this one, as many Water attacks will fail to outdamage Roost after a couple Quiver Dances. A Rapid Spinner is also good for removing Stealth Rock, though the presence of Roost on this set makes it somewhat less important. Screen support can allow Volcarona to get the first couple boosts under its belt, especially considering the extreme defensive investment. Finally, there's the standard Volcarona counters to deal with. Heatran is especially troublesome, so a teammate that can deal with it is important. Dugtrio can trap and kill it, securing the kill, but it's hard to switch in and may require a sacrifice. Jellicent is also an issue, though much less of one in the sun. Additionally, strong physical attackers like Terrakion and Landorus-T can prove troublesome. For this reason, Forretress can be a useful ally, as it not only provides a check to these strong attackers, but can spin away Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes. Landorus-T also provides a strong physical check, but lacks the ability to Rapid Spin.</p>

[SET]
name: ChestoRest
move 1: Quiver Dance
move 2: Rest
move 3: Fire Blast / Fiery Dance
move 4: Bug Buzz
nature: Modest
item: Chesto Berry
evs: 160 HP / 236 SpA / 112 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set strikes an interesting balance between bulk and offense&mdash;the aim is to absorb some damage and possibly status, rack up a couple Quiver Dances, and then Rest off all the damage and start the sweep like new, having used Chesto Berry to wake up. Against more defensive teams, this set can be devastating, as they simply don't have the firepower to deal with Volcarona quickly. With the offensive investment and powerful STABs, it can easily deliver the pain to opponents once a couple Quiver Dances are up.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Speed investment allows this Volcarona to outspeed base 130s at +1 and +1 base 110s at +2, which is important to outspeed Choice Scarf Latios and other fast Pokemon. Dugtrio makes an effective ally, as Heatran absolutely must be removed for this set to function effectively. Landorus-T or another similar Terrakion check is also extremely important, as no amount of Resting will stop Terrakion from coming in and destroying Volcarona with its Rock STAB. Hazards are also extremely useful, as this set often needs the extra damage to seal the deal. A Rapid Spin user is nearly obligatory, as Stealth Rock needs to be gone in order to allow Volcarona the most time to set up. Finally, wallbreakers of any stripe are useful, as this set only gets one shot at sweeping, and it needs all potential problems removed beforehand.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A Choice Specs set with U-turn can be utilized effectively. Volcarona's massive 135 base Special Attack lets it power through pretty much anything, and U-turn can be extremely useful to capitalize on Volcarona's tendency to force switches. However, a Choice set on a Pokemon with a 4x Stealth Rock weakness is rather suspect, so it has to be played with care. A mono attacker with Sunny Day, Quiver Dance, Fire Blast, and either Roost or Morning Sun can be effective, especially against Rain teams. Between Quiver Dance and Sunny Day, Volcarona can almost set up in the face of opposing Water-types, and Politoed fails to put a damper on Volcarona's sweep potential. Finally, a straight offensive set with dual STAB, a coverage move, and Roost can be used for a Starmie-esque set. Volcarona is remarkably bulky, and being able to heal off residual damage can keep Volcarona in the fight for a remarkably long time.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>With its 4x weakness, Stealth Rock is easily Volcarona's biggest check in OU. It's hard for Volcarona to set up at 50% HP, and even harder at 1% if it's forced out. Keeping Stealth Rock on the field is the easiest way to reduce Volcarona's effectiveness in the long term. Terrakion in the sand is probably the most significant check, as it resists both STABs and has super effective Rock STAB to take it out. It can also outspeed +1 Volcarona with Choice Scarf, or simply sponge an attack and set up a Rock Polish. Heatran is also especially effective, as it's essentially immune to both STABs. However, Hidden Power Ground can be troublesome, and if Heatran is the only Volcarona check on the team, this can make it especially deadly. Chansey can wall Volcarona effectively outside of the sun, but with sun support, Volcarona can muscle through with Fire Blast, so be careful. Toxic on Chansey can make it more effective, putting a death timer on more defensively oriented sets. Snorlax has huge HP and Special Defense, resists Fire with its Thick Fat ability, and can slam Volcarona hard with its powerful STAB Body Slam and Return.</p>

<p>There are some more nonstandard Volcarona counters out there as well. Azumarill in the rain is the ultimate counter to Volcarona, as it has plenty of bulk and a STAB Aqua Jet to deal with Volcarona. Any of the Flying-type Pokemon that resist Volcarona's dual STABs, such as Gyarados, Salamence, and Dragonite, can help deal with it, but they have to watch out for Hidden Power Rock, as well as Volcarona's raw power. Tyranitar can cancel out Drought, lay down Stealth Rock, and OHKO Volcarona with its Rock STAB, but its weakness to Bug makes it a shaky check at best and terrible if Volcarona already has some boosts.</p>

<p>When not carrying Giga Drain, a check against Water-types of all stripes is suggested, especially Jellicent and Keldeo, which also resist Bug. Note that while Timid Scarf Keldeo can outspeed Volcarona, its Hydro Pump fails to OHKO at full HP, and if sun is involved, it fails to even 2HKO. As mentioned before, Tentacruel is an exceptionally good teammate, absorbing Toxic Spikes, spinning away rocks, and sponging Water-type attacks. Rain is often considered a "counter" to Volcarona, but in many cases, rain can be more of a liability against it. Against the standard sets, Volcarona loses its most powerful STAB while the rain exacerbates its Water weakness. However, against sets packing Hurricane and/or Giga Drain, the rain can actually be counterproductive.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Volcarona's Dream World ability is Swarm. While Flame Body is incredibly useful for bulky sets to burn troublesome physical attackers, Swarm can find itself used on more offensive sets. While the Fire STAB is often considered the more potent offensive move, a Swarm-boosted Bug Buzz augmented by a Quiver Dance or two can give Volcarona the punch it needs to get through some of the more troublesome Fire resistances around. It even synergizes well with Substitute sets, which can control the activation of Swarm and turn up the power for a sweep.</p>
