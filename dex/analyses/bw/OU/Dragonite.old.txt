[Overview]

<p>In BW, Dragonite rose from the shadows of its competitors due to being gifted with the rare Multiscale. With Multiscale, Dragonite has gone from an outclassed niche Pokemon to one of the most dominant offensive and defensive threats in the metagame. It can fill almost any role and is one of the few Pokemon that can claim to work on any team due to its endless movepool and well-distributed stats. However, residual damage, particularly a nasty Stealth Rock weakness, limits Multiscale's effectiveness. A slightly below-average Speed holds it back as well, though Multiscale helps mitigate this flaw somewhat. Speedy threats such as Choice Scarf Salamence and Thundurus-T don't do it any favors either. Regardless of these downfalls, Dragonite defines the OU metagame with its great bulk and power, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is more oriented towards the hit-and-run strategy. It is similar to Scizor in this aspect, except that Extreme Speed has better general coverage and around the same amount of power as Bullet Punch. With a Choice Band, Dragonite becomes a monster, capable of blasting apart walls and tearing large holes in both offensive and defensive cores. Outrage is the primary offensive tool of this set, capable of steamrolling through everything that is not a bulky Steel-type and puncturing through the highest of defenses. Extreme Speed is a huge boon to Choice Band Dragonite, allowing it to act similar to Scizor in that it can pick off almost any weakened Pokemon that does not resist it. Fire Punch has excellent coverage with Outrage, hitting the Steel-types that resist it hard, but Waterfall is the superior choice in rain due to being boosted by the weather. Earthquake rounds out Dragonite's coverage by smacking Heatran and Jirachi in rain, though Superpower is actually a very competitive alternative. It does heavy damage to Tyranitar, Blissey, and Chansey, and has arguably better coverage too, hitting most Pokemon that Earthquake hits and more. However, Jirachi in rain and Metagross will then wall Dragonite, but outside of rain Fire Punch deals a decent amount of damage and the right support can make them a non-issue.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs and nature are very simple, providing maximum offensive power with an Adamant nature, and securing many vital KOs. A Jolly nature can be run to outspeed Timid Heatran but has little use outside of that. Aqua Tail is an option over Waterfall, but Waterfall has perfect accuracy and the extra power isn't all that needed. Dragon Claw is the last move that might be considered, as locking Dragonite into Outrage with opposing Steel-types still alive is risky, and Earthquake or Superpower might not be needed due to offensive Heatran being 2HKOed by Outrage. It is much easier to toss around Dragon Claws than it is to toss around Outrages, with there being little risk attached to Dragon Claw and high risk attached to Outrage. However, Dragon Claw lacks the massive power that Outrage has and just cannot achieve the same KOs, so most of the time it will just be on the set and be a wasted moveslot that could be better spent on a coverage move.</p>

<p>For this set to function, removing Stealth Rock is vital, as it needs to be played as a hit-and-run Pokemon that will be switching in and out a lot. Forretress can provide Rapid Spinning utility as well as set up entry hazards that Dragonite enjoys to weaken its checks. Starmie is another option that can deal with spinblockers and threaten many of Dragonite's checks. Paralysis support is quite helpful due to Dragonite's below-average Speed. The most notable example is Jirachi, which has a multitude of other uses such as Stealth Rock, Wish to help with switching into attacks, and excellent defensive synergy. Chansey is great as well and can provide cleric support to remove detrimental status such as paralysis or burn. Celebi is another great choice and can also provide cleric support but lacks the defensive synergy to be the best partner that it can be. Pokemon that can utilize the holes that Dragonite punches, such as Scizor and Terrakion, enjoy Dragonite's help to aid in their respective methods of sweeping.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While in previous generations Dragonite was often overlooked in favor of the much faster Salamence, Multiscale gives it a major boost that puts it on the forefront of Dragon Dance sweeping. With Multiscale, provided that Stealth Rock is off the field, Dragonite is the only Dragon-type that can claim to have a guaranteed turn of setup, which rivals Salamence and Haxorus only wish they could have. It can even set up on and KO Starmie and Latias, both of which would otherwise have their way with slower Dragon-types. Once set up, very few Pokemon in OU can take on the menace that is boosted Dragonite, allowing it to rip apart teams if left unchecked.</p>

<p>There are two choices for Dragonite's STAB move: Outrage and Dragon Claw. Outrage is much more powerful, so powerful that it 2HKOes offensive Heatran with a +1 boost, meaning that with it and Fire Punch Dragonite can hit every Pokemon in OU for a large amount of damage. Dragon Claw is another option, having much less power but giving Dragonite the option to switch moves. Dragon Claw pairs well with Extreme Speed, as the combination of the two allows Dragonite to continue its sweep against faster revenge killers, such as Keldeo, Thundurus-T, Latios, and Haxorus. Earthquake is another option that allows Dragonite to beat Pokemon that rain teams in particular often have trouble with such as Tentacruel, Jirachi, and Heatran. Lastly, Roost can be run in order to optimize Dragonite's access to Multiscale to obtain more boosts and increase overall longevity.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread is ideal for Dragonite to have the maximum Speed and power. A Jolly nature will reduce its power significantly, but it allows Dragonite to outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Politoed and Timid Jolteon at +1, as well as Choice Scarf Terrakion and Choice Scarf Latios at +2. A bulkier spread of 252 HP / 44 Atk / 212 Spe is also usable in order to try and stack many boosts and then sweep. In this case, Roost is vital in order to increase longevity, as is Dragon Claw so that Dragonite is not disadvantaged by being locked into a move when it is not quite so powerful. However, this sort of Dragon Dance set has a lot of issues that it did not have in the past, as fast revenge killers such as Terrakion, Keldeo, Thundurus-T, as well as super effective priority from Mamoswine make it much harder for a set that needs time to operate to actually obtain the time that it needs to setup. In addition, the power loss is very noticeable and Dragonite becomes much easier to wall.</p>

<p>Lum Berry is the preferred item to ward off burns from Scald and paralysis from the likes of Ferrothorn that Dragonite might want to set up on. Leftovers is another option to lessen the effects of residual damage, and is particularly useful under sand and hail to prevent them from getting in the way of Multiscale. The last item that might be considered is Life Orb, as although it does negate Multiscale, the OHKOs on Vaporeon and Jellicent as well as the 2HKO on Skarmory with +1 Fire Punch might be well worth it. As far as moves are concerned, there are a few other decent choices. First off, Waterfall is superior to Fire Punch on rain teams, but then Stealth Rock support and Life Orb become necessary for Dragonite to break Steel-types, and Ferrothorn will then always beat Dragonite sans those running Superpower, which has drawbacks that make it undesirable in most cases. Fire Blast can be used to break through Skarmory and Ice Punch can be used to hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, and opposing Dragonite harder, but usually Dragonite is better off simply running Earthquake and Fire Punch.</p>

<p>As far as support is concerned, Rapid Spin is a must in order to maintain Multiscale, with Forretress, Starmie, and Donphan being your best choices. Stealth Rock is important as well, securing many KOs and wearing down Dragonite's counters, with Landorus-T and Ferrothorn being excellent choices for the job. Weather support is appreciated to boost the power of Fire Punch or Waterfall and to remove sand, which is detrimental to Multiscale, with sun being optimal for the former and rain for the latter. Rotom-W makes a good partner, as it can switch into Dragonite's best defensive checks, such as Skarmory, Gliscor, and Landorus-T, force them out with the threat of Hydro Pump, and then use Volt Switch to get back out to Dragonite who can deal with common switch-ins to Rotom-W. Magnezone is a decent partner as well, making it much easier to get Skarmory out of the way due to the very specific conditions that Dragonite needs to beat Skarmory, as well as beating Ferrothorn if Waterfall is chosen over Fire Punch and having excellent type synergy with Dragonite.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The main goal of this set is to deal with the three main things that standard Dragon Dance Dragonite is stopped by: status, revenge killers, and residual damage from sand. While usually Dragonite will have to choose which issue to overcome, with this set it can have it all, with beating revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Haxorus lacking Dual Chop, Choice Scarf Keldeo, Choice Scarf Terrakion, and Choice Scarf Thundurus-T being icing on the cake. Without having to worry about status and being protected from faster revenge killers and priority, Dragonite can easily boost all the way up to +6 provided it gets in against a slower wall or Pokemon that cannot hit it for much damage. Most teams lack a way to prevent this from happening other than denying Dragonite momentum, which can be easily gained with a simple slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Once Steel-types are removed, this set is a nightmare for stall, as other than Roar and Whirlwind, such teams usually lack ways of stopping this set from setting up to +6 and unleashing its untold fury upon their mightiest and bulkiest walls. The SubRoost strategy finds its home on this Dragonite set, allowing Dragonite to maintain Multiscale and have an even easier time setting up. Dragon Claw is the sole attack, boasting a large amount of power after a few boosts. While Dragonite might have a bit of trouble finding time to actually switch in and set up Substitute, the moment it does spells doom for all of its opposition.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread is the best possible option, with maximum investment in HP for the best overall bulk with enough Defense EVs for Dragonite's Substitutes to survive Iron Heads from specially defensive Jirachi as well as enough Special Defense EVs to take Thunders from the same Jirachi. The given Speed EVs combined with a Jolly nature serve to outspeed Alakazam at +1. 80 Special Defense EVs can be invested to stall out Ice Beams from Choice Specs Politoed. Otherwise, there aren't any other great choices for EVs that do not cause Dragonite to forfeit key investments in other areas.</p>

<p>Although this set is more self-sufficient than other sets, it still needs the correct support to bypass counters and function with more ease. As far as counters are concerned, Skarmory is a huge issue due to its high Defense, resistance to Dragon Claw, and access to Whirlwind to phaze Dragonite out. Other Steel-types and physical walls can be bypassed with the correct setup sequence, though there are some Pokemon that can overcome Dragonite through other means, such as Perish Song users, Ice Punch Metagross, or Unaware Quagsire. Hippowdon and Heatran with Roar can take a boosted hit easily and phaze it out, while Shell Smash Cloyster ignores Substitute and Multiscale with Icicle Spear. Generally speaking, before sending Dragonite out to sweep, ensure that the aforementioned defensive threats are eliminated. Magnezone and Gothitelle are notable for their ability to trap and eliminate Steel-types, though Skarmory with Shed Shell might prove problematic. Rather than going with the conventional trap-and-kill route, one can simply employ Pokemon that can lure in or punch through these counters; prime examples include Choice Band Terrakion and Magic Bounce Espeon with Hidden Power Fire.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin support is not as necessary because of Substitute and Roost, but it is still appreciated to ensure Multiscale is activated from the start. Starmie is notable above all others due to its ability to use Rapid Spin, absorb status with Natural Cure, and break down physical walls that Dragonite might encounter. Dragonite in turn can set up on threats that wall Starmie, including, but not limited to, Gastrodon lacking Ice Beam, Jellicent, Blissey, and Rotom-W. Forretress and Tentacruel are also good choices because of their stellar defenses, great typing, and access to entry hazards. Speaking of which, residual damage is instrumental to Dragonite's success; it will often find itself in situations where it will have to stall out certain foes before doing anything else, which applies mainly to walls such as Quagsire and Hippowdon. These foes are easily stalled out with Toxic Spikes support, which Forretress and Tentacruel can easily provide.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>All it takes is one look at Dragonite's offenses and movepool to see that it can make an excellent mixed attacker in rain. It boasts coveted access to both Hurricane and Thunder with STAB to boost the former. There are other reasons that it works well in rain, such as covering the Grass-type weaknesses that many members of most rain teams tend to have without being weak to Electric-type attacks, which is a solid advantage over such Pokemon as Tornadus. It does not take much to get Dragonite in, and once it gets in it blasts holes, boasting downright amazing coverage and tearing apart common threats to rain teams.</p>

<p>Due to this set being built for rain, Hurricane overtakes Dragonite's Dragon-type STAB as the main spam move of choice, boasting 100% accuracy in rain as well as a high Base Power and excellent neutral coverage. The next slot is all preference; Aqua Tail gains a sort of pseudo-STAB in rain and does solid damage to most Pokemon that resist Hurricane, with notable hits being the OHKO on 252 / 0 Heatran 81% of the time, the OHKO on 0 / 0 Thundurus-T after Stealth Rock, the 2HKO on 252 / 0 Jirachi 65% of the time after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, the 2HKO on Blissey after Stealth Rock, and the 2HKO on Tyranitar outside of rain. While Superpower might seem like a much more inferior option when put up against how well Aqua Tail does against a variety of threats, Superpower OHKOes Tyranitar, OHKOes Blissey after Stealth Rock, and 2HKOes Chansey, all of which are very relevant and notable checks to rain, and although lowering stats is a drawback, the draw is still there for smacking those three Pokemon hard. However, it does then leave Dragonite open to Jirachi if it forfeits Earthquake, and Earthquake and Superpower have redundant coverage when used together.</p>

<p>Thunder is in the third slot due to the fact that it has perfect accuracy in rain and deals super effective damage to Pokemon that rain teams struggle with, such as Tentacruel, as well as allowing Dragonite to lure in and KO Skarmory expecting a physical Dragonite. The solid 30% paralysis chance can be helpful in a clutch, giving the Latias, Latios, and other fast Pokemon that can take a Thunder second thoughts on switching in. The last slot is all a tossup, as it won't be used very much at all. Extreme Speed allows Dragonite to pick off faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users and can be combined with another move that could potentially surprise the opponent. Earthquake hits a few things that Aqua Tail and Superpower fail to hit and gives Dragonite a great tool against sun teams that are otherwise challenging for rain teams to beat. Roost can be useful to keep Dragonite alive longer and possibly repair Multiscale, but its use is limited, and the use of Life Orb breaks Multiscale anyway. Every move that can be put in the last slot does have some potential use, but in actuality it isn't all that much and the best move to pick is the one that will handle something that your team struggles with.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Where EVs are concerned, there are enough Speed EVs to outspeed Timid Magnezone and maximum EVs in Special Attack to pump up Dragonite's spammable STAB as well as Thunder, with the remaining EVs placed in Attack to make Dragonite's physical moves a bit more powerful. As far as other moves are concerned, Outrage is an option in the final slot for a more powerful physical attack, boasting STAB, that hits special walls such as Chansey, Gastrodon, and Blissey, but the lock-in is detrimental and usually ends up with a dead Dragonite and a wasted moveslot, having quite redundant coverage.</p>

<p>Due to this set packing Hurricane, Thunder, and possibly Aqua Tail, it is easy to see that Politoed is necessary for the rain support it provides. Another type of support that helps is the much aforementioned Rapid Spin, especially due to this set's vulnerability to residual damage as well as its general hit-and-run playstyle. Starmie is a top-notch teammate for this Dragonite set, being excellent at taking advantage of rain in itself and having the potential to beat checks to Dragonite such as Latios, Mamoswine, Scizor, and Thundurus-T. It also pairs well with Pokemon that need certain Pokemon removed in order to sweep such as Toxicroak, Latios, and Scizor, all of which struggle with certain Pokemon that this Dragonite can remove. Thanks to its low Speed, Dragonite will often be forced out, so any sort of Pokemon that has good type synergy with Dragonite, such as Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Jirachi, makes an excellent teammate as a pivot to take attacks aimed at Dragonite. Paralysis support is optional but is greatly helpful, with Jirachi, Chansey, and Celebi being great choices for the job, the latter two boasting a nice defensive synergy with Dragonite. Notice that a lot of Dragonite's support is optional, as it is one of the best standalone Pokemon for punching holes in teams in existence.</p>

[SET]
name: Tank (Rain)

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While many Dragonite sets aim to break holes, this set aims to deal with many common threats to rain teams thanks to its numerous resistances and the all-important Multiscale. Thanks to being made for rain, it has the ability to hit back hard as well, which is a key advantage over the Multiscale shuffler set. Out of every single set contained in this analysis, this set is the best at taking advantage of Multiscale, taking advantage of Roost to stall out even super effective attacks from some of the most monstrous attackers in existence. Dragon Tail is able to be used at key times if Multiscale is intact, as well as STAB Hurricane and perfectly-accurate-in-rain Thunder to hit back hard.</p>

<p>Hurricane hits quite hard thanks to STAB, even without investment, with the 30% confusion chance being ever-present and always a headache for opposing Pokemon. Thunder has decent coverage with Hurricane and has a very nice 30% chance of paralysis, allowing Dragonite to cripple many sweepers completely and even create an unreliable but still deadly parafusion combination with Hurricane. Rain stall teams often struggle with bulky Water-types, such as Jellicent, Vaporeon, and Tentacruel, and Thunder allows Dragonite to beat them. Dragon Tail prevents Dragonite from being set up on and can be pulled off to save a battle from the fires of defeat, being able to be used as a revenge killer for setup sweepers not behind a Substitute. It would be remiss not to mention Roost, which is supremely important for keeping Dragonite in a decent range of health and abusing Multiscale. Bringing Dragonite without it would be a tragic mistake.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs provide Dragonite with the maximum possible special bulk in order to maximize the number of threats that it can wall. Investment in Special Attack might be desired to better handle Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi, but the loss in special bulk is usually not worth it and makes it harder for Dragonite to act as the excellent pivot that it is. Earthquake can be used in order to hit some troublesome Pokemon to rain teams such as Jirachi, Heatran, and Tyranitar, the former being a nightmare to most rain stall teams. Substitute is an option to be used over Thunder to turn this set into a rain-based version of the Multiscale shuffler set in order to protect Dragonite from status, but the coverage and paralysis chance that Thunder offers will be sorely missed.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that this set is made for rain stall and has two attacks that rely on rain to be reliable, Politoed is a mandatory partner. Entry hazard support from the likes of Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory are also beneficial to this set due to the fact that Dragon Tail shuffles around the opposing team. The latter also checks Dragon- and Ice-types and counters and KOes Swords Dance Virizion with Brave Bird, all of which are troublesome for Dragonite. A spinblocker, such as Gengar, Jellicent, or Sableye, can be helpful in order to make sure these vital hazards are not spun away. Cleric support from the likes of Chansey and Celebi is useful because Dragonite is quite vulnerable to status and Toxic is pretty much instant death for this since it will usually be staying in for long periods of time. Wish support from Blissey, Chansey, or Jirachi can aid greatly in keeping Multiscale intact and all of them have great type synergy with Dragonite. The three also check Water-types with an Ice-type attack for coverage that are a major headache for Dragonite. Amoonguss is a great partner because it checks Water-types and Thundurus-T which Dragonite struggles with. Lastly, a check to Terrakion, such as Starmie, Scizor, or Breloom, is useful due to the fact that Terrakion's Stone Edge does heavy damage to Dragonite.</p>

<p>While it has been discussed that Dragonite is excellent on rain stall, it has not been discussed why this is true. First off, it can take on many threats to rain stall such as bulky Water-types and Calm Mind sweepers, the most notable two being Jirachi and Keldeo. In addition, Dragonite is not just another weak wall&mdash;it is a legitimately powerful force with STAB Hurricane and the powerful Thunder that many rain stall teams tend to lack. Multiscale makes it an excellent pivot for such teams, allowing it to switch in on attacks even the mightiest of walls cannot take. It has Dragon Tail to beat setup sweepers. Dragonite provides a full package that is exceptionally useful for rain stall teams. This Dragonite set is an excellent tool for rain stall and should be considered for any team utilizing the playstyle.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Dragonite set can take on a variety of roles for a team, including paralysis spreader, sweeper, lure, and a check to some of the top threats of the metagame. Thunder Wave allows Dragonite to support slower teammates as well as itself, which most importantly means that it gets more opportunities to use Roost, possibly reactivating Multiscale in the process, allowing it to survive an otherwise fatal hit. With Thunder Wave slowing opposing Pokemon down, Dragonite can invest all of its EVs in bulk and power, making it so Dragonite can function as an effective tank. In a similar vein with Tinkerbell Celebi, Dragonite should aim to spread paralysis early-game and fire off strong attacks later. While Dragonite's 100 base Special Attack doesn't seem like much, it is more than enough to hit a pretty decent majority of the metagame hard thanks to high-power attacks in Draco Meteor and Fire Blast.</p>

<p>Due to the heavy threat level of the omnipresent Dragon Dance and Choice Band variants of Dragonite, this set can also act as an effective lure, dealing heavy damage to physical walls such as Slowbro, Gliscor, and Skarmory that might switch in expecting to take an Outrage only to meet a Draco Meteor or a Fire Blast, paving the way for physical sweepers, such as Terrakion and Scizor, to sweep. Luring in physical walls is something rain variants of Dragonite cannot do, as special attacks such as Hurricane and Thunder might be expected under these conditions. If Dragonite is using Leftovers and Thunder Wave happens to be revealed before either of Dragonite's attacks are, it can effectively bluff being the Multiscale shuffler set and surprise foes with a powerful attack, as Multiscale shuffler Dragonite typically does not invest in its offenses. Draco Meteor is Dragonite's strongest attack, and thanks to the STAB boost it receives, only a handful of non-Steel-type Pokemon are able to switch in to it and live to tell the tale. Fire Blast provides excellent coverage alongside Draco Meteor, with the combination of the two attacks only resisted by Heatran. Flamethrower is a viable alternative to Fire Blast, but the drop in power is noticeable. However, if sun support is provided, Flamethrower is generally the better option, as with the sun boost, Flamethrower gets all the KOs Fire Blast would, in addition to having perfect accuracy.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>To get a sense of this Dragonite's effectiveness as a lure, here are some damage calculations against its common switch-ins:</p>

<ul class="damage_calculation">
<li>Life Orb Draco Meteor vs 252/0 Gliscor 97% - 114%</li>
<li>Life Orb Draco Meteor vs 252/0 Slowbro 82% - 97%</li>
<li>Life Orb Draco Meteor vs 252/0 Hippowdon 84% - 100%</li>
<li>Life Orb Draco Meteor vs 252/0 Quagsire 97% - 115%</li>
<li>Life Orb Fire Blast vs 252/0 Cloyster 95% - 112%</li>
<li>Life Orb Fire Blast vs 252/252+ Skarmory 83% - 99%</li>
<li>Life Orb Fire Blast vs 252/216+ Ferrothorn 118% - 139%</li>
<li>Life Orb Fire Blast vs 252/92+ Bronzong 68% - 80%</li>
</ul>

<p>Life Orb is the item of choice to obtain the given amounts of damage listed above. Leftovers is an option to increase Dragonite's survivability, but without Life Orb, Dragonite misses out on a significant amount of OHKOs and 2HKOs, becoming a less effective lure as a result. However, if this Dragonite is used on a sandstorm or hail team, Leftovers will be necessary to mitigate the residual damage. The EVs provided give Dragonite an HP number not divisible by four, guaranteeing that it can switch in on Stealth Rock four times as opposed to three without fainting. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Attack, and a Modest nature is used so that Dragonite can hit as hard as possible and also help obtain the above amounts of damage.</p>

<p>If the Special Attack drops from Draco Meteor are an issue, Dragon Pulse can take its place. Dragon Pulse allows Dragonite to stay in longer, thus alleviating its need to switch into Stealth Rock. However, the drop in power is noticeable, and Dragonite loses out on a number of KOs. Dragonite has access to some useful support options, such as Heal Bell and Light Screen, but has trouble fitting them into the set. Additionally, Heal Bell is incompatible with Multiscale, and giving up Multiscale is not recommended under any circumstances. Draco Plate can be used to power up Draco Meteor while maintaining Multiscale, but Dragonite is usually better off boosting both attacks with Life Orb or healing with Leftovers.</p>

<p>This set has severe difficultly breaking through Heatran and Blissey, both of which can Toxic and stall out Dragonite. Thanks to the boost in Special Defense it receives from sand, Tyranitar can also wall Dragonite, breaking its Multiscale with sandstorm damage, and threatening Dragonite with its powerful Stone Edge. Tyranitar would also gladly absorb a Thunder Wave, as this allows it to switch in on Scalds from bulky Water-types and not have to risk becoming crippled by a burn. Terrakion makes an excellent partner as it and Dragonite share decent type synergy, and Terrakion can scare off or set up on all three of the aforementioned threats. Dragonite can also eliminate some of Terrakion's checks while providing paralysis support for it to take advantage of with Swords Dance, Rock Polish, or a combination of both. Ninetales is a fine partner to consider because the sun it provides eliminates residual damage caused by opposing hail and sand while boosting the power of Dragonite's Fire-type attack. Dragonite must be cautious of opposing Ground-types as they can switch into Thunder Wave. Two Ground-types in particular that give Dragonite problems are Gastrodon and Landorus-T, both of which can retaliate with 4x super effective Ice-type attacks. However, Landorus-T can't take a hit from Dragonite and Gastrodon will fall to two consecutive Draco Meteors if it takes a little prior damage.</p>

<p>As Dragonite is weak to Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin support is obviously appreciated, especially for Life Orb variants, which can be worn down quite quickly. Based on the damage calculations above, entry hazards of your own can help Dragonite net more KOs. Forretress can provide both entry hazards and its Fire-type weakness grants Dragonite more opportunities to switch in. Jirachi makes an excellent partner to this set, as the two resist all of each others' weaknesses and Jirachi can provide much appreciated Wish support. Cleric support can prove useful for healing Dragonite of status, but is not a necessity as Dragonite is immune to Toxic Spikes. Furthermore, the only Pokemon in OU that can safely status Dragonite without being KOed by Draco Meteor or Fire Blast are Blissey, Heatran, and specially defensive Jellicent.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set, yet another one of Dragonite's rain-utilizing variant, functions as a more independent sweeper rather than a support unit or wallbreaker. Specifically, it makes use of the odd Agility, doubling Dragonite's average Speed which allows it to outrun and take out faster opponents. Keep in mind, however, that this set also invests heavily in Speed, making Dragonite actually quite fast as is; therefore, Agility should only be used if dangerous Choice Scarf Pokemon or otherwise faster threats are present.</p>

<p>Thanks to the sheer power of Dragonite's Hurricane and Thunder, backed up by investment and Life Orb, Dragonite can lure in and greatly weaken or KO most of its regular checks and counters. Hurricane 2HKOes standard Ferrothorn with one layer of Spikes, and scores many OHKOes against a large list of offensive threats not resistant to it, such as Salamence, Starmie, and Keldeo (the first two after Stealth Rock damage). Thunder complements Hurricane with additional coverage, especially against the more defensive Water- and Flying-types such as Jellicent, Vaporeon, and Skarmory. The last move depends on personal preference. Aqua Tail breaks down a number of threats, mainly Blissey, Heatran, and most Steel- or Rock-types in the rain, and Tyranitar in sandstorm. Surf is an alternative with perfect accuracy and special damage output, and is generally a better option against most physically defensive Steel-types and Landorus-T. Superpower does most of the things Aqua Tail does, except it is less reliant on weather, takes out Kyurem-B, and ensures that you can win the weather war by OHKOing Tyranitar right off the bat. However, it misses on super effective coverage against Ground-types, which means Dragonite will have a harder time with Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Naive nature is preferred here, as the extra Speed points allow Dragonite to outrun a number of important Choice Scarf users, mainly Keldeo, Terrakion, and Latios, after an Agility boost. The increased Speed also generally makes Dragonite more offensively functional and less reliant on Agility in dire situations. A Rash nature, on the other hand, offers more special power and allows Dragonite to attain even more KOs overall. A prime example of this is against 4/0 Kyurem-B, which has an 18.75% chance of being OHKOed by Rash Hurricane after Stealth Rock damage, but can always survive Naive Hurricane. However, keep in mind that +2 Rash Dragonite falls just short of Choice Scarf Terrakion and Keldeo by a single point, which makes it fairly easy to revenge kill considering these variants are very common. If using Surf, use a Timid or Modest nature instead to avoid the Defense drop.</p>

<p>A common issue with this set is its inability to KO many Dragon-types in time. While most Dragon-types still dislike taking Hurricane, others, such as Latios and Kyurem-B, can survive and use their respective Dragon-type STAB to revenge kill Dragonite. Therefore, Dragon Pulse is a perfectly valid alternative on this set, OHKOing a number of Dragon-types after Stealth Rock damage. Finding a moveslot for it, however, can be difficult due to the importance and coverage of the listed attacking moves. A good way to get around this is by pairing Dragonite with teammates that also utilize Thunder, such as Rotom-W, and replacing Thunder with Dragon Pulse.</p>

<p>Politoed is obviously a required teammate as Hurricane, Thunder, Aqua Tail, and Surf are very reliant on rain support. Politoed should also preferably have Encore or Perish Song in its arsenal in order to force switches, and thus give Dragonite more leeway in setting up. Rapid Spin support is also essential to preserve Multiscale, granting Dragonite even more valuable setup opportunities. This is especially important considering Life Orb puts Dragonite on a timer, and Dragonite itself won't last for long overall. In the rain, good Rapid Spin users include Starmie, which can also utilize the rain offensively, and Tentacruel, which also handles many defensive counters to Dragonite. Speaking of which, even though Dragonite can 2HKO defensive Pokemon, it needs hazard support to do so (especially if Dragonite is running a Naive nature). Sadly, even with the usual Stealth Rock or Spikes support, it also needs additional offensive support to ensure a smooth sweep, as it is easily vulnerable to status and stray attacks while attacking or setting up Agility. Choice Band or Substitute + Swords Dance Terrakion is a particularly good example, as it handily beats and scares off Chansey, Blissey, and defensive Tyranitar, while maintaining good offensive momentum. Keldeo and Gyarados also do a fine job against these threats in addition to Jirachi, while also taking advantage of the rain themselves.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While it might seem unorthodox for such a powerful offensive threat, this set is extremely effective with the right support. The goal is to shuffle the opposing team in order to rack up entry hazard damage as well as damage from Dragon Tail, possibly spreading paralysis if it has a chance or instead utilizing that slot to hit Steel-types hard that otherwise do well against Dragonite. Dragonite has an excellent set of resistances and has excellent bulk that is bolstered by Multiscale, having even more bulk than the titan of special walls, Blissey, with Multiscale intact. This set is best for teams built around entry hazards and residual damage, and functions poorly if used like a normal phazer, though if Multiscale is intact it gets the chance to phaze anything not behind a Substitute, barring a Dragon Tail miss.</p>

<p>This set has a very simple setup process. First, come in on a resisted move or one that Dragonite is immune to and make sure that the opposing Pokemon cannot deal heavy damage to Dragonite. Next, the goal is to set up a Substitute and attempt to stall with Substitute and Roost while using Dragon Tail every time Dragonite gets a chance. Thunder Wave is usually the modus operandi in order to achieve this, but if paralysis support is already provided, Dragonite can run Flamethrower to deal with the ubiquitous Steel-type switch-ins that are not fazed by entry hazards, such as Skarmory due to its access to recovery and Ferrothorn because of Iron Barbs, making it so Dragon Tail also deals damage to Dragonite if it connects. Forretress is another Steel-type that is problematic, mainly due to being able to spin away the hazards that are vital to this set's success.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs maximize special bulk to ensure that Dragonite takes the least amount of damage from most attacks, particularly most Ice-type attacks. The only other option that might be considered for this set is Fire Blast over Flamethrower, boasting a great deal more power that is particularly useful if 80 EVs are invested in Special Attack from HP in order to 2HKO even the most specially defensive of Skarmory. However, the much higher PP that Flamethrower packs is much more useful as Flamethrower, if used, is a great source of damage for Dragonite. It will need to be spammed in order to actually KO most targets, however, so the lower PP of Fire Blast is a major issue.</p>

<p>As with every other Dragonite set, this set greatly appreciates Stealth Rock being removed, and if Dragonite is a team's only phazer it is of utmost importance in order to keep Multiscale intact. Forretress can both provide Rapid Spin support and lay the hazards that this Dragonite set requires to work. Starmie is another option that can also sweep teams weakened by Dragonite's parashuffling due to its amazing coverage. It should also be mentioned that Dragonite is setup fodder for many entry hazard users, which increases the need for a spinner. Entry hazards are needed for this set to make the most of the opposing team being shuffled around, so a good hazard layer such as Ferrothorn or Jirachi is of vital importance to be paired up with Dragonite. Ferrothorn has great defensive synergy and can aid in Dragonite's quest to wear down the opposing team due to its hazards, Leech Seed, and Iron Barbs ability. Jirachi is also noteworthy because it can set up Stealth Rock and pass Wishes to Dragonite, which makes switching in much easier, and has great defensive synergy with Dragonite, one important advantage over Ferrothorn being that it resists Dragonite's Ice-type weakness that Ferrothorn takes neutral damage from. A spinblocker, such as the more offensive Gengar, sturdier Jellicent, or generally annoying Sableye, is useful to prevent these hazards from being spun away.</p>

<p>Wish and cleric support are quite helpful, as they aid with switching in and remove harmful status that Dragonite might have received through a misplay or by not having a Substitute up against a status user. The aforementioned Jirachi as well as Blissey and Chansey work well in this regard. If Thunder Wave is being used, something to trap and eliminate Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and other Steel-types is useful. Magnezone and Gothitelle are the best choices for the job, doing so with ease. If Flamethrower or Fire Blast is being used, paralysis support is heavily beneficial. The many times aforementioned Jirachi can provide this support as well as Celebi, Chansey, Blissey, and Ferrothorn. Cloyster and Mamoswine trouble this set, and for that matter, all Dragonite, so a Pokemon to beat them is a worthwhile investment. Ferrothorn is an excellent choice, providing other types of helpful support as well, but Rotom-W can beat both as well and has excellent type synergy with Dragonite. By now, you, the reader, have probably absorbed the fact that this Dragonite set requires much more support than other sets. It might seem like a waste of time, but in practice, with the needed support Dragonite will win games. It is all based on how much effort one is willing to put in to make it work.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Dragonite's movepool contains a plethora of other options. Although the lack of an Attack boost makes it an inferior alternative to Dragon Dance, Agility can turn Dragonite into an untouchable monster, with only Choice Scarf Pokemon with base Speed above 108 being faster after the Speed boost. Heal Bell can be used on a bulky set to allow Dragonite to function as a cleric or even to help set up Dragon Dance; however, Substitute is better for that and Dragonite's moveslots are cramped as it is, not to mention that it is incompatible with Multiscale thanks to being a move solely found on Dragonite in Pokemon XD. Haze can have some potential use to check setup sweepers, but Dragon Tail is superior due to it shuffling around the opponent and spreading entry hazard damage, though Haze might see the light of day on teams that struggle with last Pokemon setup sweepers. Tailwind can be used in a similar vein to Agility and to support the team, but once again Dragon Dance is superior for boosting the power of Dragonite's attacks. The gimmicky Icy Wind can be used to lower the opposing Pokemon's Speed and follow it up with a powerful attack, but an attacking move followed by Extreme Speed is a more effective strategy.</p>

<p>Although Superpower is superior in most cases, Brick Break can be used with more consistency and breaks through dual screens, but unfortunately it is not very powerful. Stone Edge is a very niche option solely viable to OHKO Volcarona without any chance of being burnt by Flame Body. Dragon Rush might seem to be a decent option over Dragon Claw for more power, but the much lower accuracy makes the increased power not worth it for most teams.</p>

<p>A mixed set composed of Draco Meteor, Fire Blast, Superpower, and Extreme Speed can be used to decent effect, but other sets are generally more effective and the set itself is inferior to Hydreigon and Salamence. It does have a few things that it boasts that separate it from the two, including that it lures in physical walls thanks to its most common set being Dragon Dance, Extreme Speed for priority, and lack of reliance on Outrage to hit special walls hard. Other than that, its inferior Special Attack and Speed make it a worse choice. Multiscale can't even save Dragonite here, with at maximum there being only one turn of it and most of the time it being already broken.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Due to Dragonite's extreme diversity it has no hard counters, but many checks exist. Faster Choice Scarf users, such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Kyurem, Salamence, Latios, Haxorus, and Thundurus-T, can outspeed and OHKO Dragonite once Multiscale is broken even if it has set up, with a few even being able to OHKO Dragonite through Multiscale. Landorus-T and Gyarados make decent switch-ins due to Intimidate and can take a neutral Outrage, and with a Steel-type teammate such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Heatran, or Forretress to sponge Outrages creates a core that Dragonite cannot hope to break. Steel-types and walls with high physical bulk that can switch in on Outrage, such as Jirachi, Heatran, Skarmory, Hippowdon, Ferrothorn, and Gliscor, beat most physical Dragonite sets, though even they must be wary of the proper coverage move that might be used specifically to beat some of these threats.</p>

<p>Slowbro and Tangrowth make excellent switch-ins thanks to Regenerator allowing them to make up for any mistakes, and outside of mixed and special sets Dragonite cannot OHKO either of them. Both are able to take a super effective coverage move and then switch out to something that resists it, while coming out of the scenario pretty much unscathed. The very rare Porygon2 makes a perfect counter, copying Multiscale with Trace and being able to take any hit not named Superpower. Quagsire is another rare Pokemon that can beat Dragonite, though the only set it beats is Dragon Dance all thanks to Unaware. Defensive Cloyster is another of these rare Pokemon that can beat Dragon Dance sets, having massive physical bulk as well as Icicle Spear which has four times its usual effectiveness and ignores Multiscale due to being a multi-hit move. Choice Scarf Ditto is another option but only actually beats and revenge kills the offensive Dragon Dance set. Stealth Rock is usually one's best line of defense against any Dragonite, negating Multiscale, and combining it with a sturdy spinblocker such as Jellicent will make Dragonite's life quite difficult. Attempting to figure out Dragonite's set early on is key, as its versatility makes it very difficult to deal with later in the game if its set is not yet known. Overall, the best ways to deal with Dragonite are revenge killing, priority, prediction, and something that can absorb a few hits, and most all teams worth their stuff have, at the very least, one of these methods in place.</p>
