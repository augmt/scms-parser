[Overview]

<p>As is befitting of its ability, Landorus-T is a Pokemon that is somewhat more intimidating than dangerous. When it was first announced, its massive 145 base Attack struck fear into the hearts of players everywhere, but in practice, it's not the harbinger of doom that everyone expected. Between a reduced 91 base Speed and the loss of Sand Force, Landorus-T is less offensive than its genie counterpart despite the former's higher Attack.</p>

<p>That said, it's not like Landorus-T is ineffectual in the metagame. Its solid 89 / 90 / 80 defenses are enhanced further by Intimidate, making it one of the few Pokemon capable of confronting Terrakion head-on, and it still has access to Swords Dance and Rock Polish to present a credible physical threat. On top of that, its massive Attack means that Landorus-T doesn't need much investment to pack a punch. Altogether, while it's not the offensive behemoth that was expected, it's still a solid Pokemon that has earned a well-deserved spot in the OU metagame.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive Pivot
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Hidden Power Ice
item: Leftovers
nature: Naive
evs: 248 HP / 172 Def / 88 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Admittedly, 145 base Attack doesn't scream for tons of defensive investment, but Landorus-T has all the tools it needs to play the role of offensive pivot and steal momentum away from opposing teams. Its solid bulk and Intimidate let it stop many offensive threats cold, including Terrakion, a Pokemon with few real offensive answers. It's also a stellar user of Stealth Rock, as Landorus-T's bulk lets it easily lay down Stealth Rock, and its power makes it hard to Taunt against. U-turn is stellar for stealing momentum away from opponents, and Earthquake and Hidden Power Ice combine to give solid offensive coverage as well as protection against some top threats, such as Terrakion and Dragonite.</p>

<p>Since Landorus-T's base Attack is so high, it can spend all of its EVs on bulk and Speed. 88 Speed EVs with a Naive nature allows Landorus-T to outrun a number of notable threats, including Adamant Dragonite, Modest Heatran, Jolly Breloom, and standard Tentacruel, all of which this set can dispatch with ease. The rest goes into bulk, which combines with Intimidate to give Landorus-T the ability to tank all but the most vicious of OU's most prominent physical attackers and respond in kind. Additionally, even without any investment in Attack, Landorus-T reaches 326 Attack, which is even more than a fully invested Gliscor with an Adamant nature can muster. It also has a solid 105 Special Attack, which gives a super effective Hidden Power Ice enough teeth to deal with targets like Gliscor, Garchomp, and Breloom.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Stone Edge is an option over Hidden Power Ice, as it works off of Landorus-T's significantly higher Attack stat. Notably, it deals much more damage than Earthquake to Kyurem-B, and is also incredibly useful for taking on Thundurus-T, which otherwise has carte blanche to set up on this set. However, its accuracy is a real letdown, and it hurts Landorus-T's efficacy against Gliscor, Tangrowth, and other Landorus-T. Additionally, without investing in Attack, Stone Edge misses some important KOs, especially Dragonite. Note that when using Stone Edge, a Jolly nature is preferred. If you already have a Stealth Rock user on your team and you're so inclined, Landorus-T is a great user of Gravity, since it can make use of Gravity Earthquake itself, as well as U-turn to other teammates who benefit from Gravity. Sleep Talk can also be used in place of Stealth Rock to make Landorus-T more effective against Breloom- Hidden Power Ice will likely OHKO it, and U-turn does solid damage while letting Landorus-T escape in lieu of a better counter. While Landorus needs every bit of its bulk, there are faster options. 104 EVs outspeed maximum Speed Tyranitar, while 144 EVs outspeed neutral-natured Heatran. Landorus-T can also opt for a more defensive spread, consisting of 252 HP / 252 Def for greater durability and the ability to survive some of OU's most vicious physical attacks.</p>

<p>This Landorus-T is a star on bulky offense, since it's a Stealth Rock user that most Magic Bounce users would never dream of switching into. As a result, it works best with offensive teammates, especially ones that profit well from offensive momentum. It's great for starting Volt-Turn, making it a great teammate for Rotom-W, which also provides Water and Ice resistances. Hydreigon is also a solid teammate for this reason, though a shared Ice weakness can be an issue. Since this Landorus-T lacks recovery, Wish support is highly suggested. Jirachi is one of the best teammates, since Landorus-T is immune to Ground, resistant to Fighting, and neutral to Fire. Vaporeon is also an excellent option, since it provides Water and Ice resistances, while Landorus-T is immune to Electric and neutral to Grass. Finally, Landorus-T's ability to force switches means that it makes great use of entry hazards.</p>

[SET]
name: Double Booster
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Rock Polish
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Stone Edge
item: Leftovers
nature: Adamant
evs: 48 HP / 252 Atk / 208 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Landorus-T's respectable bulk, useful ability in Intimidate, and key resistance to Fighting and immunity to Ground and Electric attacks make it a perfect candidate for a double boosting set. The main selling point of this set is its flexibility. With a Swords Dance boost, Landorus-T can rip through slower, more defensive teams while Rock Polish lets it clean up weakened, faster teams. Due to the aforementioned attributes, it is not uncommon for Landorus-T to grab multiple boosts and decimate unprepared teams. While Terrakion might seem like the superior double booster due to its higher Speed and access to STAB Stone Edge, Landorus-T sports a higher base Attack and has a much easier time setting up on common walls such as Forretress and Ferrothorn thanks to Intimidate and its lack of weaknesses to their STAB moves. Unlike Terrakion, Landorus-T is also not weak to common priority moves such as Mach Punch and Bullet Punch, although Ice Shard will quickly dismantle it.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread maximizes Landorus-T's Attack while allowing it to outspeed everything up to Adamant Toxicroak at +0 and common Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo and Latios after a Rock Polish. The remaining EVs are invested in HP for added longevity. If Toxicroak is not a concern, 184 Speed EVs is sufficient, with 24 EVs moved to HP for even more bulk. Alternatively, Landorus-T can simply opt to run max Speed with an Adamant nature to outpace Adamant Lucario and Timid Heatran without a boost at the cost of bulk.</p>

<p>As is the case for most sweepers, entry hazard support tremendously helps this set, as not only does Landorus-T naturally forces a lot of switches, but entry hazards also help it achieve OHKOs on some bulkier Pokemon. Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory are all fine choices in this regard. Although Earthquake and Stone Edge provides near-perfect coverage in OU, this set still has trouble muscling through several common walls, notably Gliscor, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Skarmory. Thus, partners that can soften or lure these walls are highly recommended. This includes common OU Pokemon such as Choice Band Terrakion, Expert Belt Jirachi, Ice Punch Lucario, and Technician Breloom, all of which naturally attract these Pokemon. Alternatively, Gothitelle can be used to eliminate them with Hidden Power Ice, Grass Knot, and Thunderbolt. Note that as the last Pokemon, Landorus-T can potentially beat Skarmory and Hippowdon as they can no longer phaze it.</p>

<p>Leftovers is the item of choice as the extra recovery is very helpful when setting up in front of walls or tanking priority moves. Alternative items for this set include Lum Berry, Yache Berry, Life Orb, and Earth Plate. Lum Berry is especially useful for setting up on Jirachi without fearing a Body Slam paralysis, as well as Will-O-Wisp or Scald burns from bulky Water types, which despite being super effective, can usually be tanked by Landorus-T outside of rain. Yache Berry can be used to take an Ice Shard from Mamoswine, Weavile, or Donphan trying to cut short Landorus-T's sweep. Finally, Life Orb and Earth Plate are useful items that boost Landorus-T's power, the former giving a more significant boost at the cost of HP. However, keep in mind that Leftovers is still the preferred item on this set as it also helps Landorus-T in checking and setting up on the premier physical attacker in the game, Terrakion, as well as other physical attackers such as non-Ice Punch Lucario and Jirachi.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Superpower
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Naive / Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>91 base Speed is plenty to warrant a Choice Scarf set, especially considering that unlike its Incarnate version, Landorus-T doesn't have to rely on weather for its physical damage output. Earthquake is basic STAB, though it's iffy on a Choice set due to its relatively common immunities. U-turn is also a given, as it's excellent for keeping momentum after Landorus-T forces a switch. Stone Edge provides solid neutral coverage, while Hidden Power Ice pounds Dragon-types, wards off Gliscor and opposing Landorus-T of all stripes, and can break down Tangrowth. On the other hand, Superpower is the best option against Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Bronzong. It also hits Air Balloon Heatran, which is useful. Remember to use the right nature&mdash;Naive for Hidden Power Ice and Jolly for Superpower.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Punishment is cute against some boosting Pokemon, and can be especially good against opponents such as Sigilyph and Calm Mind Latias, who become incredibly dangerous after a couple of boosts and need overwhelming power to take down. Explosion is an option, as it provides solid neutral coverage and plenty of punch as a last-ditch attack. Sleep Talk can also be used, as it allows Landorus-T to act as an impromptu Breloom check. EVs are very basic: Attack is maximized to provide maximum offensive power, and Speed is maxed with a Jolly nature to give Landorus-T enough Speed to outspeed +1 neutral-natured base 100s.</p>

<p>As with any Landorus-T set, this works best on bulky offense. Intimidate and good resistances give it plenty of chances to switch in, and as primarily a speedy hit-and-run Pokemon, it doesn't take a lot of support to make it effective. That said, Stealth Rock is always an issue, as it makes it harder for Landorus-T to switch in repeatedly. Starmie is the best spinner for the slot, as it provides crucial resistances to Water and Ice, and Landorus-T can switch into Electric attacks, especially Thunder, and come out unscathed. Wish support from Jirachi is also nice, as it helps Landorus-T leverage its bulk and ability to switch in.</p>

[SET]
name: Gravity
move 1: Gravity
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / U-turn
item: Life Orb
nature: Naive / Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>An unorthodox setup set, Gravity wrecks a lot of top Landorus-T counters. Without their Ground immunities, Pokemon such as Skarmory, Bronzong, Gliscor, and Balloon carriers lose the ability to switch into Landorus-T with impunity. On top of that, Stone Edge is 100% accurate in Gravity, temporarily making it not the worst move in the game. Finally, Hidden Power Ice blows up the few defensive Pokemon not crippled by Gravity, such as exceptionally bulky Gliscor, Tangrowth, and some other Grass-types. Alternatively, U-turn can be used to hit Grass-types and pass Gravity to other abusers on the team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Spikes provide double duty here, as not only does Landorus-T greatly appreciate the chip damage, but Gravity renders many normally unaffected fliers and levitators vulnerable to them. Ferrothorn provides a longer-lasting presence, can also spread Thunder Wave, and resists Water for Landorus-T. As icing, Ferrothorn gains 100% accurate Power Whip and Leech Seed, two moves it relies on to be effective.</p>

<p>Special mention here goes to teammates that can effectively make use of Gravity. Starmie comes to mind, as it can use Hydro Pump and Thunder with 100% accuracy without requiring Rain for the latter, and Starmie brings with it useful resistances. Mamoswine doubles up on the Ground-type threat, which is both a blessing and a curse due to shared weaknesses. Still, if Landorus-T can break through Ground resistances, Mamoswine can be a real terror. Between Earthquake with no immunities and 100% accurate Icicle Crash and Stone Edge, Mamoswine is a far more reliable offensive threat with Gravity in effect.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Landorus-T has some options that seem decent at first glance, but have some notable issues. With its power, Substitute gives Landorus-T a new dimension of offense, easing prediction and allowing it to throw around its exceptional neutral coverage. Bulk Up provides a more balanced approach to a boosting set, but Landorus-T would really appreciate more Speed to secure more Bulk Ups and be a more potent threat after boosting to pull this off effectively. Swords Dance is in the same boat, with its potency being very Speed-dependent. RestTalk has been a classic combination on Pokemon like Landorus-T, most notably Gyarados, but the changed sleep mechanics in Generation 5 have made it largely ineffectual. Rock Tomb is an option on some sets to make up for the lack of Speed, but its low Base Power makes it extremely unappealing.</p>

<p>An offensive EV spread can be used on the Offensive Pivot set for a more offensive Stealth Rock user similar to how Terrakion is often used. However, Terrakion is a more potent user of this type of set due to its superior speed, since it is more than capable of being an offensive threat without boosting moves or items due to its impeccable two-move coverage. Landorus-T's middling Speed makes it a bit more dependent on specialized spreads, Choice items, and setup moves to do its damage, and there's simply no room for Stealth Rock on an offensive set.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>There's really no such thing as a "hard counter" to Landorus-T. Skarmory comes closest, as most Landorus-T sets will be entirely unable to break through it, but Gravity turns that matchup on its head. Virizion can easily sponge Hidden Power Ice, but its mediocre physical defense means that it can't switch into too many Earthquakes throughout the match. Bulky variants of Latias can easily take a Stone Edge and recover off the damage, but U-turn is still unfriendly, as whatever follows Landorus-T is likely to force Latias out and prevent it from Recovering. Gliscor fears nothing except Hidden Power Ice, but is deathly afraid of said move, so make sure to scout out the set before sending Gliscor in headlong. Slowbro is probably the best counter, as it can take anything Landorus-T throws at it and recover it off passively with Regenerator. However, watch out for U-turn, especially if paired with a Pursuit user to eliminate Slowbro on the way out.</p>

<p>Landorus-T's Speed tier renders it much easier to confront offensively than its alternate form. Notably, Salamence outspeeds it and packs an Earthquake immunity, though Stone Edge and Hidden Power Ice do a number on it. Thundurus-T does the same, and will easily destroy Landorus-T with Hidden Power Ice. Jirachi can be hard to switch in, but it can eliminate it with Ice Punch or play flinch games in a pinch. Faster variants of Celebi often carry Hidden Power Ice, which also deals with Landorus-T with ease. Last, but certainly not least, Mamoswine can use Ice Shard to bypass Landorus-T's Speed advantage and take it out. It can also Icicle Crash against bulkier sets, which Landorus-T is unlikely to survive.</p>
