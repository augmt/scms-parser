[Overview]

<p>While Kingdra has taken quite a few steps back in BW with the Drizzle + Swift Swim ban, it still remains a potent threat due to its ability to counter rain teams. With rain-boosted Water-type moves and Swift Swim in hand, Kingdra can outspeed and decimate opposing rain teams by turning Politoed into a massive liability. Rain teams are often stuck with the difficult choice of cutting off a major source of their power by refraining from bringing out Politoed early or risking getting destroyed by Kingdra. Despite being an absolutely terror for rain teams, it isn't seen as much as one might expect because it competes with the many other OU Dragon-types for a spot on a team. It has a hard counter in the extremely common Ferrothorn and it is somewhat weak without rain support. It has a useful quadruple resistance to Fire and Water, which makes it a handy check to both powerful sun threats such as Victini and rain threats such as Keldeo and Choice Specs Politoed. One should also not discount its bulk, as Kingdra can take common attacks, such as Terrakion's Close Combat, quite nicely. Overall, while Kingdra isn't the best Pokemon in the world, it stands tall as the ultimate counter to rain teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set makes great use of Kingdra's offensive capabilities. In the rain, Kingdra is essentially a faster Life Orb Latios, boasting similar Special Attack with an insanely powerful Water-type STAB, enabling it to do something Latios can only dream of doing: sweep with its most powerful move. To put this into perspective, very few Pokemon in OU aren't 2HKOed by either Hydro Pump or Draco Meteor. Kingdra is adept at disrupting weather teams due to its ability to set up rain at any time. However, the limited turns of rain in conjunction with a Life Orb puts Kingdra on two timers; Kingdra does not last very long, so you must make the most of the time it has.</p>

<p>When it comes to choosing a STAB move, you need to make a choice between Hydro Pump and Surf. A difference of 30 Base Power might not seem like much, but it makes a significant difference in practice as, accounting for rain and STAB, Hydro Pump has 270 Base Power and Surf 213. For this reason, Hydro Pump is recommended despite its tendency to miss: it punches massive holes in just about everything, 2HKOing even Ferrothorn with some prior damage. There goes Kingdra's biggest "counter"! If the accuracy really bothers you, by all means use Surf, but prepare to be disappointed by the lowered damage output.</p>

<p>Draco Meteor is the key to Kingdra's success, though just one use of it ends its sweep. That debilitating factor is beside the point, however, when you take into account its ability to 2HKO most bulky Water-types. Hydro Pump just cannot break bulky Water-types, especially Jellicent, and the goal of this Kingdra is to hit as hard as possible in the limited time it has; thus, Draco Meteor fits perfectly. Heck, you don't even have to go for two Draco Meteors if you're worried about missing or being even more vulnerable to set up; you can choose to use Dragon Pulse followed by Draco Meteor for the 2HKO. That way, Kingdra's second move will still hit hard if you pick something else.</p>

<p>Finally, the last slot is a toss-up between three moves. Just remember, it's not some filler move you'll never use. Surf might seem like the craziest idea to even consider pairing with Hydro Pump, but it gives you the best of both worlds: power and accuracy. When you don't need the power of Hydro Pump, you can go for Surf, and vice versa. Additionally, Surf gives Kingdra a reliable move with which to sweep late-game. Ice Beam has three main benefits: firstly, it lets Kingdra 2HKO Celebi, Amoonguss, and other Grass-types; secondly, it reliably KOes Landorus-T and Gliscor outside of rain; thirdly, it takes down Salamence and Dragonite without the need to use Draco Meteor. The final option is Dragon Pulse, which is similar to Surf in that it is a more reliable alternative to Draco Meteor. It is extremely useful for times when Kingdra needs to hit Water-types but doesn't want to render itself helpless in the turns following. However, keep in mind that a resisted rain-boosted Hydro Pump is just as powerful as a neutral STAB Dragon Pulse, so it's all for the accuracy.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs allow Kingdra to outrun Choice Scarf Latios in the rain and Jolly Breloom, Adamant Dragonite, and Adamant Gyarados outside of it. The HP EVs provide an optimal number for taking Life Orb and entry hazard damage. Dropping the Speed EVs for bulk is a decent option; specifically, 176 Speed EVs lets Kingdra outrun Choice Scarf Garchomp in the rain. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is also viable to allow Kingdra to outspeed more Pokemon without a Swift Swim boost, but it comes at the cost of Draco Meteor never OHKOing Keldeo. As for the item, Life Orb is far preferred for the much-needed power boost, but there are other choices if you want Kingdra to survive longer. Leftovers stands out due to providing passive recovery, but it leaves Kingdra a bit lacking offensively. Splash Plate is another option if you want survivability but power on Kingdra's main Water-type STAB. The difference in power is still present in Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse, but that's a sacrifice you will have to make.</p>

<p>There are two more options for the last moveslot: Hidden Power Fire and Signal Beam. As previously mentioned, Kingdra's worst enemy is Ferrothorn; however, you'll notice that Ferrothorn has a double weakness to Fire. This makes Hidden Power Fire a decent option to catch Ferrothorn off guard, but there are two issues: it doesn't hit anything else hard and is counter-productive with rain. For Hidden Power Fire to surprise Ferrothorn and do a good amount of damage to it, rain must not be up. Recall how Kingdra relies on the speed and power boosts from rain to accomplish much of anything? Yeah, this is pretty much the sole reason Hidden Power Fire is not a top pick for the last slot, but it is significant enough not to deter use. Signal Beam is an option to hit Celebi hard, but that's about it.</p>

<p>Teammates are needed for just about every Pokemon to be successful, and Kingdra is no exception. First, you're going to want other fast sweepers that benefit from the removal of weathers other than the one they prefer. You're also going to want a way around Ferrothorn. Magnezone, Magneton, or Gothitelle make the best course of action to deal with it. After you get around Ferrothorn, you'll also need a way to remove Blissey, Chansey, and other specially defensive threats. These Pokemon are typically handled well by Fighting-type Pokemon. Keldeo is the best Fighting-type teammate, as Secret Sword demolishes Kingdra's counters and Keldeo has an extraordinarily powerful Hydro Pump of its own to weaken threats, which sets the stage for Kingdra to come in and clean up. Physical Fighting-types, such as Terrakion and Breloom, can also work. Scizor can also beat Chansey and Blissey, and furthermore can checkmate Grass-types, such as Celebi and Amoonguss, that are a nuisance for Kingdra to deal with. Thundurus-T can do the one thing Kingdra cannot: break walls. Its immunity to Thunder Wave and resistances to Grass and Steel give Thundurus-T the ability to set up on Kingdra's worst nemesis, Ferrothorn; it can also break bulky Water-types with ease. Generally, you're going to want multiple ways to defeat bulky Grass- and Water-type Pokemon, as they are major threats to Kingdra. Last but not least, Kingdra is ruined by entry hazards due to how quickly they stack up with all the other damage Kingdra takes throughout the course of a match. The solution is Rapid Spin support, which can be provided by Starmie or Tentacruel&mdash;both of who also benefit from rain.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The main issue other Kingdra sets have is the need to waste a turn setting up. While the boost obtained in that turn is certainly appreciated, it also leaves Kingdra open to its opponent's attacks. How do you fix this issue? It's simple; just throw on a pair of Choice Specs! With Choice Specs, Kingdra is able to go out easily and attack, but not have anything to lose by switching back out. It isn't on any timer and hits like a freight train. This immediate offensive presence surprises foes that expect Kingdra to spend a turn setting up and not damaging them. Additionally, it lifts the burden on Kingdra to sweep. Instead, Kingdra can fulfill a role as a supporting attacker, hitting hard early- to mid-game and relying on its resistances to Fire and Water as a pivot; after that, it can sit back and watch the credits roll as its teammates finish off the opposing team. If Kingdra manages to survive that long, it can even do that itself.</p>

<p>The first two moves are there for power. Every good Choice Specs user has a powerful STAB move or two, and Kingdra is no exception. With fantastic coverage together, little can stand in Kingdra's way. If you see a Pokemon that resists one move, most of the time you can pick the other, it's that simple. Hydro Pump is also useful to dismantle rain teams. However, both Draco Meteor and Hydro Pump have debilitating drawbacks, specifically an awful Special Attack drop and imperfect accuracy. While they are excellent moves to punch holes for most of the game, when late-game comes around, these drawbacks make them undesirable choices. The final two slots provide that reliability. Basically, pick a STAB move and Ice Beam. Ice Beam is needed to 2HKO specially defensive Celebi and do a ton to Amoonguss, while the STAB move is for reliable late-game cleaning. Surf is usually preferred because it hits many common threats hard and is quite powerful in rain, but Dragon Pulse has perfect neutral coverage against all foes bar Steel-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs enable Kingdra to outrun Jolly Breloom and Cloyster, while a Modest nature gives it a chance to OHKO Dragonite through Multiscale, as well as land OHKOs on Venusaur, Magnezone, Keldeo, Skarmory, and bulky Starmie, and a 2HKO on physically defensive Ferrothorn after Spikes damage. However, a Timid nature is also viable as it allows Kingdra to Speed tie with Modest Hydreigon and revenge kill Adamant Haxorus. To reach this Speed benchmark, move the HP EVs to Speed. Without 252 EVs in Speed, you are better off with a Modest nature, plain and simple. Anyway, as you should know by now, Ferrothorn is Kingdra's worst enemy. With Choice Specs, Hidden Power Fire would actually do quite a bit to it. However, the move fails to damage specially defensive Celebi significantly and does pittance in rain, the favored weather of both Ferrothorn and Kingdra, which makes removing Ferrothorn a job best left to Pokemon specialized to do so, such as Magnezone.</p>

<p>Choice Specs Kingdra is a top-notch rain counter, though its inability to set up rain on its own can be a hindrance at times. Consider using Pokemon that can set up rain the old-fashioned way, such as Tornadus, who has access to priority Rain Dance and can double as a special attacker, or Bronzong, whose massive bulk usually enables it to set up Rain Dance reliably; the latter can also easily bring Kingdra into battle with Explosion. Keep in mind that Choice Specs Kingdra is setup bait for the likes of Volcarona, Cloyster, and SubCM Jirachi after having used Draco Meteor or Ice Beam. Specially defensive Rotom-W can deal with all three to an extent, while Nasty Plot Thundurus-T, Swords Dance Scizor, Hippowdon, Tyranitar, Choice Specs Magnezone, and Garchomp can deal with Jirachi specifically. Additionally, Thundurus-T and Scizor, as previously mentioned, have the ability to set up on Ferrothorn. The last item you need for Kingdra to work at its best is entry hazards, which discourages switching. Ferrothorn is your best bet to set them up.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A classic set from DPP, Substitute + Dragon Dance Kingdra is still as effective as ever. Kingdra has plenty of special attacking prowess, but physical sets are just as effective due to how amazing Dragon Dance is as a boosting move. Aside from the Attack boost, the lack of reliance on rain for a Speed boost is huge. The basic premise of the set is to set up on defensive Pokemon, weakened Pokemon, or a Choice-locked Fire- or Water-type attack. Defensive threats, such as Jirachi and Jellicent, are the easiest to take advantage of. Between Leftovers and Substitute, Kingdra can laugh off their weak attacks and status moves. After Kingdra has set up a couple of Dragon Dances, it is all set to sweep. Substitute makes it far easier to set up, blocking status, Trick, and revenge kills. The offensive moves are pretty obvious as well, consisting of only Kingdra's STABs, which are all it really needs. Waterfall is reliable, has a nifty chance to flinch, and brings rain teams to their knees. Outrage is for when Waterfall just isn't enough; it has ungodly power after a Dragon Dance or two and hits most Pokemon that resist Waterfall hard. Be sure to use discretion with Outrage, however, as being over-reliant on it against Water-type resistors will inevitably lead to a Steel-type such as Skarmory coming in and putting Kingdra in its place.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread enables Kingdra's Substitute to survive a Body Slam from specially defensive Jirachi as well as outspeed Jolteon after one boost, Choice Scarf Latios after two, and Jolly Breloom with none. The 40 HP EVs lessen Life Orb recoil and the remaining EVs are placed in Attack. With this spread, Kingdra achieves a perfect balance between bulk, power, and speed.</p>

<p>Despite all the pros of physical Kingdra, there is also one major con--it is much easier to wall. Armed with only its STABs, Kingdra needs Steel-types removed to get its job done. Ferrothorn can break Kingdra's Substitutes, cripple it with status, and take any attack that might come its way. Scizor forces Kingdra to use Substitute lest it take massive damage, and Skarmory can take any attack bar Waterfall after multiple boosts. Additionally, Steel-types make it basically impossible to use Outrage effectively, as they can absorb the hit and force Kingdra into confusion, stopping it right in its tracks. Having one of Gothitelle, Magnezone, or Magneton is essentially a requirement if you want Kingdra to sweep, as they can trap and KO Steel-types. Gothitelle can cripple other walls&mdash;including but not limited to Steel-types&mdash;with Taunt and Trick, but Magnezone and Magneton are immune to Toxic and resistant to the Steel-types' common attacks. Magnezone is bulkier, but Magneton has more Speed and so can double as a revenge killer. Pokemon that lure out and weaken Steel-types, such as Haxorus and Kyurem-B, are also appreciated as partners. Be sure to get rid of Toxic Spikes (among other entry hazards), as poison limits the time Kingdra has to set up, especially alongside Substitute. Dragon Dance Kingdra is best fit on a team with other offensive Pokemon, such as Thundurus-T, Dragonite, and Volcarona, due to its susceptibility to revenge killing and being worn down. It also greatly appreciates Rain Dance support, as that provides Kingdra with a hefty boost to Speed that can come in handy if it can't nab a Dragon Dance.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The biggest problem Dragon Dance Kingdra suffers from is being worn down. ChestoRest is a tried-and-true combination that gives Kingdra the ability to fully heal itself once with no repercussions. It tosses aside worry of being hit by status while boosting, which eliminates a large pool of Kingdra's counters. Furthermore, it boasts the ability to take some hits while setting up and be at full health afterwards to stop what few revenge killers can deal with a boosted Kingdra. Kingdra has the resistances it needs to set up easily against most Pokemon that cannot hit it too hard. The goal of this set is to boost as many times as possible, heal up, and sweep with Outrage and Waterfall, which provide all the coverage Kingdra needs in most cases. One thing you must not do, however, is attempt to sweep with only one or two boosts; this Kingdra doesn't have the power necessary to do so.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs allow Kingdra to, as all Dragon Dance sets do, outrun Jolteon after one Dragon Dance and Choice Scarf Latios after two. With the investment in bulk, Starmie's Ice Beam has only the slimmest chance to 3HKO, giving Kingdra the opportunity to set up all over it. Beware of Psyshock, however, which easily 2HKOes. The leftover EVs are placed into Attack to boost the power of Kingdra's attacks with an Adamant nature to supplement. These EVs are designed to give Kingdra the ability to obtain multiple boosts.</p>

<p>For all the neat things this Kingdra set does, one it does not is beat Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn still walls Kingdra to hell and back, so consider packing Magnezone, Magneton, or Gothitelle to trap it. You should also carry a Fire- or Fighting-type or two to have another way around Ferrothorn and other Steel-types, since they tend to stop this set cold. The final threats you must be prepared for are Perish Song and Whirlwind users; you should eliminate them immediately. Politoed is the most common Perish Song user, and Skarmory and Hippowdon the most common Whirlwind users. Thundurus-T, Celebi, Roserade, and Breloom are optimal choices to deal with these threats. Lastly, you can't go wrong with giving Kingdra Rain Dance support, as the Speed increase and boost to Water-type moves is invaluable.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Dragon Dance Kingdra usually attempts to obtain multiple boosts, that doesn't bode well for fighting more offensive teams. Such teams most often have Pokemon that can KO or completely cripple Kingdra as it foolishly attempts to set up. The goal of this set is to fix that issue; it has powerful attacks and a Life Orb in order to do so. This gives Kingdra the ability to hit everything hard, including physical walls that the other Dragon Dance sets struggle against. Examples of foes that are no longer a problem are Skarmory, Scizor, and last but not least Ferrothorn; many more can be defeated after a boost or two.</p>

<p>This set's wide coverage is the main reason it is so good. The biggest decision you will have to make is between Waterfall and Hydro Pump. Waterfall is more accurate, has a chance to flinch, and can be boosted by Dragon Dance, but Hydro Pump hits Skarmory much harder and can OHKO Hippowdon; it all comes down to what you want Kingdra to beat. The second attack is not nearly as difficult a choice. You should use Hidden Power Fire unless for whatever reason you don't care so much about beating Ferrothorn; in which case replace it with Draco Meteor, which gives Kingdra an alternative to Outrage against Water-resistant foes, such as Breloom, Starmie, Slowbro, Latios, and Hydreigon, among many others.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs guarantee that Kingdra's +1 Outrage OHKOes 4/0 Dragonite through Multiscale and has a decent chance to also OHKO bulkier variants; they also provide Kingdra with enough Speed EVs to outrun Jolteon after one Dragon Dance, and Breloom, Mamoswine, and Adamant Gyarados before. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Attack to power up Kingdra's special moves. Life Orb is far preferred for the power boost, but Lum Berry is also an option to combat status users such as Ferrothorn, though the power difference is noticeable and Kingdra has difficulty stacking boosts to make up for said power difference. A specially based set of a similar nature is also possible, with Dragon Dance being used mostly for its Speed boost and to lure physical walls. Having a boosted Outrage to use when Kingdra is at -2 from Draco Meteor is also nice. An EV spread of 16 Atk / 252 SpA / 236 Spe with a Rash nature, Hydro Pump, Outrage, Draco Meteor and a fourth move of your choice for the attacks, and a Life Orb would be the set you would want.</p>

<p>Kingdra is best used with offensive Pokemon such as Swords Dance Scizor and Swords Dance Lucario, who benefit from the weakening of certain walls and otherwise-annoying Pokemon. Kingdra doesn't usually run special attacks with Dragon Dance, so this set can effectively lure them in and KO them. If using Draco Meteor over Hidden Power Fire, be sure to pack a Magnezone, Magneton, or Gothitelle to trap Ferrothorn. Even if running Hidden Power Fire, however, it is ideal to have an alternative way around Ferrothorn, for example Terrakion or Keldeo, due to Ferrothorn's sheer popularity in rain. Something for Choice Scarf Salamence, who can easily revenge kill Kingdra at +1, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, or Bronzong, is also needed. Finally, insurance against other common revenge killers, such as Terrakion and Keldeo, is advised, as the lack of defensive investment makes Kingdra easily revenge killed.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Kingdra can run quite a few more sets, but none are as effective as any of the ones listed. A mixed Rain Dance set is viable, but a rain-boosted Waterfall isn't what it used to be in a metagame filled with physically bulky Steel-types and Water-immune Pokemon. The main draw would be to beat special walls, but mixed Kingdra can't even beat Chansey; all you would really gain is a weaker Hydro Pump. A mono-attacking set with Outrage as the attack could work in a similar vein to CroCune, but it also has trouble sweeping, and being asleep, even with Sleep Talk, is undesirable with BW's sleep mechanics. Additionally, having one's only attack being Outrage is undesirable. A Double Dance set with both Dragon Dance and Rain Dance is yet another set that seems great on paper, as it theoretically allows Kingdra to use whichever setup move is best for the situation. However, there is really no need for that, as both Rain Dance and Dragon Dance are amazing tools and don't need to be used in tandem; rather, you're just wasting a moveslot. You can run a Dragon Dance Kingdra set with Disable and Protect or Substitute over conventional moves, with Outrage as the sole attack. Disable would prevent foes from 2HKOing Kingdra with a move if it is their only move to hit Kingdra, provided Kingdra is slower, but it's not worth being left with Outrage as Kingdra's only attack, and Protect or Substitute is needed to sweep.</p>

<p>Bounce might seem a usable move to spread paralysis, but it provides no additional coverage and is really better used by Gyarados, as Kingdra lacks the STAB to make good use out of it. Sniper can be used over Swift Swim on any of the sets other than Rain Dance if you want to use permanent rain to boost Kingdra's STAB Water-type attacks, but in doing so you've pretty much defeated the purpose of using Kingdra. Kingdra's viability relies on the fact that it can effectively combat rain due to Swift Swim; without Swift Swim, you might as well use another Dragon-type.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Clad in spiked armor, Ferrothorn is the bane of Kingdra's existence. Kingdra's Hydro Pumps and Draco Meteors do pittance while Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs edge Kingdra ever closer to death. Power Whip breaks Kingdra's Substitutes and Thunder Wave can completely cripple Kingdra. Ferrothorn can set up entry hazards in the time Kingdra is out. If rain is up, forget Hidden Power Fire, which only 2HKOes anyway; no Kingdra can score an OHKO. Ferrothorn's partner in crime&mdash;Jellicent&mdash;is just as good a counter, taking negligible damage from every attack in Kingdra's arsenal other than Draco Meteor. Jellicent can reply back with a burn, or worse, Taunt. Jellicent can Recover stall Draco Meteor, so the only way Kingdra will win is if it hits Jellicent with Dragon Pulse as it switches in and follows up with a Draco Meteor.</p>

<p>Gastrodon can take special sets and cripple non-Substitute Dragon Dance ones with Toxic or burn. Another is defensive Politoed, who can take on Dragon Dance variants fairly well, as it can force Kingdra out with Perish Song. The final is Rotom-W, who can cripple Dragon Dance variants with Will-O-Wisp, and if specially defensive, it can handle special variants adequately enough. The major issue that arises is Substitute + Dragon Dance and ChestoRest Kingdra, who doesn't have to worry about status and thus turns these three Pokemon into setup fodder. Notable bulky Grass-types include Celebi and Amoonguss, specially defensive Celebi and Amoonguss can handle special Kingdra fairly well, and Amoonguss can Spore all variants except Substitute ones. Choice Specs and even Life Orb Draco Meteors do tons to both bulky Water- and Grass-types though, so be wary of that.</p>

<p>Of course, you can always take the easy way out and use a revenge killer. Well, it's actually not that easy with Kingdra. Kingdra has some considerable bulk; it can tank some attacks, such as Choice Scarf Terrakion's Close Combat and Choice Scarf Keldeo's Secret Sword. For this reason, you will need a Choice Scarf Dragon-type to revenge kill Kingdra. Latios is preferable, as Kingdra needs two Dragon Dances to outpace it. You can also use Salamence, who has the benefit of turning Kingdra into a liability with Moxie. The only other way you're revenge killing Kingdra with a non-Dragon-type is with Terrakion, both of whom can only shorten and not end Kingdra's life. Also, remember that you're simply not revenge killing Kingdra in rain, so you'd better have a decent answer to it. The Choice Specs set is much easier to revenge kill, as it has no way of boosting its Speed unless you have rain. If you do have rain, try to force it out before bringing out Politoed. The only way to revenge kill Kingdra in rain is with powerful priority, such as Technician Breloom's Mach Punch, Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed, and Life Orb Mamoswine's Ice Shard, and they only KO if Kingdra's been weakened.</p>
