[Overview]

<p>Bouffalant is, without a doubt, a very unique Pokemon. It boasts a great base 110 Attack, impressive bulk, and an astounding afro. Bouffalant even gets its own signature move, Head Charge, allowing the buffalo to do high amounts of damage with its tremendous tresses, further powered up by its ability: Reckless. With an immense physical movepool, Bouffalant is a very dangerous threat. However, such a glorious afro hinders Bouffalant's Speed; base 55 Speed is nothing to celebrate at all, but with the proper team support, this well-groomed buffalo can wreak havoc.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its ample movepool, a single weakness, great 95 / 95 / 95 defenses, and immunity to Ghost-type attacks (as well as to Grass-type attacks if you're using Sap Sipper), Bouffalant is simply screaming to wear a Choice Band over those lustrous locks. Head Charge is the STAB move of choice, OHKOing almost all who dare to switch in, but Return can be used instead to preserve Bouffalant's bulk. Wild Charge is used in the second slot to nail bulky Water- and Flying-types, and is even more powerful with the help of Reckless. Earthquake in the third slot is your best bet against Electric-, Steel-, and Rock-types, especially if you're using Sap Sipper. Earthquake will also nail Chandelure on the switch. Payback and Megahorn are both good attacks to use in the last slot. Payback hits Ghost-type Pokemon hard, while Megahorn is mainly for bulky Grass-types. Payback is best used with Reckless, as Grass-types are less of an issue: the Reckless boost almost guarantees that Head Charge will OHKO max HP Shaymin and Celebi after Stealth Rock. If you decide to use Sap Sipper, Megahorn is the superior option to OHKO almost every Grass-type that Bouffalant switches in on.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb can be used for the freedom to change attacks, but the recoil detracts from the value of Bouffalant's bulk, and the power from Choice Band is too good to pass up. A Careful nature can be used to help Bouffalant take special hits better. Trick Room is a great option to remedy Bouffalant's underwhelming Speed. Thrash got a huge boost this generation, now having 120 Base Power. It can be used in the first slot, but it's generally not a good idea to be locked into a Normal-type move without the ability to switch.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Leftovers can be used for more survivability, which works well with Bouffalant's bulky nature. Stone Edge is an option to hit Bug- and Flying-types hard. Bouffalant also has access to Swords Dance, but its poor excuse for a Speed stat means that most of its counters can just outspeed it and kill it before it gets a chance to set up.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bouffalant isn't very easy to counter due to the gargantuan power of Head Charge. However, defensive or bulky Steel-types and Ghost-types do a pretty decent job of halting it. Skarmory and Jellicent can come in on anything except Wild Charge and set up on Bouffalant or whittle it down with STAB Brave Bird / Scald. Even with the power of such a massive mane, Bouffalant has trouble taking down Steel-types. Ghost-types in general can switch into Head Charge and force Bouffalant out. Mach Punch from Conkeldurr isn't fun to take, but after a Sap Sipper boost, Bouffalant will always kill max HP Conkeldurr with Head Charge, and Mach Punch will only do 52.2% max (with Iron Fist and max Attack).</p>
