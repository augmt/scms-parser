[Overview]

<p>While Arcanine, with its impressive base stats and workable movepool, played a significant role in last generation's UU, fifth generation has given the original fire pup some unique tools to establish itself as a force in OU. With access to Flash Fire, Arcanine is effectively able to switch into many common threats and add authority to its mighty Fire-type STAB with both physical and special attacks. In sunlight, which plays an active role in the current metagame, Arcanine's Fire-type attacks become absurdly powerful while its main source of recovery, Morning Sun, regains up to two-thirds of its maximum HP. Defensive tools such as Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp help the dog's middling base 80 defenses as well.</p>

<p>Yet, Arcanine still faces some of the same issues that hindered its performance in the past. Stealth Rock and Spikes still hit hard any Arcanine hoping to switch in for an easy Flash Fire boost. Its movepool, although expanded with options such as Wild Charge and Close Combat, is still rather limited and predictable. Nevertheless, when played with some strategy and foresight, Arcanine is able to hit hard against prevalent Steel-type threats, while surviving hard-hitting blows with its own decent bulk.</p>

[Set Comments]

<p>This set takes full advantage of Arcanine's new tools in the fifth generation. Flare Blitz is its STAB move of choice, running off Arcanine's solid base 110 Attack-- only surpassed by Darmanitan in terms of common OU Fire-types. Under sunlight and with a Flash Fire boost, Flare Blitz transforms Arcanine into an offensive juggernaut who will not only dent foes that resist it, but also nullify all Fire-type threats trying to abuse the sunlight. Close Combat hits hard on both Blissey and Tyranitar while Wild Charge can catch Water-types, such as Jellicent and Tentacruel, off guard. The last moveslot can be filled with Extreme Speed if you lack a priority move elsewhere in your team. Crunch, on the other hand, increases Arcanine's chances of taking out threats that resist its STAB, namely Latios and Chandelure.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>While Fire Blast could be considered if Arcanine is having issues with physical walls, Flare Blitz is generally the optimal choice for a Fire-type move. It makes use of Arcanine's better Attack stat while hitting more consistently than Fire Blast and its lackluster accuracy. Morning Sun is also an option, helping Arcanine to recover from residual damage; refrain from using Morning Sun along with Choice Band, however. At base 95 Speed, Arcanine doesn't face much competition with Pokemon with lower base speed, so Adamant is preferred to provide more offensive presence. In terms of abilities, Intimidate is superior, as it helps Arcanine survive longer against physical threats. Flash Fire is worth considering if your team suffers from a Fire-type weakness, as the boost helps Arcanine hit even harder. The given EVs maximize Arcanine's offensive force by allowing it to hit as quickly and powerfully as possible. This set succumbs to damage quickly, so Wish-passers and Rapid Spin users make for solid teammates to increase Arcanine's lifespan.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Arcanine has the potential to run a Special Attacker set, with its usable base 100 Special Attack stat. Options include Fire Blast, Hidden Power Grass or Electric, and Dragon Pulse. However, there are many other Fire-types who fulfill this role better, including Infernape and Victini. Toxic is possible if you're looking for team support, although Arcanine normally likes to hit hard with its wide attacking movepool. Solar Beam is a good way to attack Gastrodon and Quagsire, but its dependence on the weather makes it subpar. Besides, Grass-types will be able to take on bulky Water-type threats a lot better under sunlight.</p>

<p>Morning Sun is a great option for taking care of residual damage, but its usefulness depends significantly on the weather. Flame Charge, Agility, and Howl all go towards boosting Arcanine's stats, but don't do it many favors; its time is better spent attacking opponents with its vast movepool.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Thanks to new moves, such as Wild Charge and Close Combat, Arcanine can take on bulky Water-types and Rock-types, respectively. However, the flame dog faces many challenges that will hinder its longevity. Entry hazards and sandstorm hinder Arcanine by adding on even more residual damage. Speaking of extra damage, the recoil from Flare Blitz and Wild Charge certainly won't do any favors, particularly with Life Orb. Once Arcanine has dealt out a few hits and sustained some recoil, it can easily be taken out by quicker threats such as Gengar and Latios. In the same vein, almost anything that outspeeds Arcanine will likely kill it. Mach Punch Conkeldurr and Fake Out / U-turn Mienshao have the power to bring its HP down quickly.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Arcanine faces issues with being walled. Bulky waters, such as Jellicent and Tentacruel, are difficult to 2HKO, even with Stealth Rock support. Especially troublesome are Water/Ground types, who resist Fire-type attacks while laughing at Wild Charge. Without Stealth Rock support, Arcanine will fail to OHKO Physically Defensive Skarmory, even with a combination of Life Orb and STAB Flare Blitz.</p>

<p>To alleviate some of these issues, certain teammates can be utilized. Defensively speaking, Bronzong and Rotom-W make excellent partners as they are immune to Ground-type attacks and resist another of the types to which Arcanine is weak. In return, Arcanine covers their Fire- and Grass-type weaknesses respectively. Ferrothorn makes for a great defensive comrade with its ability to combat rain-based teams, while Flash Fire Arcanine especially appreciates the Fire-type attacks aimed at it. Offensively, Arcanine works well with Grass-types to combat bulky waters. Rain also hurts Arcanine's chances to OHKO with Flare Blitz, so Ninetales and Sunny Day users can alleviate stress.</p>
