[Overview]

<p>BW brought a lot of new offensively oriented Pokemon into the game. In that bunch of Pokemon is Archeops. Archeops is gifted with a sky-high 140 Attack stat, and a well above average base 112 Special Attack. Couple that with a fast base 110 Speed, and you have one potent sweeper on your hands. Though Archeops was granted a gift from the heavens with those base stats, it was also cursed with an awful ability in Defeatist. This ability makes Archeops lose 50% of its attacking power if its HP goes to 50% or below; not to mention he has crippling weaknesses to almost all types of priority and Stealth Rock. There are plenty of ways to work around those weaknesses, though. Archeops can run sets from a physical sweeper to a special sweeper and even a mixed sweeper. If used correctly, Archeops can be a force to be reckoned with this generation.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is probably Archeops's most used set, and for a good reason. With a base 140 Attack stat, which, unboosted, reaches 415 using a Naughty nature and max Attack EVs, nothing is going to want to take even a neutral hit from this guy, let alone a super effective hit. With Acrobatics boosted thanks to Flying Gem, Archeops is capable of 2HKOing even Ferrothorn, which is very impressive. Stone Edge and Earthquake make up the infamous EdgeQuake combination, granting Archeops nearly perfect coverage, hitting the entire metagame for neutral damage, barring Bronzong, Breloom, and Virizion. The fourth moveslot is filled with Hidden Power Ice, as with its base 112 Special Attack stat, Archeops has a 100% chance of 2HKOing Gliscor. Naive is the preferred nature over Naughty because it allows Archeops to Speed tie with Pokemon such as Latios and Gengar who share its base 110 Speed. The given EVs are essential to max out Archeops's Speed and Attack stats. This set gives Archeops a lot of raw power, letting it rip through many unprepared teams.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Since Archeops is weak to Stealth Rock, you absolutely need a Rapid Spinner on your team if you want to use Archeops to its maximum potential and avoid activation of Defeatist. Donphan is a very good teammate to Archeops because it can Rapid Spin Stealth Rock away and covers the Rock-type weakness. If Archeops happens to drop below 50% health, you can just pass a Wish and Archeops will gain some, if not all, of its HP back. Jirachi is a great Pokemon to pass Wish as it resists Bullet Punch, one of Archeops's biggest weaknesses. Hidden Power Ice isn't going to do a lot of damage to Skarmory, so Magnezone is also a very good teammate for Archeops, trapping Skarmory with Magnet Pull and proceeding to KO with Thunderbolt. Other special attackers such as Starmie, Reuniclus, and Heatran are also good partners to break through physical walls. Above all, you really have to make sure that Archeops doesn't take a too many hits, ensuring that Defeatist does not activate.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Sweeper
move 1: Stone Edge
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Hone Claws
item: Leftovers / Expert Belt
nature: Naive / Naughty
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set works similarly to the Acrobatics set. Stone Edge is in the first slot because it is Archeops's main STAB move, hitting many Pokemon Earthquake can't hit super effectively. Earthquake is in the second slot to hit Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-type Pokemon super effectively. The third slot on this set is dedicated to Hidden Power Ice to get past Gliscor, who would otherwise wall this set to oblivion. Thanks to its base 140 Attack and base 110 Speed stats, Archeops can be a good user of Hone Claws, meriting the final moveslot, boosting Archeops's accuracy and Attack by one stage. The item choice is a tricky one; Leftovers can keep Archeops above the 50% health line more easily, while Expert Belt can give it an extra boost to its super effective attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Rapid Spin support should always be considered when building your team around Archeops due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Donphan is a very good teammate, providing this while covering Archeops's Rock-type weakness. Wish support is also very beneficial to Archeops; this can be provided by the likes of Jirachi, who resists Bullet Punch. Magnezone is also a very good teammate for Archeops, taking out Skarmory, who otherwise takes Archeops nicely. Any priority moves can beat this set pretty easily. Archeops is weak to Bullet Punch and Aqua Jet, both putting Archeops below 50% health, so watch out for those. special attackers are key to letting Archeops sweep because they can break through physical walls with ease. A Naive nature should be used if you are using your fourth slot for Hone Claws.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Life Orb could be considered on both sets, but it can reduce Archeops to below 50% health very quickly. If Stealth Rock is on the field, it will only get three attacks in before Defeatist activates, not accounting for any hits taken. Sitrus Berry could be considered as an option on the Physical Attacker set because once Archeops gets below 50% health, the Berry will activate and hopefully bring Archeops's HP above 50%. This can be risky, though, because odds are that if Archeops is near 50%, the opposing Pokemon will be able to KO it. A Naughty nature can also be considered on the first set if tying base 110 Speed Pokemon isn't very important to you and you want the extra power that a Naughty nature brings. You should use Adamant over Naughty if you are not using Hidden Power Ice, because an Adamant nature does not lower Archeops's defensive stats. Crunch can be considered on both sets if you want to hit Ghost-types super effectively. Dragon Claw can also be considered to give you a reliable move to use against various Dragon-types such as Latios, Latias, and Haxorus, many of whom are outsped by Archeops.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The biggest problem that Archeops faces is priority. It is weak to Bullet Punch and Aqua Jet, and the main carriers of those moves are Scizor and Azumarill, who will both OHKO with a Choice Band equipped. Archeops is also weak to physically defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory and Bronzong. Archeops has virtually no way of breaking through these walls, so they will have to be dealt with by other means before attempting to use Archeops. Archeops has a weakness to Stealth Rock, which combined with its ability, Defeatist, allows it to switch in only two times before its ability is activated, making Archeops very frail indeed.</p>
