[Overview]

<p>Once the king of DPP OU, Heatran is still one of the best Fire-types in standard play. Versatility is one of Heatran's fortes, as can be seen by its ability to use a range of defensive, offensive, and supportive sets. A stellar Fire / Steel typing coupled with a great ability in Flash Fire gives Heatran some amazing resistances to Grass-, Ice-, Dragon-, and Bug-type attacks, and an immunity to Fire-type moves. Along with its acceptable 91 / 106 / 106 bulk, Heatran makes a great answer to some of OU's most powerful attackers, including Volcarona, Venusaur, and Scizor. With a mighty base 130 Special Attack and an exceptional movepool, Heatran's firepower is sure to leave a scorching impact.</p> 

<p>Unfortunately for Heatran, the prevalence of Drizzle Politoed makes it difficult to compete in a rain-soaked metagame. Powerful threats in Terrakion and Keldeo do not make life any easier, as their offensive prowess quickly extinguishes Heatran's flame. Moreover, the ubiquity of Ground-types, such as Dugtrio, takes quite a toll on Heatran's defensive potential, forcing it to maneuver carefully in battle. A lackluster base 77 Speed does Heatran no favors either, as it often finds itself being outpaced by most offensive teams and has a hard time sweeping. Though it has gathered quite a few foes in the transition to BW2, Heatran's ability to defeat sun teams single-handedly gives it quite the niche. It should be considered when building a team, as it can be both an invaluable team player or a menacing adversary.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its stellar resistances, acceptable bulk, and amazing coverage, Heatran's offensive set provides the best of both worlds in terms of power and bulk. Fire Blast is Heatran's best STAB, being the sweet spot between Overheat's power and Flamethrower's accuracy. Earth Power is a great coverage move that hits opposing Heatran while damaging Tyranitar and Terrakion. The choice of Hidden Power largely depends on what your team needs. With Hidden Power Ice and an Air Balloon, Heatran becomes an excellent check to some Dragon-types, easily OHKOing Dragonite after Stealth Rock. If Dragon-types are of little issue, Hidden Power Grass does well in simmering Water-type switch-ins, such as Starmie and Gastrodon. Due to Heatran's ability to force switches, it can find plenty of time to set up Stealth Rock to support its team. Toxic can be used to cripple Jellicent, a Pokemon that Heatran has difficulty breaking through. Taunt is also quite useful as it can stop annoying Custap Berry leads such as Skarmory and Forretress from setting up their entry hazards.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>While Leftovers seems counter-intuitive on an offensive set, the gradual recovery provided lets Heatran repeatedly come in and wall threats such as Scizor and not be worn down by its attacks and/or entry hazards. Air Balloon is another useful item that gives Heatran a temporary Ground-type immunity, allowing it to check some of OU's most fearsome attackers, such as Garchomp and Salamence. Do note that Air Balloon will pop if Heatran is hit by an attack, i.e. caution must be taken when using this item. Life Orb gives Heatran the ability to OHKO Mamoswine with Fire Blast; however, it wears Heatran out too quickly and is often inferior to either Leftovers or Air Balloon for that reason.</p>

<p>A Timid nature is best, as it allows Heatran to outspeed Breloom and Adamant Dragonite and OHKO them with Fire Blast and Hidden Power Ice, respectively. A defensive spread consisting of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Spe can be used to give Heatran more durability, though Heatran will be unable to outspeed key threats like defensive Gliscor and Adamant Dragonite. Will-O-Wisp can be used in the final slot to cripple incoming physical attackers such as Terrakion and Landorus-T. Flame Charge is also useful in patching up Heatran's middling Speed, which in turn gives it the opportunity to sweep late-game. When paired with Air Balloon, Flame Charge is an especially potent weapon against sun teams. Dragon Pulse and Roar both present interesting possibilities. Dragon Pulse lets Heatran do considerable damage to opposing Dragon-types, as well as having the added benefit of inflicting more pain to Hydreigon and Latias.</p> 

<p>Ninetales partners well with Heatran, as it is able to fend off Politoed's rain and power up Heatran's Fire Blast. With the support of Ninetales, Venusaur becomes a great offensive partner, as Venusaur has no difficulty setting up on bulky Water-types, while Heatran can check pesky Dragon-types. Just like Ninetales, Tyranitar can also keep the rain away, Tyranitar's Pursuit-trapping utility can also come in handy when dealing with Latios, Latias, and Chansey. Celebi and Jellicent form an excellent defensive core with Heatran, as all three of them can cover each other's weaknesses exceptionally well. Electric-types, such as Thundurus-T and Rotom-W, also make excellent partners for their ability to dispose of Water-types, such as Gyarados, and having great synergy in general. Physical walls such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon do well in taking on the plethora of Fighting- and Ground-types that force Heatran out. Just like Ninetales and Tyranitar, Hippowdon does well in keeping Politoed's Drizzle in check. Abomasnow is another weather inducer that pairs well with Heatran, by tanking Ground-, Electric-, and Water-type attacks aimed at it, while Heatran can take the Fire- and Bug-type attacks Abomasnow loathes.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its excellent set of resistances and great bulk, Heatran can halt powerful sweepers such as Venusaur, Volcarona, and Jirachi with ease. Lava Plume is Heatran's best defensive STAB, allowing it to spread burns while dealing acceptable damage. Protect allows Heatran to scout the opponent's moves and accumulate Leftovers recovery. Roar works quite well with entry hazard support, letting Heatran wear down its counters and simultaneously preventing setup sweepers, such as Latias and Volcarona, from doing much. Toxic goes hand in hand with Protect, allowing Heatran to stall out its enemy. Will-O-Wisp is quite useful in crippling incoming physical attackers such as Dugtrio, thus lessening the need for prediction when dealing with it. Last but not least, Stealth Rock can work if your team is in need of an entry hazard setter or a backup Stealth Rock user.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>To take full advantage Heatran's resistances, a specially defensive spread is most optimal. Speaking of alternative attacks, Flamethrower, Earth Power, Taunt, Substitute, and Torment are all acceptable options in the final moveslot. Heatran can run Flamethrower instead of Lava Plume so that it has a better chance of defeating Ferrothorn in the rain. Earth Power does well in OHKOing other Heatran and dealing respectable damage to Terrakion. Taunt can stop slower walls from phazing Heatran or its incoming switch-in, while Substitute works efficiently with Toxic Spikes down. Torment is a good option because it can render Choice-locked attackers useless. Sun teams often rely on Dugtrio to deal with Heatran; if your team is particularly weak to such teams without Heatran, consider utilizing Shed Shell for an effective second life against them.</p> 

<p>Heatran's lack of reliable recovery hurts its defensive potential, so it's best to pair it with Wish users such as Chansey, Blissey, or Vaporeon. Chansey and Blissey can pass bigger Wishes, but Vaporeon's typing synergizes better with Heatran. Other Water-types that work well with Heatran include Jellicent, who can cover Heatran's Fighting- and Water-type weaknesses, while Heatran can take Grass-, Ghost-, and Dark-type attacks aimed at it. If Heatran is not running Toxic, then Toxic Spikes support from Tentacruel or Forretress is recommended in order to better break down the opposing team. To make it easier for Heatran to stall, entry hazard users, such as Celebi and Forretress, who can provide Stealth Rock and Spikes support respectively, have great potential as teammates. Speaking of Spikes support, Roserade makes a great partner, as it can sponge any Water-type moves aimed at Heatran and set up either Spikes or Toxic Spikes. Finally, RestTalk Gyarados synergizes quite well with Heatran by being able to tank Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks and add more phazing shenanigans of its own.</p>

item: Choice Scarf
nature: Modest
evs: 112 HP / 160 SpA / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With acceptable Speed, good coverage, and a high Special Attack, Heatran's Choice Scarf set makes a good utility check to some of the metagame's most powerful setup sweepers, namely Jirachi, Volcarona, and Scizor. Overheat is Heatran's most powerful attack, capable of OHKOing Kyurem-B with entry hazard support, but Fire Blast keeps enough power to roast Alakazam and Lucario without the Special Attack drops. Earth Power is a good way to deal with opposing Heatran and Fire-type resists, such as Terrakion. Hidden Power Ice damages Dragon-types such as Garchomp, as well as Flying-types such as Tornadus in the rain. While it can't hit Garchomp as hard, Dragon Pulse does more damage to Latios, making it an appealing option. Finally, Flamethrower is Heatran's reliable STAB; while not as powerful as Overheat or Fire Blast, its perfect accuracy and consistency make it a great option to have late-game.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given spread allows Heatran to outrun Pokemon with base 120 Speed, such as Dugtrio and Alakazam while also improving Heatran's durability; for instance Life Orb Latios cannot OHKO Heatran with Surf even after Stealth Damage. As a revenge killer, Heatran can use a few specialized options to take on a different array of foes. Hidden Power Electric allows Heatran to revenge kill Adamant Dragon Dance Gyarados at +1. Hidden Power Grass fries Gastrodon; both give super effective coverage against most Water-types, particularly Starmie, making them strong potential choices.</p>

<p>Heatran is often prone to being setup bait when locked into certain moves, as its Choice Scarf leaves much to be desired in terms of overall damage output. To remedy this issue, powerful mixed attackers such as Kyurem-B and Thundurus-T make excellent partners for their ability to weaken the opposing team and dispose of troublesome walls, such as Chansey and Tentacruel. By weakening the opposition, there will be little concern when Heatran is locked into a resisted attack, as the enemy combatant will be too weak to take another. Residual damage provided by entry hazards from the likes of Skarmory or Ferrothorn also does well in breaking down the opposing team while simultaneously discouraging switches. Weather inducers such as Tyranitar and Hippowdon provide some much-needed residual damage, courtesy of their ability, Sand Stream. Speaking of weather inducers, Ninetales does well in powering up Heatran's Fire Blast with Drought, making it easier to sweep.</p>

evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When used in conjunction with Sunny Day, Heatran can take advantage of its signature move, Magma Storm, to help sun teams win the weather war. The premise of the set is that when Heatran can predict a slower opposing weather inducer switching in, it can hit them with Magma Storm. From there, Heatran can Sunny Day before the opponent can attack. Politoed's STAB moves will no longer hit for super effective damage, and Tyranitar will no longer receive a Special Defense boost from its sand. This sets up Heatran to use a chargeless Solar Beam, either OHKOing or 2HKOing the opponent before Heatran can be 2HKOed in response. In this event, Ninetales can be brought in after Sunny Day wears off, guaranteeing permanent sunlight so long as the opponent does not have an alternative source of weather. It is important to note, though, that Heatran will not always win against an opposing weather inducer. Outside of a Magma Storm miss, Choice Scarf Politoed can outspeed and OHKO Heatran before it can use Sunny Day. Choice Scarf Tyranitar will similarly outspeed Heatran and 2HKO with Superpower or Stone Edge, or flat-out OHKO with Earthquake. However, these two variants are easy enough to deal with using specialized team support. Be wary of Shed Shell users as well. Fortunately, this set functions as a powerful special attacker even outside of its trapper role, allowing it to serve multiple uses and rarely become a liability. It can also trap Pokemon that operate independently of weather should sun be up, such as Jellicent and Starmie. It should be noted that while this Heatran is put to best use on sun teams, it can also be used to good effect on teams utilizing other weather or no weather at all, in order to combat certain weathers.</p>
 
<p>The first three moves are of course all staples, but the last moveslot is dependant on team support. Earth Power is the default move, because without it it is impossible to harm opposing Heatran. This set functions by forcing switches to opposing Pokemon that resist its powerful Fire-type STAB, so if the opponent has a Pokemon that can switch into this set with absolute impunity, then it largely ceases to function. Because of this, Earth Power is absolutely necessary, with one exception: a partnered Dugtrio. Dugtrio's unparalleled ability to easily dispose of opposing Heatran is an incredible asset for this set; it not only frees up the fourth moveslot as Earth Power is no longer a strict necessity, but it also effortlessly disposes of Choice Scarf Tyanitar, one of the Pokemon that can give this set trouble. Just be wary of the rare Choice Scarf or Shed Shell Heatran, as the two of them must be carefully played around. If your team is particularly weak to Shed Shell Heatran it is advisable to use Earth Power even if Dugtrio is being used as support. Hidden Power Ice allows Heatran to become a trapper of Dragon-types as well. Adamant Dragonite, for example, will always have its Multiscale broken if it switches into Magma Storm, and is then outsped and easily OHKOed with Hidden Power Ice. Should sun be up, Latios can also fall victim to Heatran, being 2HKOed by either a double Magma Storm or a Magma Storm followed up by a Hidden Power Ice, while Surf fails to OHKO Heatran. Hidden Power Ice also gives Heatran a reliable way to hit Landorus-T, Thundurus-T, and Breloom without relying on the shaky accuracy of Magma Storm.</p>
 
[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Air Balloon gives the most utility when being used on a sun team, as they can have difficulties in handling Ground-type attacks. Air Balloon allows Heatran to take on the likes of Landorus-T more reliably, and also lets Heatran act as a more effective Dragon-type trapper. For example, most Garchomp switching into Magma Storm in the sun will be 2HKOed, while it is unable to OHKO Heatran with Earthquake first because of the Air Balloon. The Air Balloon also prevents Dugtrio from trapping Heatran. This, combined with Magma Storm's ability to OHKO Dugtrio through Focus Sash, makes it difficult for Dugtrio to handle Heatran. Chople Berry is another viable item, making it far easier for Heatran to deal with opposing Tyranitar, and giving it the ability to tank Breloom Mach Punches and weaker Keldeo Secret Swords. Leftovers is another option for longevity, as Heatran's immunities and resistances are very useful for a sun team. An alternative EV spread of 56 HP / 252 SpA / 200 Spe can be used if Heatran is running Hidden Power Ice, as it no longer needs to attempt to outspeed opposing Heatran. The bulk increase is minimal but makes Leftovers an appealing option for both greater longevity and feigning a defensive set, which can more easily lure in Politoed. Taunt is also an option in the fourth slot to shut down a trapped Blissey's recovery, allowing a partnered Dugtrio to tag-team it and take it out with little trouble. Just be sure that two Seismic Tosses will put Dugtrio in maximum Reversal range when building your team.</p>
 
<p>Stealth Rock support is very important for this set in order to ensure the deaths of opposing weather inducers; with it and Magma Storm's recoil the opponent will effectively be taking Heatran's hits with only 81.5% health, and Stealth Rock pushes the combination of Magma Storm and Solar Beam agaisnt some weather inducers into the "pseudo-OHKO" range of Solar Beam. It is especially important for dealing with Choice Specs Politoed and Choice Band Tyranitar, as Heatran does not have the time to 2HKO them with Solar Beam. This set is of course designed to support sun teams, so generally this set should be partnered with Ninetales. The support of Dugtrio or Wobbuffet can be invaluable for dealing with the few variants of weather inducers that give this set trouble. Pokemon that can easily abuse permanent sun, especially Venusaur and Volcarona, greatly appreciate this set's support. This set can struggle with some threats, such as fast Pokemon that resist Heatran's Fire-type STAB and can outspeed and destroy Heatran. For example, Terrakion in the sand fears little from this set, so consider packing a partner such as Scizor or Dugtrio that can handle it. Though it can be very daunting to switch into this Heatran, it can also be forced out fairly easily after it has accomplished its job. Be sure to have partners that can take a Ground- or Fighting-type attack, such as Landorus-T or Latios. Additionally, be careful that the opponent does not have a Pokemon that can change the weather back before sacrificing this set or Ninetales, as a well-timed Rain Dance from Tornadus or Starmie can undo all of your efforts.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Heatran's offensive and defensive prowess often forces switches; this makes a Substitute set workable. Substitute allows Heatran to attack without worry of being OHKOed by powerful attacks such as Terrakion's Close Combat. Substitute also works strategically by lessening the need for prediction when dealing with powerful Choice Specs or Choice Band users, such as Keldeo. Fire Blast pairs well with Substitute by providing a handy safety net in case it misses. Earth Power destroys opposing Heatran and dents offensive Tyranitar. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ice is quite useful in destroying Dragon-types such as Garchomp. Toxic and Will-O-Wisp both provide unique utility in tandem with Substitute. Toxic is great for crippling bulky Water-types, which would otherwise wall Heatran. On the other hand, Will-O-Wisp cripples most physical attackers, helping Heatran maintain its Substitute.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>There are a few other ways to tweak this set. Hidden Power Grass is one way, being more effective against squishier Water-types or those that can easily cure themselves of status, such as Starmie. Heatran can also invest more in HP or Defense for a more durable Substitute, but doing so does not really add much to the set and the loss in power or Speed will make Heatran noticeably less proficient offensively.</p>

<p>Status absorbers such as Blissey and Chansey are quite the problem for this set; Conkeldurr does well in slaughtering the two threats, while it can even take advantage of their status afflictions to acquire a Guts Attack boost. Tyranitar and Ninetales benefit from Heatran's presence, given its capability to wear down Politoed with Toxic and thus win the weather war. Pokemon that can take advantage of Heatran's ability to spread status benefit from it too. Latias in particular can set up Calm Mind on burned physical attackers, while Substitute + Calm Mind can stall out a poisoned Jellicent. Defensively, Celebi partners perfectly with Heatran, as they both cover each other's weaknesses to a tee.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Ever thought about walling Heatran? Well, you can throw those absurd notions out the window against this set. With a Choice Specs equipped, Heatran's offensive capability goes through the roof. Overheat is Heatran's most powerful move, capable of OHKOing Dragonite with sun support after Stealth Rock. Fire Blast is slightly more reliable and is able to 2HKO Chansey and Blissey with entry hazard and sun support. Earth Power destroys Terrakion and opposing Heatran, and 2HKOes offensive Tyranitar. The choice between Dragon Pulse and Hidden Power Ice depends on which threats you want to hit harder. Hidden Power Ice hits Dragonite and Garchomp; however, Dragon Pulse OHKOs Kyurem-B and offensive versions of Latios and Latias after Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Grass works well in demolishing Water-types such as Jellicent and Starmie. While Flamethrower might seem redundant, there are times when the move's reliability comes in handy, as Overheat tends to be more one-off and Fire Blast has accuracy issues.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Modest nature is best, as it gives Heatran enough firepower to demolish Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Chansey on the switch. Timid can also be useful, as Timid Heatran can outspeed neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon, such as Dragonite. In terms of alternate spreads, Heatran can use 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 Def with Eruption and a Quiet nature. Though the Speed loss and Eruption's mechanics make it dependent on the support of Trick Room users like Cresselia or Reuniclus, Rapid Spin users, such as Tentacruel, and Wish passers, such as Chansey.</p> 

<p>Stealth Rock support is highly recommended, as it gives Heatran the ability to achieve many OHKOs it otherwise would not on threats like Dragonite, Latias, and Jellicent. Dugtrio and Forretress are both good partners that can set up Stealth Rock; Dugtrio can remove Tyranitar while the latter can even lay Spikes. Ninetales support is also recommended, with the sun, Heatran has the capability to 2HKO the most durable special walls, Chansey and Blissey. With the help of this Heatran's wallbreaking capabilities, Chlorophyll sweepers, such as Victreebel and Venusaur, will have no difficulty taking out weakened teams. For the same reason, Agility Thundurus-T also makes an acceptable partner.</p>

[Other Options]

<P>Heatran's above-average movepool gives it a few other moves to work with. Ancient Power and Stone Edge can both be used to defeat Volcarona and Gyarados; however, Heatran is often strapped for moveslots as is, so these options are generally unappealing. Flash Cannon can be used on the Choice Specs set, allowing Heatran to 2HKO defensive Tyranitar and OHKO Terrakion in the sand, but it offers relatively poor coverage outside of that. Heatran's once famous Torment set consisting of Substitute, Protect, Torment, and Lava Plume is also a decent option, though the influx of offensive teams in the tier makes it difficult to use. Finally, Magma Storm can be used outside of the Sunny Day set; however, those two moves generally work more effectively together. Grass Gem is also a good option on the Sunny Day set, as it allows Heatran to more efficiently take out Politoed and Tyranitar with Solar Beam.</p> 

[Checks & Counters]

<p>Chansey and Blissey are the best checks to Heatran, being able to wear it down with Seismic Toss and recover off any damage. Both Chansey and Blissey only have to fear a sun- and Choice Specs-boosted Fire Blast. Offensive Gyarados makes a great check as it can take all of Heatran's attacks and use it as setup bait, but Gyarados must be wary of Toxic or Will-O-Wisp, as either status affliction will cripple it. So long as Stealth Rock is off the field, RestTalk Gyarados makes a much more solid check. As long as it lacks Hidden Power Grass, other bulky Water-types such as Jellicent, Starmie, Slowking, and Gastrodon are also great counters, as they can easily force Heatran out with their Water-type STABs; however, Toxic can cripple all but Starmie. Defensive Latias is a great check given its ability to use weaker Heatran as setup bait, though it must watch for offensive Heatran's coverage moves or an incoming Toxic.</p>

<p>While Politoed has trouble taking a Hidden Power Grass and dislikes Toxic, its ability to summon rain allows Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Mamoswine to survive Heatran's Fire-type attacks and retaliate. In a similar vein, defensive Tyranitar makes a great check, as the Special Defense boost provided by the sand allows it to beat Heatran in most situations. If Heatran lacks Earth Power or Solar Beam, Tentacruel works well too, being able to 2HKO Heatran with a rain-boosted Scald while taking very little from its other attacks. So long as Dragonite's Multiscale is intact, it can take any attack from Heatran and OHKO with Earthquake (watch out for Air Balloon variants).</p> 

<p>Dugtrio is quite possibly the best offensive check. Thanks to Dugtrio's Arena Trap ability and its STAB Earthquake, it can quickly dispose of Heatran. Keep in mind, however, that while Dugtrio's Focus Sash enables it to survive any attack from Heatran (provided that it's at full health), Magma Storm or Will-O-Wisp will prevent it from doing its job. Terrakion, Keldeo, and Garchomp are all excellent checks, as they can tank Heatran's main STAB and retaliate appropriately, although they must all watch out for Heatran's coverage attacks. Azumarill can take Heatran out with Aqua Jet; however, it must be cautious when switching in on either Heatran's coverage moves or a Will-O-Wisp. It might have difficulty switching in, but Choice Scarf Landorus-T makes a good answer to Heatran for its ability to always outspeed and OHKO Heatran. In a similar vein, Breloom makes a decent check, as it can OHKO offensive Heatran after Stealth Rock with Mach Punch. Ironically, Heatran can even check itself. Air Balloon versions of Heatran take very little from its own coverage attacks and can OHKO with Earth Power.</p> 

<p>While it is an unconventional way to deal with Heatran, Pokemon that Heatran normally defeat, such as Volcarona and Venusaur, can lure Heatran out and nail it with Ground-type attacks. At +1, Life Orb Volcarona can OHKO Heatran with Hidden Power Ground, while Venusaur can invest in 88 Attack EVs to OHKO Heatran with Earthquake after Stealth Rock.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Heatran's Dream World ability is Flame Body. This might be useful on some defensive sets in order to buff up Heatran's Defense. In addition, Flame Body prevents the rare, but incredibly annoying, Trace Gardevoir and Porygon2 from setting up on it. However, Flash Fire is usually the better option, as otherwise, Heatran would be taking neutral damage from Fire-type attacks. The more resistances, the better.</p>
