[Overview]

<p>Meloetta is a Pokemon that is sure to keep its opponents on their toes. There aren't many Pokemon that can boast being able to change into a completely different Pokemon with a single move, and Meloetta is able to make great use of its ability to do this. This is especially effective because many of Meloetta's counters, such as Blissey, Chansey, and Tyranitar, are beaten by Meloetta-P. But Meloetta's effectiveness doesn't stop with a mixed set. Thanks to its naturally high special defense and HP and its expansive movepool, Meloetta is able to run effective Calm Mind, all-out attacker, and specially defensive sets as well. Its Normal typing might seem useless at first, but the Ghost immunity that comes with it makes Meloetta a great counter to the likes of Gengar and Alakazam. To top it all off, Meloetta is gifted with one of the best abilities in the game: Serene Grace. This means that its Psychic, Shadow Ball, and Focus Blast all have twice the chance to lower Special Defense and it can support the team with a 60% paralysis chance Thunder.</p>

<p>However, Meloetta's Defense is lacking, its low Speed means that it will have trouble against faster offensive teams in its Aria forme, and it has to waste an entire moveslot and turn to switch into its Pirouette forme. The turn it uses to set up can be costly, as it means that you won't be able to hit opposing Pokemon with the appropriate coverage move on the switch. And because Relic Song is a Normal-type move, the forme change can be blocked by Ghost-types, giving them a free switch-in and losing momentum for Meloetta. However, these flaws are dwarfed by the sheer versatility and power that Meloetta can bring to the team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Few Pokemon can run a mixed attacker set as effectively as Meloetta. Relic Song allows Meloetta to change into its Pirouette forme, a Normal / Fighting type with base 128 Attack and Speed. Common switch-ins to Meloetta, such as Blissey, Chansey, and Tyranitar, are destroyed by a STAB Close Combat from Meloetta-P. Conversely, Pokemon such as Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Gliscor that switch in on Meloetta-P might find themselves on the wrong end of a Thunder or Hidden Power Ice. Furthermore, one cannot ignore the importance of shifting from a merely decent base 90 Speed into a blazing fast base 128 Speed. Changing into Meloetta-P as the opponent sends in a faster Pokemon&mdash;such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar or, if it runs Ice Punch, Choice Specs Latios or Calm Mind Latias&mdash;can turn the tide of a match. In fact, one of the biggest draws of the relic mixed set is its unrivaled ability to apply pressure to the opponent. With the constant fear of Meloetta changing formes, the opponent will have to choose between sending in Tyranitar to take a Hidden Power Ice or Landorus-T to take a Close Combat. The mind games that Meloetta creates give its user a major advantage. It is also important to note that prediction is key when using this set. Using Relic Song on a switch can be an effective way to keep momentum without actually switching; however, using Relic Song when the opponent stays in can be costly, as the opposing Pokemon can take advantage of Meloetta being in the wrong forme.</p>

<p>Close Combat is a useful move for late-game cleaning and is Meloetta-P's main STAB move. It smacks Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Blissey, which are full stops to Meloetta's Aria forme. Meloetta's coverage moves really come down to what your team needs. Thunder is an amazing option for Meloetta in the rain, as Serene Grace doubles its paralysis chance to 60%. This allows Meloetta to support the team while also keeping on the offensive. Thunder can even keep Latios and Latias, common switch-ins to Meloetta, at bay, because they fear the paralysis that might come with taking a hit. On the other hand, Shadow Ball can hit Celebi, Latios, and Latias on the switch for decent damage, and the 40% chance of lowering their Special Defense can come in handy to prevent them from Life Orb stalling Meloetta or trying to set up on it. The final moveslot largely determines what Pokemon Meloetta can KO and how it goes about doing so. With Hidden Power Ice, Meloetta can lure and OHKO Landorus-T and Gliscor, regardless of what forme it finds itself in. This can later clear the way for Meloetta-P to clean with Close Combat. Psychic is a secondary STAB option for Meloetta, hitting Tentacruel, Breloom, and Gengar for super effective damage. Finally, Ice Punch is a decent option to help Meloetta-P clean late-game. After a Relic Song, Choice Specs Latios, Calm Mind Latias (guaranteed 2HKO only with Stealth Rock damage), Landorus-T, and Gliscor will all be OHKOed by an Ice Punch coming from Meloetta-P. The choice between Hidden Power Ice and Ice Punch comes down to whether letting Meloetta wallbreak or clean up is more important to the team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>In order to effectively use Meloetta, it's important to know exactly how to play it, as it is used differently than one might expect. At the beginning of the match, Meloetta is going to spend most of its time in its Aria forme blasting holes in the opponent's team with powerful Life Orb-boosted special attacks. This might even enable it to feign the Calm Mind set, which could be used to Meloetta's advantage later by allowing it to surprise the opponent by transforming. Then, in the later stages of the game, Meloetta should transform and clean up with Life Orb-boosted STAB Close Combat. The only time using Relic Song is advisable early- or mid-game is when a switch to a dedicated special wall is obvious, i.e., a switch to Blissey, which can be smashed by Close Combat. This is why Meloetta appreciates entry hazard support so much. It will be forcing switches and bursting holes in the opponent's defenses, so the extra damage will tend to rack up. It also makes it easier for Meloetta-P to sweep late-game once everything has been weakened by multiple switch-ins to Spikes and Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>Meloetta's EVs let it outspeed Adamant max Speed Landorus-T in its Aria forme and Alakazam and Dugtrio in its Pirouette forme. Special Attack is maxed and the leftover EVs are placed in Attack because max Attack isn't as necessary as Special Attack, as Meloetta will be in its Aria forme more often. U-turn is a decent option to use, as it lets Meloetta switch formes and then grab momentum and also hits possible checks such as Latias for super effective damage.</p>

<p>Meloetta appreciates entry hazard support, so Pokemon that can set both Spikes and Stealth Rock generally make excellent partners. This includes Skarmory and Forretress, the latter of which also provides spinning support. Ferrothorn gets special mention because it not only sets up entry hazards but also works very well on rain teams, where Meleotta fits perfectly to use Thunder and support the team with paralysis. In the same vein, Politoed makes a good partner simply because it can provide the rain support that Meloetta needs. Latios and Latias can be very troublesome for Meloetta, as they resist Close Combat, Psychic, and Thunder and can do serious damage with Draco Meteor or set up with Calm Mind. Because of this, Tyranitar works well with Meloetta, being able to Pursuit trap both. However, Meloetta doesn't appreciate the added damage that comes from Sand Stream, as it is already taking Life Orb recoil. Scizor can also work well with Meloetta--especially on rain teams--and has the added bonus of U-turn, which can force more switches and wear down the opponent more easily. Because Meloetta has to change formes to effectively hit both physically and specially, it isn't the most efficient wallbreaker. Pokemon like mixed Salamence, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon can all break down defensive cores much more easily, so their support is much appreciated. Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Tyranitar also make for great partners, such as Latios, Latias, and U-turn Celebi, as Meloetta can easily lure it in and dispose of it with a Life Orb Close Combat. Finally, while Meloetta's special bulk is impressive, its Defense is rather lacking, so physical walls such as Landorus-T make great partners. Landorus-T, like Scizor, can provide U-turn support as well.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>At first, one might think that the role of Calm Mind sweeper is better handled by Reuniclus or Jirachi; however, Meloetta has quite a few advantages that distance itself from these other Pokemon. Meloetta was practically made for a Calm Mind set with its already amazing base 128 Special Attack and Special Defense combined with an interesting typing that lets it set up on common special attackers such as Alakazam and Gengar. It doesn't have four-moveslot syndrome like Jirachi does, as Psychic / Psyshock, Focus Blast, and Shadow Ball are all Meloetta needs to succeed. While Reuniclus has Magic Guard and Recover to keep it going, Meloetta has a much better Speed and isn't walled by Sableye because it can run Shadow Ball effectively. Meloetta also has the highest Special Attack of all common Calm Mind users, meaning that after a boost, it hits its opponents hard.</p>

<p>The choice between Psychic and Psyshock depends on what your team struggles with most. Psychic is preferred because it is more powerful and has an increased chance of lowering the opponent's Special Defense. However, Psyshock can hit Blissey and other Calm Mind Pokemon harder, so it is a viable alternative. Choosing Psyshock does leave Meloetta out of luck against certain defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon though, as Focus Blast only has a 30% chance to 2HKO specially defensive Hippowdon at +1 and it can simply Whirlwind Meloetta out. Focus Blast lets Meloetta dent Tyranitar and OHKOes all variants at +1. It also hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Heatran hard. The combination of Meloetta's Speed, bulk, and power make it an excellent check to many slower, bulkier teams, as it can boost to +1 or +2 and then sweep. Pokemon such as Jellicent, Gengar, Forretress, and Celebi (without Perish Song), are all setup bait for Meloetta, as it can usually grab one or two Calm Mind boosts on them.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Thunder can be used over Shadow Ball, as it hits Jellicent even harder than Shadow Ball and Meloetta sets up on Gengar regardless. It also get an increased chance to paralyze opponents thanks to Serene Grace, which comes in handy against offensive teams. However, this requires Politoed to provide rain support. It also means that Latios, Latias, and Celebi will now check Meloetta, depending on their sets. Signal Beam is another option over Shadow Ball, as it does much more damage to Celebi, which is useful because it prevents Celebi from stopping a sweep with Perish Song. It also deals comparable damage to Latios and Latias; however, it leaves Meloetta more vulnerable to Jellicent, and losing out on the 40% chance for a Special Defense drop that comes with Shadow Ball is unfortunate. Hyper Voice is an alternate STAB option over Psychic. Its Normal typing gives Meloetta decent neutral coverage, but it does miss the super effective coverage that Psychic gives on Pokemon such as Keldeo and Tentacruel.</p>

<p>Meloetta does very well against slower, bulkier teams. However, it does struggle to deal with offensive teams, so faster, hard-hitting Pokemon such as Keldeo and Terrakion make fine partners, compensating for the Speed that Meloetta lacks. Because Meloetta lacks any form of recovery outside of Leftovers, Wish support can be useful to make sure it is able to stay around all match. Jirachi can provide said support and also set up Stealth Rock. Like any sweeper, Meloetta appreciates as much entry hazards support as it can get, so Stealth Rock and Spikes setters such as Skarmory, Forretress, and Ferrothorn work very well with Meloetta. These Pokemon in particular work well with Meloetta, as they cover its lackluster Defense, protecting it from physical attackers.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Meloetta can opt to use an extra move instead of Calm Mind to give it the coverage its expansive movepool can provide. Its main STAB move is very important because it dictates what will counter it. Psychic is the stronger of the two, and it has a nifty 20% chance to lower an opponent's Special Defense, but it leaves Meloetta walled by Blissey and Chansey. Psyshock can deal more damage to both of these Pokemon, but it leaves Meloetta vulnerable to physical walls such as Landorus-T and Gliscor. Focus Blast beats Tyranitar and Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Skarmory if Meloetta lacks Thunder. Unlike the Calm Mind set, Signal Beam is the preferred option to hit Psychic-types as Meloetta can't boost to beat Celebi. The difference in damage between Signal Beam and Shadow Ball on Latias and Latios is negligible, while Signal Beam also boasts the ability to 2HKO Celebi. The last slot largely depends on what move was chosen in the first slot. If Psychic was chosen, then Thunder is strongly recommended to hit specially defensive Jellicent, which otherwise takes little-to-no damage from any of Meloetta's other moves. If you can't afford to save a teamslot for Politoed or prefer Psyshock, then Hyper Voice is the better option to take out Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Landorus-T, which can easily tank a Psyshock.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Meloetta has decent Speed, but it isn't enough to effectively deal with offensive teams, so paralysis support is always welcome. This will let it use its coverage and power more easily. No matter what moves Meloetta chooses, it all always be walled by something, so its teammates need to cover those weaknesses. Depending on its moveset, Pokemon that can beat Blissey, Chansey, Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Gliscor, Jellicent, and Gengar are going to be needed. Mixed Jirachi fits the bill, being able to beat all of these Pokemon bar Jellicent. If Thunder is used, then Politoed is a necessary teammate. However, Tyranitar can be useful to Pursuit trap Jellicent and Gengar. Breloom gets special mention, as it can beat Blissey and Chansey with Mach Punch and also beat Jellicent and Hippowdon with Bullet Seed. Entry hazard setters are also appreciated, as they can aid Meloetta in sweeping, especially because Meloetta is a Pokemon full of surprises and forces a lot of switches. U-turn is an option over Signal Beam to help grab momentum and hit Latios and Latias on the switch, making them easy prey for Pursuit trappers, but it is a waste of Meloetta's coverage and Special Attack. Hidden Power Ice can hit Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon, but it isn't a very powerful option and usually other moves are more useful.</p>

[SET]
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Perish Song

evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although its appearance might suggest otherwise, Meloetta is surprisingly bulky. With base 100 HP and 128 Special Defense, it has enough bulk to take onslaughts from common special attackers such as Alakazam, Gengar, and Calm Mind Jirachi. With its interesting typing and access to Perish Song, Meloetta is also one of the best counters to Reuniclus in the game. When considering Meloetta as a special wall, one must understand the advantages that it has over other standard walls such as Jirachi, Blissey, Chansey, and Celebi. The first is Perish Song, which lets it scare out setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Jirachi and Latias. The second is that it hits surprisingly hard even with no investment due to its impressive base 128 Special Attack. Psyshock gives Meloetta a move to hit Gengar and Calm Mind Keldeo, making it one of the few special walls that can take down Calm Mind Keldeo itself. Thunder Wave is yet another useful support move, providing paralysis support for the rest of the team and crippling special attackers such as Alakazam and Latios. In the last slot, U-turn can be useful, as Meloetta tends to force out special attackers and U-turn prevents it from killing the team's momentum. It also prevents Meloetta from being trapped by Wobbuffet, Gothitelle, and Dugtrio after using Perish Song. However, using Focus Blast instead means that Meloetta won't be completely walled and subsequently Pursuit trapped by Tyranitar.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Meloetta has several other support options to choose from, but has only four moveslots to put them in, making most of them inferior. Heal Bell can be a useful option over Thunder Wave to keep Meloetta and the rest of the team status-free, but usually paralysis support is more useful and other Pokemon fill the role of cleric better than Meloetta due to its lack of recovery. Light Screen can also be used, but Meloetta already has great Special Defense and doesn't really need the boost. Toxic can also be used to wear down opposing walls, but Meloetta can't really Toxic stall very well because it can't recover damage taken. While Meloetta does have great special bulk, its physical bulk isn't nearly as good, so physically defensive teammates such as Landorus-T and Skarmory make excellent partners, covering the threats that Meloetta can't. Because Meloetta has no recovery, Jirachi makes a good partner as it can pass Wishes.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Meloetta can run a decent Substitute + Calm Mind set with Psychic and Focus Blast, but this is usually done better by Jirachi and Latias and Calm Mind Meloetta needs to play to its advantages if it wants to separate itself from other Calm Mind users. A Choice Specs set with Psychic / Hyper Voice / Shadow Ball / Focus Blast seems effective, as base 128 Special Attack is impressive and Meloetta's Speed is high enough to support it. However, locking Meloetta into any of those moves is undesirable, as they all have types that are immune to them. A mixed set with Relic Song and Work Up can boost both of its attacking stats, but Meloetta already has to waste a turn to switch formes, so finding an additional turn to boost is difficult and usually isn't worth it. Physically, Meloetta can use a Hone Claws set that can switch to Meloetta-P and then boost its attack to sweep. It can also use a Relic Song set with three physical attacks and play exclusively as Meloetta-P. However, Meloetta still has to use up one of its moveslots and a turn to even transform into Meloetta-P in the first place, meaning it usually isn't worth it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Because of Meloetta's sheer versatility, there aren't really any Pokemon that can be considered counters to it. Though with that being said, specially defensive Jirachi only fails to beat the Calm Mind set, but only if Body Slam or Thunder don't manage to paralyze on the first hit. However, once the set is revealed, it is much easier to deal with. Specially defensive Celebi is a hard counter to the mixed set, as it is not 2HKOed by any of Meloetta's moves; however, if Meloetta runs Ice Punch, Celebi will be forced to stall out Life Orb recoil with Recover, as it comes close to 2HKOing. Specially defensive Hippowdon avoids the 2HKO from any of the mixed set's moves and can  also stall out Life Orb recoil, with sandstorm damage helping to wear down Meloetta even faster. If Meloetta decides to use Ice Punch then even physically defensive Hippowdon can counter it. On the same set, if Meloetta lacks Ice Punch, Latios and Latias can check it, as they don't take much damage from Hidden Power Ice and resist Thunder, though they do fear paralysis. Ghost-types such as Jellicent and Gengar can prevent Meloetta from changing formes, as they are immune to Relic Song. However, Jellicent has to watch out for Psyshock and Thunder, and Gengar has to watch out for any Psychic STAB while it can't do anything significant back. If the Calm Mind set lacks Signal Beam, it can be stalled out by Perish Song Celebi. Blissey and Chansey can Toxic stall the Calm Mind and all-out attacker sets (Blissey only if Meloetta lacks Psyshock), as it takes several boosts to be able to 2HKO them with Focus Blast. Specially defensive Hippowdon avoids the 2HKO from all-out attacker Meloetta most of the time and can stall it out with Life Orb and sandstorm damage by spamming Slack Off. Scizor can threaten any set with U-turn and can pick off Meloetta after it has been weakened with Bullet Punch, while switching relatively easily into most of Meloetta's attacks. Fast physical attackers, such as Choice Scarf Salamence, Choice Scarf Jirachi, and Choice Scarf Garchomp, can effectively revenge kill Meloetta when it is holding a Life Orb, as this takes away from its already lacking physical bulk.</p>
