[Overview]

<p>With the ability to pass on any genetic sequence, Ditto's role as the breeding machine was well-known and much-used by trainers around the world to obtain flawless IVs on their Pokemon. Ditto's repertoire has expanded, however, and it is now capable of something much more. With Imposter, Ditto can be known as the greatest revenge killer of all time, using its opponents moves against it. With Team Preview being a staple in the BW metagame, opponents will be hesitant to set up once they see Ditto in your party. Although Ditto is an imposing threat to any team, its HP is downright pitiful. Unfortunately for Ditto, HP is the one stat Imposter does not copy, so Ditto will be forever stuck with its 48 base HP. Ditto also has little to no use against opposing stall teams as when Ditto transforms, it will be little more than a Choice Scarf stall Pokemon; not the most useful thing in the world. Ditto is a risk&mdash;use its power with caution.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Imposter allows Ditto to copy its opponent's every aspect (except HP and IVs). From moveset to pixel design all the way to stat boosts, Ditto shares the same exact traits. Ditto does a particularly good job of defeating set-up attackers. With a Choice Scarf attached, Ditto is not only able to copy all stat boosts, but also able to outspeed the Pokemon it is copying. This is particularly useful against Dragon-type Pokemon, as these Pokemon will carry a move that will lead to their downfall. Never again will Salamence and Dragonite try setting up on you, as they know that if they boost, Ditto is ready to do what it does best.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>HP is the only stat that you need to invest in, but make sure you don't forget to. Imposter does not copy HP values, so whatever you invest is whatever you will get. The IV stat is also something you need to pay close attention to as IVs also do not get copied by Imposter. This means that if you IV your Ditto to have Hidden Power Ice, it will have Hidden Power Ice after you transform. The given IVs ensure that you will have Hidden Power Ice, while also keeping the lowest Speed possible. You may be wondering what the point is in having low Speed IVs, and the reason is for the rare Ditto mirror-match. That is, if two Ditto are sent out at the same time, Imposter won't do anything and both Ditto will face a PP stall battle. The slowest Ditto will win due to not dying from Struggle recoil. Max Special Defense is being used in the rare occurrence that you switch into a Zoroark (Imposter doesn't work on Zoroark), but either way you have no chance of beating Zoroark if you switch into it.</p>

<p>In terms of teammates, Ditto appreciates Pokemon that can set up entry hazards. Pokemon such as Skarmory and Forretress are good candidates as both can set up Spikes and are good pivots if Ditto ever needs to switch out. Forretress is particularly useful as it can clear any hazards on your side of the field. Any grounded Poison-type is also a useful partner for Ditto as it is susceptible to Toxic Spikes depending on what it transforms into. In all actuality, you shouldn't be basing your team off Ditto as it is more of a glue Pokemon that aims to KO setup users. Do be warned, however, that there are some setup users that can beat Ditto due to their bulk. Volcarona is an example of this as Quiver Dance boosts its Special Attack and Special Defense. Due to Volcarona's higher HP, it would win the encounter.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Nope.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Ditto has no real counters as Ditto will transform into whatever it switches into. If you want a literal counter to Ditto, then Zoroark is the premier Ditto counter as Imposter fails to copy Zoroark. The best way of handling an opposing Ditto is to not use setup moves such as Dragon Dance, as they will only be used against you. Without boosted stats, Ditto is little more than the typical Choice Scarf Pokemon. Substitute will block Imposter from activating and cause Ditto to be useless.</p>
