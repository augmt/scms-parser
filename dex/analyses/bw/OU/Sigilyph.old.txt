[Overview]

<p>Sigilyph is quite a unique Pokemon. He can fill a number of roles on a variety of teams, and with the right setup, he can become a monster. Sigilyph learns a lot of support moves, such as Reflect, Light Screen, and Whirlwind. His Magic Guard ability can also cause massive headaches for stall teams. However, every Pokemon has its downside. With the introduction of new powerful Dark- and Rock-types, Sigilyph doesn't exactly get a lot of safe opportunities to switch in. Given the right support though, you'll find Sigilyph to be a team player that will not disappoint.</p>

[Set Comments]

<p>This set utilizes the full potential of Cosmic Power. With already above average bulk, Cosmic Power makes Sigilyph almost untouchable, and Stored Power just adds to that in a great way. Since it becomes more powerful the more stat boosts the user has, Stored Power will become a very potent attack as Sigilyph acquires boosts from Cosmic Power. Roost is absolutely necessary on this set, as Sigilyph will take damage as he slowly boosts his defenses. Psycho Shift is easily one of the most important moves on this set, as it allows Sigilyph to fatally cripple the opponent's Pokemon. Because the majority of threats in this generation are physically-based, burn will render them near-useless as it halves the Attack of the opponent's Pokemon, as well as slowly whittling down their HP. 252 HP EVs increase the overall bulk of Sigilyph. 200 Def EVs help you wall the majority of physical attackers, which will help you when setting up Cosmic Powers.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>If you feel that physical attackers aren't much of a problem, then Toxic Orb can be used over Flame Orb. The Toxic status doesn't decrease the opponent's Attack stat, but the passive damage increases each turn. Leftovers and Hidden Power Fighting can also be used instead of Flame Orb and Psycho Shift in case your team already employs another status condition and you don't want them clashing.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sigilyph has a lot of tricks up his sleeve. He can use moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave to cripple opponents, but Psycho Shift is still preferable. Shadow Ball is an option to hit Ghost-types such as Jellicent. If you aren't using Magic Guard, then Safeguard is a useful move to protect Sigilyph from status. Other useful moves that this Pokemon can learn and utilize include Calm Mind, Trick Room, and Gravity. Whirlwind can cause a lot of trouble for Pokemon who rely on set up moves, and can be used in conjunction with Psycho Shift.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Because of Sigilyph's low initial offensive prowess and the poor coverage of Psychic attacks, almost any strong user of Dark, Ghost, Rock, or Electric attacks can potentially switch in and defeat him. Tyranitar is likely the most notable example, being immune to Psychic moves and having powerful STAB Stone Edge, Crunch, and Pursuit; it is also known to carry Ice Beam frequently, and sets focused on special attacking do not fear burn. Jirachi is a major threat, it's 4x resistant to Psychic and frequently carries Thunder due to the popularity of rain. Starmie resists Psychic and is almost completely unafraid of burn or poison thanks to Natural Cure, it also carries Thunderbolt / Thunder and Ice Beam. Heatran is immune to burn and also resists Psychic; its powerful Fire attacks are a real threat even when it's a neutral hit. Be careful about using physical attackers against Sigilyph, as an untimely burn can leave that Pokemon useless for the remainder of the match. Overall, the trick is to hit hard and hit fast, as you definitely do not want to let Sigilyph set up.</p>
