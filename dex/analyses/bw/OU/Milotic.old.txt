[Overview]

<p>Milotic moves into the new generation retaining her status as the only bulky, pure Water-type with instant, self-sufficient recovery. Above-average HP, excellent Special Attack, and phenomenal Special Defense stats allow Milotic to function as a great mixed wall that is also capable of dishing out her own damage. Marvel Scale remains a unique defensive ability that sets Milotic apart from other bulky Water-types as a status absorber or a Sleep Talk user. Despite only a minute increase to her already shallow movepool, Milotic has some new toys to play with in BW. Scald is a welcomed asset, burns helping protect Milotic's weaker defensive stat and Dragon Tail gives her much-needed phazing. Since these options are TM-based, Milotic is one of the few Pokemon who can enjoy the generation transition with no detrimental impact. In a chaotic, new world dominated by offense, Milotic establishes herself as a moderate defensive check, not supporting the team so much as disrupting the opponent.</p>

[SET]
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Scald
move 2: Recover 
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Dragon Tail / Toxic / Haze
item: Leftovers
ability: Marvel Scale
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes advantage of Milotic's access to Recover, which frees up an extra moveslot for both offensive and support moves. Scald and Ice Beam allow Milotic to exercise her robust 100 base Special Attack. Scald's 30% burn chance means that most physical sweepers must be wary of switching in, lest they be crippled. Ice Beam rounds out Milotic's coverage, notable targets including Salamence, Dragonite, and Haxorus.</p>

<p>The choice of support move is at the player's discretion, each having its own merits; Toxic allows Milotic to make short work of her fellow bulky Water-types and works well with Recover-stalling, whereas Dragon Tail allows Milotic to bounce away setup sweepers and inflict extra damage through entry hazards. It also bypasses Taunt, but unlike Haze, it is liable to miss, albeit rarely, and fails to get rid of opponents behind a Substitute.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The defensive EV spread makes the most of Milotic's mixed walling potential, providing her with solid 394 HP and 280+ defenses, while the 4 offensive EVs guarantee Ice Beam's OHKO on uninvested Salamence. Toxic can be used over Ice Beam which would allow Milotic to shuffle status across an opponent's team with Dragon Tail. If one is turned off by the idea of conflicting statuses, then Surf can be used over Scald. However, most opponents will enjoy neither burn nor Toxic, rendering Surf's additional Base Power an inferior choice.</p>

<p>Milotic can fit on both bulky offensive and pure stall teams, as both welcome a defensive pivot with the potential to hit back. Entry hazard support is always welcome. Milotic enjoys being part of a Fire / Water / Grass core; Ferrothorn, Roserade, and Whimsicott come to mind as worthwhile Grass-type partners, especially with the entry hazard potential of the first two. Heatran and Chandelure are great Fire-type choices as in most cases Milotic can pave the way for their sweep by eliminating enemy Water-types.</p>

<p>In addition, Milotic works wonderfully in tandem with sweepers that fear Ice-, Water-, or Fire-type moves: Latios, Dragonite, Scizor, Lucario and most other Dragon- and Steel-types hence work as teammates. They allow Milotic to avoid getting into stall wars with the most resilient of walls. Thanks to Poison Heal, Gliscor or Breloom can switch in and absorb Toxic, as well as Electric-type moves. Milotic can happily switch into an opponent's attempts at set-up and status; an activated Marvel Scale gives Milotic the potential to exceed Skarmory's Defense. Opposing Scalds, the first layer of Toxic Spikes, and Will-O-Wisp all provide optimal opportunities to switch in and grab the defensive boost.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Scald
move 4: Dragon Tail
item: Leftovers
ability: Marvel Scale
nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The fabled strategy of RestTalking is definitely still viable on Milotic because she is the only Pokemon that receives a defensive reward for using Rest, through Marvel Scale. Scald, again, is the primary STAB because of its chance to enhance Milotic's walling ability. Dragon Tail finally allows Milotic to join the phazing ranks of Gyarados and Swampert, becoming a team player of sorts as it can hamper opposing efforts to set up or spread status. With Sleep Talk, Dragon Tail loses its negative priority, allowing Milotic to phaze slower opponents before they even have a chance to move. Milotic is a solid choice over Gyarados in this niche because of her lack of Stealth Rock weakness, better Special Defense, the boost from Marvel Scale, and lack of an easily exploitable 4x weakness to Electric-type moves.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As with the Recover set, the EV spread and nature give Milotic near-equal defensive stats. While Marvel Scale is inactive, Milotic sits at 394 HP, 282 Defense, and 286 Special Defense. However, after a Rest, Milotic's Defense skyrockets to an incredibly durable 423. It is also of interest to note that the combination of Rest and Scald actually allows Milotic to handle any of the five major statuses and restore itself to full health. An Attack-lowering nature is used because Dragon Tail is being used to phaze rather than as a legitimate attacking option. Before choosing this over Gyarados, one has to consider defenses, damage roll, and burn chance. Marvel Scale also makes Milotic a viable choice over Suicune, but as always, one must weigh the many pros and cons of Dragon Tail vs Roar.</p>

<p>Entry hazards of all kinds are welcome, although at least two are recommended to make full use of Milotic's phazing powers. One should probably take into account the fact that Toxic Spikes is somewhat counter-productive with Scald, however. As Milotic is still effectively acting as a mixed wall, it's a good idea to have Pokemon in the wings who are entirely focused on one defensive stat, such as Blissey or Snorlax, and Hippowdon or Skarmory. Like Jellicent, Milotic has high Special Defense and the power to burn her foes, but she isn't Pursuit weak and boasts superior physical defense, even before considering Rest and Marvel Scale. As Milotic and Jellicent have similar niches, it is recommended that one relies on another spinblocker, such as Spiritomb, Chandelure, or Dusclops.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>With Scald disabling physical sweepers, Milotic can try Mirror Coat to nail special attackers as well. For this, a spread focusing on Special Defense is recommended as Milotic needs all the investment it can get to survive and reflect the most powerful of special moves. Light Screen, when combined with Scald, can be used to increase Milotic's overall defenses. A Calm nature with 252 HP / 200 Def / 56 SpD makes a good balance, but Milotic will want to focus most of her EVs on Defense this generation to differentiate herself from Jellicent.</p>

<p>Hidden Power Electric and Hidden Power Grass are offensive alternatives to Ice Beam or the support options on the Recover set, but Milotic won't be doing as much damage to her fellow Water-types as she would with Toxic. Hidden Power Fire is another option to deal with Ferrothorn, but doesn't offer many other benefits. A Life Orb set is also a possibility, but can be hard to pull off--although Milotic has great Special Attack, barely better-than-average Speed, a poor offensive movepool, and a lack of setup moves leave her to coverage-based tanking at best.</p>

<p>Magic Coat's increased versatility this generation extends to Milotic as well, although more often than not, Milotic is happy to take a status move. Hypnosis was once a staple on Milotic last generation and it remains a viable option with the sleep counter shenanigans of BW, although Scald and Toxic are more consistent options.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>For all of her splendor and bulk, Milotic is easily 2HKOed by powerful Grass- and Electric-type moves. Zapdos, Virizion, Breloom, Celebi, Jolteon, and Lilligant can all counter Milotic quite effectively with their STAB moves, but the majority of them won't like being hit by Ice Beam or badly poisoned. Ferrothorn and Whimsicott make Milotic's life hellish as they can sap massive amounts of health through Leech Seed--Ferrothorn is especially troublesome as it can set up entry hazards. However, Scald can be troublesome as Ferrothorn will be unable to kill Milotic with Power Whip if it's burned. The RestTalk set can also outrun Ferrothorn and, should Sleep Talk select Dragon Tail, phaze it before it gets a chance to move. If Milotic switches into either Ferrothorn's Thunder Wave or Whimsicott's Stun Spore, killing her will be much harder.</p>

<p>Milotic needs Ice Beam to slay dragons and Grass-types, Toxic to overcome bulky Water-types, and Haze to counter Substitute sweepers. Once you figure out her support move, she'll be relatively simple to counter appropriately. Jellicent might have a chance against the Recover set if it's running Energy Ball or Toxic. Taunt is its best option against the RestTalk set, however, because Milotic can easily outspeed Jellicent and use Toxic itself, while Jellicent will find it hard to do any damage back. Tentacruel can easily set up on Milotic, but runs the risk of being stalled to death if Milotic is burned. Additionally, if Tentacruel is used to set up Toxic Spikes, one should be careful of a Milotic switch-in nabbing the Marvel Scale boost on the first layer.</p>
