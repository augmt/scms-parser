[Overview]

<p>Hydreigon belongs to the special group of Pokemon that can boast they possess no true counters: they potentially carry a move that can OHKO or 2HKO any Pokemon in the game, and as such are virtually impossible to switch into. Its peers include such wrecking balls as Deoxys-A, Excadrill, and Salamence. He also has Levitate, garnering many of the benefits his Flying-type brethren possess with nearly none of the drawbacks. Hydreigon is even gifted with excellent attacking and defensive stats as well as a movepool to make any Pokemon leaf-green with envy, so why does he struggle in OU? The answer is simple: Hydreigon's base 98 Speed. While very far from bad, he falls just short of the myriad of faster Pokemon. Hydreigon's secondary Dark typing only makes things worse, giving it weaknesses to Fighting- and Bug-type attacks while doing nothing to improve its STAB coverage or alleviate its Dragon and Ice weaknesses. Hydreigon is not an easy Dragon to use, and isn't always the right one, with many of his peers being faster, more powerful, or both, but don't be afraid to give it a try; this ferocious hydra just might surprise you.</p>

[SET]
name: Life Orb Attacker
move 1: Dark Pulse
move 2: Roost

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hydreigon shines in a metagame where Psychic-types are common, with its combination of a higher damage output, great coverage options, and good bulk and typing differentiating it from other special attackers. Additionally, its Speed, while far from terrific, is perfect for it to threaten Pokemon commonly used on sand balance teams, which are extremely prevalent in BW OU.</p>

<p>This Hydreigon set is highly customizable and can be tailored towards your team's needs. Dark Pulse and Roost are the only necessities, as Dark Pulse allows Hydreigon to adequately threaten the bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types in the tier that it is relied on to beat, while Roost gives it decent longevity, as damage from Life Orb and possibly sandstorm can wear it down very quickly. Hydreigon's good bulk and typing allow it to use Roost against many Pokemon that can't adequately damage it, such as defensive Starmie and Celebi. Next, Hydreigon should choose a coverage option that allows it to hit Steel-types, which could otherwise easily switch into its Dark-type STAB moves, super effectively. Flamethrower allows Hydreigon to roast Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Jirachi, and Scizor, while Focus Blast can deal massive amounts of damage to Heatran while still retaining super effective coverage against Ferrothorn. Focus Blast also has the benefit of hitting other Dark-types, such as Tyranitar or opposing Hydreigon. Draco Meteor is an option over either of these moves, as it is Hydreigon's strongest STAB move and has great neutral coverage throughout the tier.</p>


[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Hydreigon's Speed should be maximized to take advantage of its decent Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed Kyurem, Kyurem-B, Nasty Plot Celebi, and Adamant Haxorus, as well as Speed tie with Jolly Toxicroak, all without needing to use a Speed-boosting nature. Hydreigon should have a Modest nature and maximum EVs in Special Attack to increase its damage output. The remaining four EVs can be placed into Special Defense to slightly raise Hydreigon's special bulk, as it will be often switching into weak Scalds or Giga Drains from Pokemon such as Starmie or Celebi; however, if Hydreigon is running Superpower, the four EVs should be placed into Attack and a Mild nature should be used, allowing Hydreigon to 2HKO most Chansey after Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>Hydreigon has several more attacking options that it can utilize, the main one being the aforementioned Superpower over Focus Blast. Superpower can deal heavier damage to special walls such as Blissey, Chansey, specially defensive Heatran, and Tyranitar. However, Hydreigon is very prone to being burned, as many of the Pokemon it usually switches into carry Scald or Will-O-Wisp, so Focus Blast is generally preferred. For special options, Dragon Pulse is a reliable STAB attack that has good neutral coverage; it can be used over Dark Pulse if your team has alternative ways of handling Psychic- and Ghost-types. If Hydreigon is being used on a rain team, Surf can be used to hit Pokemon such as Heatran, Tyranitar, or Hippowdon super effectively, as it receives a damage boost in the rain. Finally, Hydreigon has access to Fire Blast, and the extra power over Flamethrower can be useful against Pokemon such as Jirachi and Celebi (if Hydreigon is using Dragon Pulse), or in matchups against rain teams. However, Hydreigon usually has enough firepower to break through such Pokemon with Flamethrower and thus appreciates that move's reliability.</p>

<p>In terms of team options, defensive Starmie is a good partner, as it checks Keldeo and is able to switch into Fighting- and Ice-type moves aimed at Hydreigon. It can also OHKO Gengar, which threatens Hydreigon. In return, Hydreigon can remove Pokemon such as Jellicent and Ferrothorn, which prevent Starmie from doing its job of keeping your side of the field free from entry hazards. Ferrothorn itself is a good teammate, as Hydreigon appreciates Spikes support, which lets it secure 2HKOs against bulky Pokemon such as Jirachi, Politoed, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon. Ferrothorn can also beat fast threats to Hydreigon such as Latios, Latias, and offensive Starmie; Hydreigon, in turn, can beat Celebi and Reuniclus, which often render Ferrothorn setup bait.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute 
move 1: Substitute 
move 2: Dragon Pulse
move 3: Focus Blast 
move 4: Fire Blast / Roost
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
nature: Modest
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Substitute goes hand-in-hand with Hydreigon's excellent coverage and ability to force switches. Instead of viciously attempting to tear its opponents apart, this set adopts the tried and true method of whittling down its foes into KO range. Substitute lets Hydreigon scout its checks, protects it from status effects, and most important of all, protects Hydreigon from taking hits. Hydreigon's mere presence forces Pokemon out, so you will have no trouble setting up Substitutes on forced switches. In other cases, its typing allows it to set up Substitutes on Pokemon that can't really damage it, such as Rotom-W and Celebi. Dragon Pulse is a step down from Draco Meteor, and its disappointing Base Power leaves a lot to be desired; however, it's a reliable STAB move that generally deals sufficient damage. Focus Blast and Fire Blast are awesome coverage moves that ensure that Hydreigon hits everything in OU for at least neutral damage. Hydreigon is still capable of beating its most common checks, such as Tyranitar and Heatran, but dedicated special walls such as Blissey and Chansey are out of Hydreigon's reach. Roost is a decent alternative to Fire Blast, as it helps stave off Substitute recoil, and is a flat out requirement if you're planning on using Life Orb, as Substitute and Life Orb recoil (and other forms of passive damage) eventually take their toll on Hydreigon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb was previously mentioned as an alternative to Leftovers on Hydreigon. With a Life Orb equipped, Hydreigon trades longevity for power, but note that Life Orb basically forces Hydreigon to rely on Roost which could cost it some coverage. A Timid nature, is as always, an option for those who want Hydreigon to outspeed Jolly Haxorus, Gliscor, and opposing Modest Hydreigon. These threats are exceedingly rare, however, and you're weakening a set that already needs all the power it can get. Dark Pulse can deal with Jellicent and Mew who invest in Special Defense, as well as Reuniclus. However, it's far too weak and specialized to be of any use on average. Work Up might seem like a lesser option, but when you're safely behind a Substitute and Hydreigon gets going, you can really get some damage against the opposing team. With Work Up, Superpower with a Rash or Timid nature can be used over Focus Blast. If you're worried about consistency, Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast. It's noticeably weaker than Fire Blast, though; Flamethrower fails to 2HKO specially defensive Jirachi, for example. In the same vein, Earth Power can be used over Focus Blast to grant Hydreigon reliable coverage against Heatran and Tyranitar. If the above recommendations are of any indication, this set relies on too many imperfect accuracy moves, so replacing one of them might not seem like a bad idea in practice.</p>

<p>Above all else, this set appreciates having multiple entry hazards on the field. As Hydreigon is prone to causing switches, and most of its checks are grounded, Spikes users are ideal partners. Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory are relatively good Spikes users each with the ability to perform another task for your team, whether it be tanking hits, walling, or spinning. Forretress stands above the rest, since it has incredible defensive synergy with Hydreigon, resisting its Ice-, Dragon-, and Bug-type weaknesses, and is capable of Rapid Spinning.</p>

<p>This set is useful for players who want a wallbreaking Dragon-type that takes neutral damage from Stealth Rock and can switch into weak Grass-, Electric-, and Water-type moves. This set is also useful on offensive teams, but it tends to fit better on balanced teams where its disappointing Speed isn't as much of a detriment. Hydreigon helps most Pokemon by virtue of wearing down and defeating most walls, but Pokemon such as Latios especially appreciate this set for its ability to lure most of its checks and beat them down one-on-one. In comparison to the mixed attacker set, this set is actually more dangerous against offensive teams. Whereas offensive teams could easily revenge kill the mixed attacker set using Pokemon such as Terrakion, it's a struggle to actually remove Hydreigon once it's behind a Substitute, and it usually ends up with the opponent losing at least one Pokemon to remove its Substitute. Unfortunately, this set suffers against stall teams as they tend to carry dedicated special walls that can beat this set. Hydreigon will never break through Blissey or Chansey, so running a dedicated counter is helpful. Strong Fighting-types are as always the solution to avoid being walled by pink blobs; running any of Terrakion, Breloom, or Conkeldurr should suffice.</p> 

[SET]
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Focus Blast
move 3: Fire Blast / Flamethrower
move 4: U-turn / Dark Pulse
item: Choice Specs 
nature: Modest
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Specs promotes a different way of playing with Hydreigon, which focuses on a more extreme hit and run playstyle, therefore overriding Hydreigon's standard role of wallbreaking. Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor pretty much steamrolls anything that isn't a dedicated special wall or a Steel-type, and even then most Steel-types take heavy damage from Draco Meteor. Focus Blast is the most important coverage move on this set, and knowing when to use Focus Blast is the key to being effective with it; it lets Hydreigon power its way through most of the Steel-types in OU in addition to OHKOing all variants of Tyranitar and Heatran, as well as 2HKOing Blissey most of the time after Stealth Rock damage. Fire Blast targets Jirachi and hits Ferrothorn even harder, though you should avoid using this move in general because it's very easy for the opponent to capitalize on. Tyranitar, Politoed, Heatran, and Dragon-types can switch in and put your team at a massive disadvantage. Only use Fire Blast when you absolutely need to remove Jirachi or Ferrothorn.</p>

<p>U-turn is a useful move to scout its checks and gain momentum, and is useful when paired with a Dugtrio; though, on average, Hydreigon is usually better off attacking. Dark Pulse is a fairly strong and consistent STAB move, though it's similar to Fire Blast in that it's too easy for the opponent to abuse; however, Dark Pulse is particularly effective against Reuniclus and Jellicent. This set is easier to use than the other Hydreigon sets, but therein lies the problem; the mixed attacker set is more effective at netting KOs because of its ability to switch moves. Choice Specs is easier to use in general, as you can spam Draco Meteor to get meaningful damage on most of the OU metagame, but don't be tricked into thinking that this is acceptable, because you're better off using the mixed attacker set if you want to simply KO things. If you're going to use the Choice Specs set, it's for its 20% boost in power and lack of recoil in comparison to the mixed attacker set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Giving Hydreigon a Choice Scarf makes it capable of revenge killing faster threats, which is an obvious use it has over the Choice Specs set. On the other hand, Choice Scarf Hydreigon is completely inferior at actually KOing opponents, and it's useless in the face of sturdy Pokemon. It's somewhat of a hybrid set, and is a gimmicky version of Choice Specs that can only KO weakened Pokemon or Pokemon that are weak to Hydreigon's coverage moves, but at the same time Hydreigon is also a gimmicky Choice Scarf user with suboptimal Speed and an spammable STAB move. What makes Choice Scarf Hydreigon so difficult to justify using is that, looking at the set as one whole, cohesive experience, it's sorely lacking and is a definite crutch. However, it does exactly what its intended to do, and that hasn't stopped a large number of players from using it. Surf is a legitimate option over Fire Blast on rain teams; it's a pseudo-STAB move under the rain that's effective against Heatran, Jirachi, and the rest of the Steel-types, while also maintaining some effectiveness against Tyranitar as well. Earth Power can be used over Focus Blast as a weaker, albeit more consistent, coverage move that targets Tyranitar and grounded Steel-types such as Jirachi and Heatran. You give up at ever being able to defeat Blissey without Focus Blast, however. Superpower might seem like a weird option on a Choice Specs set, but a neutral natured 0 Atk Superpower can 2HKO Blissey and almost always OHKO Tyranitar after Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>Because Choice Specs Hydreigon is a useful battering ram that can basically be used on any team, it doesn't necessarily need much team support to be of any use. Choice Specs Hydreigon appreciates having entry hazards up since it can turn 3HKOs into 2HKOs and 2HKOs into OHKOs with them. Since Blissey and Chansey are full stops to this set, so carrying appropriate counters can do wonders. Choice Band Dugtrio is capable of 2HKOing Blissey after Stealth Rock damage, but removing Chansey is a little trickier. Fortunately, since it's forced to rely on Eviolite, wearing it down with hazards and passive damage is fairly easy; it only needs a little passive damage in order to be 2HKOed by Focus Blast. You can also rely on Stealth Rock and a single layer of Spikes to guarantee the 2HKO.</p>

[SET]
name: Taunt Attacker
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Dark Pulse / Dragon Pulse
move 3: Focus Blast / Flamethrower
move 4: Roost
item: Life Orb
nature: Modest
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Taunt allows Hydreigon to stallbreak, limiting the recovery of its common switch-ins such as Chansey, Blissey, bulky Water-types, and more, while also allowing Hydreigon to beat various Pokemon that rely on status to wear down foes, such as Gliscor. Dark Pulse is Hydreigon's main attack, letting it threaten bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Jellicent, Celebi, Mew, and Reuniclus. Dragon Pulse is another option, as it offers superior neutral coverage and has a higher Base Power, but Hydreigon usually prefers Dark Pulse to threaten the aforementioned Pokemon. Hydreigon's next move allows it to threaten Steel-types. Focus Blast allows Hydreigon to beat Heatran and also nets coverage on opposing Dark-types, while Flamethrower allows it to KO Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Scizor. Finally, Roost offers Hydreigon increased longevity and helps it make use of its good typing and decent bulk.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Leftovers is a viable option on Hydreigon, as it increases Hydreigon's longevity while sacrificing some of its offensive presence. In a similar vein, you can opt to use a bulkier spread with more emphasis on HP; however, since Hydreigon primarily fulfills an offensive role with stallbreaking being secondary, it usually appreciates the extra damage output provided by a Life Orb as well as maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed. This investment allows Hydreigon to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding key threats such as Kyurem-B, Nasty Plot Celebi, and Timid Heatran.</p>

<p>Earth Power is usable as Hydreigon's coverage move, and it retains most of the coverage of Focus Blast. However, Focus Blast is preferred due to its ability to hit a wider variety of Steel- and Dark-types for heavier damage, especially Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Tyranitar.</p>

<p>Heatran is a good partner to Hydreigon because it can check Latios and Latias and provide Toxic and Stealth Rock, helping Hydreigon stall Pokemon out with Taunt. In return, Hydreigon can beat bulky Water-types, Chansey, Blissey, and Gliscor, all of which give Heatran trouble. Like most Hydreigon sets, bulky Starmie is a great partner, handling Keldeo and switching into Fighting- and Ice-type moves aimed at Hydreigon. In return, Hydreigon can remove the Pokemon that prevent Starmie from keeping its side of the field free from hazards, namely, Jellicent and Ferrothorn. Hydreigon can also remove other threats to Starmie such as Tyranitar and Celebi.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>Hydreigon's offensive movepool is enormous; it has access to nearly every single respectable attacking move in the game, which gives it a myriad of options to choose from. On the physical side, Hydreigon has access to Acrobatics, Crunch, Dragon Tail, Outrage, and Head Smash. One can choose to use a Choice Band set mostly consisting of these moves, however, it's mostly outclassed by other Choice Band using Dragon-types. Hydreigon has access to Thunder Wave and can use it on any given set to cripple attackers; however, it's not that useful, as most of its common switch-ins are barely impeded by Thunder Wave. Hydreigon can use a defensive set consisting of Taunt / Thunder Wave / Dragon Tail / Roost, and act as sort of defensive tank that spreads paralysis strikingly similar to the parashuffle set that Dragonite employs. Truthfully, Taunt is a fairly large reason to use Hydreigon over Dragonite, as Taunt prevents opposing Pokemon from setting up entry hazards on it, though usually you're much better off using Dragonite or any of Hydreigon's other sets. Make no mistake: these moves and sets are in Other Options for a reason. It's not because the moves themselves are poor, but because a large number of of these moves are significantly outclassed by the ones already listed in the above sets.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Counters? There aren't any! The closest thing to a concrete counter now is Chansey, but even then it's easily 2HKOed by Superpower with some prior damage (a common reality when you consider that Chansey doesn't use Leftovers). Nothing else can touch Hydreigon on a good day. Tyranitar is always OHKOed by Superpower, and Ferrothorn and Jirachi are scorched by Fire Blast. Heatran is OHKOed by Earthquake, and it takes a ton of damage from Superpower and everything else is at best 2HKOed by Draco Meteor. Fortunately, Hydreigon is fairly easy to check in the current BW metagame. Breloom and Keldeo are common and every single one of them can destroy Hydreigon with their powerful Fighting-type moves. The ever-popular Terrakion exists at every corner, waiting to turn Hydreigon into a liability since it is forced to switch out from its powerful Close Combats. It's also naturally outsped and KOed by Latios and Latias. Outside of fast offensive checks, you can rely on good old fashioned priority to take it down. Breloom, Mamoswine and Scizor are decent choices, though they should only bother trying to take on Hydreigon when it has been weakened as Hydreigon's 92 / 90 physical defense is nothing to sneeze at.</p>
