[Overview]

<p>Breloom's ability roster is the gift that keeps on giving. In Generation 3, it was saddled with poor defenses, a near-worthless ability, and a branding as a bit of a one-trick pony. Granted, it was a neat trick, but it just didn't cut it. Generation 4 gave it Poison Heal, which is everything that it could have ever wanted--status absorption, healing for Substitutes, and a ridiculous amount of healing on Leech Seed sets. However, Generation 5 really turned it up a notch, granting it two boons: a buffed 25 Base Power Bullet Seed, and Technician, which not only gives it a priority attack rivaling Scizor's devastating Bullet Punch, but also a powerful Low Sweep and Bullet Seed.</p>

<p>As a result, Breloom is one of the gold standards of power in Generation 5. With Technician, Breloom basically 2HKOs the metagame with Choice Band or Life Orb. Technician Bullet Seed has the potential to be the strongest attack in the metagame, a 187.5 Base Power attack coming off of 394 Attack. Compounding that is Technician Low Sweep, which gives Breloom a free second attack against many faster opponents switching in. Combine this with Swords Dance, and cap it with Spore and BW's sleep mechanics, and Breloom is a serious force to be reckoned with. And for those with a touch of nostalgia, it's still as threatening as ever with its vicious Poison Heal sets, which can be incredibly tough to crack.</p>

<p>Despite these advances, very little had happened to offset Breloom's significant weaknesses. 70 base Speed is a serious problem for it, as there are a number of significant Fighting resistances that outspeed it. Combine that with barely passable defenses, and Breloom can be a bit tough to keep alive. When used well, it's a devastating force. If used carelessly, it can be nearly useless.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When you talk about terrifying physical attackers in OU, this set is one of the first that leaps to mind. The raw power of an item-boosted Low Sweep is seriously intimidating, doubly so when you consider that Low Sweep rules out a long list of would-be counters by virtue of its Speed-reducing property. Would-be checks such as Latios, Starmie, Tornadus, and others quickly find themselves unable to do their job when crippled by Low Sweep. Mach Punch gives Breloom a burst of immediate power against speedy threats such as Terrakion and Hydreigon, and Bullet Seed gives it the potential of unparalleled power with an attack capable of reaching 187.5 Base Power. Spore caps the set off, as any Pokemon capable of sponging these attacks still has to contend with the threat of sleep, rendering it helpless against Breloom's assaults. On the flip side, if Choice-locked Spore isn't your cup of tea, Stone Edge gives Breloom a way to threaten Dragonite immediately on the switch and also provides excellent neutral coverage alongside its STAB moves.</p>

<p>This set comes in two flavors: Life Orb and Choice Band. While Choice Band has the edge in raw power, Life Orb makes up for it with versatility. Life Orb can 2HKO troublesome Pokemon such as Starmie with Low Sweep into Bullet Seed, but Choice Band can simply 2HKO Pokemon such as Latios as they switch in without a second thought. In general, Choice Band rewards prediction more, while Life Orb is a bit easier to use and is more equipped to handle unforeseen circumstances.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Jolly is most important with Life Orb, as it not only allows Breloom to outspeed notable threats such as Starmie after a Low Sweep but also gives it the edge against Adamant Mamoswine to beat it out with Mach Punch. However, Adamant gives Low Sweep some much-needed bite, allowing the Choice Band set to secure some much-needed 2HKOs without having to switch moves.</p>

<p>There are some alternative choices for the fourth moveslot. Thunder Punch not only is the most powerful attack against Skarmory but also absolutely obliterates Gyarados. Rock Tomb can operate as an analogue to Low Sweep, catching Tornadus and others with a Rock-type attack and then still having the options given by the guaranteed Speed drop. However, its low power makes it unappealing, and the utility of Spore often far outweighs it. Force Palm is an option over Low Sweep, giving Breloom a bit more of a supporting role. While it lacks the reliability of Low Sweep, it instead possesses a 30% chance to paralyze any would-be Breloom counter, crippling them for the rest of the game. Finally, if sustaining Breloom is your primary concern, Drain Punch is an option. While its Base Power increase renders it unaffected by Technician, it's still a STAB 75 Base Power attack, and its healing can be invaluable when up against teams that either stack entry hazards or boast numerous weak attacks for Breloom to come in on.</p>

<p>This set is easy to use alongside many Pokemon, but Gothitelle is probably its most effective ally. Many of Breloom's primary counters can be dealt with by Gothitelle, and with Shadow Tag providing trapping power, a successful Gothitelle play can make Breloom's life much easier. Breloom also forces a lot of switches, making entry hazards extremely potent. Stealth Rock is a must to help chip away at Flying-types and Levitate users, such as Dragonite and Latias, and Spikes can make dealing with Celebi a significantly easier task. Given the raw power of this set, entry hazards can be the difference between a safe 2HKO and an unsafe 3HKO. Finally, some solid Rapid Spin support can be invaluable given Breloom's inability to heal itself. Starmie is a good choice, as it resists Psychic and Fire, and can also sweep if opponents such as Latios are weakened or eliminated.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Mach Punch

move 4: Spore

ability: Technician
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set provides utterly unparalleled power after a single turn of setup, setup which is easily secured via Spore. After a Swords Dance, Breloom is sitting on 788 Attack. Combine that with a Technician Mach Punch, or an utterly terrifying 5-hit Bullet Seed, and there's very little that Breloom can't break through. Spore makes it easy to set up a Swords Dance, and once it's set up, this set is pretty hard to stop.</p>

<p>Despite being a setup sweeper, Breloom still packs one hell of a punch unboosted. Even if it's hard to get a Swords Dance or Spore in, it still provides the power of a Life Orb Mach Punch, which can mean the difference between life and death when you're staring down the likes of a fully set up Terrakion. Likewise, a Bullet Seed can take down nearly anything if it gets enough hits, and if the opponent is expecting a Swords Dance after a Spore, they can be in for a rude awakening with a little prediction.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Adamant nature is used to secure KOs with Mach Punch that would otherwise be out of reach. Jolly is an option as well, as it works well to hit some faster defensively oriented Pokemon with Bullet Seed or secure the Spore needed to set up. Life Orb gives this set much-needed power, as it's very much a "kill or be killed" kind of set. Using Life Orb also makes Breloom less dependent on Swords Dance in dire situations. However, Lum Berry can open up some options for sweeping where Life Orb wouldn't, especially when the only option for setting up is getting a Swords Dance against defensive Water-types attempting to burn with Scald. Focus Sash is also a fantastic item on this Breloom; the guaranteed chance to survive a hit, in combination with Spore, allows Breloom to shut down nearly any threat desired, which throws off the opposing team's momentum immensely. Breloom with Focus Sash is best used as a lead, as it can take on most other leads (especially those that can summon automatic weather) by surviving a hit and using Spore, then either attacking or setting up.</p>

<p>As this set aims to sweep, it is of the utmost importance that faster Pokemon that resist Fighting are eliminated. Gothitelle can be an extremely potent ally, as its high Special Defense can allow it to eliminate some potential threats, such as Celebi, Tornadus, Starmie, and Latios. Entry hazards are also once again incredibly important, as even with a Technician boost, Mach Punch is still only 60 Base Power. Terrakion, is one of the best offensive Stealth Rock users in the metagame, especially for offensive teams, which are the most likely to use a Breloom set such as this one. Skarmory and Forretress are also efficient Spikers that can assist Breloom by weakening the enemy team with layers of Spikes. Finally, U-turn and Volt Switch users can be extremely effective, as they can help bring Breloom in at the perfect time when it is most likely to sweep effectively.</p>


[SET]
name: Leech Seed
move 1: Spore
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Protect
move 4: Drain Punch
item: Toxic Orb
ability: Poison Heal
nature: Careful
evs: 236 HP / 248 SpD / 24 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Breloom is mostly seen as an offensive force, it can function very well in a defensive role. When invested in its bulk, Breloom is a very effective switch-in to the ever-common Water-type attacks that run rampant in the metagame. Its ability to deal with Rotom-W and Scald is priceless; typical physical Pokemon have to worry about being burnt, but since Breloom is already poisoned via Toxic Orb, it can't be crippled.</p>

<p>The trick to this Breloom's success is its longevity. Between Leech Seed, Poison Heal, Protect, and Drain Punch, it is consistently gaining health. While it is staying alive, it is also draining its opponent's health with Leech Seed, stacking up damage quickly with hazard support. Furthermore, with Breloom's signature move, Spore, it can incapacitate an opposing Pokemon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p> The HP EVs allow for a Poison Heal number. The Speed EVs allow Breloom to outpace Wobbuffet, as well as some Skarmory, Jellicent, and Choice Band Tyranitar.</p>

<p>While this set is a good sponge to Water-type attacks, it is not invincible. In a similar vein, while Breloom is a solid anti-rain measure in the sense that it can tank boosted Water-type attacks, it cannot handle all the attackers typically found on rain teams, such as Tornadus. Thus a teammate that can also deal with these Pokemon is recommended. Luckily, there is no shortage of Pokemon in OU that can fulfill these tasks; Rotom-W in particular stands out due to its ability to handle Tornadus and accommodating Breloom's Flying- and Fire-type weaknessess.</p>

<p>Entry hazards pair well with this set, as with Spore and Leech Seed, Breloom will really be harassing the opposition. Skarmory and Forretress function best on the balanced and defensive teams that this Breloom should generally be used on. While it can annoy them on the switch, strong physical attackers such as Terrakion and Scizor are dangerous to face. A solid physical wall pairs well for this reason; the aforementioned Skarmory is always a good choice, while others such as Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Gliscor are always reliable as well. Pokemon immune to Leech Seed, most notably Celebi, Reuniclus, and Alakazam, also threaten this set, especially since they take little damage from Drain Punch. Jirachi handles them well along with other threats to Breloom, such as Tornadus and Latias.</p> 

[SET]
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Spore
move 3: Drain Punch
move 4: Seed Bomb
item: Toxic Orb
ability: Poison Heal
nature: Careful
EVs: 236 HP / 212 SpD / 60 Spe


[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Bulk Up Breloom finds itself in the spotlight in an OU metagame where strong Fire- and Flying-type attacks are scarce. Taking advantage of its good typing and great ability in Poison Heal, Breloom can serve as a low-maintenance switch-in to bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Rotom-W, Gliscor, and Hippowdon and give its user a boosting win condition for the late-game. Usual switch-ins to Breloom, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Amoonguss lacking Clear Smog, find themselves being set up on and beaten. Spore helps Breloom set up or temporarily take one of its counters out of play. Finally, Drain Punch offers recovery and has good coverage alongside Seed Bomb, which allows Breloom to threaten bulky Water-types such as Jellicent and Gastrodon, Pokemon it usually switches into.</p>


[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The HP EVs allow for a Poison Heal number, while the Speed EVs allow Breloom to outspeed specially defensive Heatran. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense, and when combined with a Careful nature, increase Breloom's special bulk, as it already has means to increase its Defense by virtue of Bulk Up. This Breloom appreciates Pursuit support to remove dangerous Psychic-types such as Latios, Latias, Celebi, and Reuniclus and clear the way for its sweep. Tyranitar is a good partner, as it can cancel out opposing weather (Breloom does not mind sand damage since Poison Heal recovers more than sand deals each turn), and Breloom can check bulky Water- and Ground-type Pokemon that Tyranitar has a hard time handling. In a similar vein, powerful Bug- and Dark-types such as Life Orb Hydreigon and Choice Scarf Scizor can put heavy pressure on Psychic-types. In particular, Scizor can confer Breloom momentum through U-Turn, giving it more chances to use Spore to set up. This Breloom also appreciates Stealth Rock, which limits the number of times Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon, such as Victini and Thundurus-T, can switch in. Hippowdon and Garchomp are good partners, as they can also check threats to Breloom such as Toxicroak, and the former can eliminate rain, which can allow offensive Water-types to power their way through Breloom.</p>

<p>As a side note, if your team has adequate means of handling Ghost-types, Protect is an option over Seed Bomb to give Breloom a guaranteed means of Toxic Orb activation, greater longevity, the ability to scout the moves of Choice-locked foes, and also lets it set up against Bounce Gyarados.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Spore
move 2: Bullet Seed
move 3: Force Palm / Low Sweep
move 4: Stone Edge
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Jolly
ability: Technician
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While not Breloom's most effective set, Choice Scarf Breloom can be quite the potent threat. Boasting the second fastest sleep in OU&mdash;behind only Chlorophyll Venusaur's Sleep Powder in sun&mdash;as well as an incredibly powerful Bullet Seed, Breloom can shut down a number of threats that can otherwise be troublesome to deal with. It can also spread paralysis with Force Palm or surprise some especially quick foes with Choice Scarf Low Sweep, including Choice Scarf variants of fast Pokemon such as Latios. Finally, Stone Edge caps off its coverage and makes it an effective Pokemon for dealing with and eliminating Tornadus and Dragonite.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Jolly nature allows Breloom to outspeed every Pokemon below base 130 Speed, which has dwindled as an important Speed tier but is still useful to outpace. All of Breloom's other move options are rather low power, especially Mach Punch, which is extremely redundant with Choice Scarf, and there's little else in Breloom's movepool that goes well with this set.</p>

<p>Gothitelle can unlock Breloom's true offensive potential by busting through Pokemon that would otherwise counter Breloom. Choice Scarf Breloom also appreciates entry hazards, which can help this relatively weak set secure some important OHKOs and 2HKOs. Other than that, however, this Breloom needs very little coddling, playing much more of a supportive role than other sets.</p>

[SET]
name: SubPunch
move 1: Spore
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Focus Punch
move 4: Seed Bomb / Stone Edge / Facade
item: Toxic Orb
nature: Adamant
ability: Poison Heal
evs: 12 HP / 252 Atk / 244 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is all power. A max Attack Adamant Focus Punch from Breloom is one of the most vicious attacks in the game, capable of OHKOing most anything that doesn't resist it and even 2HKOing many Pokemon that do. While this set sacrifices durability somewhat, the increased offensive power and additional coverage makes it much more threatening offensively.</p>

<p>Spore is here as sleep allows Breloom to set up for free while also incapacitating whatever the opponent switches in. Substitute gives Breloom the buffer that it needs to fire off its powerful STAB Focus Punch and works well with Poison Heal to heal off the damage. Focus Punch turns Breloom's targets into a fine red mist and is a huge part of why this set is so threatening behind a Substitute. The last move is used to provide coverage and give Breloom a way to attack without a Substitute up. Seed Bomb is secondary STAB and also allows Breloom to do incredible amounts of damage to threatening opponents such as Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Sableye. It also hits Jellicent, which is immune to Focus Punch. Stone Edge is effective for taking down Dragonite, Salamence, and physically defensive Volcarona. Facade is the most powerful of the three options after the boost from poison and does solid damage to Gliscor, Landorus-T, Celebi, and Latias, but it leaves Breloom entirely helpless against Ghost-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>12 HP EVs give Breloom an HP value divisible by eight for Poison Heal. The EVs placed in Speed allow Breloom to outspeed uninvested base 100s as well as some uninvested or low-investment mid-speed Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Dragonite, and Heatran.</p>

<p>Gliscor and Celebi give this set hell. Kyurem-B is a good partner for this reason, as it can destroy both with Ice Beam. There are also a number of Pokemon that can cause problems depending on the choice of third attack. Without Stone Edge, Dragonite can be a major issue, so pairing Breloom up with something that can eliminate Dragonite is a good idea. Landorus fits this bill nicely, and Bronzong can do the same while also providing Stealth Rock for the team. With Facade, it's important to have a check to Ghost-types, as it leaves Breloom completely unable to damage them. As such, including a strong Pursuit user on your team such as Tyranitar or Scizor can be very useful.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>While Breloom does pack a bit of a move kiddy-pool, it's still got a couple of useful options. Even with Technician, Superpower is the strongest general use Fighting-type move that Breloom has. However, it can also be a bit of a liability, as it weakens Breloom and renders it more susceptible to revenge killing, as well as forcing it to switch more often. Wake-Up Slap is a cute gimmick, especially with Technician. It's still got 90 Base Power, but when used against a sleeping opponent it gets bumped up to 120. This makes it gimmicky but semi-effective to finish off sleeping opponents quickly, though it's almost always outclassed by both Low Sweep and Force Palm, which provide far more immediate utility. Rock Tomb is potentially usable, but its low 75 Base Power after Technician makes it a questionable choice for any serious set. Finally, there's double powder. While paralysis is incredibly crippling, and Spore does tend to force switches, it's better to leave the powdering to Amoonguss, which is far more cut out for it. Breloom doesn't need to double powder--once it Spores something, it can move on to killing off bigger and better things.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Technician and Poison Heal Breloom have largely different counters, but there are some notable common ones. Celebi is the ultimate counter--not only does it outspeed Breloom, but it also resists both of its STABs, has Natural Cure to heal off Spore, commonly carries Psychic or Hidden Power Ice to dispatch Breloom, and is essentially impossible for Breloom to break down. Along the same lines, Amoonguss is extremely bulky, resists both of Breloom's STABs, and can simply switch out to heal off all of the damage it takes. On top of that, its super effective Poison STAB easily eliminates Breloom. Latias is faster, can hit Breloom hard with Dragon Pulse and Draco Meteor, and resists both its STABs. However, Latias's a bit riskier, as Life Orb variants of Breloom can use Low Sweep to slow it down for Spore and Choice Band variants have a chance to simply 2HKO it with Low Sweep after Stealth Rock. Finally, Gengar is a terror to all Breloom sets, resisting Bullet Seed and being immune to Mach Punch, Low Sweep, and Focus Punch. However, it has to be careful, as not only will Spore ruin its day but its defenses are fairly low and enough hits from Bullet Seed can put it down for good.</p>

<p>On to the Technician-specific counters. Volcarona is one of the most notable ones, as not only does it resist Mach Punch and Low Sweep, but it also has a double resistance to Bullet Seed, and can passively burn Breloom with Flame Body. However, Volcarona needs to be especially careful of Spore or Stone Edge after a Low Sweep or on the switch, so it's not foolproof. Mamoswine is faster than Breloom (guaranteed with Jolly) and can outspeed its Mach Punch with a super effective STAB Ice Shard. However, Adamant varieties can be outsped by Jolly Breloom, so when relying on Mamoswine to deal with Breloom, Jolly is a necessity. Finally, Skarmory is a semi-unreliable counter. It can deal with Swords Dance variants if need be due to its high Defense, but it can't switch into Low Sweep from the attacking set.</p>

<p>Poison Heal sets rely almost exclusively on Substitute, and as a result, multi-hit moves can be troublesome. Mamoswine tops this list, as its Icicle Spear can chew through Substitute and cancel Focus Punch for the defensive variant, while it has a chance to outright KO offensive variants. However, if it fails to OHKO, it is in danger of either Spore or Seed Bomb from the offensive version. Gliscor is extremely troublesome, as Poison Heal variants are immune to Spore and take a pittance from Focus Punch and neutral Seed Bomb. Finally, Tentacruel is trouble for the defensive set due to Liquid Ooze. While it can't exactly take Focus Punches all day, it can whittle away at Breloom with its own Leech Seed or Rapid Spin it off, and its resistance to Focus Punch does give it much more of a fighting chance.</p>
