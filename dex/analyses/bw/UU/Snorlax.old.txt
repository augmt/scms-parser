[Overview]

<p>Once the King of GSC OU, Snorlax took quite a few hits with each subsequent generation, finally dropping to UU along with long-time fellow OU Pokemon, Zapdos, in BW. With the rising popularity of Fighting-types, it struggles to maintain a big presence on the battlefield. Furthermore, lack of reliable recovery really hurts its durability&mdash;especially with the BW sleep mechanics. However, its amazing HP stat and great special bulk make it one of the few able to reliably check a complete offensive spectrum, taking on special powerhouses such as Nidoking or Zapdos. Snorlax is also the most trustworthy answer to Chandelure, one of the biggest threats in the metagame. With its good base 110 Attack stat, it can keep offensive pressure with ease, be it with a Choice Band or by setting up with its old Curse set.</p>

<p>Taking everything previously stated into account, Snorlax continues to be a great addition to any team, countering specific prominent threats, such as Offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus or Substitute+Calm Mind Raikou, very aptly. Even though it's much less metagame-defining than it once was, it can take credit for being a staple of the Underused metagame and one of the most used Pokemon overall.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Offensive Snorlax is very useful on offensive teams, being able to switch into many special attackers and hit back hard thanks to its fully invested base 110 Attack stat. Return is the main option for a STAB move, being able to hit Pokemon such as Shaymin and Zapdos hard; Body Slam is an alternative due to the added paralysis chance, but its damage output makes it the lesser choice. Pursuit is arguably the draw of the set, allowing Snorlax to remove the Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon&mdash;Chandelure being the most notable target, since it fears Earthquake&mdash;that it forces out, possibly opening up a path for a partner to sweep. Earthquake lets Snorlax hit Rhyperior and Cobalion, both of which would otherwise get in nearly unscathed to set up on it. For the last slot, the best options are Crunch and Fire Punch, the former hitting Cofagrigus hard&mdash;allowing Snorlax to counter the Offensive Trick Room version&mdash;and dealing more to Slowbro and Mew than the other three moves, and the latter allowing Snorlax to get past Bronzong and Escavalier, while beating Abomasnow more easily. Fire Punch is also good against Shaymin if Snorlax runs Body Slam over Return.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread maximizes Snorlax's offensive presence while allowing it to avoid the OHKO from a +1 Kingdra's Outrage after Stealth Rock, the 52 Defense EVs also let it survive two Outrages from Jolly Choice Scarf Flygon around 85% of the time without Stealth Rock on the field. The rest of the EVs go into Special Defense to make better use of its great special bulk, with 4 Speed EVs to get the jump on opposing base 30s such as Slowbro and Cofagrigus. Choice Band is the main item due to the added damage output, but Leftovers allow Snorlax to last longer and let it switch moves. While the listed spread is arguably the most effective, an alternate one of 252 Atk / 88 Def / 172 SpD with an Adamant nature can work with Leftovers to ensure Snorlax isn't 2HKOed by non-Choice Band Crobat's Brave Bird after Stealth Rock damage. Thick Fat is the only ability worth using, since it allows Snorlax to be the best answer to Chandelure, one of the hardest hitting Pokemon in the tier; it also lets it be a last-minute check to physical Fire- and Ice-type Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Victini and Choice Band Weavile.</p>

<p>Double-Edge is another option for a STAB move, being more powerful than a super effective Crunch, and working decently alongside Snorlax's massive HP stat. Without Leftovers though, Snorlax won't be able to check special attackers such as Zapdos and Raikou as well due to the recoil, therefore Return is usually a better option. Ice Punch can be used in the last slot to beat Gligar, though the latter is faster and can therefore Roost in Snorlax's face. It can work when combined with Leftovers and Body Slam paralysis, though. Seed Bomb is also an alternative to hit Rhyperior harder and beat Swampert one on one. Protect is a great option with Leftovers, giving it extra recovery and scouting for Choice users, especially notable against Fighting-types such as Heracross and Mienshao. Finally, Self-Destruct could be an option due to it being a 200 Base Power STAB move capable of OHKOing Slowbro. However, it faces legality issues with Pursuit, the primary of this set.</p>

<p>When looking for partners, Fighting-types such as Heracross and Mienshao deserve a mention, since they appreciate the removal or weakening of Ghost- and Psychic-types. As Snorlax's only weakness is Fighting, a Pokemon that can absorb those moves with ease also works well. The best examples are Choice Specs Slowbro and Offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus, since they make good switches into Fighting-types and are good on offensive teams. Finally, to guarantee Snorlax will be able to tank hits for most of the match, Rapid Spin support is recommended. Hitmontop and Blastoise are the best for the job, but they are hard to fit into offensive teams, so Magic Bounce Xatu is and option to prevent hazards from being set and keeping the momentum.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>A staple of the GSC era of Snorlax dominance, Curse Snorlax continues to be a threat. Taking a more offensive approach to the classic set, this set forfeits Rest in order to get three-move coverage. As such, it shouldn't be seen as a last-Pokemon sweeper but as an early wallbreaker by setting up on the special attackers it easily checks, mainly Chandelure, Zapdos, and Raikou. Curse boosts Snorlax's great Attack and passable Defense stats at the cost of its already low Speed stat. Return is the STAB move of choice, with Crunch to hit Ghost-types, Mew, and Slowbro harder. The last move is for specific Pokemon: Earthquake hits Cobalion and Rhyperior harder, while Fire Punch helps against Bronzong and Escavalier, still hitting Cobalion super-effectively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>The EVs allow Snorlax to always survive Choice Scarf Mienshao's High Jump Kick and Choice Scarf Heracross's Close Combat after one Curse boost, at the same time avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Band Flygon's Outrage, and always take two Thunderbolts from Choice Specs Zapdos. The rest goes into Snorlax's Attack stat to grant it more offensive presence. Adamant is the preferred nature for more power, hitting hard with Return even before setting up. Seed Bomb can be used to beat Rhyperior more reliably, since the latter avoids being 2HKOed by +1 Earthquake without investing into its Defense stat. It also disposes of Blastoise or Swampert that could try to Toxic or Roar Snorlax away. Self-Destruct can work as a secondary STAB move, getting a kill on stuff that prevent a teammate from sweeping, hitting incredibly hard after one Curse: to get a frame of reference, it deals roughly the same amount of damage to Rhyperior as Earthquake, it has a good chance of beating max Defense Blastoise before the latter can Roar Snorlax out, and it can even OHKO Slowbro with Spikes support.</p>

<p>Depending on Snorlax's last move, it will struggle with specific threats. If it goes for Earthquake, Bronzong and Escavalier will wall it, so Fire-types like Chandelure or Rotom-H are good partners to deal with those walls. However, if it chooses Fire Punch, it won't stand a chance against Rhyperior and defensive Empoleon&mdash;offensive variants dislike boosted Returns&mdash;so Shaymin or Choice Specs Slowbro with Trick will be good teammates; the latter will also be able to deal with the Fighting-types that force Snorlax out, specifically Mienshao and Cobalion. Since this set's purpose is to smash things after a boost, having a secondary special tank is a good idea. Rhyperior is excellent in that regard, as it can bait Zapdos and Raikou into using Hidden Power, letting Snorlax switch in more safely. Nidoqueen can perform similarly, and also switch into Heracross and Scrafty with ease. Finally, Spikes support helps Snorlax greatly. Froslass and Roserade are the best for that position, the former acting as a spinblocker and the latter absorbing Scalds from bulky Water-types, such as Suicune.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This acts as the old Curse Snorlax that dominated a huge part of GSC OU, taking a more defensive approach. This Snorlax has been renowned as one of the most resilient last-Pokemon sweepers, since its sole weakness makes it harder to KO on the special side while it boosts its physical defense. While it isn't as good as it once was, considering the offensive nature of the metagame, it can still prove to be a threat. Body Slam is the STAB of choice for the paralysis chance, helping Snorlax boost more reliably. Earthquake and Crunch are the options for coverage, the former hitting Rhyperior and Cobalion, and the latter helping against Cofagrigus and Slowbro. Rest allows Snorlax to set up without fear on Zapdos and Raikou, since Snorlax can survive three hits before having to use Rest.</p>


[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread turns Snorlax into an amazing special tank, avoiding the 3HKO from Life Orb Modest Zapdos and Timid Choice Specs Raikou, while also taking two Surfs from Life Orb Kingdra in Rain. Additionally, the 188 Defense EVs allow it to survive two V-Creates from Jolly Choice Band Victini after Stealth Rock damage. Snorlax can also survive a High Jump Kick from Reckless Choice Scarf Mienshao at +1. If running Crunch, an alternate spread of 144 HP / 76 Atk / 112 Def / 176 SpD with a Careful nature can be used to guarantee the OHKO at +1 on 120/0 Chandelure, after a switch into Stealth Rock. Chesto Berry is an option over Leftovers to get instant recovery with Rest, although Leftovers are generally better in the long-run. Double-Edge can work over Body Slam with a spread of 80 HP / 176 Atk / 96 Def / 156 SpD and an Adamant nature, since with Rest, Snorlax doesn't mind the recoil much. Sleep Talk can be used to act as a mono-attacker, provided Snorlax has heavy Pursuit support to take care of Ghost-types. Fire Punch hits all Steel-types, while also beating Shaymin and Abomasnow more reliably; however, it would prevent Snorlax from hitting Chandelure.</p>

<p>Since this set struggles with Cobalion and Rhyperior&mdash;the former setting up on Snorlax and the latter phazing it with Dragon Tail&mdash;especially if it isn't running Earthquake, Slowbro makes for a good partner, as it can take little from their moves and even set up on them. Cleric support can be used if Snorlax is forced to Rest early and can't stay in, giving it a second chance to set up. Roserade and Togekiss are good options, the former forcing Rhyperior out and being able to set up Spikes or put a Pokemon to sleep, and the latter taking advantage of the removal or weakening of Electric-types. Finally, if not running Crunch, a Pursuit user is helpful to damage Ghost-types that don't mind Earthquake: Guts Heracross and Houndoom are the best options, absorbing Will-O-Wisps due to their abilities.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Body Slam
move 4: Whirlwind
item: Leftovers
ability: Thick Fat
nature: Careful
evs: 144 HP / 188 Def / 176 SpD 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This was at one point the premier special wall of the Underused metagame, and continues to be useful. Even with the revised sleep mechanics, Snorlax is a viable Rest + Sleep Talk user due to its great natural bulk and access to Whirlwind to phaze away things trying to set up on it. Body Slam is the only attacking move needed, possibly spreading paralysis even while asleep. Whirlwind forces Pokemon out to rack up hazard damage; it works great alongside Body Slam and Sleep Talk, since the latter bypasses Whirlwind's negative priority when Snorlax is up against a paralyzed opponent. Rest gives it a form of recovery, while Sleep Talk means it won't be a sitting duck while asleep.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread allows Snorlax to survive two V-creates from Choice Band Victini, while also not being 3HKOed by Modest Life Orb Zapdos's and Choice Specs Raikou's Thunderbolt. If you dislike the idea of a mono-attacking set, Crunch can be used instead of Sleep Talk or Whirlwind to hit Ghost-types such as Chandelure, while also dealing decent damage to Slowbro and Cofagrigus.</p>

<p>Since this set is amazing at racking up residual damage, hazard setters are mandatory. Roserade and Froslass are good partners, both laying Spikes reliably while also resisting or being immune to Fighting-type moves. Roserade can also run Aromatherapy, which could be helpful should Snorlax forgo Sleep Talk. Since neither can switch into coverage moves from Fighting-types, a main answer to them as well as Rhyperior is of need. Slowbro and Cofagrigus are both great physical walls to take those on, while having enough offensive presence to not become setup fodder. Slowbro can even take advantage of the paralysis spreading to get a late-game sweep with Calm Mind.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Outside of the moves listed, Snorlax has other options it can run. It can use Rest + three attacks with Chesto Berry for instant recovery, or Belly Drum to mimic its old offensive set from GSC with two attacking moves and Rest, although neither option help it much, and the huge boost isn't worth losing half its health&mdash;especially considering Snorlax usually takes two hits before moving. Every set can run either one of Double-Edge, Return, or Body Slam as a STAB move, but each has one that goes better with Snorlax's purpose. As coverage options, it learns Seed Bomb, Zen Headbutt, Ice Punch, Wild Charge, and Superpower, each nailing a different Pokemon. Snorlax also has a good special movepool, with Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, and Blizzard, for example, but its low Special Attack means it's unable to put them to good use. Finally, it has borderline-viable support moves in Toxic, Counter, Yawn, and Stockpile to aid its teammates.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>While straight-out countering Snorlax isn't an easy task, Rhyperior is the closest to that position as long as Snorlax isn't running Seed Bomb, since Rhyperior doesn't mind the paralysis and doesn't take much from unboosted Earthquakes, hitting back hard with its own STAB Earthquakes. Rhyperior can also phaze Curse variants, although that isn't as reliable in the lategame. Fighting-types such as Cobalion and Heracross can switch in on some sets, but neither enjoy being paralyzed and they are hit hard by Snorlax's offensive sets. Shed Skin Scrafty doesn't mind paralysis and can set up on Snorlax, but it doesn't enjoy taking STAB Returns and it can't beat Snorlax if Scrafty switched in while it used Curse. Bulky Intimidate Scrafty, on the other hand, can even switch into Choice Band-boosted Returns and force Snorlax out, though it won't enjoy getting paralyzed by Body Slam variants. Cofagrigus needs to avoid Crunch, but can otherwise set up alongside it with Nasty Plot or Calm Mind and hit it with Hidden Power Fighting, moving first if Snorlax uses Curse. Defensive Cofagrigus can't directly harm it, but it can beat Curse variants with a combination of Will-O-Wisp and Haze, disrupting a possible sweep.</p>

<p>Tricking a Choice Specs or a Choice Scarf is generally a good way of dealing with Snorlax, since only the offensive sets don't mind being locked into a move. Rotom-H and Chandelure are good lures for it, though the latter needs to worry about Pursuit on the way out. Those two can also lure Snorlax and use Will-O-Wisp, which can mean the end for Snorlax if it doesn't have Rest. Stallbreakers such as Mew, Crobat, and Mismagius can make short work of non-Offensive Snorlax with Taunt, preventing it from using Rest and Curse. However, they can't directly switch in without knowing the sets, since Return and Crunch, respectively, hit them hard.</p>

<p>Finally, submitting Snorlax to much offensive pressure is generally a good option, since non-Rest variants become unable to stop Zapdos and Raikou, and Rest variants can be taken advantage of while asleep. Strong special attackers like Nidoking or Choice Specs Yanmega usually do a great job of wearing Snorlax down. Incoming switches need to be wary of Sleep Talk, though.</p>
