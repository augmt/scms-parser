[Overview]

<p>In a tier packed to the brim with Fighting-types, Virizion stands out from the crowd with its rare Grass / Fighting typing, shared only with the OU Breloom. Its Grass typing allows Virizion to get past the archenemy of Fighting-types, Slowbro, with either Leaf Blade or Giga Drain. It also boasts solid mixed offensive stats of 90 apiece, which is complemented by two excellent boosting moves in Swords Dance and Calm Mind, allowing Virizion to fulfill the role of a fast and powerful physical sweeper or a bulky yet speedy special sweeper.</p>

<p>However, every Pokemon has their faults, and Virizion is no exception. It suffers from a massive weakness to Flying, meaning that Pokemon such as Tornadus and Crobat can come in on both of Virizion's STABs and proceed to eliminate it with Hurricane or Brave Bird. Its STABs don't have great coverage, so it must beware of that. Moreover, although Virizion sports a massive base 129 Special Defense, it also has mediocre base 72 Defense, so it can be hit hard by any physical attack. Don't let these faults deter you from using Virizion though; if you play it to its strengths, it will serve you well.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Leaf Blade
move 3: Close Combat
move 4: Stone Edge
item: Life Orb / Lum Berry
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With acceptable Attack and Speed stats, Virizion is a great candidate for a Swords Dance set; after a single boost, it packs enough firepower to plow through most of the tier. Its Grass typing allows it to get past most bulky Water-types that other Fighting-types have trouble with, namely Slowbro and Swampert. It also sports excellent 91 / 72 / 129 bulk to be able to set up on threats such as Raikou, Blastoise, and Snorlax and sweep effectively.</p>

<p>Swords Dance boosts Virizion's Attack to a high level. Leaf Blade is the first STAB; it provides decent coverage while also hitting most bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Suicune super effectively. Close Combat is a strong Fighting-type STAB that can hurt anything that doesn't resist it, such as Registeel and Empoleon. Last but not least, Stone Edge is a coverage move to get around Chandelure, Tornadus, and Crobat, Pokemon that take little from Virizion's other attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Maximum EVs are invested into Attack and Speed in order to ensure that Virizion attains its maximum potential as a sweeper. Life Orb is the preferred item to boost Virizion's power; however, Virizion appreciates nether being worn down by recoil nor being crippled by a burn, so Lum Berry is an option to get past Sableye as well as setting up on Scald. Alternatively, one can drop Stone Edge and use Hidden Power Ice along with a Hasty Nature and an EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe to hit Gligar.</p>

<p>Entry hazards are essential to this set's success. Qwilfish and Froslass can set up Spikes while Registeel, Bronzong, and Rhyperior are good at setting up Stealth Rock. However, these are also this set's enemy; therefore, Blastoise and Claydol are both fine picks to spin them away. Rhyperior is a good ally to deal with Flying-types such as Tornadus and Crobat, which would otherwise threaten Virizion with their STAB. A Dark-type such as Honchkrow or Bisharp is also a decent ally to deal with Mew and Azelf.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Hidden Power Rock / Hidden Power Ice
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 20 HP / 252 SpA / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Virizion utilizes Calm Mind very well, as it can take on bulky Water-types pretty well thanks to its Grass / Fighting typing. Calm Mind is the key move, boosting both of Virizion's special stats to high levels. Giga Drain is the primary STAB, and provides reliable recovery while also a reasonably powerful attack. Focus Blast is the Fighting STAB of choice; although it's inaccurate, it is very powerful, and deals with Steel-types. Hidden Power Rock is the preferred coverage move in the last slot, as it defeats Chandelure and Crobat, two important targets that resist Virizion's STABs. Hidden Power Ice is usable as well, hitting Roserade, Shaymin, and opposing Virizion super effectively while maintaining coverage on Crobat.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>236 EVs are invested into Speed to outspeed positive-natured base 105s, as due to Hidden Power Rock cutting Speed by one point, Virizion is unable to Speed tie with Cobalion and opposing Virizion. If Hidden Power Ice is used, then an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe is preferred to tie with opposing base 108s. A Life Orb is the preferred item, as it grants more firepower, and the residual damage can be patched up by Giga Drain. Leftovers is a usable alternative if staying power is preferred; however, Virizion will usually want the extra power Life Orb provides.</p>

<p>Rhyperior is a recommended ally, as it can take on Chandelure and Crobat, as well as set up Stealth Rock. Additionally, a Dark-type such as Bisharp or Krookodile is helpful to eliminate Psychic-types such as Azelf and Mew, both of which can use Psyshock to eliminate Virizion. Finally, a Pokemon capable of setting up Spikes, such as Froslass or Qwilfish, can be immensely helpful to allow Virizion to attain some important KOs, most notably on Snorlax, Suicune, and Mew.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Virizion has a few other options in its arsenal. Substitute is a decent option to allow Virizion to attain boosts more easily, especially on the Calm Mind set. However, this requires forgoing an important coverage move, something you must keep in mind when considering it. X-Scissor is a decent option on the Swords Dance set to get rid of Mew and Azelf, but is generally inferior to Stone Edge. Aerial Ace is also a usable option to hit Heracross, but is not very useful otherwise. Energy Ball is a strong Grass-type move that can be useful on the Calm Mind set, but is inferior to Giga Drain, which trades a little less power for recovery. Like the other Swords of Justice, Virizion has access to their signature move Sacred Sword, which is an acceptable alternative over Close Combat if the defense drops are undesirable; however, it is considerably weaker.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Crobat is the number one counter to Virizion: it resists both of Virizion's STABs and can retaliate with a powerful Brave Bird. However, it cannot switch into a Hidden Power Ice and Rock or Stone Edge. Heracross and Chandelure resist Virizion's STABs as well, and can retaliate with Close Combat and Fire Blast, respectively, however, Chandelure will need to watch out for Stone Edge or Hidden Power Rock. Zapdos can come in safely on Virizion's STABs and hit back with Heat Wave, but must be wary of switching in on Hidden Power Ice and Rock or Stone Edge. Amoonguss and Cresselia wall Virizion to no end and can cripple it with Spore or Thunder Wave, respectively, while Amoonguss can clear all of Virizion's stat boosts with Clear Smog. Escavalier can hurt Virizion with a high-powered Megahorn. Finally, any Pokemon who can outspeed and hit Virizion hard, such as Azelf or Durant, will also check it decently.</p>
