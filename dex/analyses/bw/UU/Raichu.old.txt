[Overview]

<p>Just like its infamous pre-evolution, Raichu is truly a hazardous and mediocre Pokemon to consider, no sugar coating involved. In an environment where many Electric-type Pokemon reign supreme (many of them being OU last generation), the electric mouse constantly struggles to find a stable niche. Some of Raichu's qualities are outdone in certain areas, and it is generally frailer and slower than most other Electric-types.</p>

<p>While Raichu obviously isn't game-breaking in terms of usefulness, it has semi-exclusive perks that differentiate it from its competition in UU. Nasty Plot, complemented by decent offensive stats, is something that Raichu proudly boasts. Furthermore, although there is a variety of similar sweepers available, such as Raikou and Jolteon, only Raichu is able to handle itself against special walls effectively. Additionally, thanks to the graces of the Dream World, Raichu receives Lightningrod as its new ability, granting it an immunity to Thunder Wave and expanding its list of targets.</p>

<p>It is important to take Raichu's advantages and niche into consideration. Raichu is still Raichu; unless you're exploiting it for its unique qualities and incredible power (with Nasty Plot), you should instead consider the other Electric-type staples. Overall, Raichu is up there with other niche Pokemon such as Jumpluff; it's not fantastic, but it will serve you well when the opportunity presents itself.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Raichu's access to Nasty Plot is one of the only reasons to ever use it over other Electric-type Pokemon in UU, and it does an amazing job at special sweeping when given the chance to use it. With a Timid nature, after one Nasty Plot boost, its already decent Special Attack is doubled to 558, enabling Raichu to slash through teams before going down. To put this into perspective, Raichu's power output after one Nasty Plot boost is greater than Raikou's after one Calm Mind boost.</p>

<p>Raichu has other perks that allow it to sweep all the more easily; Encore, in tandem with Lightningrod and the popularity of slower Pokemon with support moves, scores it many confident opportunities to attack or use Nasty Plot. If used correctly, Encore gives Raichu a chance to get past nearly any special wall.</p>

<p>Aside from the obligatory STAB Thunderbolt, either Hidden Power Ice or Grass Knot give Raichu good dual coverage. Hidden Power Ice is the preferred choice out of the two, as it provides greater overall coverage in hitting Grass-types super effectively. Grass Knot, despite leaving Raichu vulnerable to the likes of Roserade, is notable for removing certain troublesome Ground-types such as Mamoswine and Quagsire. If you feel Encore is unnecessary, Focus Blast can be used to cover Mamoswine, Rotom-H, and Registeel.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Although Raichu can break through walls and sweep at any point in the battle, it's best used mid- to late-game. Before sending Raichu out for sweeping, ensure that faster Pokemon (including those holding a Choice Scarf) are taken care of by the appropriate teammate. As far as other problems are concerned, Raichu has a hard time switching into anything other than Electric-type attacks. A more reliable way of executing a sweep is by locking the target into an Electric-type attack or non-damaging move, then using Nasty Plot. Given the amount of slower Pokemon in UU, there are a number of opportunities to attempt this, ranging from any given Thunder Wave user to a Roserade using Spikes.</p>

<p>Ideally, your team should be prepared for the most common speedy threats, such as Mismagius, Flygon, and Cobalion, to name a few. If possible, consider using bulky offensive support or your own revenge killer to fence off these kind of foes. If Raichu chooses to use Encore, you must also provide it with specific offensive support to cover any threats it can't hit hard enough. Of course, entry hazards assist any offensive Pokemon, and Raichu is no exception, as they allow him to deal with a handful of Sturdy Pokemon. Finally, you may consider Wynaut for its ability to trap and kill any troublesome foe, in addition to easing prediction with its own Encore.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Raichu boasts a surprisingly colorful movepool when compared to its Electric-type brethren. However, these other options are either outclassed or wasted on it. Other ways to boost Raichu's stats, mainly Agility and Choice Specs, may look good on paper, but at this point, you're almost better off using the naturally fast and powerful Raikou or Manectric. Raichu also has access to several whimsical support options, such as Charm, Teeter Dance, Tickle, Magnet Rise, and Yawn. Some of these options, however, are better used on a dedicated support Pokemon, and using some of them means the unfortunate loss of Lightningrod.</p>

<p>Raichu also sports a decent base 90 Attack stat along with a few good physical attacks, though a physical set has lost some of its value from last generation due to its inability to get past certain walls in the current metagame. A mixed set would probably be the best approach to using any physical moves at all, as Raichu achieves great coverage with just Volt Tackle and Focus Punch. Even then, there are better choices for mixed attacking, such as Zoroark and Sharpedo.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Revenge killing is, naturally, the most straightforward and reliable way to dispose of Raichu, given its only above-average Speed, frailty, and lack of relevant resistances. Assuming it avoids all attacks bar Thunderbolt, Dugtrio is easily the best counter due its ability to outspeed, trap, and wipe Raichu out with Earthquake. On this note, naturally fast attackers or Choice Scarf users, such as Flygon and Heracross, can also easily eliminate Raichu with the appropriate attack.</p>

<p>Defensively speaking, most walls have a harder time stomaching Encore or Raichu's boosted moves, as it can boost twice as fast as your usual Electric-type attacker. If Raichu is running Encore, however, it only has room for two coverage moves, so depending on the secondary move, Raichu will always be walled by specific threats. These are most Grass-types if using Grass Knot, and Electric-immune Water-types if using Hidden Power Ice. Finally, if Raichu lacks Focus Blast, it will have problems with Jolteon, Rotom-H, and Abomasnow.</p>
