[Overview]

<p>With a great movepool, awesome typing, and two fantastic abilities, Ludicolo can be a force to be reckoned with. The ability to run both physically- and specially-based offensive sets while also being able to act as a defensive pivot with the combination of Substitute + Leech Seed is not something the average Pokemon can claim. With Ludicolo's abilities offering either blistering Speed or the capacity for huge amounts of recovery in the rain, he is one of the best rain abusers in UU. Ludicolo is not perfect though; his Speed is mediocre outside of rain, and he must depend on Swords Dance if he wants to do much physical damage. Don't let that dissuade you from using him, though, as he is a solid Pokemon and a monster on rain teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Ludicolo has a great movepool that is backed by a decent base 90 Special Attack. In the rain, his Speed is doubled, thanks to Swift Swim, and Hydro Pump--or Surf, but the power drop is really noticeable--becomes incredibly powerful by effectively gaining another STAB boost, which makes Ludicolo a very fast and powerful sweeper. The other moves are self-explanatory: Giga Drain is used for a second STAB and pseudo-recovery move, and Ice Beam is used because of its fantastic coverage alongside Ludicolo's STABs. Rain Dance is used in the last slot in order to change the weather and renew Swift Swim, but Rain Dance support from Damp Rock Uxie or Azelf is still recommended.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is very simple: max Speed to let Ludicolo outspeed most of the metagame under rain and max Special Attack to hit as hard as possible. A Modest nature is probably the better choice in order to hit harder, but a Timid nature lets Ludicolo outspeed positive-nature Choice Scarf base 109 Pokemon.</p>

<p>This set appreciates entry hazards for breaking potential Focus Sashes and Pokemon with the Sturdy ability, while also assisting Ludicolo in getting more KOs. Donphan is a good partner for Ludicolo; not only do they have nice type synergy, but Donphan also helps by taking the physical hits that Ludicolo is not fond of and providing Rapid Spin support, adding to Ludicolo's survivability. Registeel can also fit the job of laying down Stealth Rock. It and Ludicolo have good synergy together, and Registeel can set up hazards and cripple opponents with status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave, making Ludicolo's job easier.</p>

<p>Special walls are always Ludicolo's worst nightmare. Registeel and Lanturn can take a hit and cripple Ludicolo with Thunder Wave, but for that to work, another Pokemon has to go down since they both get 2HKOed by Hydro Pump, and Hydro Pump + Giga Drain, respectively. Lanturn can be a good partner for Ludicolo, since she can absorb the opponent's Thunder Wave and, with rain set up, deal a lot of damage with Hydro Pump and Thunder.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Seed Bomb / Bullet Seed
move 4: Ice Punch / Rain Dance

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Despite coming off Ludicolo's lower attacking stat, a physical sweeper set can be potent as well. Taking advantage of the best Attack boosting move in the game (and the only boosting move he learns other than Hone Claws), and Ludicolo's great movepool, this set can be very dangerous. It does need Rain Dance support though, since Ludicolo has no way of setting it up himself without Rain Dance because he requires a moveslot for a Swords Dance. Waterfall is the only decent physical Water-type move Ludicolo learns, so it's a must have. The choice between Seed Bomb and Bullet Seed is up to personal preference. Seed Bomb is a reliable move, but Bullet Seed can break Substitutes that your opponents set up in order to stall out your rain turns. Ice Punch can deal with common Pokemon that resist Ludicolo's STAB moves, but Rain Dance can help continue Ludicolo's sweep.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is pretty simple: max Speed allows Ludicolo to outspeed the large majority of the UU metagame in the rain and max Attack lets him hit as hard as possible. An Adamant nature seems to be the best option considering Ludicolo's not-so-great Attack stat, but Jolly lets Ludicolo outspeed Choice Scarf base 109 Speed Pokemon.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock is a common need for sweepers in order to make their job easier, and Ludicolo is not an exception. Bronzong and Cobalion are solid partners for Ludicolo, as they both have nice synergy with him and can set up those entry hazards Ludicolo loves.</p>


<p>Eviolite Dusclops and Ferroseed can work around this set pretty easily. Dusclops, with its amazing Defense stat and the boost from Eviolite, can take Ludicolo's hits with relative ease, and counter with a Will-O-Wisp, which makes Swords Dance Ludicolo completely useless, and recover some health with Pain Split or Rest. Ferroseed resists Ludicolo's dual STAB attacks, is neutral to Ice Punch, and can cripple Ludicolo with Thunder Wave, making his ability useless and making Ludicolo vulnerable to getting revenge killed.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Ludicolo can run an attacking combination of Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, and Drain Punch, which provides excellent super effective coverage, but loses out on Ludicolo's fantastic STABs. A few other offensive options include Zen Headbutt, Fake Out, Energy Ball, Grass Knot, and Focus Blast. On the support side, he can set up all the weathers bar Sandstorm--and can take advantage of all the weathers he sets up with Blizzard and Solar Beam, if it fits your fancy--and can use Haze as well.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Eviolite Dusclops is probably the best counter to Ludicolo. With massive defenses and Will-O-Wisp to deal with the Swords Dance set, it is worth carrying a counter to it (or at least something with Knock Off, Trick, or Switcheroo). Also, because Ludicolo depends on the rain, he doesn't like Abomasnow. Abomasnow can take most things Ludicolo has to offer, especially due to its neutrality to Ice Beam, and can hit back hard with moves such as Wood Hammer or Blizzard.</p>
