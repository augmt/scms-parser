[Overview] 

<p>Save for a few brief stints in OU, Weezing has been a defensive behemoth in the UU tier throughout its existence. With the release of Black and White, Weezing has returned to its original role as the best Fighting-type counter in UU. Weezing's Poison typing, along with its ability, Levitate, gives it a lone weakness to Psychic-type attacks, an immunity to Ground-type moves, and, more importantly, a useful Fighting-type resistance. This, coupled with Weezing's excellent Defense and access to useful moves such as Haze, Pain Split, and Will-O-Wisp, makes it the ideal addition to any team plagued by Fighting-type threats such as Hitmontop.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Weezing can take advantage of its high Defense, typing, access to coverage options such as Flamethrower and Thunderbolt, and usable base 85 Special Attack to serve as a utility counter to many physical attackers in UU. Flamethrower and Thunderbolt enable Weezing to effectively counter physical attackers such as Heracross and Swellow. However, either can be replaced by Haze, which allows Weezing to stop most set-up sweepers in their tracks, even those that pack Substitute. Pain Split turns Weezing's low base 65 HP into an asset, giving it a form of recovery, while Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and also chips away at their HP.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs maximize Weezing's physical bulk; investing in its weaker Special Defense will be a futile endeavor, as Weezing dies to special attacks anyway. Fire Blast is a viable option to run over Flamethrower, as it allows Weezing to 2HKO offensive Torterra; however, Fire Blast is generally inferior due to its lower PP and lower accuracy. Hidden Power Grass hits Rhyperior and Water-types, but lacks coverage otherwise. Sludge Bomb can be used for a STAB move, but it has poor coverage and can end up poisoning a foe that Weezing would have rather burned with Will-O-Wisp.</p>

<p>Weezing has issues with strong special attackers thanks to its low Special Defense. Psychic-types in particular can easily dispatch Weezing with their super effective STAB attacks. Thus, Weezing appreciates the support of specially defensive Pokemon that can take Psychic-type attacks, such as Empoleon. Will-O-Wisp must also not be thrown about recklessly, as Weezing could end up burning Guts abusers such as Heracross; however, Heracross is put in its place easily with Flamethrower.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Explosion can put a dent in special walls that Weezing can do little to, but it won't be hitting very hard as Explosion no longer halves Defense. Weezing also has the movepool to run a special attacking set, but it doesn't hit nearly hard enough to be anything more than a surprise gimmick. Weezing can run Taunt to prevent things from setting up on it, but it won't work as well as other Taunt users due to a lack of reliable recovery, and Weezing already has Haze to eliminate stat boosts anyway. Weezing also gets Rest and Sleep Talk; however, with the sleep counter resetting upon every switch out, this tactic is not as effective as it has been in previous generations.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Psychic-type special attackers such as Mew are Weezing's prime checks, as they will destroy it with their STAB attacks. Weezing also despises faster special attackers with access to Substitute, such as Mismagius, as it has no way of damaging them. Strong special attacks in general are sufficient to break through Weezing's low Special Defense. Pokemon that don't fear burns or can get rid of the status, such as Roserade, can just switch in and set up entry hazards, though Roserade must be wary of Flamethrower. While Weezing has Haze to deter stat boosters, it can't do anything to prevent hazards or other supporting moves from being used if it doesn't opt for Taunt. Fire-types such as Victini, Arcanine, and Houndoom can easily beat Weezing, as they are immune to burns and aren't hit for super effective damage by any of Weezing's attacks; Houndoom even receives a Flash Fire boost when it switches in on Will-O-Wisp or Flamethrower.</p>
