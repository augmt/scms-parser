[Overview]

<p>Slowking is usually overlooked in UU in favor of Slowbro, whose higher physical defense lets it defend against dangerous offensive behemoths such as Darmanitan and Victini. However, there are a few specially offensive threats in UU, most notably Kingdra, that make Slowking worth looking into. With a specially oriented EV spread, Slowking becomes one of the most foolproof Kingdra switch-ins in the tier, and can also provide a reliable answer to Azelf, Nasty Plot Mew, offensive Nidoqueen, and Nidoking.</p>

<p>Aside from the ability to tank such powerful moves as Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor and Fire Blast from Kingdra and Chandelure, respectively, Dragon Tail is the one useful thing Slowking has over Slowbro. Phazing is one of the most traditional, and fundamental strategies of bulky Water-types--handy for blowing away enemies untroubled by their lower powered attacks, and critical against foes with means of getting around status like the aforementioned Kingdra. While Slowbro's lack of a phazing attack sometimes leaves it a liability, Slowking excels in utility where it lacks in physical brawn.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This variant of Slowking has more general metagame utility than the more specially defensive variants, but often finds itself missing the sheer physical bulk that Slowbro has, which prevents it from checking obscenely powerful threats such as Life Orb Darmanitan. Instead, it trades this physical bulk for access to Dragon Tail and the ability to take on powerful special attackers which Slowbro cannot; Choice Specs Chandelure locked into Fire Blast, for example. Scald is Slowking's obligatory STAB move; it deals consistent damage and has a handy 30% burn rate. Dragon Tail is one of the main reasons to use Slowking over Slowbro, and is very useful for those free turns where Slowking forces a switch. It also throws out foes like Suicune, Kingdra, or Togekiss that use moves like Rest or Heal Bell to get rid of status as they boost. Slack Off provides additional recovery in case Regenerator is not enough. Thunder Wave spreads paralysis for Slowking's teammates to take advantage of, and allows it to cripple many of the Pokemon it'll be switching into.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs and nature allow Slowking to always break 4/0 Kingdra's Substitutes with Dragon Tail, and then maximize Slowking's physical bulk. Psyshock is a decent alternative in the fourth moveslot, as it gives Slowking a means of badly injuring the common Roserade. Specifically, it OHKOes offensive variants and does upwards of 80% to defensive ones. As another alternative, Fire Blast hits several common switch-ins to Slowking, namely Shaymin and Roserade, decently hard, and also maims threats such as Cobalion and Escavalier. It's worth noting that you should never even consider forgoing Dragon Tail on this set, otherwise you'll literally be using a statistically inferior Slowbro.</p>

<p>Although it might seem as though Slowking can take on offensive behemoths such as Life Orb Darmanitan and Choice Band Victini, it simply does not have the physical bulk to do so. Instead, this Slowking is meant to provide utility, and abuse Regenerator to scout against a wide variety of threats and handle them jointly with the appropriate teammates. Rhyperior thus makes an excellent partner to this set, as it can easily defeat the aforementioned threats, take advantage of the paralysis Slowking spreads, and lay down Stealth Rock for Slowking to take advantage of with Dragon Tail. Escavalier is another great partner to this set as it can take advantage of paralyzed opponents, easily switch into and take out Roserade with Pursuit, and tank Kingdra's Draco Meteor so that Slowking doesn't have to.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Slowking might seem to be outclassed by its fellow bulky Water-types Slowbro and Milotic, it does fill a good niche in being one of the--if not the--best Kingdra switch-ins in the tier. This set steers away from the traditional role of bulky Water-types as physical tanks, and instead opts to check special attackers such as Nidoking and Azelf. Dragon Tail is vital for this purpose, as it allows Slowking to phaze away Dragon Dance Kingdra; phazing is generally useful to have as well. Scald gives Slowking a reliable STAB move with a handy 30% burn rate, which helps patch up its weaker defensive stat. Slack Off gives Slowking greater staying power and keeps it healthy throughout the game, while Thunder Wave spreads paralysis for Slowking's teammates to take advantage of. Alternatively, Fire Blast provides good coverage as it fends off Grass-type switch-ins by hitting Shaymin and Roserade for about 50%. At the same time, it gives Slowking a good move to combat other dangerous threats, such as Escavalier and Cobalion.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs guarantee Slowking can accomplish the following things: survive any two consecutive Dragon attacks from all special Kingdra after accounting for Stealth Rock and one round of Leftovers, break 4/0 Kingdra's Substitutes with Dragon Tail, and survive +1 Outrage from maximum Attack Kingdra after Stealth Rock. If Slowking is instead hit with an unboosted Outrage on the switch-in, it will be 2HKOed, but thanks to Regenerator, it can switch out to a Steel-type and regain most of the lost HP. It's worth noting that even with a Speed-hindering nature, Slowking still outspeeds Escavalier, which allows Slowking to roast it with Fire Blast before it can move. Slowking can also opt to run Psyshock in the fourth moveslot for a good secondary STAB; as it hits Roserade super effectively on its weaker defensive stat, Psyshock discourages it from switching in.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this set fills a completely different niche to the typical bulky Water-type, and should be sure to steer clear of powerful physically offensive behemoths, such as Darmanitan and Flygon. Because of this, Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Bronzong, who can take on the aforementioned threats, make for excellent partners. Offensively, Pokemon that appreciate the paralysis support Slowking provides are also good partners. Machamp is one such Pokemon, and as a bonus, it will gladly switch into Bug-type attacks, such as Megahorn, aimed at Slowking.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Many of Slowking's alternative options are done better by Slowbro, whose physical bulk makes it a better fit for the metagame. However, it does receive several moves, such as Trick Room and Nasty Plot, that Slowbro does not, which it can use effectively, both separately and together. Slowking can also take a more offensive approach by utilizing Choice Specs along with a moveset of Surf, Psyshock, Grass Knot, and Fire Blast, but again, its more physically defensive cousin does this job better.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Countering Slowking is all about knowing which set it's running; even though its not very threatening offensively, it could easily cripple a few of your Pokemon if you let it. The physically defensive set shares many of its checks with Slowbro. Specifically, Shaymin and Roserade make excellent counters, especially if Slowking lacks a coverage move. Raikou can switch in as long as it avoids status, and proceed to set up with Substitute and possibly even Calm Mind. Zapdos also dislikes status, but it can demolish Slowking with its obscenely strong STAB Thunderbolt. More specially defensive variants of Slowking might take you by surprise by being able to tank a Thunderbolt or Seed Flare though, so you have to be careful. Heracross is another excellent check, as it can switch in relatively easily and destroy Slowking with its powerful Megahorn. Toxic Spikes are also a huge thorn in Slowking's side, as they prevent it from staying in for prolonged periods of time, and ensure it won't be able to stall out any of your Pokemon.</p>
