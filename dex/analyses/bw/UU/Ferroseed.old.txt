[Overview]

<p>While Ferrothorn reigns in OU with its supreme bulk, typing, and support movepool, Ferroseed is a great supporting Pokemon in UU with many similar qualities. It has the same amazing typing and nearly equal bulk factoring in Eviolite, allowing Ferroseed to be a great wall despite the loss of Leftovers. Ferroseed's main issue stems from its terrible base 50 Attack, leaving it to become setup bait to even some of the bulky Water-types it's supposed to counter. Despite this flaw, thanks to its great typing and support movepool, Ferroseed can be a great supporter in UU.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With an amazing typing that gives it ten resistances and one immunity at the cost of a mere two weaknesses, Ferroseed is great user of Spikes. Spikes is a superb supporting move, limiting the number of times the opponent can switch while also helping many sweepers obtain OHKOs that they would miss otherwise. If your team already has a Spikes user, you may run Stealth Rock in its place. Leech Seed is used as Ferroseed's main form of recovery, and it also discourages Pokemon from setting up on Ferroseed. Thunder Wave is the primary option in the third slot, crippling fast setup sweepers, such as Cobalion and Weavile, trying to use it as fodder, and enabling a sweep for your own slower sweepers, particularly Togekiss. Protect is a possible secondary option that allows Ferroseed to scout opposing Choice users and gain Leech Seed recovery. In the last slot, Gyro Ball is used to hit many sweepers relatively hard and prevents Ferroseed from being crippled by Taunt.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Although the main spread is specially defensive, one may opt to use either a physically defensive spread or split EVs for a mixed wall. Toxic is a viable option over Gyro Ball to cripple many walls and quickly end an opponent's sweep due to the fact that Ferroseed's Gyro Ball is not powerful enough. Because this set is meant to set up entry hazards, a spinblocker, namely Dusclops or Mismagius, is useful to prevent the entry hazards from being spun away. Pokemon that enjoy entry hazard support, such as Weavile, make great partners for Ferroseed, as do phazers such as Suicune and Donphan, who can rack up entry hazard damage on the opponent. Bulky Water-types, particularly Slowbro, make great partners for Ferroseed, as they can take the powerful Fire- and Fighting-type attacks aimed at Ferroseed, while it can take the Electric- or Grass-type attacks aimed at said Water-type. Due to Ferroseed's weak offenses, a revenge killer is recommended, as practically everything can use Ferroseed as setup bait.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Despite Ferroseed's limited movepool, it has a few more options it can use. Seed Bomb and Bullet Seed are viable alternatives to Gyro Ball to hit both Rhyperior and bulky Water-types for super effective damage, although faster Pokemon, such as Azelf, will then be able to set up without an issue and sweep. Gravity is useful on dedicated teams that need it, but Ferroseed's other support options largely outclass it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>While Ferroseed has great defenses and typing, Fire- and Fighting-type Pokemon, Heracross and Victini in particular, can destroy it easily. Boosting sweepers, Cobalion and Suicune for instance, can also set up on Ferroseed and proceed to sweep. Lastly, Xatu and Taunt users such as Crobat can make Ferroseed a liability to its team by preventing Ferroseed from setting up entry hazards or inflicting status on opposing Pokemon.</p>
