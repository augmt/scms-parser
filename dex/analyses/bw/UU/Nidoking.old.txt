[Overview]

<p>Nidoking is one of the most feared attackers in the UU tier due to his vast movepool and good attacking stats, further increased by Sheer Force. Nidoking is also an easy Pokemon to switch in with his resistance to Stealth Rock, immunities to Thunder Wave and Toxic, and a key immunity and resistance, respectively, to Electric- and Fighting-type moves. However, Nidoking isn't without flaws, as his mediocre Speed and defensive stats often let him down against more offensive teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Nidoking's flagship set, and for good reason. Between his peerless coverage, and the power that Life Orb and Sheer Force provide, Nidoking can at least 2HKO every Pokemon in the tier barring particular dedicated special walls. Earth Power is Nidoking's main attacking move, receiving STAB and destroying the plethora of Steel-, Rock-, and Fire-type Pokemon in the tier, such as Empoleon, Registeel, Rhyperior, and Arcanine. Fire Blast gives coverage on Grass-type Pokemon such as Shaymin, while also hitting Bronzong and Heracross for super effective damage, netting a 2HKO on the former while OHKOing the latter. Ice Beam is generally the best option for the third slot, hitting Flygon and Flying-type Pokemon super effectively. However, Focus Blast allows Nidoking to get past Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2, which would wall Nidoking otherwise. The final slot depends on the needs of the team; Nidoking can set up Stealth Rock if you can't afford running it on any of his teammates, but Substitute is generally the superior option, as it takes advantage of the switches forced by Nidoking and eases predictions.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Timid nature is recommended as it allows Nidoking to outrun non-Choice Scarf Chandelure and Kingdra, as well as at least ensuring the Speed tie, with non-Choice Scarf Heracross; however, a Modest nature can be used if more power is needed. Nidoking has other attacking options such as Thunderbolt and Sludge Wave. The former hits Water-types such as Milotic and Slowking, and the latter is a good secondary STAB move.</p>

<p>Nidoking has trouble with faster offensive Pokemon and priority users, such as Flygon, Weavile, and Azumarill. For this reason, bulky Pokemon such as Shaymin and Calm Mind Suicune are great partners, as they are able to check those Pokemon while benefitting from Nidoking's ability to defeat special walls for them. Another good partner is Snorlax, which can take hits from special attackers such as Zapdos, Rotom-H, and Choice Scarf Chandelure while maintaining offensive pressure. Although Nidoking doesn't need much support because he hits like a truck, entry hazards are always helpful due to the amount of switches Nidoking forces, which, together with his access to Stealth Rock, make Nidoking a very good Pokemon on Spikes-stacking teams.</p>

[SET]

move 2: Sludge Wave

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While it might seem like a waste to use a Choice Scarf on a Pokemon with such perfect coverage, Nidoking has just the necessary power and movepool to be a great revenge killer. Choice Scarf helps Nidoking overcome his biggest flaw, its lackluster Speed, as with a Choice Scarf attached, it can outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in UU, including common Nidoking checks such as Shaymin and Zapdos. Earth Power is Nidoking's primary STAB move; it lets him KO Pokemon such as Raikou, Cobalion, and Chandelure, while Ice Beam gives Nidoking a move to hit Pokemon immune to Earth Power, such as Togekiss, Zapdos, and Flygon.</p>

<p>Sludge Wave is Nidoking's secondary STAB move, and it has good neutral coverage with Earth Power. Sludge Wave allows Nidoking to revenge kill Azelf as well as Grass-type Pokemon such as Shaymin, while also being Nidoking's best option against Rotom-H. For the last moveslot, Fire Blast is preferred, as it allows Nidoking to OHKO Heracross while being able to hit Bronzong, which would wall Nidoking otherwise. However, Thunderbolt can also be used to hit most Water-types super effectively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Modest is the preferred nature on this set, as Nidoking still retains the necessary speed to outpace every Pokemon in the tier while gaining as much power as possible to take down bulkier foes such as Zapdos or Kingdra. Timid is an option if you are really worried about Choice Scarf Heracross, but take into account that even with a Timid nature, Nidoking can only Speed tie with Jolly Heracross.</p>

<p>Without the power provided by Life Orb, Nidoking finds himself unable to take down special walls such as Porygon2 and Umbreon, and bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic are now better able to check Nidoking too. For this reason, teammates that are able to take down special walls and defensive cores in general such as Mienshao, Honchkrow, and Sleep Powder Roserade are recommended. Swords Dance Heracross is an extremely good partner for Nidoking, as it can take advantage of a Scald burn to activate Guts.</p>

<p>This Nidoking set needs more support, as it will be switching more often; due to its reduced damage output, entry hazard support is highly recommended. Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Rhyperior, Bronzong, and Blastoise are good partners, as they can not only support Nidoking by setting up hazards or using Rapid Spin, but can also check faster Choice Scarf users that outrun Nidoking, such as Flygon, Darmanitan, and Krookodile.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Nidoking has an impressive physical movepool, which includes Earthquake, Poison Jab, and the elemental punches, but Nidoking is generally better off using special attacks. Nidoking has access to Superpower, which can be used to get past Snorlax if Focus Blast's accuracy is a concern. Finally, Nidoking can use a mixed set with Hone Claws, as it boosts Nidoking's Attack while making low accuracy attacks such as Blizzard or Thunder viable; however, it is not effective enough to be a standard option.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Specially defensive behemoths such as Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2 are the best options to stop Nidoking, as they can switch in on most of Nidoking's attacks and retaliate back. However, one must keep in mind that Nidoking can beat them if he's carrying Focus Blast. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Suicune, and Slowking can also check Nidoking thanks to their great defenses, but they don't enjoy taking repeated hits.</p>

<p>Another way of dealing with Nidoking is preying on his mediocre Speed. Its base 85 Speed is by no means great in UU, as it leaves Nidoking outsped by most offensive Pokemon in the tier such as Shaymin, Darmanitan, Flygon, and Azelf, which can force Nidoking out or simply OHKO him with their powerful attacks. Rotom-H is another annoying Pokemon for Nidoking to face, as it resists all his moves except Focus Blast and Sludge Wave while being able to outspeed and OHKO Nidoking with Overheat.</p>
