[Overview]

<p>Despite being an RU Pokemon, Mandibuzz has a potent niche in UU. It has a good defensive typing, which allows it to resist many common attacking types, and when combined with great defenses and a good movepool, it means Mandibuzz is a viable mixed wall. Its movepool includes good options like Roost and Toxic, and Overcoat makes it immune to weather damage. However, these benefits come with a drawback, which is Mandibuzz's crippling weakness to Stealth Rock. Rapid Spin support is mandatory for Mandibuzz, and it should be paired up with Pokemon to help sponge Rock-, Ice-, and Electric-type attacks. Overall, Mandibuzz is an effective wall in the UU tier, and its ability to take on threats such as Azelf and Mismagius is much appreciated by any team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Due to its typing, Mandibuzz is better suited to being a special wall than a physical wall. It can switch in on a variety of special sweepers such as Mismagius and wall them thanks to recovery in Roost. This, together with Toxic, allows Mandibuzz to outstall many opposing Pokemon. It can even use Taunt to force those Pokemon to switch. Whirlwind is used to phaze set-up sweepers away. Brave Bird is an option though if you don't want Mandibuzz to be Taunt bait.  U-turn is an option as well, to bring in a safe switch-in, but you will need Rapid Spin support.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Knock Off is an option, since it cripples most walls and Eviolite users. You can use Torment as well, so opponents can't 2HKO Mandibuzz with their strongest attacks. A Dark-type STAB attack can be used, but it provides less coverage than Brave Bird. The HP EVs give an odd HP stat, which ensures that you can switch in four times with Stealth Rock up. Special Defense is maxed out and the remaining EVs are put into Defense. You can use Mandibuzz as a mixed wall with the following spread: 248 HP / 216 Def / 44 SpD, which enables Mandibuzz to function as an emergency check to any out-of-hand threats. The Specially Defensive set outclasses this set though, because of Mandibuzz's typing.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin support is welcome from Pokemon such as Hitmontop, otherwise Mandibuzz will lose a quarter of its health every time it switches in. Heal Bell support is recommended, as Mandibuzz doesn't appreciate status. While Registeel can be kept in check with Taunt, most Steel-types such as Cobalion and Escavalier are problematic as they don't mind Mandibuzz's STAB attacks and are immune to Toxic. Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Suicune are capable of handling most Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon. Fighting-type Pokemon can also take on the aforementioned Steel-types thanks to their STAB attacks. With Taunt and Roost, Mandibuzz is capable of stalling out certain dedicated walls such as Slowbro. Pokemon that struggle against these Pokemon partner well with Mandibuzz for this reason. Faster users of Taunt are also troublesome for Mandibuzz.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Mandibuzz can go with a Nasty Plot set, but this is outclassed by so many other Pokemon with higher Special Attack and Speed. You can also try out a Mean Look + Toxic set, but this is way too situational to be effective.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Steel-types in general completely wall Mandibuzz as they are immune to Toxic and have a high base Defense to take Brave Bird. A good example is Cobalion; it can set up a Swords Dance or a Calm Mind and sweep, as only Whirlwind threatens it, but Cobalion can just come back in. Magic Guard or Magic Bounce users also wall Mandibuzz since Toxic is bounced back at Mandibuzz. Xatu can completely set up on Mandibuzz, either with dual screens or Calm Mind. Strong super effective STAB moves also easily kill Mandibuzz: Rhyperior can rip apart Mandibuzz with STAB Stone Edge and the Rotom formes carry a strong STAB Thunderbolt to take it down. Mandibuzz doesn't appreciate Toxic either; it severely reduces its walling capabilities. Faster Taunt users also shut Mandibuzz down. Finally, having Stealth Rock on the field will cripple Mandibuzz, as most Pokemon can take it down when it has taken some prior damage.</p>
