[Overview]

<p>Aggron can certainly prove to be a headache for any player that goes up against it; with a respectable base 110 Attack and an amazing 150 Base Power STAB move, very few Pokemon can safely switch into Aggron. Unfortunately, Head Smash is really the only thing Aggron has going for it, and it has a lot of things going against it. Abysmal Speed, a horrendous defensive typing with two 4x weaknesses, and lack of special bulk all make it difficult for Aggron to survive for long in battle. However, if Aggron can find an opportunity to use Head Smash, it will usually pay off.</p>

move 1: Head Smash
move 2: Heavy Slam

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Aggron becomes absurdly lethal when equipped with a Choice Band. Head Smash deals devastating amounts of damage, and Aggron's Rock Head ability blocks recoil, allowing Aggron to use the attack with no risks, save for Head Smash's accuracy. This set focuses on abusing Head Smash, while the rest of the moves cover the Pokemon that resist it. Heavy Slam is a secondary STAB move, and it provides coverage on Fighting-types that resist Head Smash, such as Hitmontop. Earthquake deals with most Steel-types, including Registeel and Empoleon. Aqua Tail nails Ground-types, such as Golurk, Nidoqueen, and Claydol, while Superpower is Aggron's strongest move against Steelix, Empoleon, and Registeel.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Although Aggron is incredibly slow, a Jolly nature is recommended for getting the jump on walls that don't invest in Speed, such as minimum Speed Suicune and Milotic. Adamant is still a perfectly acceptable choice, though, since the increase in power is noticeable. Because the opponent will often switch in order to minimize the damage Aggron causes, Focus Punch can be used to nail predicted Head Smash-resisting switch-ins for tons of damage.</p>

<p>Because Aggron is so slow, it greatly appreciates paralysis support. Alternatively, giving Aggron a Brave nature, a 0 Speed IV, and moving the Speed EVs to HP makes Aggron a deadly Trick Room sweeper. Victini also hits hard physically and can set up Trick Room for Aggron to run amuck in. Teammates that cover Aggron's weaknesses are also important, especially its Fighting and Ground-type weaknesses. Zapdos resists both types and can scare off the Water-types that threaten Aggron, although it struggles against Quagsire and Swampert if it lacks Hidden Power Grass. Roserade terrorizes the aforementioned Pokemon, resists Fighting- and Water-type attacks, and can lay Spikes, making switching into Aggron more difficult.</p>

[SET]
name: Autotomize
move 1: Autotomize
move 2: Head Smash
move 3: Aqua Tail
move 4: Low Kick / Magnet Rise
item: Life Orb / Chople Berry
ability: Rock Head
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Autotomize patches up Aggron's Speed, allowing it to pose more of a threat to offensive teams. Head Smash is obviously Aggron's STAB move of choice, and a powerful one at that. Aqua Tail covers Ground-types that resist Head Smash. Low Kick helps deal with most Steel-types, while Magnet Rise allows Aggron to beat walls that can only threaten it with Ground-type moves.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Because this set does not have the brute power that Choice Band provides, an Adamant nature is preferred to make Aggron as strong as possible. A Jolly nature is still an option for outpacing base 130 Speed Pokemon, but Aggron will still fail to outrun the majority of Choice Scarf users. A Life Orb boosts power significantly, but using a Chople Berry makes it easier for Aggron to set up. Substitute is an option for blocking status, especially burns and paralysis, while also providing a safety net against attacks.</p>

<p>This set appreciates entry hazard support. For example, Spikes support gives Aggron a chance to OHKO offensive Suicune with Head Smash. Roserade makes a great partner, resisting some of Aggron's most common weaknesses while also providing Spikes. Mew can also provide Stealth Rock and burn opponents with Will-O-Wisp, making it easier for Aggron to set up. On that note, dual screen support is recommended. Uxie can set up both Reflect and Light Screen and has other support options that benefit Aggron, including Stealth Rock, Memento, and Yawn. This set greatly fears Choice Scarf users, so a Wynaut holding Eviolite is appreciated for trapping and killing them. Priority users are also a problem, especially Hitmontop and Azumarill. Slowbro handles both handily, resisting their STAB moves and outstalling them with a combination of its impressive bulk and Toxic.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Aggron can take advantage of its low Speed and other ability, Sturdy, to OHKO nearly any attacker with Metal Burst. Unfortunately, this keeps it from using Head Smash effectively. Aggron also has a decent selection of support moves, including Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Aggron can use a Hone Claws set to increase Head Smash's accuracy, but it is generally too slow to pull it off effectively. A set utilizing Substitute and Focus Punch to soften up Pokemon that resist Head Smash, such as Steelix and Registeel, is also an option. With entry hazard support, Aggron can also take advantage of Dragon Tail or Roar to soften up Pokemon that attempt to switch into it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Hitmontop can switch into Head Smash and can revenge kill the Autotomize set with Mach Punch, but it should be wary of Heavy Slam, which can 2HKO after Spikes even after an Intimidate. Bulky physical walls that resist Head Smash also check Aggron effectively, especially Steelix and Nidoqueen, both of which threaten Aggron with STAB Earthquake. Because of its special frailty, nearly any Pokemon with a super effective special move threatens Aggron. Many Pokemon that threaten Aggron also outspeed it, such as Suicune with at least 52 EVs invested in Speed, so it is not very difficult to revenge kill.</p>
