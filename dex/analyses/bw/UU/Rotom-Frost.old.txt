[Overview]

<p>The reintroduction of Snow Warning and Abomasnow to UU has given Rotom-F a new life, as it can now reliably use its powerful STAB Blizzard. While its stats aren't off the charts, they aren't bad either. It outspeeds many good Pokemon, such as Heracross, Kingdra, and Nidoking, its Special Attack is high enough to leave a mark with its strong Blizzard, and its bulk is usable. However, Rotom-F's strength is its legendary STAB combination. The combination of Ice- and Electric-type moves hits the majority of the tier for neutral damage, and many Pokemon for super effective damage. Thanks to its Levitate ability giving it a Ground-type immunity, its typing isn't bad defensively, either. While it still suffers from weaknesses to the common Fighting- and Fire-type attacks, as well as a nasty Stealth Rock weakness, it mitigates those factors with resistances to the common Electric- and Ice-type attacks, as well as an immunity to Ground-type attacks and Spikes damage. Rotom-F's biggest fault as a Pokemon is its reliance on hail to function well, as well as the fact that its weaknesses will likely be shared with other members of its team, worsening team synergy.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set operates as a revenge killer, wall crippler, and late-game sweeper. Rotom-F's nice Speed tier allows it to revenge kill weakened sweepers, such as Choice Scarf Heracross and Dragon Dance Kingdra. Rotom-F's acceptable bulk and Ground-type immunity allow it to check Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Krookodile, despite the fact that those two Pokemon outspeed Rotom-F. Its typing allows it to counter any Raikou lacking Aura Sphere and check any variant of Zapdos. Blizzard is a powerful STAB move that OHKOes most Pokemon weak to Ice, and 2HKOes most Pokemon that don't invest in bulk. Once bulky Pokemon and Ice-type resistances have been removed, Rotom-F can easily spam Blizzard and attempt to sweep. Thunderbolt is a great secondary STAB that hits Pokemon that resist Blizzard hard, especially Water-types that would otherwise easily absorb a Blizzard. Ground-types hesitate to switch into battle against Rotom-F due to its powerful Blizzard, so Volt Switch is a safe move to keep momentum on your side while wearing down your opponent. Trick can cripple a special wall switching into Rotom-F. Once the wall is stuck with a Choice Scarf, it can be worn away to the point that another special sweeper can break through it and sweep.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is designed to take advantage of Rotom-F's great Speed tier, make it hit as hard as possible, and give Download Pokemon an unfavorable physical boost. Hidden Power Grass can be used to damage the rare Lanturn and hit Swampert harder than Blizzard, but it has little use otherwise. Abomasnow is a mandatory teammate, as without it, Rotom-F will be unable to spam its STAB Blizzard. Rotom-F appreciates Pokemon that can lure in and weaken special walls, such as Substitute + Will-O-Wisp Chandelure, or outright defeat them, such as Mienshao and Heracross. Chandelure can take advantage of Fighting-type attacks aimed at Rotom-F and set up a Substitute or spread status. Mienshao can form an effective VoltTurn core with Rotom-F. Mienshao scares special walls such as Snorlax and Umbreon out of battle, and Rotom-F can threaten physical walls such as Slowbro, Cofagrigus, and Gligar. Rotom-F can also be part of an effective double Electric-type strategy: Trick can cripple special walls and Blizzard hits many Pokemon with an Electric-type resistance hard. This allows another powerful Electric-type, such as Raikou, who also benefits from hail with access to Weather Ball, to sweep. Spikes helps weaken many of Rotom-F's counters as many of them are grounded. Froslass can supply Spikes, has an immunity to Fighting-type attacks, and also benefits from hail with its STAB Blizzard.</p>

[SET]
name: SubSplit

move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Pain Split
item: Life Orb
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rotom-F is an effective sweeper thanks to its usable Special Attack, a good Speed tier, and near perfect coverage with just its STABs. It can enter the field after a KO, or switch into battle using its common resistances and immunity. It can then force out Pokemon it would typically beat one-on-one and use that opportunity to set up a Substitute. Blizzard is a strong STAB move that deals heavy damage to all but the bulkiest Pokemon, and those with an Ice-type resistance. Thunderbolt is a decent STAB move that gets great coverage beside Blizzard, hitting Water-types for super effective damage and other Ice-type resistances for neutral damage. Substitute eases prediction, making sure that one doesn't use Thunderbolt against a Swampert or Blizzard against a Slowbro. Pain Split recovers health lost to Substitutes, Life Orb recoil, and Stealth Rock damage, while weakening opposing Pokemon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The last 4 EVs go in Special Defense so Download Pokemon get a less favorable Attack boost. Rotom-F can use Discharge over Thunderbolt and Leftovers over Life Orb to become a good status spreader, but the drop in power is very noticeable. Abomasnow is a necessary teammate to ensure Blizzard is reliable. Chandelure can cripple special walls such as Snorlax and Umbreon with Trick or Will-O-Wisp, allowing Rotom-F to sweep. Rotom-F can be paired with the event Raikou, who is a common sight on hail teams due to access to Weather Ball. Raikou can utilize also Aura Sphere in order to weaken Snorlax and Umbreon. Rotom-F's team should prepare for its several common weaknesses as well. Mew and Crobat can both check Fighting-type Pokemon and have access to recovery moves in order to mitigate hail damage. Both Milotic and Suicune can switch into Fire-type Pokemon, and the former has access to Recover. Finally, Slowbro and Slowking can check both Fire- and Fighting-type Pokemon, and can heal passive hail damage with both Slack Off and Regenerator.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Rotom-F can use a Choice Specs set identical to the Choice Scarf set. However, the little extra power that Choice Specs provides over Life Orb doesn't balance the ease of prediction granted by Substitute. Rotom-F can also run a defensive set utilizing Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and decent its defensive typing, but its few common weakness hurt the set's viability. Rotom-F has space on its moveset for Charge Beam, but it's too slow to pull off a boosting sweep successfully.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Rotom-F is tricky to directly counter with its great STAB combination, Substitutes, and correct uses of Trick. Lanturn can shut down almost any Rotom-F set, as only a Choice Specs Hidden Power Grass can 2HKO it. Rotom-H also resists Electric- and Ice-type attacks, and can OHKO with Overheat even at -2 Special Attack, but it can be 2HKOed by Life Orb Blizzard if a Speed tie doesn't fall your way. Snorlax and Umbreon can easily take hits from Rotom-F, but are crippled by Trick so they must be careful when switching into it. Victini can revenge kill Rotom-F, but if it's behind a Substitute, Victini cannot use V-Create as its defense drops will enable Thunderbolt to OHKO after Stealth Rock damage. Chandelure and Darmanitan outspeed and easily OHKO Rotom-F, but Chandelure is likely OHKOed by Life Orb -boosted Thunderbolt, and Darmanitan is always OHKOed after Stealth Rock damage so they must be careful. Choice Scarf Heracross and Mienshao can revenge kill a Rotom-F lacking a Substitute with powerful Fighting-type STAB moves, but Mienshao is always OHKOed by Blizzard and Heracross is likely to be OHKOed by Blizzard after Stealth Rock and hail damage. Cobalion can also revenge kill Rotom-F, but after a defense drop due to Close Combat, it will be OHKOed by Thunderbolt. Therefore, if Rotom-F is behind a Substitute, Cobalion will be defeated.</p>
