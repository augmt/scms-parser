[Overview]

<p>While most Steel-types are stuck in OU to help check the overpowering Dragon-types there, Dragon-types in UU can often run through teams with their virtually unresisted Dragon-type STAB. Fraxure is a great offensive Dragon Dance user with base 117 Attack, just enough Speed to outspeed key threats such as Azelf and Weavile after a boost, and decent bulk with an Eviolite. Despite the greater versatility and coverage of other Dragon-types, such as Kingdra and Altaria, the sheer power of Fraxure's Outrage makes up for its lesser movepool.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Dragon Dance is a great set up move for Fraxure, boosting its above average Attack to huge levels in an attempt at a sweep. Outrage is the main and only move Fraxure will commonly need to sweep, being a 120 Base Power STAB attack with practically perfect neutral coverage. Dragon Claw is a secondary STAB option that does not lock Fraxure into the move and will not cause confusion. Taunt is usable in the last slot, allowing Fraxure to set up on certain walls, but Swords Dance is also viable, as it gives Fraxure the ability to smash through almost any Pokemon, and whole teams if it can grab both boosts.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Although Fraxure relies on its Eviolite to set up easily, a Life Orb is usable to give Fraxure a noticeable increase in power. With a Life Orb, Fraxure cleanly 2HKOes both Tangrowth and Slowbro after Stealth Rock damage. If outspeeding Weavile is unnecessary, an EV spread of 56 HP / 252 Atk / 200 Spe with a Jolly nature is viable to still outspeed Pokemon with 115 Base Speed such as Azelf, while giving Fraxure more bulk. Because Steel-types such as Escavalier completely wall this set, a steel trapper such as Magneton is a great teammate to dispose of them with Hidden Power Fire. Fire- and Fighting-types are also great partners for Fraxure, damaging Steel-types as well as Weavile.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Fraxure has a few other options, but all have very situational usage, making them generally useless. Substitute can be used over Taunt to ease prediction while also protecting against status, while Dual Chop may be used over Dragon Claw to break Substitutes from Pokemon like Mismagius. Reversal can be used to hit Steel-types for super effective damage, but it is very weak unless Fraxure is low on health. Aerial Ace is usable to ensure an OHKO on Choice Scarf Heracross that come in to revenge, while X-Scissor can get a super effective hit on Weavile without locking yourself into Outrage. Dig, although it takes two turns, hits Steel-type Pokemon hard, and with Mold Breaker, levitating Pokemon such as Mismagius are not immune to the move.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Steel-type Pokemon are the greatest counters to Fraxure, being able to sponge its STAB attacks with ease. Registeel, Empoleon, Durant, Cobalion, and Escavalier can all easily take an Outrage, and either status, phaze, set up on, or outright kill Fraxure respectively. Outside of Steel-types, physically bulky Pokemon such as Slowbro and Tangrowth can avoid the 2HKO from +1 Eviolite Outrage and status Fraxure in return, rendering it useless. Hail is a massive threat to Fraxure, limiting its ability to switch in while Pokemon spam perfectly accurate Blizzards. Weavile is a great threat to Fraxure as well, with its STAB priority Ice Shard, although it will fail to OHKO a full health Fraxure even with a Choice Band.</p>
