[Overview]

<p>Krookodile's main selling point is its ability Moxie; combined with a unique typing granting it great coverage and usable Attack and Speed stats, it is capable of easily sweeping teams. With a Choice Scarf, Krookodile also functions as a great revenge killer, checking common threats in UU such as Chandelure, Azelf, and Nidoking. Its access to Pursuit means it is also a very useful trapper, as it can also force out the aforementioned Pokemon. Even with these qualities, there are a number of factors that hinder Krookodile's usefulness in UU. Its typing, while solid offensively, is mediocre defensively, giving it a number of exploitable weaknesses, especially to Fighting. Its moves also have major drawbacks, with many Pokemon being immune to Earthquake, while Crunch has middling power without any boosts. Krookodile also faces notable competition from Honchkrow and Heracross as a Moxie cleaner, both of which pack more initial power. Nonetheless, Krookodile is still a solid choice as a late-game cleaner and revenge killer.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a decent base 92 Speed stat and a solid base 117 Attack stat, Krookodile is a great Choice Scarf user, allowing it to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the tier, as well as +1 base 85 Speed Pokemon. Its ability, Moxie, also allows it to rack up Attack boosts as it kills Pokemon, turning it into a very fast and hard-hitting sweeper.</p>

<p>Earthquake is Krookodile's strongest STAB move, nailing many Pokemon, such as Chandelure and Cobalion, for heavy damage. However, due to the number of Ground immunities throughout the tier, becoming locked into Earthquake can hamper a potential sweep and force Krookodile out. Crunch gains decent coverage alongside Earthquake, hitting a number of the Psychic- and Ghost-Type Pokemon such as Claydol or Mismagius, many of which have an immunity to Ground-type attacks. Stone Edge completes the EdgeQuake coverage, hitting the various Flying- and Ice-type Pokemon in the tier hard. The last moveslot is between Pursuit or Superpower. Pursuit can be used to trap Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Azelf or Xatu, opening holes for Krookodile's team; however, Superpower is Krookodile's best move against Pokemon such as Scrafty and Porygon2.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Adamant nature can be used over Jolly, allowing it to hit the opposition harder, but considerably slows Krookodile down, leaving it outsped by +1 base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Kingdra. Aerial Ace deserves consideration in the fourth moveslot as a niche option to get rid of any Heracross variant.</p>

<p>Because Krookodile can easily force switches, entry hazard support is generally appreciated. The damage taken upon switching in allows for Krookodile to pick off weakened threats while unboosted and not worry about taking damage in order to gain a Moxie boost later in the game. Entry hazard users that work well alongside Krookodile include Empoleon and Scolipede, as each can handle a specific type weakness of Krookodile's. Much like other Choice item users, Krookodile appreciates having a spinner such as Hitmontop or Claydol to back it up, as despite its resistance to Stealth Rock, the damage from the other two types of entry hazards adds up quickly, leaving Krookodile's already slim defenses weaker. Faster Choice Scarf users such as Darmanitan pose a threat to Krookodile, as a super effective hit, even without STAB, tends to easily finish Krookodile off. Bulky Pokemon such as Swampert also pose a threat, as they take laughable damage from all of Krookodile's attacks, and can threaten back with strong STAB or coverage moves.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Rock Slide is an acceptable choice over Stone Edge if the lower accuracy is unfavorable, but it will lead Krookodile to lose out on a few unboosted revenge KOes. Bulk Up can bolster Krookodile's offense and defense, making it simultaneously stronger and harder to kill, though it's still vulnerable to being OHKOed by it's checks and counters in UU. Dragon Tail can damage and force out common switch ins, but its uses are situational at best.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Hitmontop, Heracross, Gligar, Porygon2, and bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Swampert and Milotic are the best checks to Krookodile available in the UU tier. None of them are at any real risk of being 2HKOd by any of its moves (although Heracross will not want to be taking an Aerial Ace) and most of them threaten Krookodile with a STAB move. Sableye can use its Prankster ability to move before Krookodile and render it useless with Will-O-Wisp. Faster Choice Scarf users such as Darmanitan and Mienshao outspeed and threaten to OHKO Krookodile. Sharpedo has the ability to raise its Speed with Speed Boost, outspeeding Krookodile after a single boost, and threaten back with Waterfall or Surf. Priority moves such as Aqua Jet and Mach Punch also threaten to KO Krookodile, making Azumarill and offensive variants of Hitmontop decent checks as well.</p>
