[Overview]

<p>In previous generations, the taboo combination of Shadow Tag and Encore led to Wynaut being banned from standard play, along with its evolution, Wobbuffet. BW has changed this, and Wynaut can once again be used in standard play, albeit with a weakened Encore, as it now only lasts four turns. However, all is not bad news; the new Eviolite item boosts Wynaut's lackluster defenses to great levels, and in conjunction with the CounterCoat combination, Wynaut is almost guaranteed to score a KO. However, the fact remains that Wynaut is complete Taunt bait and has relatively poor defensive stats even with Eviolite, making it difficult to fit onto most teams. Still, Wynaut's ability to counter virtually any threat in the tier and help its teammates set up with Encore gives it a respectable niche in the UU metagame.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Wynaut remains one of the premier counters to attackers with a Choice item. Optimally, Wynaut is brought in after something, preferably a Choice-locked attacker, lands a KO so it can trap with Shadow Tag and go for the KO with either Mirror Coat or Counter. Encore is the focal point of the set, forcing even non-Choice opponents to repeat their last move. This enables Wynaut to KO with Counter or Mirror Coat or switch to an ally that takes little damage from the attack, enabling it to set up. Encoring a support or setup move allows Wynaut to give a teammate a free turn.</p> 

<p>The final moveslot can be occupied by either Safeguard or Tickle; both have their individual advantages. Safeguard protects Wynaut's team from status moves, but with its low Speed, Wynaut might obtain a status effect of its own before it can set up. Tickle lowers the opponent's Attack and Defense stats, and when paired with a Pursuit user such as Spiritomb or Weavile, it enables Wynaut to do huge damage to walls that it would not be able to hurt by itself. Wynaut can choose to run Tickle over any move, but it depends entirely on what you wish to accomplish with regards to the rest of the team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs allow Wynaut to outspeed and Encore slower walls such as Registeel, while maintaining the maximum available bulk. An alternate spread of 152 HP / 200 Def / 156 SpD with a Calm nature gives Wynaut more bulk while disregarding Speed. Pokemon that require only one turn of setup to sweep are great partners because Encore can provide them with the safety to switch in. Because of Wynaut's ability to trap and KO Pokemon, it partners very well with Pokemon that appreciate one specific counter removed. Pokemon such as Cobalion, Raikou, and Victini love having Nidoqueen and Rhyperior removed, and Wynaut is perhaps the best Pokemon to do the job. As Wynaut has no method of recovery, it enjoys the support of Wish passers. Receiving a Wish can enable Wynaut to trap and KO even more Pokemon, as long as it survives each onslaught. As with any grounded Pokemon, Wynaut hates entry hazards. Therefore, Hitmontop makes an excellent partner, as it is one of the premier Rapid Spin users in UU. In addition, Hitmontop can take out Dark-types and Pursuit users with its super effective STAB attacks.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>With a movepool consisting of only eight moves, Wynaut has the bare minimum when it comes to other options. Charm is outclassed by Tickle, and Destiny Bond is rather unimpressive with Wynaut's low Speed stat.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Due to the nature of Shadow Tag, Wynaut technically cannot be countered, as the only ways to escape it are by using U-turn, Volt Switch, or Baton Pass or holding a Shed Shell. However, Wynaut is crippled severely by Taunt, as this restricts it to Counter and Mirror Coat. Similarly, Wynaut is particularly susceptible to Trick, as a Choice item will render it almost completely useless for the rest of the match. Priority moves and faster Pokemon can revenge kill Wynaut after it scores a KO as it will often be at low health. Special attacking Dark-types such as Houndoom and physical attacking Ghost-types such as Golurk cannot be KOed by Wynaut as they are immune to Mirror Coat and Counter, respectively. Both Houndoom and Spiritomb deserve special mention, as they carry a strong Pursuit to trap Wynaut and are also immune to one or both of its retaliation options.</p>
