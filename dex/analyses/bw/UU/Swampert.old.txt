[Overview]

<p>For the past two generations, Swampert had been an OU staple. However, this generation, the power creep of OU was just too much for Swampert to handle and Swampert now finds itself in UU for the first time. The environment of last generation's OU is much like that of this generation's UU, meaning Swampert feels right at home in this tier. Swampert makes for a fantastic choice in UU because it combines great bulk, a wonderful defensive typing, a solid movepool, and an often overlooked base 110 Attack stat, serving as one of the best defensive pivots in the UU tier.</p>

<p>Even with that in mind, Swampert has its limitations. First of all, it lacks reliable recovery, which means it cannot stand up to many hits. It also has a terrible quadruple weakness to Grass, so Shaymin and Tangrowth can switch in with impunity. The real problem with using Swampert is knowing how to use him correctly. Swampert is not a wall, but rather a tank; if you try to sponge neutral attacks with the mud fish, then you'll find Swampert's HP dropping to zero far too quickly. However, if you're aware of its typing and take Swampert's limitations into account, then Swampert will be a great asset to your team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Swampert's claim to fame in previous generations was its great physical bulk, and that hasn't changed this generation. Swampert needs all the physical defense it can get in order to stop some of UU's strongest attackers such as Life Orb Darmanitan and Choice Scarf Flygon. With the nature and EVs listed, Choice Scarf Flygon fails to 2HKO Swampert and Darmanitan can barely 3HKO Swampert after Leftovers recovery. Although there are few dedicated leads in BW2, Swampert works well in the lead position because he can set up Stealth Rock against most Pokemon in UU and will rarely be taken down in one hit. Swampert should use a secondary STAB in the second slot, and Scald and Waterfall are the best choices. Scald has the ability to spread burns, which is devastating for most physical attackers. Waterfall, on the other hand, comes off of Swampert's mighty base 110 Attack. However, Scald's burn can be detrimental for teams that rely heavily on inflicting other status problems. If spreading burn is what your team needs, choose Scald. Otherwise, Waterfall will deal a good amount of damage. Earthquake is Swampert's best attacking move, hitting Fire- and Steel-types such as Darmanitan, Cobalion, and Victini super effectively. In the final spot, Swampert has an array of useful support moves, but the choice usually boils down to Toxic versus Roar. If Scald is your Water-type move, then it's best to go with Roar, as Swampert already spreads status with Scald. Toxic is generally a better choice if Waterfall is your secondary STAB, but it's really a decision based on team preference.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The purpose of the EVs is to reach a Leftovers number to recover more HP and maximize physical bulk. The remainder of the EVs are put into Attack so Earthquake can hit slightly harder. Swampert's main fault is its lack of recovery, and there are ways to remedy that weakness that can be used in the fourth slot. The first option is Protect, which gives Swampert additional Leftovers recovery, scouts for any unexpected Grass-type moves, and messes with High Jump Kick users such as Mienshao and Scrafty. Rest is the other solution, but it costs a moveslot (potentially two if Swampert uses Sleep Talk) and incapacitates Swampert for two turns. If Swampert uses Rest, it's important to have Aromatherapy or Heal Bell support from Roserade or Togekiss. Both of those Pokemon make good partners for Swampert regardless of Heal Bell or Aromatherapy. Togekiss resists Swampert's lone weakness, and Swampert resists two of Togekiss's three weaknesses. Roserade also resists Grass-type attacks and provides Spikes support, forming a formidable defensive core with Swampert. Offensively, Crobat absorbs any Grass-type attack and can help rack up entry hazard damage through U-turn or blast the opponent with a powerful Brave Bird.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Earthquake

item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 208 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 44 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band Swampert epitomizes the idea of bulky offense, retaining the offensive set's bulk while cranking the Attack power up to eleven. Earthquake is the main attacking option on Swampert; being so strong that it can even attain an OHKO on Spikes Roserade. For Flying- and Grass-type Pokemon, Swampert can use the consistently powerful Waterfall and Ice Punch, the latter of which is a great coverage move that hits Pokemon weak to Ice just as hard as a neutral Earthquake. Ice Punch will always OHKO Zapdos with Stealth Rock down and has a slight chance to knock it out even without Stealth Rock damage. Superpower rounds out this set by giving Swampert a way to defeat Scrafty, regardless of the set. Stone Edge also works in the fourth slot, but Ice Punch gains equal coverage and the power boost is not worth the lower accuracy. The EVs are straightforward: the Speed EVs let Swampert outspeed Umbreon and base 60 Speed Pokemon that only invest a little in Speed so that none can switch in and stall Swampert. Attack is obviously maximized in order to pack a punch. The remainder of the EVs significantly boost Swampert's bulk, but not enough for Swampert to take powerful STAB attacks repeatedly. Furthermore, there is no Leftovers to boost Swampert's durability, so try to keep Swampert out of the line of fire.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>There isn't much to change on Choice Band Swampert. You can adjust the EVs to find a more preferable balance between bulk and Speed, but keep in mind that this set is designed to be slow and bulky. Raising Swampert's Speed much is not recommended. Wish and Stealth Rock support, especially the latter, are appreciated, as Swampert needs the extra damage to obtain key 2HKOs, such as against 252/252+ Suicune and 248/252+ Slowbro. Prediction is key, especially on the defensive side, as Swampert does have trouble switching into strong attacks. Swampert can still shrug off resisted and neutral non-STAB attacks from most Pokemon, but can't reliably take many other attacks and expect to last long. Likewise, most Pokemon have extreme difficulty taking hits from Choice Band Swampert, so if Swampert switches in safely it can shift the game's momentum in its user's favor. Choice Band Swampert has an extreme element of surprise as the most common set is the defensive Stealth Rock setter, so the opponent will be shocked when their Roserade is defeated in one hit or Zapdos can't take an Ice Punch. Swampert's favorite teammates include defensive Roserade, as it 4x resists Grass-type attacks and can set up Spikes that make Swampert a pain to switch into; Rhyperior, for setting up Stealth Rock and defeating Flying-type Pokemon reliably; and Flying-type Pokemon, such as Togekiss and Zapdos, to take Grass-type hits and build momentum for Swampert's team. Furthermore, Swampert can safely take the Electric-type moves that give Togekiss and Zapdos headaches.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive Tank
move 1: Earthquake

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Is Swampert not hitting hard enough? Well, this set is the answer. Offensive Swampert combines Swampert's awesome base 110 Attack and great three-move coverage to hit opposing Pokemon much harder than the defensive set does. However, this additional power comes at the expense of Swampert's bulk. The first three attacks of this set are very straightforward; STAB Earthquake is fantastic coming off of Swampert's 350 Attack, able to fell offensive Roserade in one hit and cause severe damage to defensive Roserade sets. Waterfall is an obvious choice for a second move, as it provides decent power with STAB, and great coverage alongside Earthquake. Ice Punch is a great coverage move, smacking Flygon, Gligar, Zapdos, and Grass-types decently hard. However, note that the only Grass-type that's usually beaten in one hit is Roserade, so the other Grass-types can still switch into Swampert without fearing an OHKO. Unlike the defensive set's Ice Punch, this variant can terrorize Togekiss, scoring a 2HKO. The final moveslot should be dedicated to a support move such as Stealth Rock, Roar, or Toxic. Stealth Rock is great if your team otherwise lacks Stealth Rock support, turning many of your team's 2HKOs into OHKOs. However, a move such as Roar or Toxic can discourage opponents from setting up on Swampert.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The most important distinction between this Swampert and the defensive variant is that offensive Swampert is considerably less bulky than the defensive one. Fortunately, even with that loss of bulk still allows it this set is still able to deal with Raikou just as well as the defensive variant does. Other Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Darmanitan, however, have a much easier time dealing with this set than the defensive one, as their STAB attacks do much more damage. On the other hand, other Pokemon have a much more difficult time switching into this Pokemon as it's hitting with so much more force than the typical defensive Swampert. For example, offensive Roserade cannot switch into Earthquake or Ice Punch as it is OHKOed 91% of the time, even without Stealth Rock. Defensive Roserade takes upwards of 65% from an Earthquake, which can be enough to pick off a weakened one hoping to use Swampert as setup fodder. Unlike the defensive set, offensive Swampert is able to 2HKO most Pokemon with two neutral hits with the exception of extremely bulky Pokemon such as Umbreon or Tangrowth. Substitute is a great move to use on this set as Swampert forces switches easily, especially on common Pokemon such as Raikou, Xatu, and Choice-locked Pokemon that cannot harm the defensive set. If Swampert decides to use Substitute, it's worth bumping the HP EVs to 252 in order to have 101 HP Substitutes that cannot be broken by Night Shade or Seismic Toss. Roserade is a perfect partner, especially the defensive Spiker set, as it can absorb attacks from Pokemon such as Zapdos. The Spikes that Roserade sets make it tough to switch into a powerhouse like Swampert. Bouffalant gets a special mention here for straight-up absorbing Grass-type attacks and using them as fuel for ridiculously powerful Head Charges. When using this variant of Swampert, it's important to predict well because this Swampert does not have the bulk to take many neutral STAB attacks.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Curse Swampert has been a standard set for what seems like an eternity, but that set has fallen out of favor as Swampert's bulk just doesn't carry it as far as it used to. Swampert gets Counter and Mirror Coat, which can catch an opponent off guard. Rest and Sleep Talk are Swampert's only form of recovery, but they leave Swampert a sitting duck for three straight turns unless Swampert comes with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy support. Swampert has a decent special movepool, so a Choice Specs set is viable, but there's little point in using moves such as Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Sludge Wave, and Hidden Power when its fearsome base 110 Attack and awesome physical coverage goes farther. Yawn is worth a mention for forcing switches, but Swampert can force switches well enough with its wonderful typing, great movepool, and Roar.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bulky Grass-types are Swampert's nemeses. Roserade, Shaymin, and Tangrowth can switch into Swampert rather easily and either destroy Swampert in one hit or force it to switch. However, weakened Shaymin and Roserade have to watch out for offensive and Choice Band Ice Punches. Grass-type attacks in general scare Swampert as the mud fish takes quadruple damage from any Grass-type move. Pokemon that commonly run Giga Drain or Hidden Power Grass, such as Yanmega, Zapdos, and Rotom-H, can all come in on an Earthquake or on the revenge kill and beat Swampert with either move. Burns, especially from the omnipresent Scald or from Prankster Sableye, absolutely ruin Swampert because they destroy Swampert's bulk and slash its Attack. Though Swampert has the bulk to take unboosted Scalds all day, it cannot risk a burn. Spikes also wear Swampert down and allow Pokemon such as Sharpedo or Kingdra to break through its defenses. The best way to defeat Swampert is to repeatedly pummel it with strong attacks; it loses most wars of attrition because of its lack of recovery.</p>
