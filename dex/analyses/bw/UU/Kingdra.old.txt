[Overview]

<p>Kingdra is a very lethal threat in the UU tier with its solid stats and unique Dragon / Water typing (which gives it a neutrality to Grass- and Electric-type attacks that most other Water-types are weak to). A lot of Kingdra's lethality is due to its ability to use Rain Dance, doubling its Speed thanks to Swift Swim, as well as Dragon Dance, boosting both Kingdra's Attack and Speed stats, two highlights in a shallow movepool. These two moves allow Kingdra to outspeed much of the UU tier and sweep with a powerful STAB combination resisted only by Empoleon, giving Kingdra a place as one of the most dangerous sweepers in the tier. Kingdra is a Pokemon you must prepare for if you want a successful UU team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The staple set from DPP returns as one of Kingdra's best sets in the BW2 UU tier. With new status inducers such as Amoonguss, and constant threats such as Sableye and Xatu becoming increasingly popular in the tier, the use of Substitute gives Kingdra more than enough time to set up and become a powerhouse. While behind a Substitute, Kingdra can use Dragon Dance to increase its Attack and Speed. With the EV distribution, two Dragon Dances will ensure that Kingdra outspeeds the entire tier, leaving it free to smash the opponent with Waterfall or Outrage, both of which are powerful STAB moves that gain near perfect coverage throughout the tier, with only Empoleon and Ferroseed resisting the combination.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If you don't fear status and are willing to rely on Substitute alone to block it, Leftovers may be used over a Lum Berry to recover Kingdra's HP. Sniper is a viable option over Swift Swim because Rain Dance teams are fairly scarce in the Underused tier. This allows Kingdra to basically guarantee an OHKO with a critical hit because the multiplier is boosted from 2x to 3x. However, while Rain Dance teams are scarce in UU, Rain Dance Kingdra is not, so using Sniper over Swift Swim means you don't Speed tie with opposing Kingdra in rain. As Empoleon is the number one go-to check to Kingdra in the Underused tier, Kingdra appreciates having it removed by Electric- or Fighting-type partners such as Raikou or Heracross, respectively. Entry hazard support from Steel-type Pokemon such as Bronzong is also appreciated, as it breaks any potential Focus Sashes and allows for more collective damage to be spread if Kingdra should ever find itself unboosted or at +1. Rapid Spin support from Cryogonal or Hitmontop is vital for this set if Lum Berry is being used, as Kingdra's HP will be in low supply as it is, and won't want to be losing 37% of its overall HP upon switching in.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Taking on a much more immediate sweeping role from a specially attacking perspective, Kingdra also runs an effective Rain Dance set that functions well on its own or on a Rain Dance team. Rain Dance doubles Kingdra's Speed and boosts its Water-type STAB, giving it the ability to outspeed and 2HKO or OHKO a vast majority of the UU tier. Hydro Pump and Draco Meteor are the STAB moves that are going to be generally spammed, as the two of them gain near perfect coverage throughout the tier. The last slot is useful for picking off weakened threats, and both moves are useful in certain situations. Dragon Pulse is useful so that Kingdra does not need to immediately suffer the sharp drop in Special Attack, and Surf is useful because it still hits hard in rain and has better accuracy and PP than Hydro Pump.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Hidden Power Electric or Hidden Power Fighting can be used in the fourth moveslot to gain a solid hit on Empoleon, but a rain-boosted Hydro Pump does nearly the same amount of damage, so it isn't recommended. Because this set relies on Special Attack, it prefers that special walls such as Snorlax and Porygon2 are removed by a Fighting-type ally such as Heracross or Mienshao. The same goes for Empoleon, who is the number one hard counter to this set, as it has very good Special Defense and resists both of Kingdra's STABs. A strong Electric- or Fighting-type such as Raikou or Heracross respectively, are great teammates to help Kingdra out with Empoleon. Since this set will force a lot of switches, entry hazard support from Roserade and Bronzong is appreciated, as the residual damage will make Kingdra's job of sweeping much easier.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When Kingdra opts to use both of its setup moves in Rain Dance and Dragon Dance, a menacing sweeper is born. While setting up both moves in one match is often unfeasible, it allows you to pick and choose which move will give you the best chance at sweeping. In addition, this set acts as an effective lure for some Pokemon; when Kingdra uses Rain Dance, Pokemon such as Snorlax who are sent in because they are good checks to special Rain Dance will instead get destroyed by this set's physical attacks. It's much more immediately powerful than other sets, especially the ChestoRest set, but is much more vulnerable to status. The Speed boosts from both Rain Dance and a Dragon Dance leave Kingdra nigh impossible to keep up with, and priority moves are one of the few options for damaging this set. After a Rain Dance and a single Dragon Dance, Waterfall becomes a very devastating move, crushing anything that doesn't resist it. Much goes the same for Outrage, obliterating anything that isn't a Steel-type. Draco Meteor is a viable option over Rain Dance, as even with no investment, it will still be heavily damaging Pokemon like Slowbro or other physically defensive Pokemon that can stomach an Outrage or two.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If using Draco Meteor over Rain Dance, a Lonely or Naughty nature should be used so it can hit as hard as possible without investment. Sniper is a viable option over Swift Swim if Rain Dance is not being used, powering up Kingdra's critical hits. Prankster Sableye is a major issue for this set, and appreciates having a strong sweeper immune to Will-O-Wisp such as Victini or Darmanitan remove it. This variant of Kingdra pairs well with another cleaner, such as Choice Scarf Moxie Heracross, as it will tear holes in the opposing team, leaving Heracross to quickly pick up the pieces and gain Attack boosts. This set also appreciates entry hazard support from Roserade and Bronzong, as it will be forcing a lot of switches, and the additional damage upon switching in will leave many opponents vulnerable to an OHKO.</p>

[SET]

nature: Modest / Timid

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This variant of Kingdra puts sweeping aside for the purpose of wallbreaking, considering not much in the tier wants to be toying around with a Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump or Draco Meteor. Draco Meteor is the STAB move of choice, removing whatever doesn't resist it or carry a large amount of special bulk from the face of the earth. Hydro Pump functions similarly as a powerful STAB move, but doesn't suffer from the drop in Special Attack like Draco Meteor does. Dragon Pulse is a powerful backup STAB move that can be used to pick off weakened opponents instead of wasting Kingdra's Special Attack stat to Draco Meteor. Hidden Power Electric is a handy coverage move that deals considerable damage to the bulky Water-types in the tier and the occasional Flying-type that Kingdra finds itself up against, but unless they resist Draco Meteor, two Hidden Powers will always be outdamaged by two Draco Meteors. Surf is an acceptable STAB option over either Hydro Pump or Hidden Power Electric, being used much how Dragon Pulse is, which is to damage opponents while preserving Hydro Pump's low PP or if you can't afford a miss.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Because of the scarcity of Rain Dance throughout the Underused tier, Sniper is a perfectly usable option over Swift Swim, boosting up Kingdra's critical hits to absurdly powerful levels. A Timid nature may be used to tie other positively natured base 85 Speed Pokemon, such as Nidoking or Heracross, but will see a hefty drop in overall power. Signal Beam may be used over Dragon Pulse or Hidden Power Electric to gain additional coverage on Pokemon such as Shaymin or Azelf, but is generally not recommended as the STAB Draco Meteor will be hitting harder. Because of its power, this set doesn't need to rely on having special walls removed, rather just weakened. All variants of Porygon2 are 2HKOed by Hydro Pump, and Snorlax takes around 40% from Hydro Pump. Entry hazard support from Rhyperior and Frosslass is still appreciated, as it turns many 2HKOs into OHKOs.</p>

[SET]
name: ChestoRest
move 1: Rest
move 2: Dragon Dance
move 3: Outrage
move 4: Waterfall
item: Chesto Berry
ability: Swift Swim / Sniper
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With status moves being in high supply in the Underused tier, a ChestoRest set greatly aids Kingdra in pulling off a sweep. The goal of this set is to accumulate as many boosts as possible, use Rest to heal whatever damage or status Kingdra may have taken, then begin smashing your opponent. This set excels late-game when most Steel-types are weakened or removed, and other strong threats are out of play, but can be used early on to open holes for other sweepers. Dragon Dance boosts Kingdra's Attack and Speed stats, turning it into a very capable sweeper, outspeeding the entire tier after two boosts. Backed by STAB, Waterfall and Outrage accumulate a lot of power after two or more Dragon Dance boosts, proceeding to OHKO or 2HKO nearly the entire tier. Rest, as mentioned, recovers HP and eliminates status, giving Kingdra a new lease on a sweep.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Waterfall can be dropped for Sleep Talk so that Kingdra can gain additional opportunities to Rest and set up on Pokemon such as Slowbro, but this leaves Kingdra walled by Steel-types. Sniper can be used in place of Swift Swim simply because of how rare Rain Dance teams are and that the Speed boost may not be found; this powers up Kingdra's critical hits, decimating anything they touch. This set greatly appreciates having Empoleon and users phazing moves removed by powerful attackers such as Raikou or Heracross, as Empoleon walls this set cold and generally carries Roar, removing Kingdra's boosts. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Roserade and Bronzong is also greatly appreciated, as it weakens many of Kingdra's checks, and allowing for easier sweeps.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hidden Power Fighting can be used over Hidden Power Electric wherever applicable to ensure a super effective hit on Ferroseed along with a super effective hit on Empoleon. However, Ferroseed's usage is fairly low, and should not warrant that much attention. Ice Beam can be used to hit Grass-and Flying-types hard, but the coverage offered alongside its Dragon-type STAB is relatively redundant. Kingdra is capable of running a mixed set consisting of Outrage, Draco Meteor, Waterfall, and Hydro Pump, but splitting its offenses is generally not recommended. Kingdra could run a Choice Band set of Outrage, Waterfall, Return, and Iron Head, but Flygon is a better Choice Band user, as its movepool supports a Choice Band better than Kingdra's does. A support set with moves such as Yawn, Clear Smog, and Scald is possible, as Kingdra has the bulk to pull it off, but lacks viable recovery.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Choice Scarf Flygon is one of the most capable checks to Kingdra, as it threatens variants below +2 Speed, easily outspeeding and KOing with Outrage. Both Empoleon and Ferroseed hard counter any sets lacking Hidden Power Electric or Fighting, respectively, and the former can phaze Kingdra while the latter can set hazards up on it. Toxic Spikes can limit Kingdra's staying power and force it to use Rest prematurely, making it easier to break down; Roserade and Qwilfish can set them up. Strong attacks from faster Pokemon, such as Superpower from Choice Scarf Darmanitan, put a hefty dent in Kingdra's HP, making it vulnerable to priority moves. Milotic and Cofagrigus have the bulk to take on just about anything Kingdra can throw at it while recovering any damage taken with Recover or Pain Split, and Hazing away boosts, however the latter will not want to be taking a Draco Meteor or Hydro Pump. Specially attacking sets, bar the Choice Specs set to a certain extent, are shut down by the likes of Snorlax and Porygon2. Arguably the most reliable check for a setup Kingdra, Imposter Ditto, can use Kingdra's boosts against it, outspeed it, and revenge kill it with its own attacks, but if Kingdra is behind a Substitute, it will die before it can KO.</p>
