[Overview]

<p>At first Empoleon might receive an icy reception from new UU battlers due to its rather lackluster stats; while it possesses a respectable base 111 Special Attack, its Speed is much lower than that of common offensive juggernauts. Defensively, Empoleon faces competition from both Suicune and Milotic, who both boast better specially defensive stats. Although it might seem that Empoleon is outclassed in both offensive and defensive roles, Empoleon has all the right tools to pull off a variety of sets in the competitive UU environment. Thanks to its unique defensive typing, Empoleon can easily wall common UU threats such as Roserade; its tailor-made movepool also allows it to run a powerful sweeping set which can wash away the opponent late game. In terms of pure numerical power, Empoleon cannot hope to beat the powerhouses and bulky behemoths in the UU tier; but if given correct team support, Empoleon can become a huge thorn in your opponents side.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With the Petaya Berry finally released in BW2, Empoleon can once again use its signature sweeping set from the fourth generation. Although Empoleon might appear to be outclassed by a whole host of UU attackers in terms of sweeping, the combination of Agility, Substitute, and Petaya Berry quickly turns Empoleon into a terrifying foe to face. Agility lets it double its lackluster Speed in one turn, meaning only priority attackers and the fastest Choice Scarf users will be able to move before Empoleon. After boosting its Speed, Empoleon can then proceed to safely use Substitute. After doing this a few times, Empoleon will be able to lower itself below 25% health and activate Petaya Berry to boost its Special Attack. Coincidentally, Empoleon's health will also be hovering in Torrent range, which further boosts its damage output. After all this has been accomplished, Empoleon will be ready to sweep. Surf is Empoleon's staple attack; after being boosted by STAB, Petaya Berry and Torrent, only dedicated special walls and resists will be able to avoid the OHKO. However, Hydro Pump can be used for its superior damage output at the cost of accuracy. With Hydro Pump, Empoleon can now OHKO Togekiss, specially defensive Zapdos, and specially defensive Escavalier after Stealth Rock while having a chance to OHKO Porygon2 and Cresselia after Stealth Rock! The remaining slot goes to a coverage move to use against Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks. Ice Beam covers Grass-types such as Shaymin and Roserade while Grass Knot takes care of Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With maximum Speed EVs, Empoleon will be able to outrun Adamant Choice Scarf Darmanitan and anything slower. The Special Attack is also maximized along with a Modest nature to dramatically increase Empoleon's damage output. However, a Timid nature can be used if Jolly Choice Scarf Heracross is a problem for your team. 30 HP IVs ensure that after using Substitute 3 times from full health, the Petaya Berry will activate. Unfortunately, Empoleon only has room for one coverage move, meaning that it will be walled by certain Pokemon no matter what. If Ice Beam is chosen, then bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Slowking will stop its sweep cold. Shaymin is thus an excellent partner for Empoleon because it threatens Water-types with a powerful Seed Flare. If Empoleon is running Grass Knot, then Victini and Togekiss are excellent teammates due to their ability to take down Grass-types such as Roserade with their STAB attacks. Priority such as Hitmontop's Mach Punch and fast Choice Scarf users such as Flygon will be able to easily finish Empoleon off after it lowers itself into Petaya Berry range. Tangrowth is therefore good teammate, as it easily walls Choice Scarf Flygon and can take priority moves. In return, Empoleon can set up on Ice- and Bug-type attacks directed at Tangrowth.</p>


[SET]
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Scald
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Roar / Toxic
item: Leftovers
ability: Torrent
nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A specially defensive set makes the most out of Empoleon's unique defensive typing which lets it wall dangerous threats such as Shaymin, Tornadus, and Kingdra. Stealth Rock is a metagame staple that Empoleon can find multiple opportunities to use thanks to the number of switches it forces. Scald is Empoleon's STAB move that scares out Fire-, Rock-, and Ground-types. Even when uninvested, it hits hard coming off a base 111 Special Attack stat. It also has a great 30% chance to burn the target, which makes physical attackers think twice before switching into Empoleon. Ice Beam allows Empoleon to severely dent common switch-ins such as Shaymin, Roserade, and Zapdos. Although it isn't likely to OHKO any of them, it will bring them down low enough so that another teammate can finish the job. Lastly, Roar is used to shuffle the opponents team and to remove greedy stat boosters such as Raikou hoping to set up on Empoleon, while also racking up entry hazard damage on your opponents team. However, Toxic can be used instead to let Empoleon beat opposing walls and win stall wars. Due to Empoleon's Steel typing, the opponent will not be able to poison Empoleon in return.</p>


[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Maximum investment in Special Defense and HP along with a Calm nature maximizes Empoleon's specially defensive capabilities, letting it take onslaughts from Shaymin and Zoroark. However, the EV spread can be tweaked to boost Empoleon's Defense at the cost of some special bulk. 252 HP / 108 Def / 148 SpD lets Empoleon take Technician Hitmontop's Close Combat and reply with a devastating Scald, which hits hard after the Special Defense drop from Close Combat and has a high chance to burn. Leftovers should be the only item considered as Empoleon would otherwise have no means of recovering its health. Instead of Ice Beam, Empoleon can use Grass Knot to obtain a stronger hit on bulky Water-types such as Slowbro at the cost of being unable to damage Grass-types such as Roserade and Shaymin. Lastly, Empoleon can replace Roar with the phazing move Yawn which forces switches by threatening your opponent with sleep. However, it is useless against Substitute users and cannot be used if Sleep clause is already activated. Yawn should only be considered if your team has no other sleep inducing moves.</p> 

<p>As Empoleon covers most special attackers, a sturdy physical wall such as Gligar is a good teammate. Not only does Gligar aptly wall most physical threats in UU, it also has perfect type synergy with Empoleon, resisting Fighting- and Ground-type attacks while being immune to Electric-type attacks. In return, Empoleon can take Water- and Ice-type attacks directed at Gligar. Zapdos also has excellent type synergy with Empoleon and can be EVed towards Defense. Grass-types in general cover many of Empoleon's weaknesses and can threaten Pokemon that Empoleon is afraid of. Shaymin, Roserade, and Tangrowth resist two of Empoleon's weaknesses while scaring out Pokemon such as Swampert. Some special attackers such as Raikou and Zapdos can beat Empoleon, so Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Krookodile are good teammates.</p>


[SET]
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Grass Knot
move 4: Scald / Surf
item: Choice Specs
ability: Torrent
nature: Modest
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With Choice Specs, Empoleon eschews the opportunity to sweep for sheer wall breaking power. With its perfect neutral coverage, Empoleon can annihilate common switch-ins. Hydro Pump is Empoleon's STAB attack and hits extremely hard with Choice Specs and a potential Torrent boost; with Torrent activated, Empoleon's Hydro Pump OHKOes Pokemon such as specially defensive Zapdos and Escavalier, and can even 2HKO defensive Roserade after Stealth Rock! Ice Beam pins down common Roserade and Shaymin switch ins, 2HKOing both. It also deals with Flygon, while being a more accurate option against the likes of Rhyperior and Gligar. Grass Knot deals with the many Water-types in the tier, comfortably 2HKOing Slowbro, Suicune, and Kingdra. As Empoleon has perfect coverage in just three moves, the last slot is used for a more reliable STAB move. Scald is useful for its 30% burn chance while Surf has slightly more power. Both have perfect accuracy and should be used when Empoleon can't afford a miss from Hydro Pump. Other offensive Empoleon sets aim to sweep through the opposition late game, but Choice Specs Empoleon seeks to punch holes in the opponents team and clear a path for late-game sweepers such as Raikou and Kingdra.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is the regular offensive spread; Speed is maximized so that Empoleon can outrun minimum Speed Roserade; Special Attack is also maximized so Empoleon hits as hard as possible. A Modest nature is the best option as it gives Empoleon superior wall breaking power. The Speed boost from Timid is largely irrelevant as Empoleon can already outspeed most walls. However, an alternative EV spread of 208 HP / 252 SpA / 48 Spe lets Empoleon outspeed minimum Speed Umbreon while giving it greater bulk. For example, Empoleon can now take a Choice Scarf Victini's V-Create and retaliate with a Torrent boosted Hydro Pump. Flash Cannon is an alternative STAB move that Empoleon can use to hit Pokemon such as Froslass and Weavile hard. However, it has largely redundant coverage and should only be considered if you are afraid of Hydro Pump consistently missing. Sleep Talk is also a move that Empoleon can run to act as a sleep absorber, countering Pokemon such as Roserade. As Empoleon can weaken most special walls, Pokemon such as Raikou and Yanmega appreciate Empoleon's presence and can easily sweep once Pokemon such as Snorlax and Zapdos have been significantly weakened. Defensively, Pokemon such as Gligar and Zapdos are good teammates as they can sponge the Fighting- and Ground-type attacks directed at Empoleon.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Grass Knot
item: Leftovers
ability: Torrent
nature: Modest
evs: 172 HP / 252 SpA / 84 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set blends Empoleon's decent defensive typing and high Special Attack stat to make it a formidable Stealth Rock setter, as well as allow it to maintain a great amount of offensive presence. Unlike other Stealth Rock setters, Empoleon is able to keep Stealth Rock on the field due to its ability to defeat every common Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce user. Because of this, this set functions better on offensive teams that don't have room for a spinblocker. Hydro Pump functions as Empoleon's main STAB move, as due to its high Base Power and a Modest nature, it is guaranteed to 2HKO relatively bulky Pokemon such as Cofagrigus and Hitmontop. Ice Beam accomplishes two roles on this set: eliminating Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Empoleon's STAB and defeating Xatu. Grass Knot rounds this set off by hitting bulky Water-types, such as Blastoise and Swampert, for super effective damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With the given EV spread, Empoleon is able to outspeed everything up to standard Hitmontop while retaining a large amount of offensive presence and bulk. An alternate EV spread of 48 HP / 252 SpA / 208 Spe or 108 HP / 252 SpA / 148 Spe can be used, with the former outspeeding minimum Speed base 85s such as Suicune and Gligar and the latter outspeeding minimum Speed Blastoise, but this would greatly detract from Empoleon's bulk, as Choice Scarf Victini now has a chance to OHKO Empoleon after Stealth Rock. Despite Leftovers being the preferred item on this set, a Chople Berry or a Shuca Berry can be useful in certain situations. For example, if Empoleon is up against a Ground- or Fighting-type, such as Nidoqueen or Life Orb Mienshao, the Shuca Berry or Chople Berry will allow Empoleon to take their respective Ground- and Fighting-type attacks and OHKO back with its STAB Hydro Pump. Surf is an option over Hydro Pump on this set due to its perfect accuracy, but it unfortunately lacks enough power to reliably 2HKO Hitmontop. Empoleon can also function as an anti-lead by using Aqua Jet over Grass Knot, a Focus Sash, and maximum Speed, as the combination of Hydro Pump and Aqua Jet is able to defeat leads such as Azelf, Crustle, and Omastar. Finally, Empoleon can use a Life Orb to boost its power, but it unfortunately counteracts its great natural bulk.</p>

<p>Defensively, this set struggles against powerful Fighting-, Electric-, and Ground-types, while offensively, it struggles against bulky Water- and Grass-types. Because of this, Zapdos makes an absolutely wonderful partner for this set, as it can switch into the powerful Fighting- and Ground-type moves that Empoleon fears while also defeating a large amount of Water- and Grass-types with Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Flying, respectively. In return, Empoleon covers Zapdos's Ice- and Rock-type weaknesses and can defeat Swampert and Rhyperior, two of Zapdos's greatest counters. Crobat is another great partner for this set, as it can keep Grass- and Fighting-types, such as Virizion and Shaymin, in check with Brave Bird while also bringing Empoleon in safely with U-turn; however Crobat does share an Electric weakness with Empoleon. Roserade resists Empoleon's Electric-type weakness and can use Electric- and Water-types to set up Spikes.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although this set appears to be outclassed by an Empoleon that uses Petaya Berry and Substitute, it makes up for the lack of power with an extra coverage move and less reliance on Pinch Berries. Agility doubles Empoleon's Speed letting it outspeed all of the unboosted metagame and slower Choice Scarf holders. Hydro Pump is Empoleon's main STAB move and is used over Surf as Empoleon needs the extra power when trying to sweep. As Empoleon forgoes Substitute for an extra coverage move, it is no longer walled by certain types and has perfect neutral coverage on the whole tier. Ice Beam chills the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Hydro Pump, and also serves as another way to take out Flygon. Grass Knot trips up Water-types such as Suicune and Slowbro while also reliably OHKOing Rhyperior. Agility Life Orb Empoleon is an extremely capable sweeper and can be used over the Substitute Petaya Berry set if you do not want to eliminate only either Grass- or Water-types. It also has the benefit of not requiring Empoleon to be below 25% of its HP to sweep.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Speed EVs allow Empoleon to outspeed common Choice Scarf users such as Adamant Darmanitan after an Agility, while the Special Attack EVs and Modest nature give Empoleon much needed power. However, a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Flygon and Jolly Choice Scarf Heracross. A Life Orb is necessary on this set because Empoleon cannot boost its Special Attack, and the recoil can also help lower Empoleon into Torrent range, letting it fire off insanely powerful Hydro Pumps. As Empoleon struggles to OHKO bulkier Pokemon, entry hazard support is much appreciated. Roserade and Qwilfish can set up Spikes, while Rhyperior and Gligar can set up Stealth Rock. Pokemon such as Snorlax and Umbreon can easily stop Empoleon from sweeping, so a Pokemon such as Heracross is a good teammate. Not only is Heracross a good offensive partner, it also has decent defensive synergy with Empoleon, being able to take Fighting- and Ground-type attacks. Lastly, a Pokemon such as Tangrowth that can take Mach Punch and attacks from faster Choice Scarf holders such as Flygon is a good teammate for Empoleon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Empoleon doesn't have much else in its movepool. A physical attacking set is plausible thanks to Swords Dance and a STAB priority move in Aqua Jet. However, base 86 Attack isn't very high, and Empoleon will struggle against common threats and walls. ResTalk is Empoleon's only method of recovery, and can be used on the specially defensive set. However, it eats away two of Empoleon's moveslots, meaning that Empoleon will be less useful to your team. Protect lets Empoleon scout common Choice-locked users such as Darmanitan, removing the need for prediction.</p> 

[Checks and Counters]

<p>In general, the best counters to Empoleon are Electric-types, as most of them do not mind Scald burns and can hit Empoleon hard with a STAB attack. Lanturn is probably the best Empoleon counter. It resists Empoleon's Water-type attacks and takes little from Grass Knot thanks to its light weight. In return, Lanturn can fry Empoleon with an Electric-type attack and even gain momentum against your team with Volt Switch. Grass-types such as Roserade and Shaymin resist Empoleon's powerful Water-type STAB and can even stomach a Choice Specs Ice Beam at full health. Roserade can put Empoleon to sleep, while Shaymin can Leech Seed Empoleon or hit it with Earth Power. Keep in mind though that Empoleon is only neutral to Grass-type attacks and has an excellent Special Defense stat, even without investment. Standard special walls such as Snorlax are generally good switch-ins to Empoleon as well; however they take a hefty chunk from Torrent boosted Hydro Pumps and can normally do little back to Empoleon bar phazing it out. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Slowking can wall Empoleon that do not carry Grass Knot but cannot usually do much to Empoleon aside from phazing in Suicune's case. Opposing defensive Empoleon also counter Empoleon and can Roar it away. Fast Choice Scarf users such as Flygon and Raikou can outspeed a +2 Empoleon and hit it hard with powerful super effective STAB attacks. Priority users such as Hitmonchan will always be able to outspeed Empoleon and finish off weakened ones with Fake Out and Mach Punch.</p>
