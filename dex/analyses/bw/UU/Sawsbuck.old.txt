[Overview]

<p>At first, Sawsbuck seems like a weak choice due to the ban of the ability Drought, which robs it of a chance of an easy Speed boost thanks to Chlorophyll. However, Sawsbuck still has qualities that make it a viable contender in the Underused tier. Swords Dance and a good physical movepool allows Sawsbuck to still be a good physical sweeper, while Baton Pass gives it the option of supporting other Pokemon in sweeping. Sawsbuck becomes even more powerful if Sunny Day can be set up by a teammate due to Chlorophyll, and Grass-type moves keeps Hippopotas from freely switching in to get rid of the sun. Sawsbuck may have been weakened with the loss of permanent sun, but it still remains a threat in the right hands and should not be underestimated.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Swords Dance makes Sawsbuck a dangerous sweeper, reaching 598 Attack after a single boost. This results in serious damage to most of the Pokemon which don't resist Horn Leech, which is Sawsbuck's best physical Grass-type move that heals Sawsbuck as well. Return is the main choice for a secondary STAB move, getting a powerful neutral hit on most opponents. Double-Edge is an option for the higher Base Power, but has the drawback of recoil, making it a secondary option. Horn Leech can alleviate that effect, however, so it can work if the extra power is desired. In the last slot, Nature Power is the main option. It has the same type and power of Earthquake in a Wi-Fi environment, which allows Sawsbuck to hit most Steel-types super effectively. Jump Kick is a viable alternative, due to hitting the same targets while also doing damage to bulky Normal-types such as Snorlax. If Jump Kick misses, however, Sawsbuck loses a large amount of HP, making it quite risky.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Sap Sipper is Sawsbuck's best choice for an ability, as Sunny Day is unreliable to count on. It also can get a free Attack boost on the odd chance that it switches in on a Grass-type move. If Sunny Day is present on a Pokemon on the team, however, Chlorophyll is a good option. Arcanine is one of a multitude of options that can set up Sunny Day reasonably well. It also does well against bulky Grass-types and Escavalier, which means it is a very good teammate for Sawsbuck in normal conditions. Slowbro has good synergy with Sawsbuck, resisting Fire-, Ice-, and Fighting-type attacks, and keeps Fire-types away in general.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Agility
move 3: Baton Pass
move 4: Horn Leech / Substitute
item: Lum Berry / Leftovers
ability: Sap Sipper
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sawsbuck can pass stat boosts well both in and out of the sun, meaning it is a viable Pokemon to set up for a teammate that needs a boost. Swords Dance and Agility are both fantastic boosting moves, making them staples on this set along with Baton Pass. Agility is especially useful, as it lets Sawsbuck pass the boosts to another Pokemon easily before getting hit. Horn Leech is listed in the last spot for an attacking move, meaning Sawsbuck can use the boosts itself if needed. Substitute can be used for protection if desired, but leaves Sawsbuck helpless to defend itself, especially if it is Taunted. Lum Berry is the recommended item, as it protects Sawsbuck from a crippling status which could prevent it from doing its job. Leftovers can give Sawsbuck slight healing, which helps if Sawsbuck uses Substitute for status protection.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Sap Sipper is the best ability if Sawsbuck is used outside of sun, but Chlorophyll is superior if the sun is up. If Substitute is being used, an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature is the best choice, giving Sawsbuck maximum speed and bulk as its Attack stat isn't being used.</p>

<p>Sawsbuck can also pass Work Up, which can work for mixed sweepers such as Victini. The other boosts are usually superior, however. Uxie is a good partner, as it can set up Reflect and Light Screen, which significantly helps Sawsbuck's survivability. Fast, physically offensive Pokemon make good sweepers for Sawsbuck to pass to, as the Swords Dance boost can give them much-needed power. Some examples of these include Weavile, Flygon, and Aerodactyl. Slower Pokemon that have a high Attack stat also work well, as an Agility boost can allow them to sweep. Some good examples are Heracross, Bisharp, and Azumarill. Registeel is also a good teammates, as it can set up entry hazards which aid a sweep.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sawsbuck has few viable moves other than those listed. Megahorn and Wild Charge are alternative coverage moves, but they have limited coverage compared to Sawsbuck's aforementioned moves. Leech Seed and Aromatherapy are there, but these are best left to another, more defensive Pokemon such as Celebi. Grass Whistle can be used to put a Pokemon to sleep, but is unreliable due to its terrible accuracy. Sawsbuck also learns Thunder Wave and Light Screen, but it is much too frail to be supporting its team outside of Baton Passing. Sawsbuck also gets Sunny Day, but it would much rather have a teammate set it up.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Hitmontop can either revenge kill Sawsbuck with Mach Punch or switch in with Intimidate, making it able to take a hit then OHKO back. Escavalier can take every move Sawsbuck has, and Megahorn easily scores an OHKO on Sawsbuck. Dusclops has great bulk, making it able to take a hit and cripple Sawsbuck with Will-O-Wisp. Tangrowth can also take a hit and can work well if using Hidden Power Fire or Brick Break.</p>
