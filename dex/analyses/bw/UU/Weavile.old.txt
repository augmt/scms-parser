[Overview]

<p>Weavile is the textbook definition of a late-game Pokemon, as it is capable of sweeping large portions of the UU metagame, which is mostly due to its blistering 125 base Speed. This allows Weavile to outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame&mdash;only Meloetta-P and Crobat are faster. Weavile's base 120 Attack lets it tear opposing teams in two thanks to its STAB moves, Ice Punch and Night Slash. However, its super-thin 70 / 65 / 85 Defenses still hold it back. Also, Weavile's typing leaves it with a crippling Stealth Rock weakness, which prevents it from switching in and out of a match effectively, and a weakness to the most common type in UU, Fighting-types.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Weavile is arguably the best late-game sweeper available to the Underused metagame, as its unique dual STAB, amazing Speed and sheer power make it difficult to beat once set up. With maximum Speed investment, Weavile is capable of outspeeding all unboosted Pokemon bar Crobat, making it one of the fastest Pokemon available to the tier. Swords Dance brings Weavile's already potent Attack stat to monstrous levels, allowing it to 2HKO and even OHKO many top defensive threats, such as Cofagrigus, Gligar, and Rhyperior. Ice Shard holds a lot of utility in the second slot, as it allows Weavile to check and OHKO Choice Scarf Flygon, which would otherwise outspeed and significantly threaten Weavile, while also allowing it to pick off weakened opponents. After a Swords Dance, Ice Shard OHKOes and 2HKOes many other opposing threats, even those using Choice Scarf. Night Slash acts as Weavile's Dark-type STAB move of choice, allowing it to tear opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types apart. Night Slash also has solid neutral coverage in UU, so it's useful for powering through the opposition mid-sweep. Low Kick occupies the fourth slot to flatten opposing Steel- and Rock-types with the former resisting Weavile's dual STAB, as their cumbersome weight means they'll be taking a lot of damage after a Swords Dance, potentially opening up the opposition for a game-clinching sweep. Low Kick is also effective at removing Snorlax, which stomachs Weavile's STAB attacks with relative ease due to its supreme bulk.</p>

<p>A Jolly nature is a must in order to outspeed positively-natured base 115s, such as Raikou and Azelf. A bulkier EV spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe can be used to give Weavile the chance to set up on stray Ice Beams or Shadow Balls, but now Weavile can only tie with opposing Crobat. If Life Orb recoil isn't your cup of tea, an Expert Belt can be used instead. However, there will be a noticeable drop of damage done to neutrally-hit opponents. Ice Punch can be used over Ice Shard in favor of more damage output, as it is Weavile's strongest physical Ice-type STAB attack, but prevents Weavile from beating the multiple Choice Scarf users that would otherwise outspeed and beat Weavile. Pokemon capable of keeping the field free of entry hazards, specifically Stealth Rock, make for excellent partners, as Weavile cannot afford to continuously switch in on them. Xatu, Blatoise, and Hitmontop all make for great choices, with the latter of the two also resisting Fire- and Rock-type attacks aimed at Weavile. Chandelure can be used to lure in Pursuit users wielding a Choice Band, such as Snorlax, and give Weavile a free turn to set up Swords Dance. The removal of bulky Water-types also makes Weavile's life easier, making Zapdos and Shaymin useful teammates, as their powerful STAB attacks will make quick work of any opposing Water-type. Powerful attackers that can freely switch in on or lure bulky Water-types, specifically Choice Specs Kingdra, Arcanine, and Choice Band Heracross, are also capable of heavily damaging them, giving Weavile room to pull off a sweep.<p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to its sky-high Speed and Attack, Weavile performs exceptionally well as a revenge killer thanks to the abundance of Ghost- and Psychic-types in the tier and access to Pursuit. Pursuit allows Weavile to put opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Chandelure and Azelf into a checkmate situation, preventing them from switching and doing heavy amounts of damage and 2HKOing both without Stealth Rock damage or the bonus damage from switching. Ice Shard is Weavile's main STAB, allowing it to bust faster opposing threats, such as Choice Scarf Flygon or Choice Scarf Zapdos, wide open. Low Kick is handy for breaking through opposing Rock-, Ice-, and Steel-type opponents that would otherwise resist Pursuit or Ice Shard, potentially opening holes throughout the opposition's defenses. The last slot is more preference-based, as both Ice Punch and Night Slash are acceptable options. Ice Punch deals more damage to slower Flying-, Grass-, and Ground-types than Ice Shard does, but Night Slash is capable of inflicting more damage against opposing Fire-types. Night Slash also guarantees the OHKO on many of the Ghost- and Psychic-types that Pursuit is designed to trap, but when the opponent decides not to switch.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A bulkier spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe can be used in order to take weaker ineffective attacks better while still maintaining the jump on positively-natured base 115s. The choice in item is a personal preference, with Choice Band allowing Weavile to deal more damage and embrace a revenge killer role while Life Orb gives Weavile free reign over its moves at the cost of HP. Do note that if you choose Choice Band, Rapid Spin or Magic Bounce support is mandatory. Teammates capable of keeping entry hazards away from Weavile, such as Blastoise, Hitmontop, and Xatu, all make for great partners. Depending on your choice of move in the fourth slot, Weavile will require some custom support. If you opted for Ice Punch, teammates capable of removing bulky Water- and Fire-type Pokemon are greatly appreciated. Kingdra, Zapdos, and Rhyperior are all capable of removing at least one of those two types from battle. If Night Slash was chosen, partners capable of removing Fighting-types will be desired. Cofagrigus, Slowbro, and Togekiss are all good candidates for removing Fighting-types and can help ease Weavile's need to come in and defeat the opposition.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Pickpocket can be used to possibly nab viable one-time use items, such as a Focus Sash, Dark Gem, or Lum Berry from the opponent if physical contact is made. It is recommended that the bulkier EV spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe is used if you opt for Pickpocket, as the extra bulk can help Weavile last longer. A set consisting of a Focus Sash, Swords Dance, and Beat Up can be used; however, it's a fairly predictable set and Weavile is usually treated as if it is already carrying a Focus Sash. Agility can be used in tandem with an Adamant nature on the Swords Dance set over Swords Dance and a Jolly nature, making Weavile the fastest thing to step foot in the tier, but it will miss out on many OHKOs that Weavile can net once it sets up with Swords Dance and it requires more support than the original Swords Dance set. Brick Break can be used to guarantee set damage against all Normal-, Rock-, Steel-, and Ice-types, allowing Weavile to do more damage against lighter foes such as Ambipom and Durant. However, Low Kick still does more damage against heavier foes, specifically Snorlax, Abomasnow, and Rhyperior, and Weavile's STAB attacks are usually enough to typically hit Pokemon harder than Brick Break.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bulky Water-type Pokemon, most notably Suicune and Swampert, sponge Weavile's attacks with extreme ease and can threaten it with Scald or Roar. Beefy Steel-types, such as Bronzong and Escavalier, can all take Low Kick relatively well and threaten Weavile with their STAB move of preference. However, despite resisting both of Weavile's STABs, Registeel cannot afford to switch in on either a Low Kick or a Swords Dance. Outspeeding Weavile with a Choice Scarf user, such as Mienshao, Victini, Chandelure, Rotom-H, Heracross, or Darmanitan, is a solid way of checking Weavile, as they immediately threaten it with their powerful STAB attacks. However, both Mienshao and Heracross take severe damage from a +2 Ice Shard, with the former being OHKOed and the latter taking about 67%. In a pinch, Intimidate users, such as Arcanine, Hitmontop, and Qwilfish, may be used to check Weavile, reducing its Attack stat. Qwilfish also has the added benefit of carrying Thunder Wave, potentially crippling Weavile for the remainder of the match. However, both Qwilfish and Arcanine must be wary of a +1 Night Slash. Hitmontop, on the other hand, carries a super effective STAB and won't be bothered much by +1 Ice Shard, as many Weavile do not carry Ice Punch. Azumarill and Sharpedo are also stable checks to Weavile, as Azumarill OHKOes with Aqua Jet and Sharpedo outspeeds Weavile after a single Speed Boost. However, Sharpedo can only switch in on variants without a Swords Dance boost, as Ice Shard may be able to knock Sharpedo out once at +4.</p>
