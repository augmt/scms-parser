[Overview]
<p> In a tier dominated by Water-, Electric-, and Ground-types, such as Suicune, Slowbro, Raikou, and Rhyperior, Rotom-C stands out as a great check to many of them. It is one of the best Water-type counters in the game, with its Electric and Grass STABs providing super effective coverage against any Water-type. Unfortunately, with pros come cons, and while Rotom-C resists some of the main offensive types in the UU metagame, it is also weak to other common offensive types including Ice, Fire and Bug. </p>

<p>Rotom-C's movepool gives it a number of offensive and defensive options. Rotom-C functions well as a Choice Scarf user thanks to its base 86 Speed, which is a cut above base 85s such as Heracross. Rotom-C's immunity to Earthquake also comes in handy, as this means it can switch in and out freely with Volt Switch. The ability to use Trick complements Choice sets well, as it can either cripple opposing walls and render them useless or ease prediction by Tricking an offensive enemy. However, if Choice items are not your cup of tea, then Rotom-C can also elect to run a non-Choiced set with Pain Split. Rotom-C also has access to niche status moves, such as Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, to cripple opponents, a combination of moves which other Electric- and Grass-types rarely have. Finally, Volt Switch allows Rotom-C to gain momentum by ensuring the correct switch, making it a useful partner to offensive threats. In conclusion, Rotom-C is a very good Pokemon and is capable of succeeding more than decently with just the right amount of support.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>When donning a Choice Scarf, Rotom-C functions as a very powerful revenge killer, with its 140 Base Power STAB Leaf Storm being able to OHKO multiple frail enemies in the UU metagame, including but not limited to Sableye and Mienshao. Meanwhile, Volt Switch can be used to gain momentum on the opponent by switching out to counter whatever your foe just switched in, although if you predict a Ground-type switch-in, you can use Leaf Storm to, more often than not, OHKO it.</p>

<p>Trick can be used to nullify a dedicated special wall's utility, and because special tanks, such as Snorlax and Porygon2, make for good switch-ins to Rotom-C, it is relatively easy to predict a switch. Rotom-C's dual STABs, although deadly to Water-types, are unfortunately resisted by Grass-types. A Hidden Power on Rotom-C can be used to relieve this burden, but most Grass-types are only 2HKOed by Hidden Power and can take action against Rotom-C. Fret not, as Volt Switch on Rotom-C does just the job by allowing you to switch out to an appropriate Grass-type counter.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>Math dictates that a STAB neutral Thunderbolt does more damage than a super effective Hidden Power. However, Hidden Power can come in handy sometimes when you need to immediately eliminate specific threats such as Ferroseed, Escavalier, Gligar, and Flygon. A standard EV spread is used; the remaining 4 EVs are sent to Special Defense to give Porygon2 and Porygon-Z an Attack boost if they use Download. A Timid nature is preferred on Rotom-C in order to outspeed positive natured base 85 Speed Pokemon, especially Jolly Heracross.</p>

<p>Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are plausible options for neutering threats such as Snorlax and non-Substitute Raikou, allowing teammates to deal with them easily. However, care must be taken when using those moves as being locked into a non-damaging move can be taken advantage of by the opponent to set up with dangerous Pokemon such as Swords Dance Heracross.</p>

<p>Blastoise is a good partner for Rotom-C, spinning away Stealth Rock from the field while blocking Fire-type attacks from threats such as Darmanitan, which outspeeds Rotom-C. Rotom-C is able to support Spikes stackers thanks to its offensive presence, being able to annihilate common spinners such as Blastoise, Claydol, and even Hitmontop. An exceptional Spikes user that pairs well with Rotom-C is Qwilfish, as it resists the Bug-, Ice-, Poison-, and Fire-type moves that are dangerous for Rotom-C, while Rotom-C provides Electric and Ground resistances.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Rotom-C is commonly seen as an offensive monster, but it also has often overlooked base 107 defenses, which permit it to function as a semi-bulky sweeper. A significant HP investment is used to remedy its low base 50 HP, which bolsters the effect of Pain Split, granting a greater health recovery while dealing greater damage to the opponent. Thunderbolt can be used to dish out more damage to enemy Pokemon, but Volt Switch permits switching to a more suitable teammate, thereby keeping momentum. Will-O-Wisp is useful for neutralizing enemy physical attackers. Alternatively, if physical attackers do not pose a threat to your team, Thunder Wave can be considered for its ability to cripple faster threats</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>You can customize the EV spread of Rotom-C to your needs, increasing the Special Attack EVs as necessary. The defensive spread on Rotom-C is useful for defeating Ground- and Water-types. This defensive Rotom-C set is specially tailored to combat Krookodile, Rhyperior without Megahorn, Scarfed Flygon, Sharpedo, and offensive Swampert, just to name a few. A specially defensive spread is not used because its niche role is already fulfilled by Roserade.</p>

<p>The bulky set's teammates should play off its ability to pivot for momentum while inflicting status for the team's needs. Anti-Fire-type support is needed for Rotom-C to function to its best potential, because they are immune to the effects of Will-O-Wisp, resist Leaf Storm, and can even retaliate with their own super effective STAB attacks. A good candidate for fighting Fire-types is Blastoise, which also has the ability to spin away Stealth Rock from the field, which causes irritating residual damage to Rotom-C. Offensive threats which appreciate the removal of bulky Water-types &mdash;for example, Slowbro and Suicune&mdash;make good partners to Rotom-C, thanks to Volt Switch's ability to gain momentum. Some of these threats include Heracross and Darmanitan.</p>

evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Rotom-C is gifted with an amazing STAB move combination; Leaf Storm's sheer power can deal massive amounts of damage even to resistances while Thunderbolt offers more consistent power. Thunderbolt is used when the switching out granted by Volt Switch is not necessary, permitting you to attack repeatedly without having to remove Rotom-C from the field. The extra power from the Choice Specs allows you to OHKO frail Pokemon, such as Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Raikou, Lanturn, Medicham, and more, with Leaf Storm.</p>

<p>Grass-types resist both of Rotom-C's STABs, but you can use Volt Switch to switch into an appropriate teammate to deal with them. Trick is also useful to cripple defensive or support opponents permanently, such as Snorlax, Umbreon, and Uxie, allowing a teammate to finish them off.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>Choice Specs Rotom-C is more commonly seen on offensive teams due to its sheer power, but you can also use it as a pivot for bulky offense or semi-stall teams. Choice Specs grants Rotom-C major offensive presence, allowing it to hit like a truck and 2HKO a large number of UU Pokemon. Thanks to its many resistances and one immunity to common attacking types, Rotom-C generally has many opportunities to switch in, especially on Earthquakes and Thunderbolts. Since Choice Specs Rotom-C is mainly a wallbreaker, Pokemon that enjoy the removal or weakening of Gligar, Rhyperior, and bulky Water-types such as Slowbro make great partners for this set. Good candidates include Choice Scarf Darmanitan and Heracross.</p>

[SET] 
name: Non-Choice Attacker
move 1: Leaf Storm
move 2: Volt Switch / Thunderbolt
move 3: Will-O-Wisp / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Pain Split
item: Expert Belt / Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>This set is a good lure because Rotom-C is running a Choice set most of the time, and as such, opponents who expect you to be locked into Thunderbolt may daringly switch their Swampert, Lanturn, or Quagsire in, only to be OHKOed by a powerful Leaf Storm. This set works better on more balanced teams, as it sacrifices power and speed for bulk, semi-reliable recovery, and the ability to switch moves, while also packing a status move to support its team. Leaf Storm is the main offensive move used as usual, but it is hard to use on this set, since it will be extremely weakened after the first use. Thunderbolt or Volt Switch is the staple move for weakened enemies, so Rotom-C doesn't have to switch out early due to a lack of power. Pain Split is semi-reliable recovery which also damages the opponent as a bonus.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>The EVs are customizable; the ones used here maximize Rotom-C's offensive prowess, with a Timid nature to outpace Life Orb Nidoking, Timid Togekiss, non-Scarf Heracross, and Kingdra. A more defensive spread can also be used, with 120 HP EVs and a Modest nature to get a better use of Rotom-C's resistances and force even more switches. With this spread, Rotom-C can outrun an Adamant Honchkrow and force it to Sucker Punch, although the best option against it is probably Will-O-Wisp anyway. Since Snorlax and Umbreon wall Rotom-C, Fighting-types, such as Heracross and Hitmontop, should be included as teammates. You can customize your Rotom-C with 140, 208, or 220 Speed EVs, with the remainder dumped into HP, to outspeed different prominent threats, such as Honchkrow, neutral-natured base 80 Speeds such as Gallade, Togekiss, Chandelure, and positive-natured base 70 Speeds such as Bisharp respectively.</p>

[Other Options]
<p>Thunder Wave can be used over Will-O-Wisp as a status move to cripple fast enemies if physical attackers aren't a problem for the team. Charge Beam is an alternative option to facilitate a late-game sweep if used correctly. Shadow Ball can be used as an extra coverage option to attack the numerous Ghost- and Psychic-types in the tier, such as Mew, Mismagius, Cofagrigus and more, dealing similar super effective damage to a neutral Leaf Storm but not causing a -2 Special Attack drop. A ChestoRest set can give Rotom-C another chance at life to help the team. This is possible on the bulky set to restore Rotom-C to full health. A RestTalk set can be used instead to give better recovery to Rotom-C. It can also be used as a sleep fodder for the team, but that is better left to other superior sleep fodders such as Suicune. It is possible to run a SubSplit set, but Leaf Storm's -2 Special Attack drop makes it difficult to keep Rotom-C on the field for long, which reduces staying power and makes it unviable.</p>

[Checks and Counters]
<p>Several notable checks to Rotom-C include Fire-types, such as Arcanine and Victini, which can tank Leaf Storms and Hidden Powers and retaliate with a STAB Fire move, which can usually OHKO Rotom-C. Fast Ice-types, such as Weavile and Froslass, serve as temporary checks that can OHKO with a STAB Ice move but are unable to switch in on Leaf Storm. Escavalier, Durant, Ferroseed, and Abomasnow resist Rotom-C's STAB moves and can OHKO back, but can be dealt with a 4x effective Hidden Power Fire. Roserade can take Leaf Storms and Thunderbolts and set up on Rotom-C or even OHKO with a Sludge Bomb, while being bulky enough to take two or three super effective Hidden Powers. To deal with such checks, it is possible to repeatedly use the appropriate coverage move to deal super effective damage to them or just switch out either conventionally or with Volt Switch.</p>

<p>Hard counters to Rotom-C include Rotom-H and Snorlax. Rotom-H resists all of the attacks Rotom-C can throw at it and OHKOes with Overheat while not minding Trick. Snorlax has massive HP and Special Defense, allowing it to wall Rotom-C, and can dent it with Return or catch it on the Volt Switch with Pursuit. Tricking a Choice Specs onto Snorlax can cripple it for the match, however. In such cases, the preferred method is still to Volt Switch out and let an appropriate teammate deal with Snorlax, as Rotom-C does not always want to lose its Choice item.</p>
