[Overview]

<p>Feraligatr, one of the top physical sweepers of DPP UU, returns in BW UU to wreak havoc on a whole new metagame. With access to physical sweeping options in Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, as well as a decent offensive movepool, it can make use of its 105 base Attack and decent Speed to destroy opposing teams. Feraligatr's solid typing and decent bulk complement these features well, affording it many opportunities to sweep.  Unfortunately for the gator, it struggles to actually OHKO a majority of the top UU defensive threats without major entry hazard support, and is easily OHKOed by a tickle from any special Grass- or Electric-type move.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its bread-and-butter offensive set, Feraligatr can use Dragon Dance to boost its Attack and Speed in a fashion akin to Gyarados. Waterfall is Feraligatr's main STAB move; it deals consistent  damage, has a useful flinch chance, and receives a large boost in power should Feraligatr activate its Torrent ability. Ice Punch allows Feraligatr to hit the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Waterfall for super effective damage. In the third slot, Earthquake grants Feraligatr neutral coverage on the myriad Water-types in UU, as well as super effective coverage on Registeel. Alternatively, Low Kick can OHKO Registeel but deals much less damage to most Water-types. The EVs for this set allow Feraligatr to outrun positive-natured base 120 Speed Pokemon such as Sceptile after one boost.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Feraligatr, like all set-up sweepers, greatly appreciates dual screens support to afford it more opportunities to set up and sweep. Since Feraligatr outright loses to bulky Water-types like Slowbro, bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth make fantastic partners. Bulky Will-O-Wisp users, such as Weezing and Mew, put a major halt to any Feraligatr sweep as well, making Rotom-H a great partner to threaten both Water- and Grass-type Pokemon with its STAB attacks. Rotom-H can also switch in on Will-O-Wisp freely and Trick a Choice item to cripple a wall. Roserade is another good partner for Feraligatr; it can switch in easily on many of Feraligatr's counters and defeat them, particularly most Shaymin and Tangrowth, and can also set up Toxic Spikes to wear down walls. Hazard support in general is extremely useful, aiding Feraligatr's sweep by allowing it to net more KOs.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Feraligatr can use Swords Dance instead of Dragon Dance, forgoing a Speed boost to gain immense power. After a Swords Dance, Feraligatr hits a monstrous 678 Attack, which may be further boosted should it be put into Torrent range. Waterfall and Return grant it perfect neutral coverage against everything in UU bar Empoleon and the rare Ferroseed, while Aqua Jet allows Feraligatr to dispatch faster, frail Pokemon which would otherwise easily revenge kill Feraligatr. For an example of the sheer power of this set, Feraligatr 2HKOes Slowbro, the premier physical wall of UU, after one Swords Dance. Waterfall also 2HKOes Empoleon after a Swords Dance, so practically nothing can wall Feraligatr after it has managed to grab a boost.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set also appreciates screens to facilitate setting up, especially because it can't outspeed as many Pokemon as the Dragon Dance set can. As Swords Dance Feraligatr can break through walls much more easily, faster Pokemon that can survive Aqua Jet, such as Shaymin and Roserade, are the greater worry. Teammates that can switch into Grass- and  Electric-type attacks and KO Feraligatr's checks to open the way for a sweep are therefore ideal. Rotom-H is once again a good partner, Tricking Choice items onto walls and easily taking the Grass- and  Electric-type attacks that plague Feraligatr. Other Pokemon that appreciate bulky Waters being eliminated pair well with this Feraligatr.  For example, Choice Band Arcanine is significantly more fearsome with its Flare Blitzes after the likes of Slowbro, Milotic, and Suicune are taken out of the picture.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While the previous sets are all severely crippled by status, whether it be burn or paralysis, this set remedies that with Substitute, which allows Feraligatr to set up on slower Pokemon that rely on status to counter it, such as Weezing and Slowbro. This also prevents Milotic and Slowking from phazing it with Dragon Tail and foils Poliwrath's attempts to Circle Throw it out. Additionally, Substitute shields Feraligatr from priority and Grass- and Electric-type attacks that would end its sweep. Electric-types in particular can no longer revenge kill Feraligatr with Volt Switch, as they will be forced to switch out. Substitute is also useful to push Feraligatr into Torrent range to significantly power up Waterfall. At +2 with Torrent activated, Feraligatr 2HKOes even the bulkiest Registeel. Since Feraligatr has decent physical bulk, it finds plenty of opportunities to set up. The EVs for this set allow Feraligatr to outspeed positive-natured foes with base 100 Speed after one Dragon Dance; the rest of the EVs max out Feraligatr's attacking power and then add to its bulk to afford it more setup opportunities.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The high bulk of this set will often allow Feraligatr to set up more than once; consequently, Wish users are helpful to heal Feraligatr and give it the opportunity to sweep again. Since being walled is not as much of a problem with this set, teammates should focus on being able to switch in on, or even lure out and KO, potential revenge killers. Rotom-H, as with the other sets, switches in on attempts to revenge kill Feraligatr and dispatches Grass-types such as Shaymin with Overheat. Shaymin itself can beat many of Feraligatr's potential revenge killers, as it too can switch in easily on Grass- and Electric-type attacks and retaliate with Hidden Power Ice, Hidden Power Fire, or Seed Flare.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Feraligatr gets Rest and Sleep Talk along with defenses on par with Blastoise's; however it can't Rapid Spin and is generally outclassed in a defensive role by other bulky Waters. Feraligatr can also run a Substitute + Focus Punch set, but this is done better by Poliwrath, who gets Encore and STAB Focus Punch. Feraligatr can use Superpower to break through Ferroseed, but it will lower Feraligatr's Attack and Defense and therefore hinder its sweep. Lastly, Feraligatr has a decent special movepool, but sadly lacks the stats to use  it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Tangrowth and Slowbro can both switch in, take any of Feraligatr's attacks, and threaten it with Power Whip or cripple it with status; however, they have to be wary of  Substitute variants. Hazers like Milotic and Weezing can easily come in and negate Feraligatr's boosts, while fast Scarfers with Grass- or  Electric-type moves can easily revenge Feraligatr.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Feraligatr gets Sheer Force from the Dream World. This ability will be very helpful, increasing the power of Waterfall and Ice Punch, as well as negating Life Orb recoil. Unfortunately, Feraligatr will likely have to forgo Dragon Dance with Sheer Force.</p>
