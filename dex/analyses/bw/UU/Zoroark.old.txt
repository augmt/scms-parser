[Overview]

<p>Zoroark is a very unique Pokemon; its signature ability, Illusion, allows it to masquerade as the last Pokemon in the player's party. Although Team Preview theoretically hurts this strategy, it does not say when or even if Zoroark will be used in the battle. Zoroark is also very powerful in terms of offense, wielding a base 105 Attack and a base 120 Special Attack. In addition, Zoroark learns both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, allowing it to boost either of its offensive stats. With 105 base Speed, it outspeeds positive natured base 100s, while also forcing a Speed tie with Mienshao and Mismagius. However, Zoroark's biggest downfall is its very poor bulk; it can barely switch in on neutral hits, and has trouble facing down priority moves such as Aqua Jet and Mach Punch. As such, Zoroark is a difficult Pokemon to use effectively. Although it may be viewed as a gimmicky Pokemon, it is very deadly when used properly.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Because Zoroark learns Trick through the BW2 move tutors, Choice Specs Zoroark has increased in effectiveness tremendously. Not only does it hit 508 Special Attack with the boost from Choice Specs, it can now also cripple the likes of Gligar and Hitmontop, making these Pokemon significantly easier to handle. Although both Dark Pulse and Night Daze will hit anything that doesn't resist it very hard, it is generally better to use the former over the latter due to having perfect accuracy. However, Night Daze has slightly more power, and the accuracy drop it may inflict could be useful. With threats like Snorlax, Empoleon, Scrafty, and Umbreon weak to Fighting, Focus Blast grants Zoroark the ability to hit them for massive damage. Although Flamethrower generally provides redundant coverage alongside Focus Blast, it is Zoroark's strongest option against common UU Pokemon such as Bronzong and Roserade.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Because Zoroark's defenses are terrible, its EV spread should simply maximize Special Attack and Speed, the only two stats it can make any good use of. If bulky Water-types are a problem for you, Zoroark can use Grass Knot over Flamethrower to hit them, at the cost of having no way of hitting Heracross. Using Grass Knot over Focus Blast may seem like a solution to this problem, but without Focus Blast, Zoroark has no way of hitting Pokemon like Snorlax and Empoleon.</p>

<p>When considering a Pokemon to disguise Zoroark as, it is ideal to use a Pokemon that takes the same entry hazards damage as Zoroark. In addition, it should be able to lure defensive Pokemon, such as Cofagrigus or Gligar, that Zoroark can OHKO or cripple with Trick. Choice Scarf Heracross therefore makes a great partner as Zoroark can OHKO Cofagrigus with Dark Pulse and cripple Gligar with Trick. Zoroark will have trouble with Choice Scarf Mienshao and opposing Choice Scarf Heracross as both outspeed and OHKO it. Using a Cofagrigus of your own helps with this problem as it can switch in on both threats with ease and cripple them with Will-O-Wisp; in addition, Mummy nullifies their abilities, which is especially important in the case of Heracross.</p>

[SET]
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Dark Pulse / Night Daze

move 3: Flamethrower / Grass Knot
move 4: Sucker Punch
item: Life Orb
nature: Naive
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With great coverage and access to Sucker Punch, Zoroark can run an all-out attacker set capable of a late-game sweep. Many players will attempt to check Zoroark by using a faster Pokemon. However, with Sucker Punch, Zoroark can pick off weakened revenge killers. Dark Pulse or Night Daze are used for STAB alongside Sucker Punch, due to the fact that Sucker Punch fails if the opponent does not attack. Focus Blast provides Zoroark with nearly unresisted coverage, giving it an option to hit Snorlax, Empoleon, and Umbreon; in addition, Focus Blast OHKOes any Scrafty that does not invest in its Special Defense. Flamethrower gives Zoroark an option for hitting Pokemon such as Heracross and Bronzong. However, if you have these threats covered already, Grass Knot is a solid option worth considering over Flamethrower in order to get a harder hit on Pokemon such as Suicune and Swampert.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread simply maximizes Special Attack and Speed; maximizing Zoroark's Speed allows it to tie with Mienshao and Mismagius, and investing in extra Attack EVs does not give Sucker Punch any notable KOs. Even when using Focus Blast, Zoroark may still struggle against Pokemon such as Snorlax, as it does not OHKO. Heracross is a good teammate as it can handle Snorlax easily. In addition, while disguised as Heracross, Zoroark can lure Pokemon such as Gligar and Cofagrigus that trouble Heracross. Fighting-type Pokemon carrying Choice Scarf will be difficult for Zoroark to handle, as they outspeed and OHKO it. To make matters worse, Fighting-types resist Sucker Punch. Cofagrigus is a great switch-in to these threats due to its massive Defense, immunity to Fighting, and ability to cripple them with Will-O-Wisp.</p>

[SET]
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Flamethrower / Substitute
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Zoroark is one of few Pokemon with access to Nasty Plot, allowing it to also function as a powerful boosting sweeper. At +2, Zoroark reaches 678 Special Attack, which, when coupled with Life Orb, makes it incredibly difficult to wall; not even Snorlax can wall it, as it is OHKOed by a +2 Focus Blast after Stealth Rock. Dark Pulse should be the only STAB move ever used on this set, as missing is undesirable. In addition, the extra power from Night Daze is not as relevant with Nasty Plot boosts. Focus Blast lets Zoroark hit everything bar Heracross at least neutrally when combined with Dark Pulse, while also allowing it to get past Pokemon such as Snorlax, Umbreon, and Scrafty. Flamethrower is Zoroark's strongest option against Bronzong, Roserade, and Heracross, while Substitute is another option worth considering due to the fact that Zoroark will force many switches thanks to Illusion. In addition, Substitute gives Zoroark a buffer against enemy attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>When Substitute is used over Flamethrower, it is preferred to use Leftovers as Zoroark's held item instead of Life Orb. With Substitute and Life Orb chipping away at Zoroark's health, it will go down very quickly. However, having to use Leftovers will cause a notable drop in Zoroark's damage output. When using Flamethrower, Zoroark should always use Life Orb as its held item because if it doesn't OHKO the opponent, its sweep will likely be cut short.</p>

<p>Zoroark's disguise should be able to force out plenty of Pokemon, as this is the best way to grant Zoroark opportunities to set up. Heracross can force out Pokemon such as Snorlax and Empoleon, which Zoroark would otherwise be unable to set up on. Although Cofagrigus may seem like a strange disguise, it forces out any Fighting-type not named Scrafty, giving Zoroark even more opportunities to set up. In addition, Cofagrigus can learn Nasty Plot as well, so the disguise is not necessarily broken when Zoroark uses Nasty Plot.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Dark Pulse / Night Daze
move 2: Flamethrower
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Trick / U-turn
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>By using a Choice Scarf, Zoroark becomes an effective revenge killer who can get surprise kills due to its signature ability. In addition, while many players may attempt to use Choice Scarf Heracross to revenge kill Zoroark, this strategy will backfire against Choice Scarf Zoroark. Night Daze is a little more valuable on this set than it is on other sets because the extra damage output may be incredibly useful when attempting to revenge kill an opposing Pokemon, but it is still generally better to use Dark Pulse due to its perfect accuracy. However, Night Daze may drop the opponent's accuracy, which can come in handy if Zoroark cannot OHKO the opposing Pokemon. Focus Blast attains near-perfect coverage alongside its STAB, and allows Zoroark to revenge kill Scrafty. Although Flamethrower has redundant coverage alongside Focus Blast, it allows Zoroark to hit Heracross for super effective damage. In the last slot, Trick is generally more useful as it can cripple defensive Pokemon such as Cofagrigus, Dusclops, and Gligar; however, by using Trick, the opponent may be able to sweep more easily later. Because of this, U-turn can be used to gain momentum when the opposing Pokemon switches out.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Hidden Power Ice can be used on this set as it hits Gligar super effectively, but it has poor coverage otherwise. Unlike other Zoroark sets, this set is not weak to Choice Scarf Heracross, as Zoroark outspeeds and KOs it with Flamethrower after a little prior damage. However, Choice Scarf Mienshao may still be a problem, as it ties with Zoroark and OHKOes with High Jump Kick. Cofagrigus handles Mienshao with ease due to its immunity to High Jump Kick and its massive Defense stat. Zoroark will be a much more effective revenge killer if disguising it as Pokemon that encourage whatever you want to revenge kill to stay in. Disguising it as Slowbro encourages special attackers, such as Chandelure and Roserade, to stay in, allowing Zoroark to revenge kill these Pokemon with Dark Pulse and Flamethrower, respectively. On the other hand, although disguising it as Snorlax may seem like a terrible idea as both Snorlax and Zoroark are weak to Fighting-type attacks, disguising it as Snorlax encourages Heracross and Scrafty to stay in, allowing Zoroark to revenge kill both Pokemon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Zoroark learns Pursuit, which may seem appealing to trap Pokemon such as Chandelure and Mismagius. However, Zoroark lacks the stats to effectively use Pursuit, making Weavile and Honchkrow better options for using Pursuit. By using Taunt, Zoroark prevents the opponent from going for non-attacking moves, making Sucker Punch much more effective. However, Zoroark is so frail that if the opponent does decide to attack the turn it uses Taunt, Zoroark is likely to get OHKOed. Calm Mind boosts both Zoroark's Special Attack and its Special Defense, but its poor defenses make Nasty Plot a better option. Zoroark does have the Attack stat to use a Swords Dance set, but it does not have the physical movepool to pull off an effective one. Although Zoroark has the coverage to pull off an Agility set, this set is weak and Zoroark is already fast enough without Agility. Extrasensory can hit Fighting-types, but it has poor coverage and doesn't hit much outside of Hitmontop, Machamp, and Mienshao.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>When Illusion is in effect, countering Zoroark is virtually impossible unless you see something like a Flygon taking Spikes damage. When disguised as Heracross, Cofagrigus and Dusclops get smashed by Dark Pulse or Night Daze on a switch in, while Gligar gets crippled by Trick. Even if the opponent predicts the Pokemon in question to be Zoroark in disguise, Hitmontop will be crippled by Trick. However, once its disguise has been discovered, beating Zoroark is very easy. Specially defensive Togekiss can take any attack from Zoroark and cripple it with Thunder Wave. Hitmontop is another great switch-in, safely taking any attack bar Extrasensory and OHKOing with Close Combat. Snorlax won't enjoy taking a Focus Blast, but it can switch in on any other attack and deal massive damage to Zoroark with its STAB; RestTalk variants of Snorlax 2HKO with Body Slam while offensive variants OHKO with Return after Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>If you can't counter Zoroark, it can be checked by faster Pokemon. Cobalion outspeeds non-Choice Scarf Zoroark and OHKOes with Close Combat, allowing Cobalion to set up Swords Dance as Zoroark flees. In addition, if Cobalion switches in on Dark Pulse or Night Daze, it gets an Attack boost thanks to Justified. Be aware, however, that Cobalion cannot switch in on Focus Blast or Flamethrower. In addition, Zoroark is very easy to revenge kill with Choice Scarf users, particularly Heracross and Mienshao as they resist Sucker Punch.</p>
