[Overview]

<p>Electivire has always been shunned in OU because of his below average Base Power attacks compared to other Pokemon in the OU tier. However, this generation, Electivire is available in the UU tier, where his base 123 Attack and base 95 Special Attack are above average compared to most. Electivire was also given a gift in Wild Charge this generation, a 90 Base Power, Electric, physical attack. Combine this with Electivire's excellent movepool, which is capable of hitting almost every Pokemon super effectively, and Electivire becomes a force to be reckoned with.</p>

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>This set utilizes the awesome super effective coverage of Electivire's incredible movepool to make him a potent wallbreaker. With this set, Electivire gives bulky offense teams and stall teams trouble, and is capable of 2HKOing many common walls seen on these types of teams. Wild Charge is Electivire's STAB move of choice, thanks to his higher Attack stat. Hidden Power Grass hits Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Donphan, who are immune to Wild Charge, and 2HKOes them. Ice Punch hits Grass-types such as Shaymin and especially Roserade, who has a poor Defense stat. Cross Chop allows Electivire to hits a few pesky normal types for super effective damage. However, Earthquake hits Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Registeel, and Arcanine super effectively; OHKOing Nidoking, possibly OHKOing Arcanine with Stealth Rock support, and 2HKOing Nidoqueen and Registeel.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs of this set allows Electivire to outspeed base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Nidoking. It is not worth investing fully into Speed because there are few other base 95 Speed Pokemon in the tier, and those that are commonly used don't usually invest fully in Speed, either. 252 Attack EVs are used to maximize Electivire's Attack, while the rest is put in Special Attack for Hidden Power Grass to hit as hard as possible. A Naive nature ensures that Electivire's offenses are not dampened. Because Life Orb and Wild Charge recoil will bring Electivire down quickly, Expert Belt is a viable alternative. Also, with Expert Belt, Electivire can bluff a Choice set. However, there is a noticeable drop in power without Life Orb.</p>

<p>Electivire fits nicely on practically any team, since most will appreciate his superb type coverage and strong offenses. Electivire is also immune to and gains a Speed boost from Electric-type attacks because of his ability, Motor Drive. Therefore, Water- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Milotic, Slowbro, and Aerodactyl make great partners, as do fast sweepers who fear Thunder Wave. In addition, Electivire makes an excellent recipient of Shell Smash, again thanks to his excellent type coverage and mixed attacking stats. With a Shell Smash, Electivire becomes incredibly hard to wall. Electivire is also immune to Thunder Wave thanks to his ability; the Speed drop of which would otherwise stop his sweep. Gorebyss, in particular, makes a great Shell Smash passer for Electivire because its Water typing attracts Electric-type attacks that Electivire benefits from.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Because of Electivire's excellent attacking stats, it can use a Choice Band or a Choice Specs set effectively. A Choice Band set of 252 Attack / 4 Def / 252 Speed, a Jolly nature, and a moveset of Wild Charge, Ice Punch, Cross Chop, and Earthquake is the most viable: Wild Charge backed up by a Choice Band deals massive damage, while the rest of the moves are for coverage. However, a set leaving him locked into a move, especially a set with 3 moves that have immunities, can be dangerous. Alternatively, Electivire can boost his attack with Meditate. The same EV spread as the Choice Band set and a moveset of Meditate, Wild Charge, Ice Punch, and Earthquake is best. Either Life Orb or Expert Belt can be used.</p>

<p>A Choice Specs set of 252 Special Attack / 4 Def / 252 Speed, a Timid Nature, and a moveset of Volt Switch, Flamethrower, Hidden Power Grass, and Thunderbolt can also be used. Volt Switch allows Electivire to scout and keep up the team's momentum, and since the power drop compared to Thunderbolt is very noticeable, both are used. Hidden Power Grass hits bulky Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Donphan, while Flamethrower allows Electivire to hit Grass-types such as Roserade for super effective damage.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>There are few Pokemon that can come in on Electivire without being threatened by a super effective attack because of Electivire's excellent type coverage. Dusclops and Cofagrigus, however, are not threatened by Electivire due to their high Defense stats and ability to burn him with Will-O-Wisp. Rotom-H resists Wild Charge, Ice Punch, Hidden Power Grass, and is immune to Earthquake thanks to Levitate. Rotom-H's above average Defense stat will allow it to take these hits exceptionally well, and it can threaten Electivire with a STAB Overheat or Will-O-Wisp.</p>
