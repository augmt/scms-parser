[Overview]

<p>Haxorus is blessed with the highest Attack stat in VGC and an amazing pure Dragon typing, but it must work around its middling Speed backed by only slightly above average bulk. The axe-face dragon learns many noteworthy spread moves in addition to powerful STAB moves. Haxorus's powerful attacks are backed by a great ability in Mold Breaker. This ability is all the more fantastic in VGC, as it allows Haxorus to hit Pokemon with the Levitate ability with Earthquake.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Protect
move 2: Dragon Claw
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Rock Slide
item: Haban Berry
ability: Mold Breaker
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Haxorus's most effective set thanks to its flawless coverage and monstrous Attack. Protect stops Fake Out and scouts the opponent's strategy. Dragon Claw is a solid STAB choice, especially due to the rarity of Steel-types in VGC. Rock Slide provides good coverage and breaks Focus Sashes while ignoring Rage Powder. Haxorus is just fast enough to benefit from Rock Slide's flinch rate. Bisharp and other Steel-types resist Rock Slide and Dragon Claw, but take tremendous damage from Earthquake.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Haban Berry prevents Haxorus from being OHKOed by Hydreigon's Dragon Pulse and enemy Haxorus's attacks. These are the only common moves that can OHKO Haxorus, so Haban Berry is an extremely effective item. However, Life Orb could be used to hit bulkier foes much harder. Haxorus will appreciate Life Orb when facing Amoonguss, Conkeldurr, and Musharna. However, lacking Haban Berry leaves Haxorus completely at the mercy of enemy Hydreigon. An Adamant nature and a bulkier EV spread allows Haxorus to be more effective against bulky Trick Room teams. When utilizing the bulky Adamant set, Taunt is a decent option to stop Musharna and Jellicent in their tracks.</p>

<p>Tornadus makes an excellent partner. It is immune to Haxorus's Earthquake and can set up Tailwind easily. Tornadus also takes out Amoonguss in one hit, a feat that Dragon Claw cannot accomplish.</p>

[SET]
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Dragon Claw
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Rock Slide / Protect
item: Life Orb / Haban Berry
ability: Mold Breaker
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The premise of this set is to grab one boost and attack. Haxorus sits at base 97 Speed, which is below the genies, Hydreigon, and many notable Pokemon. A single Dragon Dance allows Haxorus to outpace these major threats and boost its already monstrous attack to astronomical levels. This combination of enhanced power and speed, combined with excellent coverage and passable bulk, makes Haxorus a very threatening sweeper. Earthquake is the best choice for a spread attack, and hits the few Steel-types that resist Dragon Claw and Rock Slide. Rock Slide is Haxorus's most powerful attack against the genies, Volcarona, and Archeops.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb increases Haxorus's damage output and compensates for Rock Slide's and Earthquake's reduced power when hitting both opponents. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed EVs is necessary in case Haxorus is unable to set up Dragon Dance.The EVs can be modified to allow Haxorus to survive specific attacks from threats, such as Hydreigon's Dragon Pulse. Haban Berry can also prolong Haxorus's time on the field; Haban Berry Haxorus can set up Dragon Dance in the face of Druddigon's Dragon Claw or Hydreigon's Dragon Pulse and KO back with a boosted Dragon Claw of its own. This single turn of protection is extremely valuable when one is looking to set up and sweep.</p>

<p>Haxorus also learns Swords Dance, and could potentially use it instead of Dragon Dance in an attempt to smash through the metagame with brute strength. Haxorus's Swords Dance-boosted attacks will OHKO almost every Pokemon in VGC. Unfortunately, Haxorus's unboosted Speed and defensive stats are decidedly mediocre, giving it very little staying power.</p>

<p>Without Tailwind support, abusing Swords Dance will be extremely difficult. Amoonguss or Volcarona can help Haxorus by using Rage Powder, allowing Haxorus to have a free turn to set up.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice
move 1: Dragon Claw
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Outrage / Dual Chop / X-Scissor
item: Choice Scarf / Choice Band
ability: Mold Breaker
nature: Adamant
evs: 36 HP / 252 Atk / 220 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Haxorus outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon in VGC. This strategy forgoes a turn of set up at the cost of being locked into one move. Choice Scarf allows Haxorus to outspeed and KO many of its checks, such as the genies, Hydreigon, Vanilluxe, and Terrakion. Choice Band is also viable, and helps Haxorus to muscle through basically every Pokemon. Rock Slide can 2HKO the genies and occasionally nabs valuable flinches. Earthquake is not a move one should use recklessly, as its effectiveness requires one to consider the presence of Flying-types on both teams. However, the ability to hit Levitate users with Earthquake still makes Mold Breaker the preferred ability.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Keep in mind that Mold Breaker negates your own partner's Levitate or Telepathy. The last move should only be used in specific situations. Outrage should be used when all other moves have no chance of KOing the opponent's Pokemon. Essentially, it should only be used when Dragon Claw is simply too weak. Dual Chop is very valuable against weak Focus Sash and Substitute users. If neither of these moves appeal, X-Scissor hits Musharna and Whimsicott for more damage while maintaining solid coverage. An alternate EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature should be used for the Choice Band set, to compensate for the absence of Choice Scarf.</p>

<p>Haxorus loves having a Flying-type teammate, especially because Ice-types are not as common in VGC 2011. Tailwind helps out Haxorus immensely, especially when using Swords Dance. Tornadus is an excellent partner, as it is immune to Earthquake and can quickly set up Tailwind.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>An Adamant nature can be used to further increase Haxorus's power. HP EVs should be modified when using an Adamant nature to survive any specific attack that troubles Haxorus's team.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bulky Pokemon that cannot be OHKOed by Haxorus, such as Musharna, Cofagrigus, and Amoonguss, can set up Trick Room in its face. Golurk has a lot of bulk and resists Rock Slide. Defensive Scrafty can take anything Haxorus throws at it bar Swords Dance or Choice Band Outrage, and hit back with a super effective Ice Punch. Although rare, Choice Scarf Vanilluxe does a lot of damage with its STAB Ice-type attacks.</p>
