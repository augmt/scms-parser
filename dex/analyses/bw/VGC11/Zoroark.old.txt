[Overview]

<p>Zoroark's ability, Illusion, is both a blessing and a curse. Illusion allows Zoroark to appear as the last Pokemon in the party, giving it the element of surprise and possibly allowing Zoroark to net a KO. However, Team Preview alerts the opponent to Zoroark's presence, meaning that much of Zoroark's surprise factor is gone. Because of this, many players are discouraged from using Zoroark. However, Zoroark still has the potential to be a devastating factor in any VGC match, and should not be overlooked when considering a possible teammate.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is able to heavily damage almost all Trick Room users, and even some of its sweepers. Dark Pulse hits most common Trick Room users for super effective damage. Night Daze has more power than Dark Pulse, but lower accuracy. Night Daze also has the downside of immediately giving away Zoroark's disguise, making Dark Pulse the better choice in most situations. Flamethrower deals heavy damage to Amoonguss and Whimsicott. Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Landorus lacking Yache Berry and 2HKOes Hydreigon, who resists the rest of Zoroark's moves. Protect is always useful in VGC, allowing your partner to set up Tailwind or to stall out an opponent's Trick Room. Sucker Punch is useful for attacking while Trick Room is up and picking off weakened Pokemon, but Protect is generally the superior option for longevity.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If you are running Sucker Punch, Naive is the best nature so as not to drop Zoroark's Attack. However, if running Protect, Timid is optimal to avoid dropping Zoroark's already low defenses. Focus Sash lets Zoroark live an extra turn, because with its frail defenses, it won't last long. Still, one cannot deny the value of Life Orb's significant power boost. Zoroark is a fast and frail attacker, so it needs all the Speed and power it can get. Dark Gem gives Zoroark a one-time, very strong Dark Pulse, possibly allowing it to OHKO some of the less bulky Trick Room setters such as Chandelure, Reuniclus, and Jellicent.</p>

<p>Musharna partners well with Zoroark to give it a Helping Hand boost, and, given the right Illusion, can make the opponent think you are running a Trick Room team. Tailwind greatly supports Zoroark, making Tornadus and Whimsicott good allies. Tornadus has the added benefit of taking out Fighting-types that threaten Zoroark with Acrobatics.</p>

<p>This set is best when Zoroark disguises itself as Chandelure or Jellicent, so you won't be getting hit with Fake Out or Fighting-type moves. Masquerading as Conkeldurr is viable to make opposing Reuniclus try and hit you with Psychic. One must remember that thanks to Team Preview, Zoroark will not always be a surprise. However, this can be used to one's advantage. Having Zoroark at the front of the party and a Pokemon such as Chandelure in the back may discourage the opponent from using a Pokemon that could beat Chandelure. Instead, they may bring their Fighting-type, allowing you to lead with Chandelure and take out the threat to Zoroark.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While its effectiveness has been reduced by Team Preview, this set is still viable. When Zoroark is hit by a physical attack, it survives using the Focus Sash and doles out twice the damage with Counter! If you think you're getting hit with a special attack, then Sucker Punch can take out the threat. Low Sweep can lower the foe's Speed, while also allowing Zoroark to support its team. Flamethrower can be used if you have problems with Amoonguss. Protect helps stall and allow time for threats to be taken out.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Focus Sash is needed so Zoroark can survive strong physical attacks, and Hasty lowers Defense to maximize the damage from Counter. Furthermore, the 0 Defense IV also increases the amount of damage Zoroark takes, and thus, the amount of damage Counter deals. The EV spread maximizes Attack and Speed, with the rest dumped into HP. This set works best when disguised as Terrakion or Scrafty, or any Pokemon weak to Fighting or Bug, as most Fighting-type moves tend to come from the physical side. Disguising it as Amoonguss is an alternative to attract Acrobatics, as well as Heat Waves from Pokemon such as Chandelure.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Grass Knot hits Water-types such as Samurott and Seismitoad hard, but Hidden Power Ice has better overall coverage. Extrasensory could be used for Fighting-types, but Hidden Power Ice hits more Pokemon and Extrasensory won't OHKO most Fighting-types anyway. Night Slash could be used on the Counter set if you don't like Sucker Punch, but the priority from the latter is usually too good to pass up. Taunt is always useful in VGC, but it's often better utilized by a Pokemon with Prankster, such as Tornadus or Thundurus. Furthermore, the Pokemon you would be using Taunt against are Trick Room users, which are weak to Dark, so you are usually better off just attacking. Aerial Ace is also an option on the Counter set, dealing with Fighting-types to an extent. Focus Blast can hit Dark-types such as Hydreigon hard, but the 70% accuracy is very unattractive. A Choice Scarf set could be utilized to come in late-game and clean up the remaining Pokemon, but with Zoroark's paper defenses, this doesn't always work.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Ironically, the main check to Zoroark is not a Pokemon itself. Team Preview allows Zoroark's opponent to plan for it, possibly leading to Zoroark being OHKOed. Otherwise, Fighting-types can hit it very hard, and outside of Extrasensory, Aerial Ace, or Counter, Zoroark can't damage Fighting-types. Bug-types such as Escavalier also give Zoroark trouble.</p>
