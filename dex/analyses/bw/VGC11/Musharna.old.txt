[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Musharna excels at setting up Trick Room and providing the user with a bulky support Pokemon, similar to Cresselia in past years. Psychic is a powerful STAB move coming off of a base 107 Special Attack, capable of dealing high damage to common Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Mienshao. Helping Hand works especially well with Musharna's ability, Telepathy. Being able to simultaneously boost a partner's Surf, Earthquake, or Explosion while maintaining immunity from these attacks is what sets Musharna apart from every other Trick Room user. Musharna has a couple of noteworthy move options in the last slot. Light Screen is a fantastic support move for both Pokemon and further increases Musharna's already impressive bulk. Moonlight works well in VGC 2011 due to the lack of instant weather.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Maximum HP and Special Defense EVs help Musharna take a Shadow Ball from Chandelure, Reuniclus, or Jellicent, a Bug Buzz from Volcarona, or a Dark Pulse from Hydreigon, and live to set up Trick Room. A Sassy nature also allows Musharna to better handle common neutral spread moves, such as Water Spout, Discharge, and Heat Wave. No Speed IVs are applied in order to be as fast as possible in Trick Room. Musharna can fit very well on an offensive team thanks to its phenomenal support moves. Helping Hand has priority and boosts a teammate's Attack and Special Attack for one turn. Musharna can also reverse Trick Room for Tailwind-based teams.</p>

<p>Pokemon that can take advantage of Telepathy and function well in Trick Room are the best teammates for Musharna. A good example of this is Gigalith, who can easily use Earthquake or Explosion without forcing Musharna to Protect or take damage. On the other hand, Terrakion and Landorus also make phenomenal partners. Musharna handles Pokemon that trouble Landorus and Terrakion, such as Amoonguss. In return, both can hit opposing Pokemon that threaten Musharna for super effective damage, such as Bisharp and Chandelure.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Musharna has an array of moves at its disposal. In terms of damaging moves, Shadow Ball can be used to hit Reuniclus, Chandelure, and Jellicent harder. Hidden Power Fighting is an option, granting coverage on Scrafty and Hydreigon. Unfortunately, it will not OHKO these Pokemon. Imprison can completely stop Trick Room from going up and stop other Pokemon from using Protect. It can also prevent other Musharna and Reuniclus from using Psychic on Musharna's teammate. This makes the Terrakion and Musharna combo that much more potent. Magic Coat is a fantastic move that bounces back Taunt, Encore, and Spore. Safeguard can completely shut down Amoonguss. Hypnosis is viable to stop powerful Pokemon such as Scrafty from OHKOing Musharna. A more physically defensive set may fit your team better, so a spread utilizing a Relaxed nature with an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD is viable. This spread takes Rock Slide from Terrakion and Crunch from Krookodile much better. On the other hand, a base 107 Special Attack stat is difficult to ignore, so an offensive set may be utilized. Using a Modest nature and 12 Speed EVs lets Musharna outspeed neutral-natured Amoonguss.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Strong Pokemon who carry physically based super effective attacks pose an instant threat to Musharna. Scrafty is the best counter, as it has Crunch and functions well in Trick Room. Krookodile can deal massive damage to Musharna with a Dark Gem boosted Crunch and also has an immunity to Psychic-type attacks. Golurk has a chance to OHKO Musharna with a Ghost Gem, Iron Fist-boosted Shadow Punch. Hydreigon is immune to Psychic-type attacks and hits back hard with a STAB Dark Pulse. Taunt prevents Musharna without Mental Herb from using support moves.</p>
