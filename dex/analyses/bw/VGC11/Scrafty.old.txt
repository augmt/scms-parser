[Overview]

<p>Scrafty is one of the select few Pokemon in VGC 2011 with access to Fake Out. This gives it a niche as the slowest Fake Out user, making it a useful Pokemon for Trick Room teams. An array of attacking options that are complimented by fantastic unresisted dual STAB make Scrafty a considerable threat with great coverage. Its middling Speed stat allows it to function well both within and outside of Trick Room conditions.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Scrafty is one of only three Fake Out users available in VGC 2011, and as the slowest user of the move, it is most suited for a role in Trick Room teams. Fake Out will incapacitate an opponent for the first turn of the match, making it easier for your partner to twist the dimensions. Drain Punch is the first of Scrafty's offensive options that provides unresisted coverage alongside its coverage moves. Drain Punch also allows Scrafty to recover health and survive longer with its good bulk. Crunch is the second move in its offensive arsenal and an all-round safe option that complements Drain Punch and works off of Scrafty's secondary STAB. The final moveslot will depend on the rest of your team's need. Detect is always useful in Doubles; Ice Punch provides Scrafty with even better coverage, and gives it a reliable way to hit all three genies and other threats, such as Druddigon and Amoonguss, super effectively; Rock Slide can be useful in Trick Room if you enjoy abusing its 30% flinch rate and will still hit two of the genies super effectively, and also leave a huge dent in Volcarona.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice of item is dependent on your playstyle. Chople Berry will give Scrafty some protection against Conkeldurr's Mach Punch, whereas Life Orb will provide you with some handy KOs on Pokemon, such as Chandelure and Jellicent, who can be EVed to survive Scrafty's Crunch without Life Orb. While Shed Skin can be a useful ability to save Scrafty from status, Moxie is generally the superior option as Scrafty has an uncanny ability to stick around for many turns, and therefore is happy to make use of the Attack boosts it is capable of getting with its great coverage.</p>

<p>Within Trick Room, Scrafty can make use of Fling + Iron Ball. Iron Ball reduces Scrafty's Speed to 28 with 0 Speed IV, which will outspeed popular Trick Room Pokemon, such as Conkeldurr, Amoonguss, and Musharna, when Trick Room is in effect. It's also worth noting that Fling will OHKO 252/0 Jellicent. You may want to consider running Zen Headbutt in the third slot to hit Conkeldurr and Amoonguss super effectively. It also comes with a useful 20% flinch chance.</p>

<p>Scrafty also functions well outside of Trick Room, although you may want to invest in some Speed EVs in order to outpace some common threats outside of Trick Room. With an Adamant nature and 20 Speed EVs, Scrafty can outspeed neutral natured Jellicent with no investment in Speed EV. 60 EVs will allow Scrafty to outspeed neutral-natured Chandelure with no Speed EV investment. If you would like to use Scrafty on a Tailwind team, 116 Speed EVs allows Scrafty to outspeed all non-boosted Pokemon but Accelgor when Tailwind is in effect. Focus Sash can be used to save Scrafty from powerful Acrobatics and Bug Buzzes from the likes of Tornadus and Volcarona, respectively.</p>

<p>Scrafty fears Fighting types, especially Conkeldurr who manages to outspeed Scrafty even in Trick Room. Having a Fighting-type resist to switch in or a Pokemon that can KO Conkeldurr is helpful, such as Musharna, who can deal a heavy hit with STAB Psychic as well as set up Trick Room. Scrafty also fears Flying-type attacks from Pokemon such as Tornadus and Archeops. A Pokemon that can take care of these, such as Eelektross is a great teammate. Scrafty's role is usually to support a set-up Pokemon, and then hammer away once it has achieved that role. Trick Room users, in general, are happy to receive this support.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Zen Headbutt is a viable option as it 2HKOes 252/0 Amoonguss 85.14% of the time, and 2HKOes 252/0 Guts Conkeldurr, factoring in burn damage. Scrafty can run a Bulk Up set to take advantage of its good defenses and Drain Punch, however, it is outclassed by Conkeldurr in this aspect, as the latter has the same defenses, a stronger Drain Punch in order to recover more HP, and is generally more threatening than Scrafty.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Conkeldurr is an absolute nightmare for Scrafty as it can use Protect to activate its status Orb, then destroy Scrafty with a Fighting-type attack. Conkeldurr also outspeeds Scrafty in Trick Room and has priority Mach Punch to use outside of Trick Room, making it an absolute terror no matter which way you twist the dimensions. Fighting-types with Inner Focus are a huge problem to Scrafty. The most common of these, Mienshao, also has a faster Fake Out than Scrafty, and will therefore pose a huge headache to it. Sawk and Throh also possess the Inner Focus ability and can threaten Scrafty with their STAB Fighting-type attacks. Archeops, Braviary, and Tornadus can OHKO Scrafty with Acrobatics and will easily outspeed it if Trick Room is not up. Volcarona and Galvantula are on the same boat but with Bug Buzz instead.</p>
