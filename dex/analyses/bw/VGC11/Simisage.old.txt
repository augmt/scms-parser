[Overview]

<p>Some people might look at Simisage and pass him off as too weak and frail to be viable in VGCâ€”those people are right. One would be hard-pressed to find a spot for Simisage on their team, but decent attacking stats and above average Speed give Simisage a small niche in the metagame.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set attempts to utilize Simisage's base 101 Speed and decent base 98 Attack to pull off a sweep. Seed Bomb gives Simisage a powerful STAB move that lands a super effective hit on such threats as Samurott, Jellicent, and Terrakion, while serving as Simisage's main attacking move. With Crunch, Simisage can deal a heavy blow to Psychic-type threats such as Musharna, while maintaining coverage on Jellicent should the foe choose to switch. The third move is dependent on what one's team has the most trouble with. Rock Slide hits Tornadus hard, which otherwise walls Simisage and hits back hard with super effective STAB Acrobatics. If one's team has problems with Hydreigon, Low Kick deals a great amount of damage, allowing Simisage's partner to finish it off. Whimsicott and Amoonguss can give Simisage fits, which might be remedied by pairing Acrobatics with a Flying Gem to threaten them, as well as other Grass-types. Protect gives Simisage a chance to scout, in addition to letting Simisage stay alive for an additional turn, possibly allowing its partner to eliminate a threat.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Simisage's weakness to two very common moves in VGC 2011, Acrobatics and Heat Wave, means a Focus Sash should be used to help Simisage stay alive and continue to hit the opposing team. However, if a teammate of Simisage's is already holding a Focus Sash, a Life Orb allows Simisage to become a little green kamikaze monkey, dishing out as much damage as possible before succumbing to its wounds. An Adamant nature allows Simisage to 2HKO Tornadus with Rock Slide, which is why Tailwind support is so important to Simisage's welfare. A Jolly nature is acceptable to allow Simisage to outspeed Hydreigon, but with Tailwind support this can be remedied. Simisage's defenses are so pitiful that any EVs are better off in its Attack and Speed stats, and the EV spread reflects this notion.</p>

<p>As mentioned throughout, Tailwind support is very important to Simisage, and this should be taken into account when considering possible teammates. Whimsicott sets up Tailwind very reliably, and can Charm physical attackers that would like to hit Simisage with super effective Flying-type attacks. However, this leaves the two open to Chandelure's super effective STAB Heat Wave, which wrecks Grass-types. Tornadus shares no weakness with Simisage, and can set up Tailwind easily with its ability, Prankster.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Where the last set focused on reliability, this set goes for it all with powerful moves, although they might have bigger drawbacks. With 140 Base Power, Leaf Storm deals a huge blow to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. However, after being used Leaf Storm drops Simisage's Special Attack by two stages, making it an all-or-nothing move. If the drop in stats is unattractive, Grass Knot can be used instead to deal somewhat more consistent damage. Hidden Power Ice is Simisage's main path of attack against Flying-type foes, as well as Dragon-types like Haxorus. Focus Blast hits Hydreigon harder than Hidden Power Ice, though it has a nasty 70% accuracy rate. Protect is utilized once again in the last slot for a large number of uses, namely granting Simisage safety for a turn while its partner eliminates a threat or sets up Tailwind.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As stated before, Simisage's frailness makes a Focus Sash the most attractive item for the monkey, although a White Herb is a suitable alternative, providing a one-time negation of Leaf Storm's Special Attack drop. A Modest nature should be used to give Simisage more attacking prowess, and the Speed boost can be forgotten if Tailwind support is available.</p>

<p>Whimsicott is arguably a better partner for this set, as it can utilize Fake Tears to lower foes' Special Defense, allowing Simisage to have a higher damage output than normal. This set has no way to deal with Chandelure, so teammates with moves such as Rock Slide and Sucker Punch are appreciated.

[Other Options]

<p>If Leaf Storm's power drop and Grass Knot's unreliability are unappealing, Energy Ball has a static Base Power of 80, and is a decent alternative. Brick Break is in a similar boat to Energy Ball, hitting for a fixed BP unlike Low Kick. Low Kick will mainly be utilized for Hydreigon whose weight makes Low Kick's Base Power 100, outdamaging Brick Break. Simisage receives Nasty Plot and Work Up, which one might want to utilize on a special or mixed set, respectively, but Simisage's frailty along with the fast-paced metagame of VGC 2011 makes these options a gimmick at best. Low Sweep gives Simisage a way to support its team, lowering foes' Speed and dealing a decent amount of damage. If you want a higher critical hit rate, Shadow Claw has about the same coverage as Crunch, albeit at a lower Base Power, 70 to Crunch's 80.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Simisage lacking Rock Slide are hard-countered by both Chandelure and Tornadus, and even with Rock Slide it will be hard-pressed to defeat them. Thundurus as well can wall Simisage, as many carry a Charti Berry, turning Rock Slide into a 3HKO and hitting back hard with either Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Flying. Eelektross can take most of Simisage's attacks and wreck Simisage with Flying Gem Acrobatics.</p>
