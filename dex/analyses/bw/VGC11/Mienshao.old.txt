[Overview]

<p>Mienshao has great base 105 Speed and base 125 Attack stats that make it a viable threat in the VGC 2011 metagame. Its ability, Inner Focus, gives it an immunity to flinching. To add to all of this, Mienshao also has access to great support moves such as Fake Out and Wide Guard. These attributes allow it to function as a lead, hit hard, and deal damage to the opposing Pokemon.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Mienshao can fit on pretty much any team, although it is extremely useful on setup teams such as Tailwind. It can also function well as a counter to Trick Room users. Mienshao is one of the three users of Fake Out available, and is the only one that is immune to flinching itself. After using Fake Out, Mienshao has decent coverage with Rock Slide and a Fighting-type STAB move, either Drain Punch or High Jump Kick. Wide Guard allows Mienshao to be more of a support Pokemon, as it can cover both of the user's Pokemon at the same time, although this only works with multi-target moves. Protect is a staple move on VGC Pokemon and simply prevents Mienshao from taking a hit.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>High Jump Kick can be used over Drain Punch, but it can be extremely risky considering the number of Ghost-types and Protect users that are present in the metagame. Protect can be used over Wide Guard; although Protect is generally a more reliable move, it does not offer the same high reward that Wide Guard does. VGC 2011 has a large number of Protect users, and Mienshao can use Feint to bypass Protect and deal serious damage. Considering the fact that this is a doubles metagame, with correct prediction, both of the user's Pokemon can attack a Protect user thanks to Mienshao's Feint, making it a useful move to have in its arsenal. Tailwind users are good teammates to Mienshao, as they increase its already high Speed, and make it easier for it to deal damage by allowing it to outspeed several Pokemon. Other setup Pokemon make good teammates, as they enjoy the extra turn provided by Fake Out.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Life Orb can be used to increase damage. Drain Punch is recommended when using this item, as its healing effect can alleviate the recoil taken. Reflect is a decent support move that Mienshao can run if its team is in need of a defensive boost. Quick Guard can be used if you are afraid of priority, but should never be used over Wide Guard or Protect, as both of them are better options.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Mienshao uses Fake Out on the first turn, so it disables at least one of the foe's Pokemon, preventing itself from taking greater amounts of damage. Mienshao can be severely hurt by Pokemon that are faster than it, such as Tornadus and Archeops, which can both take out Mienshao with Acrobatics. If the opponent is able to set up Trick Room or Tailwind, Mienshao might face problems due to its poor bulk, but will still be able to support its team with Wide Guard. Bulky Pokemon that can take a hit from Mienshao and retaliate are also good counters to it.</p>
