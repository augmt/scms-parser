[Overview]

<p>Landorus is a solid choice for a VGC team, having STAB Earthquake as well as a resistance to common spread moves. It is also blessed with great Attack as well as reasonable bulk. While Landorus's unfortunate 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks may seem unfavorable, its power and bulk more than make up for it.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Landorus is meant to be used as a lead, using its powerful spread moves in Earthquake and Rock Slide to crush the opponent. Protect is used to ease prediction, and to allow Landorus's partner to kill Pokemon that threaten Landorus. Earthquake is an amazing move for Landorus, getting STAB on it as well as spread damage. However, it will also damage Landorus’s partner if they aren’t immune to it. Rock Slide is another great choice for Landorus, as it covers the Flying-types who are immune to Earthquake, as well as having spread damage and a chance to flinch. Explosion may have been nerfed in the 5th generation, but when used in conjunction with Normal Gem and Landorus’s high Attack stat, it can still be a powerful field clearing move. Brick Break or Hammer Arm can be used if you're uncomfortable with Explosion. The choice between the two is one of power vs. accuracy.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Adamant is the preferred nature, since it significantly adds to Landorus’s Attack stat, and a Jolly nature doesn't outspeed anything important. Yache Berry can be used to make sure that Ice-type attacks don’t take advantage of Landorus's 4x weakness to it, but the lack of a power boost from Normal Gem makes Explosion much less threatening. Ground Gem can also be used if you find yourself rarely using Explosion. If you don't like Protect, or just need the additional coverage, Explosion as well as a Fighting-type move can be run on Landorus instead of Protect, which in that case is the best option. A partner that's immune or resists Earthquake is a must, as damaging your own Pokemon is anything but beneficial.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Rock Slide

move 4: Explosion
item: Choice Scarf

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Scarf allows Landorus to no longer be threatened by its genie brethren, Tornadus and Thundurus, by outpacing them and doing a significant chunk of damage with Rock Slide. It's also helpful in removing common Choice Scarf users such as Chandelure, who normally threaten Landorus with Hidden Power Ice. Earthquake and Rock Slide are powerful spread moves that take advantage of Lanodrus's great Attack stat. The choice between Brick Break and Hammer Arm is one between accuracy and raw power. Explosion can be a last minute escape option used in order to clear the field of threats to faster based teams, such as Musharna and Amoonguss. Since you have no opportunities to change moves in order to protect your other Pokemon from collateral damage with this set, a Pokemon that's immune to Earthquake is almost required. Musharna makes a particularly good partner for this set, as it can use Helping Hand to boost Earthquake to insane levels.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>There are few other attacks that can be useful on this Landorus, with the possible exception of U-turn. Good partners for Landorus are ones that are immune to Earthquake or resist it. Pokemon that can easily deal with Trick Room users are also important, as Choice Scarf Landorus can do little damage against most Trick Room teams. Choice Scarf Landorus has a couple of notable advantages over its other sets, which must be kept in mind. One of the most important things is that it can outspeed Terrakion, which, with Beat Up support, can threaten Landorus. It also easily destroys faster-based teams that don't have a way to stop Landorus from ripping through them. However, with the genies being so common, being locked into Earthquake can be a liability, forcing Landorus to switch out.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker

move 2: Psychic
move 3: Hidden Power Ice / Grass Knot

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Landorus is meant to surprise opponents who believe that this is the standard physical Landorus. Since the majority of Pokemon in VGC 2011 have higher Defense than Special Defense, Landorus hits the majority of them for slightly more damage. Earth Power is obvious STAB, and Landorus needs it in order to function properly. Psychic is for taking out the various Fighting-types that are common in VGC 2011, as well as Amoonguss. Hidden Power Ice allows Landorus to deal damage to Hydreigon, and covers its genie brethren nicely. However, Grass Knot gives coverage, and allows Landorus to cover Jellicent. The choice between Yache Berry and Life Orb is one of safety vs. power, and the choice is heavily dependent on what kind of team Landorus is used on. Focus Blast can be run in the third slot in order to deal with Scrafty, who commonly carry Ice Punch, as well as Hydreigon, but its unreliable accuracy makes it undesirable.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>If running a sandstorm team, Landorus can be good for setting up sandstorm as well as sweeping in it. Bulk Up and Swords Dance can be useful for boosting Landorus's Attack to amazing levels, but it is risky to set up with Landorus when it's usually a superior option to simply attack the opponent. Fly can be useful if you force the opponent to use Protect on the turn you use Fly, but it is easily countered, and with the popularity of Protect, it is generally not a good idea.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Thundurus with Hidden Power Ice can both outspeed and kill Landorus if Landorus isn't running Yache Berry. Tornadus's Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics can outspeed and KO all but bulky sets. Trick Room shuts down most Landorus, as most Trick Room teams can take Landorus's attacks, as well as outpacing them. Amoonguss in particular can be troublesome to Landorus, as it takes little damage from Earthquake and can retaliate with Spore, which has the chance to incapacitate Landorus for up to three turns. </p>
