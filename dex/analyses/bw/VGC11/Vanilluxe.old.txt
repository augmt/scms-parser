[Overview]

<p>In a metagame dominated by Flying- and Grass-types, Vanilluxe's Ice typing is one of its best qualities. With a huge base 110 Special Attack and surprising bulk, it becomes an invaluable asset, checking the majority of the metagame.</p>

[Set Comments]

<p>Vanilluxe is a very straightforward Pokemon. With a majority of the metagame weak to Ice-type attacks, you will rarely find a time where Vanilluxe will not be firing off Blizzard or Ice Beam. Ice Beam and Blizzard are on the same set in order to ensure that you are prepared for situations where accuracy is essential, while retaining a strong spread attack. Hidden Power Dark is useful for attacking opposing Ghost-types such as Chandelure, and also does a large amount of damage to Jellicent, which neuters its Water Spout. The last moveslot is open to preference; Taunt can be used on a lead Vanilluxe to stop Trick Room from being set up, and is always useful against annoying support Pokemon, but Flash Cannon and Water Pulse can also prove effective depending on what your team needs.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>The given EVs allow Vanilluxe to outspeed base 116 Speed enemies along with Timid Choice Scarf Jellicent to fire off the first move. Hidden Power Rock can be substituted for Hidden Power Dark to ensure an OHKO on Volcarona, while also still hitting Chandelure for super effective damage. If you feel like trying your luck, Sheer Cold is also available for the last moveslot. </p>

<p>Chandelure is an excellent teammate to have in reserve when using Vanilluxe. It serves as a great switch-in versus opposing Chandelure or Fighting-types that Vanilluxe has problems dealing with to waste your opponent's turn and possibly gain a Flash Fire boost. Another beneficial teammate is Mienshao, as its Wide Guard is very helpful for blocking Rock Slides that can stop Vanilluxe right away. Vanilluxe serves as a potential addition to any team and doesn't require much support. </p>

[Other Options]

<p>If you don't like being locked into one move, Autotomize and Icy Wind are other options to consider to outspeed your opponents without Choice Scarf. Vanilluxe also has access to Ice Shard and Explosion and, with a base 95 Attack, it can actually deal some decent physical damage. If you run a hail team variant, Toxic is an optional move that goes well with its Ice Body ability to potentially break down the foe with stall tactics. Vanilluxe's middling base Speed of 79 also makes it a possible addition to a Trick Room team if you find that you need Ice-type support. </p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any Fighting-type Pokemon will give Vanilluxe issues, especially those with access to Mach Punch. Conkeldurr, Terrakion, and Scrafty can easily OHKO Vanilluxe with powerful Fighting-type attacks, and Chandelure, Volcarona, and Darmanitan can do the same with Fire-type moves such as Overheat and Heat Wave. Focus Blast from the genies, Reuniclus, or Hydreigon also has a chance to instantly KO Vanilluxe provided they survive a Choice Scarf Ice Beam or Blizzard.</p>
