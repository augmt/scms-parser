[Overview]

<p>Archeops threatens the metagame with a huge base Attack of 140 and high base 110 Speed. Combine these strengths with an immunity to Ground-type attacks, STAB Rock Slide, and a large attacking movepool, and this bird turns into a large threat for defensively-oriented teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Archeops's massive base 140 Attack and 110 Speed help it muscle through defensive Pokemon in the tier. Acrobatics works quite well with Flying Gem, which powers up Acrobatics for one turn. This makes Acrobatics capable of OHKOing Amoonguss. After Flight Jewel has been used up, Acrobatics's Base Power doubles. This ancient bird boasts the second strongest unboosted Rock Slide in the tier, Gigalith just edging it out with an Attack-boosting nature. Earthquake gets much better coverage than Quick Attack does, and provides a secondary spread attack. On the other hand, Quick Attack finishes off Focus Sash users and lets Archeops get off an extra attack against faster foes before going down. Fast Guard protects both of your Pokemon from Fake Out and Mach Punch, and is a decent option when leading with Archeops. However, Protect gives Archeops a guaranteed turn of survival, and is generally the preferred choice.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Adamant nature could be used, but it gains no additional KOs of great significance. Adamant's primary purpose would be just to increase damage dealt to bulky Pokemon such as Escavalier or Reuniclus. Head Smash could work on a Choice Band set, but the recoil would quickly bring the bird into Defeatist range.</p>

<p>When building a team, take into account that Archeops has many weaknesses. A bulkier Pokemon that resists spread moves which Archeops is weak to is a solid choice. Golurk and Cofagrigus are decent teammates, however, Golurk adds a weakness to Water Spout. Audino can use Simple Beam on Archeops, nullifying Defeatist. Offensive teammates should be tailored to finish off whatever Archeops cannot. Conkeldurr is a solid choice here, resisting Rock Slide and having priority in the form of Mach Punch. Conkeldurr is also free to use Earthquake thanks to Archeops's Flying typing.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Archeops has a decent Special Attack and movepool, but overall, its physical options are much more impressive. Focus Blast's accuracy is very unappealing, and the raw power of Rock Slide and Acrobatics will be sorely missed. A special attacking Archeops is only good for the surprise factor and ignoring the effects of Krookodile's Intimidate. Taunt is an option to shut down bulky Pokemon like Musharna, but Prankster Pokemon are far better at this.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything that can avoid being OHKOed by Archeops and can hit back with a super effective move is as good as a counter can get. Bulky Trick Room users such as Jellicent can set up Trick Room and hit back the next turn. Choice Scarf users with a super effective move, such as Vanilluxe, can outspeed and KO Archeops. Thundurus can cripple Archeops with Thunder Wave, and Tornadus can quickly set up Tailwind, removing the advantage of Archeops's impressive Speed.</p>
