[Overview]

<p>Conkeldurr is a great Pokemon for teams that need a bulky, powerful attacker. It has a base 140 Attack stat, which is boosted even more by Guts. Conkeldurr also has 105 / 95 / 65 defenses, making it rather physically bulky. Conkeldurr can work both in and out of Trick Room, making it a good choice for teams that don't want to be totally dependent on Trick Room. Blessed with a strong priority attack in Mach Punch, Conkeldurr becomes a reliable candidate for any VGC 2011 team. </p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is designed to function either in or out of Trick Room. Conkeldurr already has a huge base 140 Attack stat. However, with a Guts boost, Conkeldurr becomes a massively powerful physical attacker capable of OHKOing a large number of Pokemon. Protect allows Conkeldurr to shelter itself from threats while its status Orb activates and gives it the Guts boost. Wide Guard can be used in place of Protect, providing valuable protection for teammates weak against common spread attacks. Unfortunately, the specificity of its protection does limit its usefulness, particularly for Conkeldurr itself. Mach Punch gives Conkeldurr priority, and with a Guts boost, can finish off weakened Pokemon or KO extremely frail ones. The choice between Drain Punch and Hammer Arm is a choice between healing and power. There are three options for the last attacking move. Rock Slide gives you the ability to hit both opponents, Payback is very effective against faster Psychic- and Ghost-type enemies that lack a weakness to Rock-type attacks, while Earthquake hits all grounded Pokemon on the field. An Adamant nature lets Conkeldurr outspeed a few threats outside of Trick Room, and is recommended if not running Trick Room, while Brave allows Conkeldurr to be one of the fastest Pokemon in the metagame when using Trick Room.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Conkeldurr should always run maximum Attack in order to deal as much damage as possible. An Attack boosting nature is also required, as there is no other stat that is worth investing completely in. A more specially defensive EV spread can also be used, in order to give Conkeldurr even defensive prowess. 152 HP / 252 Atk / 104 SpD effectively gives Conkeldurr as much bulk as possible while minimizing the burn damage from burn due to the Flame Orb. Superpower can replace Drain Punch or Hammer Arm to provide an obscene amount of power the first time it's used, but since it lowers Conkeldurr's Attack and Defense significantly, its usefulness is very limited. Earthquake can be used if Conkeldurr's partner doesn't care about damage from it (generally, when it is immune to or resists Ground-type attacks), and can hit both of the opponent's Pokemon with a strong attack that has perfect accuracy. An important thing to note is that the combination of Drain Punch, Mach Punch, and Wide Guard is illegal with Conkeldurr, and either Drain Punch or Wide Guard must be replaced with Hammer Arm or Protect, respectively.</p>

<p>If running Earthquake, Conkeldurr appreciates a partner that is immune to it. Thundurus makes a great partner, as it can also threaten Tornadus, which is a major threat to Conkeldurr. When not using Earthquake, Chandelure makes an excellent partner, killing bulky Psychic-types and physically defensive Pokemon that Conkeldurr has trouble with. Conkeldurr is an excellent choice to use with Trick Room support, being "faster" than most of the metagame under Trick Room. Reuniclus thus makes a great partner, providing Trick Room and breaking through most physically defensive Pokemon. It also defeats bulky Psychic-types if it runs Shadow Ball.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Fling can be used to burn an opponent's Pokemon. However, if the opponent uses Protect on that turn, you will have effectively wasted a moveslot. Facade can deal a hefty chunk of damage to a variety of Pokemon; however, relying on Normal / Fighting coverage leaves you helpless against Ghost-types. Sitrus Berry can be used to prolong Conkeldurr's lifespan, should you find the constant burn damage undesirable. However, unless Conkeldurr gets Guts activated in some way, it will suffer from a noticeable power drop. Coba Berry can be used to survive Acrobatics from Tornadus, Eelektross, and Archeops.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bulky Psychic-types like Reuniclus and Musharna cause trouble for Conkeldurr, easily taking most of its attacks and KOing it in return with STAB Psychic. Amoonguss can also pose a threat to Conkeldurr, as it completely avoids being 2HKOed by the standard sets, though it can be troubled by Earthquake and must be wary of Facade. Tornadus can outspeed Conkeldurr and KO it with STAB Acrobatics or Hurricane.</p>
