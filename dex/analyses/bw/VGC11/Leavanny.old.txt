[Overview]

<p>Leavanny's above average Attack, decent base 92 Speed, and access to a fantastic ability in Chlorophyll make it a dangerous threat under the sun. Its unique typing also gives it two powerful STAB moves in Leaf Blade and X-Scissor, allowing it to hit a lot of threats pretty hard along with its coverage options. Unfortunately, Leavanny's typing will also prove to be its downfall most of the time, giving it weaknesses to common Rock-, Fire-, and Flying-type attacks. Leavanny also becomes nearly useless without sun support, as its average base 92 Speed leaves it outsped by common threats such as the genies and Hydreigon, not to mention the multitude of Choice Scarf users such as Chandelure. Despite these flaws, Leavanny should not be underestimated, as with the right support, it can be hard to stop.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to Chlorophyll, Leavanny is almost impossible to outspeed under the sun without boosts, making it a fine sun attacker. Leaf Blade is Leavanny's main STAB attack, hitting common threats such as Krookodile and Jellicent very hard, if not OHKOing. X-Scissor is Leavanny's secondary STAB move, hitting Psychic- and Dark-types such as Reuniclus and Hydreigon for massive damage. It also makes Leavanny a fine check to Trick Room teams reliant on Psychic-types to set up the field effect. There are two options for the third moveslot. While Return hits the Fire- and Flying-types who resist Leavanny's STAB moves hard, Shadow Claw allows Leavanny to do massive damage to the ubiquitous Chandelure, a major threat to Leavanny in general, while still giving it excellent neutral coverage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is very straightforward, allowing Leavanny to hit hard and fast. 252 Attack EVs maximize Attack, while 152 Speed EVs allow Leavanny to outspeed every Pokemon under the sun; the remaining EVs should be invested in HP for some additional bulk. The choice between an Adamant and a Jolly nature depend on whether you appreciate a power boost or the ability to outspeed Jolly Lilligant under the sun, respectively. Life Orb and Focus Sash are both viable options for an item. While the former jacks up the power of Leavanny's attacks, the latter allows it to survive an attack at full health while its teammate sets up the sun. However, note that Focus Sash will be useless if both opponents attack Leavanny. It goes without saying that Leavanny needs team support for it to function properly. Whimsicott makes a fantastic partner, as it can set up Sunny Day with priority thanks to Prankster. Chandelure also pairs well with Leavanny, as it can switch into an opposing Chandelure's Heat Wave and gain a boost to its STAB Fire-type moves.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Swords Dance can be used to allow Leavanny to set up and sweep, but it finds it difficult to set up unharmed. The same goes for Agility as well. Leavanny also has access to Baton Pass, but the fast-paced VGC metagame generally makes this strategy a poor option. Leavanny can also set up Sunny Day itself, but it will more often than not get KOed the turn it sets up, and sun support can be provided more reliably by teammates such as Whimsicott.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Though it is almost impossible to outspeed it under the sun, Leavanny's poor defensive stats, middling Attack stat, and weaknesses to many common attacks make it relatively easy to counter. Tornadus can take all of Leavanny's attacks with ease, and OHKOes with Acrobat. Chandelure only fears Shadow Claw, and can incinerate Leavanny with a STAB Heat Wave. It can also set up Trick Room to make Leavanny's high Speed a liability. In general, bulky attackers who can take a hit and KO back in return make excellent checks to Leavanny.</p>
