[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to support Virizion's teammates while maintaining offensive momentum with Close Combat and Leaf Blade. These two moves are the strongest of Virizion's STAB options, and the Fighting Gem powers up Close Combat to compensate for Virizion's middling base 90 Attack. Close Combat and Leaf Blade do not have the best coverage, but they hit certain threats hard enough. For example, Jellicent's Water Spout does next to nothing after it takes a hit from Leaf Blade. Light Screen helps out against the numerous special attackers in VGC, and increases Virizion's ability to handle Discharge, Surf, and Water Spout. Safeguard stops Amoonguss cold, a great asset when considering Amoonguss's resistances to Virizion's STAB attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Stone Edge can replace either attacking move, but has imperfect accuracy and only hits one target. It does get better coverage, though. Fighting Gem works well against Scrafty, Conkeldurr, Hydreigon, and other bulky Pokemon. Without the boost from the Fighting Gem, these Pokemon might not be KOed. However, Lum Berry should be held if Virizion does not have Safeguard. Another option here is Fast Guard, which can stop Sucker Punch, Fake Out, and Mach Punch. Its a valuable move, considering that many of Virizion's ideal partners are hit for super effective damage by these priority moves. Helping Hand is another viable move, since Virizion can survive long enough to boost a teammate's move a few times.</p>

<p>Hydreigon is an excellent choice for a partner, as it resists Heat Wave and threatens most of Virizion's checks. Jellicent also does this job, but more on the defensive side. Any Pokemon that can finish off or weaken bulkier Pokemon also works well. Frail Pokemon can make good use of Light Screen in order to survive an extra turn.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Grass Knot

move 3: Hidden Power Rock
move 4: Protect
item: Life Orb / Lum Berry

evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Virizion's special attacking set is similar to its physical set, except that with Hidden Power Rock, the deer achieves perfect neutral coverage. The given three moves hit many common Pokemon for super effective damage. Focus Blast, while risky, nets OHKOes against Pokemon with low Special Defense. Grass Knot hits Jellicent hard, and generally anything that resists Focus Blast. Chandelure, Thundurus, Tornadus, and many other threats that resist Virizion's STAB attacks are hit hard by Hidden Power Rock. Life Orb or a Modest nature make Virizion's base 90 Special Attack workable.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Focus Blast's accuracy is an issue. On the other hand, special attacking Virizion is not susceptible to Intimidate. Bulkier Jellicent and Chandelure may not be OHKOed all of the time, especially when using a Timid nature without a Life Orb. Hidden Power Ice may be used over Hidden Power Rock. Using Hidden Power Ice, Virizion would be able to have a 31 IV in Speed. Hidden Power Ice also hits many of the same targets as Hidden Power Rock does. It damages Landorus harder, but note that Virizion will now be walled by Chandelure.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>In terms of items, Coba Berry could work to weaken Acrobatics' or Air Slash's power. A bulkier spread of 252 HP / 76 Def / 180 Spe (72 Def / 184 Spe if using Hidden Power Rock) with a Careful or Calm nature increases Virizion's lifespan while outspeeding Modest Hydreigon. Dual Screens could work quite well with this more defensively oriented set. Sacred Sword has less Base Power, but it hits through the Defense boosts of (albeit rare) Bulk Up Pokemon. This is a much better option for a defensive set, as it does not lower Virizion's defenses, a severe drawback to using Close Combat.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Archeops OHKOes Virizion with Acrobatics. Chandelure and Flying-types wall the physical support set and threaten with a super effective move. Reuniclus easily handles Virizion's attacks and has Psychic to bring Virizion down. Trick Room also turns Virizion's amazing Speed into a liability.</p>
