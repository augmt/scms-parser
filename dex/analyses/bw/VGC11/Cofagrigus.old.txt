<p>With massive Defense and Special Defense, but low HP, Cofagrigus is the Dusknoir of VGC 2011. It even performs the same role, setting up Trick Room. The item Mental Herb, along with Cofagrigus's natural bulk, allows it to set up Trick Room almost without fail.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to set up Trick Room, and is very effective at this role. With Cofagrigus's low Speed, Trick Room is perfect for it. Shadow Ball provides Cofagrigus with a solid STAB move, in addition to hitting common Pokemon such as Jellicent and Chandelure for super effective damage. Will-O-Wisp neuters threats such as Scrafty and Bisharp, who threaten Cofagrigus with Dark-type moves. The last move is mainly filler, with Protect being used to allow your partner to KO a threat, or stall out an opposing team's Tailwind. Calm Mind boosts Cofagrigus's Special Defense and Special Attack to increasingly high levels, which, when coupled with its high Defense, will make it hard to KO. Hidden Power Fighting mitigates Cofagrigus's vulnerability to Dark-type enemies, including Scrafty, Hydreigon, and the 4x weak Bisharp.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Mental Herb allows Cofagrigus to set up Trick Room with impunity, since most Pokemon cannot OHKO it, even when double targeted by both enemies. If you have Fake Out support, however, a Sitrus Berry would be best to increase Cofagrigus's longevity. Sassy and max Special Defense EVs are used to reinforce Cofagrigus's weaker Special Defense, leaving physical defense to be covered by Cofagrigus's impressive base 145 Defense. However, if using Calm Mind, some EVs should be diverted from Special Defense to Defense, as Calm Mind can be relied on to enhance Cofagrigus's Special Defense. Kasib and Colbur Berry are options to prevent Cofagrigus from getting OHKOed by Ghost- or Dark-type attacks.</p>

<p>Anything that can ease Cofagrigus's job of setting up Trick Room is greatly appreciated. Good examples of such support include Scrafty's Fake Out and Amoonguss's Rage Powder. One of the few things that could (potentially) KO Cofagrigus is a Heat Wave / Water Spout combo from Chandelure and Jellicent, respectively. In addition to its role of providing Fake Out support, Scrafty can beat the aforementioned attack combo by OHKOing Chandelure or severely weakening Jellicent and its Water Spout with Crunch.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Nasty Plot could be utilized on a more offensive set with Grass Knot and Psychic, but Cofagrigus is more of a support Pokemon than an attacker, and its base 95 Special Attack and shallow movepool makes this option very underwhelming. Rest and Toxic could be used in combination with a Chesto Berry to bring some stall capabilities, but in the fast-paced metagame that is VGC 2011, this is not recommended. Imprison is a viable option, which paired alongside with Trick Room and Shadow Ball, could shut down opposing Chandelure and Jellicent. Disable could be useful to stop Cofagrigus from being 2HKOed, but in the fast-paced metagame that VGC is, it is usually a waste of a moveslot.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Without Hidden Power Fighting, Bisharp and Scrafty completely wall Cofagrigus. The only thing they have to watch out for is Cofagrigus's ability, Mummy, which will eliminate their precious abilities. Hydreigon has no need worry about Mummy, as it utilizes non-contact moves, and Cofagrigus cannot touch Hydreigon either. A bulky Jellicent can take a Shadow Ball or two, and hit back hard with a Shadow Ball that likely has 252 Special Attack EVs behind it.</p>
