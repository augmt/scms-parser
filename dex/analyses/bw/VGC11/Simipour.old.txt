[Overview]

<p>Meet Simipour, a largely outclassed Pokemon in the VGC 2011 metagame. Simipour faces strong competition from other Water-types, mainly Samurott, who sports higher offensive and defensive stats. Simipour's movepool is decent, and includes good coverage moves, but the only trait that clearly distinguishes it from other Water-types is its Speed. Unfortunately, though, this isn't enough for Simipour to warrant use over some other Water-types. In terms of usable sets, Simipour can run a physical, special, or even a mixed set, but it cannot provide any support with moves such as Taunt, as its frailty means it won't last very long in a VGC match. All in all, Simipour is quite mediocre and should only be used over more prominent Water-types such as Samurott and Carracosta if you really require its higher Speed.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Waterfall / Aqua Tail
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Low Kick
move 4: Protect
item: Focus Sash
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Simipour can run a physical set as its base 98 Attack isn't too bad. This set is quite straight forward: do as much damage as possible before being KOed. Waterfall is Simipour's best option for a STAB move, which hits Fire- and Ground-types, such as Volcarona and Krookodile, for super effective damage. Simipour does have access to a slightly stronger STAB, Aqua Tail, but the inaccuracy can prove to be fatal at times, so Waterfall is largely better. Crunch provides coverage against Ghost-types, mainly Jellicent, who is immune to Simipour's other moves thanks to its typing and Water Absorb. Low Kick hits Dark- and Steel-types, such as Hydreigon and Ferrothorn for super effective damage, while Protect is always useful in the VGC metagame as it allows Simipour to avoid being flinched with Fake Out and scout opponent's movesets.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes Simipour's Attack and Speed, allowing it to be as strong and fast as possible. One shouldn't even bother investing EVs in Simipour's bulk, as its 75 / 63 / 63 defenses are horrendous. The choice of nature comes down to which Pokemon your team is threatened by the most. Jolly is probably the best choice, as it allows Simipour to outspeed positive natured Hydreigon and Landorus and 2HKO the former with Low Kick and the latter with Waterfall. An Adamant nature, however, grants Simipour the ability to 2HKO standard Jellicent with Crunch. If you plan on using Simipour on a team with Tailwind support, Adamant should be used over Jolly. Focus Sash allows Simipour to survive one hit from full health and guarantees it a chance to hit back.</p>

<p>In terms of team support, Tailwind support from the likes of Tornadus and Whimsicott is appreciated as it will allow Simipour to outspeed a vast majority of Pokemon in the tier, and also allows Simipour to run an Adamant nature. Amoonguss is also a decent teammate as Rage Powder allows it to take any Electric- and Grass-type attack aimed at Simipour. In addition, Amoonguss can put opposing threats to sleep while Simipour shields itself with Protect. Lastly, paralysis support from the likes of Thundurus can be useful as it can allow Simipour to outspeed faster Pokemon it otherwise cannot.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Scald / Surf / Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Grass Knot
move 4: Protect
item: Focus Sash
nature: Timid / Modest
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Scald is the primary option for a STAB move as it has a nifty chance to burn the opponent, which can potentially cripple physical attackers. Surf is the primary alternative to Scald; it is a little more powerful than Scald, but it doesn't have a secondary effect. Furthermore, Surf hits all Pokemon on the field, so it should only be used when the ally Pokemon is immune to Water-type attacks. The second alternative is Hydro Pump, which is more powerful than Surf, but less accurate. Ice Beam destroys Dragon-types, such as Haxorus and Hydreigon, and also hits the Grass-types that resist Simipour's STAB. Grass Knot provides coverage against Water-types, such as Jellicent, that resist both Ice Beam and Simipour's STAB. Protect allows Simipour to avoid taking damage from Fake Out, and can also be used to scout out opponents' moves.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Simipour's EV investment in this set is quite straight forward: maximum Special Attack and maximum Speed. As Simipour is very frail, investing in bulk wouldn't be very wise. A Timid nature allows Simipour to outspeed Adamant Landorus and Timid Hydreigon, which it can OHKO and 2HKO respectively with Ice Beam. On the other hand, a Modest nature gives Simipour more power, which allows it to nab the 2HKO on Jellicent with Grass Knot. A Focus Sash lets Simipour survive one non multi-hit move, letting it hit an opponent at least once before it is KOed.</p>

<p>Pokemon that benefit from being hit by Water-type moves, such as Water Absorb Jellicent, can work well with Simipour that carry Surf. Amoonguss can provide support with Spore and Stun Spore, and can also take hits directed at Simipour with the help of Rage Powder. Tailwind support from the likes of Whimsicott and Tornadus, is essential, as it allows Simipour to outspeed almost every non-boosted Pokemon in the metagame. Rain Dance support won't hurt either, as a rain-boosted STAB move from Simipour will dent anything that doesn't resist it.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Water Gem can be used over Focus Sash to boost Simipour's STAB move by 50%, but if the opposing Pokemon are faster and considerably strong, Simipour will get KOed before it even gets a chance to attack. Similarly, a Life Orb can be used for extra power, but it reduces Simipour's survivability. Fling + King's Rock can flinch a slower Pokemon once in a game if you're willing to give up Focus Sash.</p>

<p>The Acrobatics + Flying Gem combination is a powerful option over Crunch and Focus Sash on the physical set, but Focus Sash is an essential item most of the time. Rock Slide can be used to hit Flying-types and also has a useful flinch chance, while Brick Break is an option over Low Kick for a more reliable Fighting-type move. Blizzard can be used over Ice Beam on the special set to hit both opponents, but it only has a 49% chance of hitting both opponents. Nasty Plot is another special alternative for immediate power, but with such low defenses, Simipour won't be able to properly use it. In terms of support, Taunt is a decent option as it can be used to prevent the opponent from setting up Trick Room. It is also useful against Amoonguss, but Simipour will get heavily damaged by Giga Drain. As Simipour has decent Attack and Special Attack, a mixed set can be used to catch opponents off-guard.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Due to its low defenses, Simipour isn't hard to counter at all. Amoonguss is an exceptional counter as it can both cripple it with Spore and KO it with Giga Drain. Virizion can take anything bar Ice Beam and OHKO Simipour with its STAB move. Thundurus can take on Simipour with ease, as it can survive an unboosted Ice Beam and OHKO Simipour with Thunderbolt. Jellicent becomes a Simipour counter if Simipour isn't carrying Grass Knot or Crunch. If Jellicent is running Cursed Body, it has a decent chance of disabling either Grass Knot or Crunch. Priority completely destroys Simipour as it can break Simipour's Focus Sash on turn one and KO it on turn two. Common users of priority include Bisharp and Zoroark. In general, any Pokemon with decent offenses and access to a super effective move can destroy Simipour, as its defenses are very low.</p>
