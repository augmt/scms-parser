[Overview]

<p>Seismitoad is unique in the fact that it is the only Pokemon that has the ability Swift Swim in VGC 2011. Unfortunately, with Seismitoad as the only Swift Swim user, rain is not the dominant force it was in VGC 2010. However, with the right support, Seismitoad is capable of wreaking havoc.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Surf is Seismitoad's primary STAB move, dealing insane amounts of damage under rain. Hydro Pump gives Seismitoad even more power if you don't like hitting your teammate or being forced to have a partner immune to Surf. Hidden Power Ice hits Grass-types who resist Ground- and Water-types moves, as well as Hydreigon, who is immune to Ground-type moves. Grass Knot hits opposing Water-types like Jellicent and Samurott. Earth Power gives Seismitoad an extra STAB move, but it doesn't really hit anything that Surf and Grass Knot don't. Protect allows Seismitoad to stall out an opponent's Tailwind or Trick Room, or let its partner KO a Pokemon that threatens Seismitoad.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb gives Seismitoad as much power as it can get, and with its fair bulk, it can afford the recoil. If you don't like this, however, a Sitrus Berry could be used for maximum survivability. The given EV spread allows Seismitoad to outspeed Scarf Terrakion in the rain, and the rest are put in HP to let it possibly take another crucial attack.</p>

<p>This set does not function well without Rain Dance support, making Pokemon such as Tornadus or Thundurus good partners. Jellicent makes for an excellent partner to Seismitoad, getting healed by Seismitoad's Surf and taking out opposing Jellicent who ruin Seismitoad's day. Telepathy Musharna is also immune to Seismitoad's Surf, and can boost its power even further with Helping Hand.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Surf / Hydro Pump
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Hidden Power Ice / Grass Knot
move 4: Protect
item: Life Orb
ability: Swift Swim
nature: Mild
evs: 132 Atk / 164 SpA / 212 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to remedy Earth Power's lack of power. Surf and Hydro Pump are for STAB. Earthquake hits all opponents on the field, much like Surf, but from the physical side instead. Hidden Power Ice hits the Dragon- and Flying-types who resist Surf, while Grass Knot hits Water-types. Protect is used once again because of its multi-purpose uses in VGC.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Mild nature is used so as to not lower Seismitoad's Attack and weaken Earthquake. Life Orb gives Seismitoad a boost to all its moves, but again, Sitrus Berry can be used instead for survivability. Unlike the previous set, this set demands an immune partner. Tornadus and Thundurus work best with this set, being immune to Earthquake and setting up rain. With Seismitoad having both Earthquake and Surf, Musharna makes the best partner, boosting Seismitoad's powerful spread attacks with Helping Hand and having Telepathy so as not to get hit.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>If you don't like Hydro Pump or Surf, Scald has a burn chance and decent power. Muddy Water hits both opponents, leaving your partner unharmed, but its 85% accuracy leaves something to be desired. Seismitoad learns Rain Dance, enabling it to set up rain without a team based around it, and attempt a sweep, but this is generally better off left to Prankster Pokemon such as Thundurus. Seismitoad has the potential to run a physically based mixed set with Brick Break / Rock Slide / Earthquake / Hydro Pump, but the special set hits more Pokemon and is usually the better attacker in general. Focus Blast hits Hydreigon if you don't like using Hidden Power Ice, but Hidden Power hits so much more and Surf hits almost everything else Focus Blast would.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Samurott can take a Grass Knot and OHKO back with a Grass Knot of its own. Jellicent can wall Seismitoad that lack Grass Knot. Focus Sash Chandelure with Energy Ball can check Seismitoad, but most sets don't carry Energy Ball. Sassy Amoonguss takes Hidden Power Ice well enough and can respond with Spore or Giga Drain.</p>
