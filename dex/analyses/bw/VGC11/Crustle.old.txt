[Overview]

<p>With poor Speed and average Attack, Crustle seems destined to fall to the bottom of the VGC barrel. However, access to boosting moves in Swords Dance and Shell Smash allows Crustle to boost its Attack to obscene levels, and with the right support, Crustle can rip apart unprepared teams. Crustle also receives a great ability in Sturdy, which acts as a built-in Focus Sash. This allows Crustle to almost always get off its boosting move, and proceed to wreck opposing teams.</p>

<p>With base 45 Speed, Crustle is perfect for Trick Room. Sturdy allows Crustle to use Swords Dance once, and if Trick Room is set up, Crustle can outspeed and heavily damage most of the metagame. Rock Slide is Crustle's main STAB move and, in addition to hitting both opponents, it has a flinch chance. With a Swords Dance boost and Rock Gem, Rock Slide does a great deal of damage to most Pokemon. Rock Blast, however, OHKOes Chandelure through Focus Sash, something that should be considered. It also KOes Thundurus through Substitute in two hits, so it is not nearly as risky as one might think. X-Scissor is Crustle's other STAB move, hitting Pokemon that resist Rock Slide such as Krookodile for super effective damage. X-Scissor is also useful when facing opposing Trick Room teams, denting Psychic-types such as Musharna and Reuniclus. Protect allows Crustle's partner time to set up Trick Room, and also shields Crustle from a threatening Pokemon, giving Crustle's teammate time to eliminate the Pokemon. Swords Dance doubles Crustle's normally average base 95 Attack, allowing it to dish out powerful Rock Slides.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Rock Gem gives Crustle a one-time powerful Rock Slide, which can help if Crustle has been unable to Swords Dance. A Lum Berry could be used instead, though, if you fear Amoonguss. A Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs makes Crustle as slow as possible, so in Trick Room, Crustle can move before most other Pokemon. The EVs are invested in Attack and HP to give Crustle as much power and bulk as it can get, while the Brave nature boosts Crustle's Attack even higher.</p>

<p>This set relies on Trick Room being set up, so naturally, Trick Room users make great teammates. Musharna can reliably set up Trick Room, and boosts Crustle's attacks further with Helping Hand. Jellicent can set up Trick Room and finishes off Pokemon that Rock Slide does not KO with its powerful Water Spout. Cofagrigus can Will-O-Wisp physical attackers that threaten Crustle such as Mienshao, whom Crustle has a hard time dealing with. Cofagrigus also fills the role of bulky Trick Room user, that Crustle loves to have as a teammate.</p>

move 2: Rock Slide / Rock Blast

<p>Shell Smash boosts Crustle's Attack, Special Attack and Speed by two stages at the cost of lowering Crustle's Defense and Special Defense by one stage. A White Herb, however, allows Crustle to keep the boosts and restores its defenses, making Shell Smash into one of the best moves in the game. After a Shell Smash, Crustle reaches 212 Speed, which outspeeds all Pokemon lacking Choice Scarf in the metagame. Rock Slide is used again for STAB, though if you want the ability to OHKO Chandelure and Thundurus through a Focus Sash and Substitute, respectively, Rock Blast should be used. Crustle's second STAB move comes in the form of X-Scissor, hitting Pokemon that resist Rock Slide such as Scrafty. Protect is a great utility move in VGC, letting Crustle stall out Trick Room or give time for Crustle's ally to KO a threat.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With a White Herb, Crustle can ignore the stat reduction of Shell Smash, and proceed to sweep without lowered defenses. A Lum Berry, however, lets Crustle take on Amoonguss and KO it with support from its teammates. A Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs are used to outspeed every Pokemon in VGC after a Shell Smash, though Adamant gives Crustle more power at the expense of some Speed.</p>

<p>Amoonguss is a detriment to Crustle, so a Pokemon that can take care of it such as Tornadus is greatly appreciated. Tornadus also takes care of Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Conkeldurr, that laugh at Crustle's STAB moves and hit it hard with Drain Punch. Ironically, Amoonguss is a great partner for Crustle, as it can Spore Pokemon that may otherwise give Crustle trouble, and draw off attacks aimed at Crustle with Rage Powder.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Earthquake complements Rock Slide well coverage-wise, although an immune partner should be used to avoid hurting Crustle's team. If you would rather hit one Pokemon instead of two, Stone Edge could be used instead, but hitting two Pokemon is such a great utility that Rock Slide should almost always be used. Crustle receives Curse, although it takes time to set up, and more than one turn dedicated to set up is not wise in VGC. Night Slash hits Ghost-types such as Cofagrigus and Golurk for super effective damage, though it is not usually worth a slot over one of Crustle's other moves.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Mienshao is a great counter to Crustle, utilizing Fake Out to neutralize Sturdy and resisting both of Crustle's STABs. Conkeldurr and Golurk are good counters to Crustle, resisting both of its STABs. Amoonguss checks Crustle, putting it to sleep with Spore while, without a boost, Crustle struggles to do much damage to it. Jellicent outspeeds and OHKOes Crustle with a super effective Water Spout.</p>
