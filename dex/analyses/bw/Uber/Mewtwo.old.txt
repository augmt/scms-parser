[Overview]

<p>The classic God of Pokemon has always been one of the most fearsome combatants of Ubers, but BW has given Mewtwo a gift so great that even Arceus is jealous: Psystrike. This move strikes fear into old nemeses Blissey, Ho-Oh, and Kyogre, as it makes Mewtwo a fearsome mixed attacker with almost none of the previous downsides! Like many other Uber Pokemon, Mewtwo has the stats and movepool to do virtually anything it wants. With viable sets that range from a fearsome sweeper to a frustrating staller, its versatility ensures that there is absolutely nothing that can counter it. However, while it is by no means frail, Mewtwo is not the bulkiest Pokemon around, and with its susceptibility to entry hazards and priority attacks, its longevity is an issue in the hard hitting Uber metagame. Like other Pokemon with huge movepools, it is a pity that Mewtwo can only use four of them at the same time. These problems highlight its greatest flaw of all: Mewtwo is unable to run everything at once. You have to choose between bulk and power, and Mewtwo's typing is rather poor defensively. BW2 also introduced Genesect, which made Mewtwo a lot easier to check for offensive teams. It is otherwise perfect, as its flaws end here. Dr. Fuji's dream was to create the world's most powerful Pokemon, and he most definitely succeeded.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If there is one set in the game that embodies the word "uncounterable", this is probably it. Mewtwo's blazing base 130 Speed and sky-high base 154 Special Attack make it a terrifying sweeper and end-game cleaner. Psystrike allows Mewtwo to take out all sorts of special walls, namely Blissey, Chansey, Ho-Oh, and Kyogre, without needing to waste EVs in Attack, by striking (pun unintended) their weaker Defense. Between Aura Sphere, Ice Beam, and Fire Blast, Mewtwo hits everything that resists Psystrike. Aura Sphere destroys the likes of Tyranitar and Darkrai, while doing a lot of damage to Dialga. Ice Beam brings down Lugia and Giratina, especially physically defensive variants. Fire Blast fries Genesect, Scizor, and Ferrothorn, and is Mewtwo's most powerful option in the sun, OHKOing bulky threats such as Jirachi and Steel Arceus, as well as Lugia, after Stealth Rock damage. Calm Mind pushes Mewtwo's Special Attack to even higher levels, allowing it to take down walls effectively. It also makes Mewtwo surprisingly resilient on the special side, letting it take attacks such as Draco Meteor from Choice Scarf Palkia. Without Calm Mind, Pokemon such as Lugia, Giratina, and 252/0 Arceus avoid being 2HKOed by its attacks.</p>

<p>As for move selection, Psystrike along with three coverage moves is a fine choice. Four attacks Mewtwo is preferable, since setup opportunities are usually quite limited for it. Calm Mind, however, makes Mewtwo much harder to wall. The best moveset for Calm Mind Mewtwo is Calm Mind, Psystrike, Aura Sphere, and Ice Beam, which retains excellent coverage while hitting Lugia and Giratina, the two bulkiest walls in the tier, for super effective damage. If you can give Mewtwo sun support, Fire Blast should replace Ice Beam due to its power and coverage, especially against Genesect. The only Pokemon that stands a chance of walling Calm Mind Mewtwo in the sun is physically defensive Giratina, who can phaze Mewtwo out with Dragon Tail, but even it risks getting 2HKOed by Psystrike. While Fire Blast Mewtwo is the most potent variant, rain's popularity makes Fire Blast less attractive for teams that don't have sun support.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>The moves listed above gives Mewtwo best all-around coverage, but they can be replaced if other moves better fit your team. Recover allows Mewtwo to mitigate some of the heavy residual damage that it tends to take. Grass Knot hits Groudon and Kyogre for super effective damage, in particular OHKOing all Groudon, which Ice Beam can fail to do. Thunder hits Lugia and Kyogre super effectively while hitting most Steel-types hard. Shadow Ball is Mewtwo's strongest attack against Wobbuffet, Lugia, and Ghost Arceus in the rain, while Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast if you value accuracy. Blizzard is an inaccurate move, but it does allow Mewtwo to 2HKO Specially Defensive Giratina without a boost after Stealth Rock damage, if you hit. Charge Beam allows Mewtwo to quickly finish off a weakened Pokemon and potentially get a Special Attack boost. Taunt can prevent walls from recovering health and can be used in place of Calm Mind.</p>

<p>The given EV spread maximizes Mewtwo's Speed and Special Attack. 4 Defense EVs are used so Genesect gets a Special Attack boost instead of an Attack boost to minimize U-turn damage. Life Orb is preferred to make Mewtwo as powerful as possible, but other items let Mewtwo set up more Calm Minds. If you are turned off by the recoil, Leftovers can lengthen Mewtwo's lifespan, but the power drop is very significant, losing out on 2HKOs against Giratina, 252/0 Arceus, and Lugia at +1. Like Leftovers, Lum Berry lessens Mewtwo's power, but can allow Mewtwo to set up on status-inflicting Pokemon such as Thunder Wave Ferrothorn. Expert Belt gives Mewtwo conditional power while conserving its Mewtwo's health. Even though it does not boost Psystrike most of the time, Mewtwo's coverage is enough to hit most targets for super effective damage. On the other hand, Mind Plate boosts only Psystrike and not Mewtwo's coverage moves. With Mind Plate, Psystrike is still powerful enough to 2HKO specially defensive Giratina and Latias, and OHKO 252/0 Kyogre after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>The only things that keep Mewtwo in check are Choice Scarf users, priority attacks, residual damage, and its inability to cover all threats with four moves. If Mewtwo lacks Fire Blast, Scizor can checkmate it with Pursuit and U-turn, while Jirachi can take anything it dishes out and paralyze it with Body Slam. Metagross can also do lots of damage in return, while not taking much from Aura Sphere. If Mewtwo lacks Aura Sphere, Tyranitar destroys it with no trouble at all, while Dialga, Dark Arceus, and Darkrai can be troublesome outside of sunny weather. If Mewtwo forgoes Ice Beam, then Lugia counters Mewtwo without sun, while Giratina becomes a big problem. If Calm Mind is omitted, Mewtwo has a hard time against defensive teams in general, especially those with Latias, Lugia, or Giratina in them.</p>

<p>Most Ubers teams plan to take down Mewtwo via a Choice Scarf user, as few Pokemon can can actually wall it. It should be noted that not many Choice Scarf users can actually OHKO a healthy Mewtwo, but Life Orb recoil and entry hazards can put it in KO range. Most Choice Scarf users require at least one round of Life Orb recoil in addition to Stealth Rock damage to OHKO Mewtwo. The exceptions to this are Kyogre (with full HP Water Spout), Modest Reshiram in the sun, Adamant Kyurem-B and Zekrom, Heracross, Victini, and finally Genesect. Genesect in particular is problematic for Mewtwo, since it can deal massive damage to Mewtwo with U-turn, and avoid being locked into an attack that might be advantageous for another sweeper to set up on. Genesect is a nightmare to try and pin down, but some ways to make life difficult for it is to heavily stack on entry hazards, and try to hit it hard on the switch (Psystrike does a lot of damage, while Fire attacks OHKO it). Wobbuffet can remove most Choice Scarf users, with the exception of those just mentioned. Luring out Choice Scarf users with Thunder Wave Kyogre or other Thunder Wave users is a good strategy. Kyogre tends to lure in Choice Scarf Palkia and Zekrom, as well as Latias. If you do have sun support, though, removing Choice Scarf Kyogre is not too difficult with Wobbuffet, as you can sacrifice Groudon to Kyogre to bring in the sun, then use Wobbuffet to trap and remove Kyogre, keeping the rest of the match sunny. Sacrificing Hippowdon or Tyranitar when using a sand team has a similar effect. Reshiram is difficult to deal with if you are using a sun team, but is easy for rain and sand teams to take on. Victini can be trapped and KOed by Tyranitar or other Pursuit users that are not weak to its attacks. Heracross is walled by many Pokemon, such as the Giratina formes and Groudon. Lastly, as previously mentioned, Thunder Wave Kyogre tends to lure in Choice Scarf Palkia and Zekrom, as well as Latias, a wall that gives Mewtwo trouble.</p>

<p>Residual damage has been mentioned, but it should be stressed that Life Orb and entry hazard damage allow priority attacks and Choice Scarf users to pick Mewtwo off. Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce users will mitigate entry hazard damage. For offensive teams that tend to carry Mewtwo, Custap Berry Forretress, Kabutops, and Excadrill are all good offensive Rapid Spin users, while Xatu and Espeon provide Magic Bounce for the team. Wish support from Blissey or Jirachi can help Mewtwo, but is not always necessary.</p>

<p>In terms of offensive pressure and synergy, sometimes it is best to just stack sweepers with good offensive synergy with Mewtwo. Rock Polish Groudon and Landorus-T can set up on Choice Scarf Zekrom; Scizor, Steel Arceus, and Bisharp can set up on Choice-locked Dragon-type attacks. Latias can set up on Choice Scarf Kyogre, as can Water-resistant Arceus formes. ExtremeKiller Arceus can set up on most Choice Scarf users besides Choice Scarf Terrakion, which cannot defeat Mewtwo. Dual Screen support also benefits Mewtwo, since they prevent most revenge killers from easily KOing Mewtwo. While Wobbuffet does not have particularly good synergy with Mewtwo, it can still Encore setup moves such as Calm Mind, giving Mewtwo a free setup opportunity.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulky Booster
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Psystrike
move 3: Recover
move 4: Flamethrower / Aura Sphere / Ice Beam
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set maximizes Mewtwo's bulk, allowing it to set up Calm Mind with greater ease but sacrificing Mewtwo's immediate destructive power for greater longevity. With Calm Mind and Recover, Mewtwo can slowly boost in front of special attackers. This set is particularly useful on sand teams and teams that are more susceptible to Fighting-types such as Fighting Arceus. Normally, entry hazard damage and sandstorm recoil can easily whittle Mewtwo down, but this set allows Mewtwo to stick around for longer to counter threats such as Fighting Arceus. Be aware, though, that this Mewtwo set has significant coverage issues. Psystrike is Mewtwo's STAB attack, and helps it win Calm Mind wars. Flamethrower allows Mewtwo to hit most Steel-types for super-effective damage, in particular OHKOing Genesect. This is especially important because with a bulky spread, Mewtwo can survive both U-turn and Bug Buzz from Choice Scarf Genesect. Flamethrower also allows Mewtwo to hit most Steel-types for super effective damage. Aura Sphere hits Tyranitar, Dialga, and Darkrai for super effective damage. Ice Beam might not appear to add significant coverage, but it does hit Lugia and Giratina for super effective damage, and being able to quickly OHKO Rayquaza is always nice as well.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>The EV spread used maximizes Mewtwo's bulk and Speed. While the 4 Defense EVs might not look like much, they prevent Genesect from getting an Attack boost. Given the nature of the set and potential use on sand teams, Leftovers is far and away the best item to use. This set exacerbates Mewtwo's already severe four-moveslot syndrome. Fire Blast can replace Flamethrower to hit Excadrill harder in the rain, as well as for more power in general. Taunt and Substitute can prevent status and phazing attempts. However, keep in mind that if Recover is dropped for one of these moves, Mewtwo will have a lot less staying power, which goes against the point of this set. As for move options, Thunder can be used to hit Kyogre harder while still hitting Lugia super effectively. Grass Knot can be used to take down Groudon easily, while Shadow Ball is Mewtwo's most powerful attack against Wobbuffet.</p>

<p>This set in particular has many counters no matter what move Mewtwo runs. Without Flamethrower, it will be walled by Steel-types. Even with Flamethrower, Genesect is a major thorn in Mewtwo's side. Scizor will also make life hell for Mewtwo that lack Flamethrower by checkmating it with Pursuit and U-turn, while Skarmory can take Aura Spheres and Ice Beams and force Mewtwo out with Whirlwind. If Mewtwo lacks Aura Sphere, Tyranitar walls Mewtwo and checkmates it with Pursuit, while Dialga can take attacks from it and either Roar it out or poison it with Toxic. In general, Lugia and Giratina wall Mewtwo, although they will not enjoy taking boosted Ice Beams for too long. Genesect is very difficult to pin down and take out, but entry hazards will limit Genesect's ability to continually U-turn in and out. If you can lock it into an attack that is not U-turn or Bug Buzz, Wobbuffet can trap and KO it. While Pursuit is inescapable, Pokemon such as Fighting Arceus, Groudon, Landorus, and Gliscor can all set up on Tyranitar easily. Fighting Arceus is also good for taking down Dialga. Finally, Lugia and Giratina are setup bait for entry hazard users, such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Forretress.</p>

[SET]
name: Support (StallTwo)

move 4: Psystrike / Light Screen / Substitute
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 72 SpD / 184 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Defensive Mewtwo seems rather weird, but it is surprisingly effective. It is especially useful against opposing stall teams thanks to Mewtwo's great Speed and support movepool, traits that let it stall out a wide variety of threats. Taunt forces defensive Pokemon to hit it with weak attacks instead of healing or using support moves, allowing Mewtwo to easily stall them out. Recover in conjunction with Mewtwo's Speed allows it to heal before most things can even touch it, making it extremely hard to break. Furthermore, when combined with Pressure, Recover can easily sap up all of the opponent's PP. This is handy in a tier filled with 8 PP moves such as Spacial Rend and Draco Meteor. Once again, four-moveslot syndrome kicks in for Mewtwo. Will-O-Wisp allows Mewtwo to stall out physical attackers quite effectively, letting it repeatedly heal while they slowly die to burn damage, and easily cripples many initial switch-ins to Mewtwo, such as Genesect and Tyranitar. Toxic does more damage in the long run, and hits Fire-types outside of Heatran, with the downside of leaving Mewtwo helpless against Steel-types and without a way to cushion the blows of physical powerhouses such as Zekrom and Groudon. As such, Will-O-Wisp is usually the better option because Mewtwo's defenses, while not especially low, are not amazing either.</p>

<p>Psystrike is Mewtwo's only option to hit Ho-Oh and Reshiram if you are running Will-O-Wisp. It also lets Mewtwo prevent powerful attackers such as Kyogre and Kyurem-W from switching in for free. Light Screen lets Mewtwo sponge all but the most powerful of special attacks, and makes Mewtwo hard to crack when used with Will-O-Wisp. Substitute is useful for scouting a switch in and preventing status. It also lets Mewtwo Pressure stall more effectively. As a bonus, Mewtwo's Substitute is strong enough to survive most Dragon Tails, while Roar and Whirlwind are blocked by Taunt. Without Substitute, stall teams can still Dragon Tail Mewtwo out, which can get annoying when combined with entry hazards. There is very little reason to run any item other than Leftovers. While Mewtwo really specializes in neutering things with Taunt + Status + Recover spam, it will often rely on prediction between status and Taunt (Gyro Ball vs Leech Seed on Ferrothorn, for example). One wrong move can prove fatal.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>The given EVs maximize bulk while allowing Mewtwo to outspeed Tornadus-T. Otherwise, you can run enough Speed to outspeed Darkrai (216 EVs with a Timid nature), or, if outspeeding Arceus isn't a concern, drop it down to enough to outspeed base 110s Pokemon such as Latias, Latios, and Lugia (96 EVs with a Timid nature). 88 EVs and a neutral nature let Mewtwo outspeed base 95s such as Rayquaza and Kyurem-W. Mewtwo can even go physically defensive, by shifting the Special Defense EVs to Defense.</p>

<p>Without Light Screen, powerful special attackers can demolish Mewtwo, although not many like taking even an uninvested Psystrike (252/0 Kyogre has a good chance to be 2HKOed after Stealth Rock). Chansey and Blissey can easily sponge special attacks if you forgo Light Screen for Psystrike, making them excellent partners. Mewtwo in return can easily switch in on Fighting-type moves such as Close Combat, and OHKO most Fighting-types with Psystrike. Psystrike also KOes Tentacruel, which can Rapid Spin on Mewtwo as well. One of the great things about this Mewtwo set is that it completely rewrites the list of Pokemon that can check or counter it; defensive or bulky Pokemon hoping to tank a hit from Mewtwo and cripple it through non-attacking methods are now easily neutered.</p>

<p>Darkrai, Ho-Oh, and Reshiram are the biggest enemies to this set if Mewtwo is running Will-O-Wisp. Darkrai doesn't really care about anything Mewtwo can run besides Toxic and can smash it with Dark Pulse or sleep it with Dark Void. Be aware though, that with the right prediction, Mewtwo can use Light Screen to cushion Dark Pulse and prevent Dark Void with Taunt, so taking out Mewtwo with Darkrai might not be simple. Ho-Oh and Reshiram don't really appreciate Psystrike, but can wall Mewtwo to no end if it lacks both Psystrike and Toxic. Stealth Rock support and something to deal with them is helpful if you forgo both of these moves. Kyogre can take care of these Fire-types as well as Darkrai, provided that Sleep Clause is activated or Kyogre is running a Sleep Talk set. Your own Ho-Oh can also help deal with Reshiram and Darkrai.</p>

<p>Toxic Spikes completely neuter this Mewtwo set, so a spinner or absorber (such as Forretress, Tentacruel, Excadrill, Poison Arceus) is almost mandatory. Toxic Spikes support of your own might conflict with the use of Will-O-Wisp, but they notably allow Mewtwo to simply Taunt and begin spamming Recover without having to waste a turn using Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. Like most defensive Pokemon, this set appreciates entry hazard support for the switching it will cause, especially against stall teams. Xatu easily shuts this set down with Magic Bounce unless you are willing to use Ice Beam over Psystrike, which is not recommended. Heatran will also annoy this set due to its immunity to both burn and poison and resistance to Psystrike. Either Kyogre or Zekrom can help deal with both Heatran and Xatu. Prankster users such as Sableye, Thundurus, and Tornadus can Taunt Mewtwo before it Taunts them, though the latter two have to watch out for Psystrike. Kyogre can also take down most of them without much effort, although it will need a Choice Scarf to outspeed Thundurus.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Mewtwo's power and excellent Speed let it outpace many dangerous threats and be a decent revenge killer. With a Choice Scarf, it reaches 591 Speed, outspeeding anything not at +2. Besides revenge killing, Mewtwo can also clean late-game when its counters, such as Lugia, are weakened. Psystrike is for STAB and is generally Mewtwo's most powerful move, but beware of trappers such as Tyranitar coming in for free. Thanks to Psystrike, Mewtwo has a good chance of breaking past Blissey and Chansey with entry hazard support. Mewtwo easily OHKOes Pokemon such as Rayquaza and Salamence with Ice Beam. Fire Blast, Flamethrower and Aura Sphere let it revenge kill Excadrill and most Steel-types. Additionally, it's good to have Aura Sphere in there somewhere for neutral-Speed-natured SmashPass recipients such as Dialga, as well as Choice Scarf Darkrai. Aura Sphere is also Mewtwo's only option to 2HKO defensive Tyranitar, and nails Heatran for solid damage too. Trick can let Mewtwo cripple a wall, such as Lugia and Giratina, which would both be more willing to switch in if they see no Life Orb recoil. It can also surprise Latias and Latios by removing their prized Soul Dew.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>The EV spread listed gives Mewtwo maximizes Mewtwo's Speed, letting it outspeed Kingdra in the rain, Adamant Excadrill in the sand, Choice Scarf Shaymin-S, Darkrai, Venusaur, and Shiftry in the sun, and Rock Polish Adamant Groudon. It also lets Mewtwo continue to outspeed unboosted threats if it has Tricked its Choice Scarf away. However, since Mewtwo is so fast, it can afford to invest in bulk or a Modest nature if outspeeding the aforementioned threats are not crucial for your team. A spread of 52 HP / 252 SpA / 204 Spe and a Modest nature outspeeds Choice Scarf Terrakion. 176 HP / 252 SpA / 80 Spe with a Timid nature also outpaces Terrakion, but focuses more on bulk. 240 HP / 252 SpA / 16 Spe outspeeds +1 base 100s.</p>

<p>Mewtwo has some other coverage moves it can use thanks to its wide movepool. Thunder can be used to hit Kyogre harder but will fail to OHKO or even 2HKO specially defensive Kyogre, generally making Psystrike the safer option to hit the whale. Shadow Ball is another option to hit opposing Mewtwo, Lugia, Ghost Arceus, Wobbuffet and Giratina, but is a really weak move otherwise. Mewtwo still can't revenge kill ExtremeKiller Arceus, so you'll need something else for it&mdash;Aura Sphere will only 2HKO Arceus while a boosted Extreme Speed will OHKO Mewtwo. If running Fire Blast, sun support is good for maximum power; in the sun, Fire Blast is even stronger than Psystrike. Wobbuffet can easily trap this Mewtwo, so you will have to predict carefully when you see one. Watch out for entry hazard layers such as Ferrothorn and Forretress, as they can switch into pretty much any move besides Fire Blast and Aura Sphere. Mewtwo can no longer break walls as effectively with this set, as the power reduction is rather significant, even standard Great Wall Giratina will never be 2HKOed by Ice Beam. However, they will need to watch out for Trick.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Physical sets with Bulk Up can be used to surprise certain checks such as Tyranitar. Bulk Up also helps to reduce damage from potential revenge killers such as Arceus with Extreme Speed and Giratina-O with Shadow Sneak. However, physical Mewtwo is easily walled by Giratina, Lugia, Groudon, and even Ho-Oh depending on the coverage moves Mewtwo has. It is also very weak unboosted.</p>

<p>Mewtwo does have a massive movepool, but is generally most effective sticking to the sets listed. Dual Screens + Self-Destruct + Taunt can be used on offensive or Baton Pass teams, but sacrificing Mewtwo for this usually not worth it. Choice Specs is rather mediocre because Mewtwo prefers the ability to switch moves, but the extra power gained from Choice Specs can surprise opponents. Defense boosting moves such as Barrier can be used on the StallTwo set, but pure defensive roles are better left to bulkier walls such as Lugia and Giratina.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Mewtwo does not have any failsafe counters. Ever. It has such amazing power and coverage that there is no such thing as a safe switch-in, and its checks depend purely on what move and set it is using. Choice Scarf Genesect is probably the best check, as it can easily OHKO Mewtwo with a +1 U-turn or Bug Buzz. However, one wrong switch into Fire Blast will end it, and even Psystrike or Aura Sphere will punch a huge hole into Genesect, which means it can only come in safely after one of its teammates has fallen. Since Mewtwo lacks any true counters, revenge killers are often used. Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Zekrom, Ho-Oh, Kyogre and Reshiram are the more prominent ones. Be wary of going straight to revenge killers though, as few things outright KO full HP Mewtwo, so hazards and racking up Life Orb recoil via prediction are often useful before the revenge killer comes in. Toxic Spikes, sandstorm damage, and the fact that Mewtwo commonly carries Life Orb can help wear it down quickly. Giratina-O can make a dent in Mewtwo with Shadow Sneak. Ghost Arceus can take a hit and deal major damage with Judgment. Physical Ghost Arceus can bypass any boosts Mewtwo might have obtained with Shadow Claw, but will fail against StallTwo. Victini resists all of Mewtwo's commonly used moves and can OHKO with V-create in the sun. However, despite its resistance, Mewtwo can still 2HKO it after Stealth Rock, so it has to be careful switching into too many Psystrikes or the rare Shadow Ball. While normally rare in Ubers, Bisharp can revenge kill Mewtwo with Sucker Punch, but requires good prediction as Mewtwo can easily play mind games with Calm Mind and Substitute. Lastly, Choice Scarf Heracross can OHKO any Mewtwo set with Megahorn and has Guts to ignore StallTwo's Will-O-Wisp. One also must be careful because checks to offensive Mewtwo often fall flat against a support variant or even a more defensively oriented attacking set.</p>

<p>Defensive Dark Arceus with Payback is a bit gimmicky, but is one of the closest things to a "counter" to offensive Mewtwo out there; however, it will lose to StallTwo. In a similar vein, Psychic Arceus walls the Psycho Killer if Mewtwo lacks Fire Blast, or if the sun isn't shining, and can 2HKO Mewtwo with Payback and Extreme Speed. Jirachi can check offensive variants in the rain or even neutral weather if they lack Fire Blast, as +1 Aura Sphere fails to 2HKO. Jirachi can cripple Mewtwo with poison or paralysis, effectively neutering it. Metagross or Bronzong can be used for a more offensive check in the rain as long as Mewtwo lacks Fire Blast. Lugia and Giratina can attempt to check Mewtwo by forcing it out with Dragon Tail, but will fail to do anything significant to StallTwo. As for StallTwo, powerful special attackers such as Kyogre and Reshiram are good choices to take it out. Ho-Oh and Reshiram are immune to StallTwo's Will-O-Wisp, but cannot take multiple Psystrikes.</p>

<p>If Mewtwo lacks Aura Sphere, Dialga, Heatran, and Tyranitar can all act as effective checks. Tyranitar can safely KO Mewtwo with a super effective Crunch or Pursuit it if it tries to switch out. Wobbuffet can very effectively check non-Taunt variants, as even +1 Shadow Ball will never OHKO 28/252+ Wobbuffet after Stealth Rock. +1 Fire Blast in the sun, however, has a decent chance (a little over 50%) to OHKO Wobbuffet after Stealth Rock.</p>
