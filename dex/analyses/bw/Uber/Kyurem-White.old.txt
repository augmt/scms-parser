[Overview]

<p>Once upon a time, there lived a sad third brother named Kyurem. Day and night, it would be humiliated by its brothers Reshiram and Zekrom, the rest of the dragon tribe of the OU metagame, and millions of Pokemon trainers around the globe. The abuse was so horrific that the poor thing descended into UU, the land of mediocre Arcanine and Milotic. It prayed to Arceus, asking for respite from its constant torment. With the release of Black and White 2, the God of Pokemon answered its prayer. While the poor third brother remains neglected, it has gained a new forme with the most overpowering and spammable attacking stats ever. With base 170 Special Attack, it now has the most powerful Draco Meteor in the game to take advantage of, and its Ice-type STAB, which used to be the butt of many jokes, can smite the many walls in the Uber tier that are weak to Ice. It does have its downsides, however. Kyurem-W is quite poor defensively with its Ice typing, as it is weak to all forms of entry hazards while being rather lacking in the resistances department. This doesn't detract from its awesome attacking stats all that much, though. The ugly duckling of the Tao Trio has not returned as a beautiful swan, but as the sacker of cities and destroyer of worlds. The Pokemon world can now tremble in utter terror; because its name is White Kyurem, it rhymes with endurin', which is what its victims can't do as it skewers 'em!</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With base 170 Special Attack and two of the best STABs in the tier, it should not take a genius to figure out that Kyurem-W can run a Choice Specs set. With Specs attached, Kyurem-W reaches a sky-high 723 Special Attack (assuming a Modest nature), which means that it can obliterate virtually anything that switches in provided it picks the correct move. Kyurem-W's Draco Meteor is so powerful that it has around an 80% chance to OHKO 252 HP / 0 SpD Kyogre after Stealth Rock. It is even punching sizable holes into Blissey and bulky resists. For example, Blissey takes an average of 45% from a Modest Choice Specs Draco Meteor, and standard stallbreaker Heatran takes an average of 41% from the same attack. STAB Ice Beam is Kyurem-W's other main attraction. Even though it might seem redundant with Kyurem-W's Dragon STAB, Ice Beam hits more key threats than it might appear. It easily OHKOes Lugia, with Turboblaze negating Multiscale, and 2HKOes Ferrothorn and Ho-Oh without factoring in entry hazards. The last two moves brush up Kyurem-W's coverage, allowing it to hit everything that can take its STAB attacks. As inaccurate as Focus Blast is, it allows Kyurem-W to OHKO Tyranitar, Heatran (assuming Stealth Rock), and Steel Arceus, as well as 2HKOing Blissey after Stealth Rock damage, assuming a Modest nature. The last move allows Kyurem-W to hit whatever is left, and depends on what weather you are running. Fusion Flare is best used if Kyurem-W can get sun support, as it OHKOes Jirachi and Bronzong in the sun, as well as OHKOing Steel Arceus without having to resort to Focus Blast. Earth Power, on the other hand, is a better general move to use if you are not using a sun team to reliably 2HKO Jirachi, Bronzong (Turboblaze negates Levitate), and Steel Arceus.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs used are as simple as they can get. Max Special Attack and Speed give Kyurem-W maximum offensive potential. The nature can be quite a hard decision to make, however. A Modest nature is preferred due to the sheer number OHKOs that it brings. With a Modest nature, Kyurem-W has a high chance to OHKO defensive Dialga and Kyogre with Draco Meteor, as well as 2HKO Blissey with Stealth Rock damage only. However, a Timid nature allows Kyurem-W to outrun the growing number of base 90 Speed Ubers that are running a positive Speed nature of their own, as well as Speed tie with Rayquaza, which in itself is huge.</p>

<p>While hail is a rather difficult weather condition to keep up in Ubers, Blizzard is an excellent option on Kyurem-W if you do manage to keep it up. Choice Specs Blizzard is so powerful that it can 2HKO Choice Scarf Kyogre, assuming it hits both times. It also makes using Chansey to defend against Kyurem-W a lot harder, as it gets whittled down pretty easily with hail and entry hazards.</p>

<p>One of Kyurem-W's biggest weaknesses is that it is extremely weak to entry hazards, especially to Stealth Rock. For this reason, spinners and Pokemon with Magic Bounce are very helpful to Kyurem-W's success. Tentacruel and Forretress are excellent defensive Rapid Spin users to use alongside Kyurem-W. Tentacruel has excellent special bulk and extra healing from the omnipresent rain, while Forretress synergizes extremely well with Kyurem-W. If you're after a more offensive Rapid Spin user, Excadrill and Kabutops are both good options. Xatu, and to a certain extent, Espeon, can also help to keep entry hazards off the field.</p>

<p>Chansey is the only Pokemon that can avoid getting 2HKOed by any of Kyurem-W's attacks. Strong physical attackers are able to force her out and set up on her. Other than Chansey, specially defensive Jirachi and Bronzong are decent switch-ins, as they only fear Fusion Flare in the sun and Earth Power in Jirachi's case; Bronzong lacks recovery and will get whittled down quickly however. Steel Arceus functions similarly, although on top of Fusion Flare and Earth Power, it also fears Focus Blast. Ho-Oh and Reshiram love switching into these Steel-types if you favor sunny weather. If your team is more rain-inclined, then Kyogre and other Water-types are good for drowning Jirachi and Steel Arceus, and Excadrill, Garchomp, and Landorus make their lives difficult in the sand. Due to Kyurem-W's middling Speed, faster Dragon-types, Arceus with super effective STAB moves, and Terrakion can all revenge kill Kyurem-W fairly easily. The Giratina formes, Groudon, Landorus-T, and Gliscor are all good checks to Terrakion. Latias, Ho-Oh, and Mewtwo can easily take down Fighting Arceus. As for Dragon-types, a Steel Arceus of your own does well most of the time, while Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Forretress can switch into many Dragon-type attacks and set up entry hazards.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While the mind-blowing power of Choice Specs might be extremely tempting, Kyurem-W can tone down the firepower in exchange for the freedom to switch attacks. Draco Meteor and Ice Beam are Kyurem-W's two STAB moves that maim virtually everything that does not resist them. The last two slots are where things get interesting. Basically, Kyurem-W has two slots to make best use of five potential moves. Focus Blast and Roost are the most preferred as the former gives the widest coverage (despite its horrible accuracy) and the latter lets Kyurem-W recover off its numerous sources of residual damage. Fusion Flare and Earth Power provide more specific coverage in the third slot against Jirachi and Bronzong in the sun and the rain, respectively. In the final slot, Substitute is also an option for Kyurem-W to ease prediction as well as avoid being revenge killed. Alternatively, you can run a fourth coverage move.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Kyurem-W has the ability to run a SubRoost set, but is generally lacking in coverage against key threats, such as Tyranitar and Steel Arceus if it does, especially when the use of Substitute favors the use of Leftovers. While Draco Meteor and Ice Beam give very good coverage, Kyurem-W really likes an additional coverage move. As for other moves that Kyurem-W can use, Outrage is a decent option. It is a common strategy for players to send Kyogre into Kyurem-W after it gets a Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor, and Outrage allows Kyurem-W to 2HKO max HP Kyogre, as well as 2HKOing Chansey after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>Life Orb is the preferred item on Kyurem-W simply because of the power that it brings. However, Haban Berry can be used to bluff a Choice set to lure in Dragon-type revenge killers such as Palkia, survive the incoming Dragon-type attack, and KO another Pokemon at the same time. Leftovers works well with Substitute, as it gives Kyurem-W passive recovery that really helps its already flailing durability. The EVs are max Special Attack and max Speed for maximum offensive prowess. A Timid nature is preferred, as most of the OHKOs that a Modest nature can provide require the use of Choice Specs. As Choice Specs is not used on this set, a Timid nature is preferred so Kyurem-W is able to outspeed all the Ubers with base 90 Speed, as well as Speed tie with Rayquaza.</p>

<p>Tentacruel, Forretress, Kabutops, and Excadrill are excellent Rapid Spin users for clearing away entry hazards that limit Kyurem-W's durability. Xatu and Espeon can help keep entry hazards off to a certain extent as well. In terms of Pokemon that Kyurem-W has trouble with, strong physical attackers can be used to set up on Chansey. Strong Fire-types such as Ho-Oh and Reshiram, strong Water-types such as Kyogre, Palkia and Swift Swimmers, and many sand sweepers such as Excadrill and Garchomp make Jirachi and Steel Arceus's lives miserable in Kyurem-W's favor. The Giratina formes, Groudon, Lugia, and Gliscor are all good counters to Terrakion, and a Steel Arceus of your own can take on most of the Dragon-types that run around in the Uber tier.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Kyurem-W's overpowering base 170 Special Attack and usable base 95 Speed make it a decent Choice Scarf user, despite its weakness to Stealth Rock. It can easily OHKO Darkrai with Draco Meteor or even Ice Beam if Darkrai has taken some prior damage and easily does over 60% to +1 Mewtwo, limiting its sweep. It is also an excellent Pokemon to stick on a sun team to take out troublesome Ground Arceus, on a rain team to deal with Grass Arceus, or on a sand team to crush Gliscor. Furthermore, while its base 95 Speed only allows Kyurem-W to Speed tie with Dragon Dance Rayquaza at best, it still outspeeds some of the common Uber Choice Scarf users that only have base 90 Speed, most notably Kyogre and Zekrom. If its counters are eliminated, Kyurem-W can easily clean up late-game by spamming Ice Beam from its 439 Special Attack. Draco Meteor and Ice Beam are pretty much essential; the other two moveslots are pretty much up to your tastes. Focus Blast is the preferred third move due to its overall coverage, but Fusion Flare and Earth Power can be used to take out Jirachi and Steel Arceus in sun and rain, respectively. Outrage is the preferred last option, as Kyurem-W cannot OHKO Latias with a Calm Mind up without it. It might also allow Kyurem-W to 2HKO Blissey switch-ins as well as Kyogre variants that don't run a lot of bulk. However, Focus Blast can be used with Fusion Flare or Earth Power for maximum coverage, while Sleep Talk can allow Kyurem-W to operate as an effective sleep absorber against Darkrai.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Blizzard can be used over Ice Beam if you have hail support but is generally not advised due to how difficult it is to keep hail up in Ubers. A Hasty or Timid nature along with max Speed investment allows Kyurem-W to outspeed as many threats as possible as well as Speed tie with Dragon Dance Rayquaza at worst.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin helps Kyurem-W go a long way. Tentacruel, Forretress, Excadrill, and Kabutops are good Rapid Spin users in Ubers. Ho-Oh, Reshiram, Kyogre, Excadrill, Garchomp, and Ground Arceus are all good at taking on Jirachi and Steel Arceus, and bulky Steel-types are helpful for taking on faster Dragon-types such as Choice Scarf Palkia that try to revenge kill Kyurem-W. Strong physical attackers such as Groudon, Excadrill, Terrakion, and Extreme Killer Arceus are fine at setting up on Blissey and Chansey.</p>


[Other Options]

<p>Kyurem-W's movepool is surprisingly shallow for such a ridiculously powerful Pokemon. The most obvious move is Dragon Pulse, which can be used over Ice Beam for a reliable STAB move. The main problem is that between Draco Meteor and Ice Beam, you will hardly ever need Dragon Pulse. The super effective coverage granted from STAB Ice Beam is partly why Kyurem-W is so threatening, turning would-be counters such as Lugia into tissue paper in front of a cannon. Icy Wind can be a fun gimmick to slow down your opponent so you can take them out next turn, but should not be used as a serious option. Unlike its brother Kyurem-B, Kyurem-W has access to a strong Ice-type STAB attack that works off its higher offensive stat, which makes its signature move, Ice Burn, redundant. Endeavor can be used if you ever get Kyurem-W down to 1 HP, but is a gimmick at best.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>If your team lacks a Pokemon called Chansey, good luck trying to counter Kyurem-W, because she is the only Pokemon that isn't 2HKOed by any of Kyurem-W's attacks; although with Stealth Rock and a bit of prior damage, even she falls. In the same vein, Blissey can take most of Kyurem-W's attacks, but risks getting 2HKOed by Modest Choice Specs Focus Blast after Stealth Rock damage. Rock Arceus in sandstorm is not a bad switch-in, although it gets 2HKOed by Focus Blast and cannot OHKO in return. If you can avoid switching into sun-boosted Fusion Flare or Earth Power, specially defensive Jirachi can sponge attacks from Kyurem-W, paralyze it with Body Slam, and take it out with Iron Head, all the while recovering its health with Wish. Steel Arceus is in a similar position, although it finds itself OHKOed by Choice Specs Focus Blast. Bronzong and Heatran work similarly to Jirachi, although their lack of recovery means they get whittled down relatively quickly. Ho-Oh with a lot of Special Defense investment can take hits from Kyurem-W fairly well if Stealth Rock is kept off the field and can use Recover and Regenerator to quickly recover its health.</p>

<p>Apart from that, taking on Kyurem-W generally comes down to prediction, as well as revenge killing. Getting Stealth Rock up early will limit the amount of times that Kyurem-W can switch in and wreak havoc. Dialga is an excellent Stealth Rock user, as most Pokemon that try to stop it will end up getting destroyed. Deoxys-S is great for getting Stealth Rock up quickly. Groudon, Ferrothorn, and Forretress are good, bulky options to get Stealth Rock up as well. In terms of revenge killers, anything faster than Kyurem-W that possesses a strong super effective move should do the trick. Palkia, Salamence, Terrakion, Garchomp, Mewtwo, Arceus formes, Latias, and Latios can all take down Kyurem-W easily, although those without a Choice Scarf will need to watch out for Choice Scarf variants. Excadrill in sand can outspeed and OHKO Kyurem-W with Iron Head; Kingdra and Kabutops in the rain can do a similar job. Scizor can also strip off copious amounts of health from Kyurem-W with Bullet Punch, should you be able to switch it in safely.</p>
