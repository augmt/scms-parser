[Overview]

<p>Even though Dragon-types have always served to limit Giratina's impressive walling potential, one would regret discounting it as a defensive threat. Giratina is the most resilient spinblocker of the Ubers metagame and an excellent counter to potent threats such as Rock Polish Groudon and almost all physical variants of Arceus. While its low offenses do turn Giratina into setup fodder for some entry hazard users, such as Forretress and Ferrothorn, and some dangerous threats, such as Rayquaza and Darkrai, Giratina still finds a niche on stall teams as both a spinblocker and wall. Dragon Tail and Roar prevent Giratina from being complete setup bait, somewhat alleviating its issues. Giratina can even take advantage of its natural bulk to set up multiple boosts, allowing it to sweep an unsuspecting team. While Ghost Arceus gives it serious competition, Giratina still has many notable advantages. Its sheer bulk and ability to hold Leftovers allow it to stop Excadrill and Kabutops from spinning, something Ghost Arceus is incapable of. Its unique typing allows it to avoid getting 2HKOed by Choice Specs Kyogre's Water Spout and wall Blaziken, Pokemon that would OHKO Ghost Arceus. While the lack of a recovery move outside of Rest does hinder Giratina's walling capabilities, one would be foolish to think this stops it from fulfilling its role. Finally, its titanic defenses allow it to viably use RestTalk as a method of recovery, a feat few Uber Pokemon can boast.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Giratina's impressive defenses and access to Will-O-Wisp allow it to counter many prominent physical threats, including most physical Arceus variants, any Groudon, Ho-Oh, Blaziken, Scizor, Metagross, and many more. Giratina's enormous defenses make it the only spinblocker capable of preventing Kabutops and Excadrill that have used Swords Dance from spinning. It should be noted that Excadrill will 2HKO Giratina after it has used Swords Dance, so Giratina is at best able to phaze it and Rest. Giratina can't even burn Excadrill without fainting. Dragon Tail is an alternative phazing move that works even while Taunted, which stops Giratina from being setup fodder for many powerful setup sweepers such as Mewtwo. It also allows Giratina to punish any Dragon-type or Pokemon with weak defenses that thinks it can switch in freely, denting said Pokemon while forcing it out. The ability to phaze and deal respectable damage in the process often makes Dragon Tail appear to be the preferred move, but its inability to phaze Pokemon that use Substitute, such as Ho-Oh and Excadrill, often makes Roar the better choice. Giratina can use both phazing moves, but forgoing Will-O-Wisp prevents it from permanently crippling physical attackers. However because Giratina is often used on general Uber stall teams, Will-O-Wisp might be worthless if your team focuses heavily on wearing down the opponent with Toxic Spikes. Will-O-Wisp, however, still has the ability to burn Steel-types such as Steel Arceus and Ferrothorn, slightly hampering their bulk. Needless to say, Giratina has the ability to block Rapid Spin, but it's worth noting that Giratina cannot hurt Forretress at all, while it has an easy time setting up Spikes on Giratina. Whether or not you want to use Roar depends upon what your team needs.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>You can consider investing additional Speed EVs if you wish to engage in a Speed creep contest with opposing Groudon, Dialga, and Giratina. Other moveslot options include Toxic and Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave might have some use as a lure for fast attackers such as Darkrai, but Will-O-Wisp has more overall utility as this Giratina is supposed to counter physical threats. Earthquake pairs well with Dragon Tail and kills Heatran in one hit, when it would otherwise wall Giratina completely.</p>

<p>Giratina is countered by sweepers who can capitalize on its numerous common weaknesses. In particular, Darkrai, Dark Arceus, and Dialga terrorize Giratina as it can't really hurt them aside from preventing them from coming in through smart Dragon Tail use. Powerful Dragon-types such as Rayquaza, Reshiram, Zekrom, Latios, Latias, Kyurem-W, and Palkia can also easily 2HKO Giratina at worst with their incredibly powerful Dragon attacks provided they safely switch in. However, all of these Dragon-types hate to stomach a Dragon Tail or a potential Will-O-Wisp. In order to deal with these Pokemon, it's recommended to use partners such as Chansey, Blissey, Groudon, and Lugia. All in all, the best partner for Giratina is probably Forretress: the two have excellent type synergy, Giratina protects the entry hazards set up by Forretress, and Forretress spins away the nasty Spikes that hurt Giratina. Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Genesect are decent partners to Giratina too. All three boast Dragon-, Dark-, and Ghost-type resistances and the first two can launch Spikes onto the opposing battlefield that Giratina conveniently blocks. Genesect can assist in stacking entry hazard damage and also destroys Latios and Latias with its powerful U-turn. Ho-Oh is a decent partner because its special bulk and typing help against the strong special attackers such as Dark Arceus and Palkia that plague Giratina. Lugia might share Ice-, Dark-, and Ghost-type weaknesses with Giratina, but it checks most physical Dragon-types that plague Giratina and Giratina in return can absorb Thunder and Bolt Strike for Lugia. Groudon checks the physical sweepers Giratina cannot stop such as Rayquaza, Garchomp, Zekrom, Dialga, and Salamence thanks to its massive Defense stat and lack of Dragon-type weakness. Scizor gets a mention for sharing good type synergy with Giratina and countering most Dark-types.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Many people argue that Ghost Arceus overshadows Giratina. This set utilizes Giratina's main advantage over Ghost Arceus: resistances and Leftovers. While Ghost Arceus lacks nasty Dragon- and Ice-type weaknesses, Giratina has resistances to Fire-, Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type moves, something Ghost Arceus can only dream about. Instead of focusing on Defense, this set takes a different approach to using Giratina. With the EVs and nature used on this set, Giratina can even survive two full-power Choice Specs-boosted Water Spouts from the most powerful of Kyogre given that no entry hazards are up. This in conjunction with Pressure allows Giratina to stall out Choice Specs Kyogre locked into any move not named Ice Beam with ease. If your team lacks something to stomach Blue Flares from the deadly Reshiram or a check to Calm Mind Arceus, Mewtwo, or Deoxys-A, this Giratina can do it well. No Calm Mind Arceus, Mewtwo, or Deoxys-A will be able to 2HKO it even after Stealth Rock damage. In fact, Giratina will always a survive Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor from Reshiram or Rayquaza, given that no entry hazards are up. Ghost Arceus can never achieve such amazing feats. In fact, Ghost Arceus is always OHKOed by Choice Specs Kyogre. Giratina can easily stall out Shaymin-S's Seed Flare as well with its resistance, bulk, and Pressure. Even when using this set, Giratina still retains a lot of its physical bulk. For example, it can still survive a Choice Scarf Zekrom's Outrage after Stealth Rock damage, taking only 74% - 87.5%, and it can still stop Excadrill and Kabutops from spinning. It should be warned that Swords Dance boosted Earthquake from Excadrill will OHKO with Stealth Rock and sandstorm damage though.</p>

<p>Will-O-Wisp ruins physical attackers such as Garchomp and Zekrom that might attempt to take advantage of this Giratina's weaker Defense stat. Dragon Tail phazes and damages Pokemon, which helps quickly accumulate damage onto an opponent's team, and is not blocked by Taunt. This combined with its ability to severely harm Dragon-types that try switching into Giratina makes it a wonderful move. Roar blasts through Substitute, which can be useful if you are facing a Kyogre or Shaymin-S with Substitute. RestTalk is all Giratina has as recovery, but it's really all it needs. With those moves, Giratina can also act as a status absorber for the team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>You can consider investing additional Speed EVs if you wish to engage in a Speed creep contest with opposing Groudon, Dialga, and Giratina. Other moveslot options include Toxic and Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave might have some use as a lure for fast attackers, but Will-O-Wisp has more overall utility.</p>

<p>This Giratina is meant to utilize its resistances and absorb resisted powerful special hits such as Kyogre's Water Spout. However, even with this layout, Giratina still hates facing powerful Draco Meteors. Therefore, Blissey and Chansey are great teammates. Other teammates, such as Forretress, Lugia, Groudon, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory, work for this set as well. Forretress and in fact spinners in general, are a particular necessity for Giratina. Because the presence of entry hazards will make Giratina get 2HKOed by attacks that it would otherwise avoid getting 2HKOed from, such as Choice Specs Water Spout from Kyogre, a spinner or Magic Bounce user greatly helps it perform its job as a special sponge.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>One playstyle is always associated with Giratina, and that is stall. This set attempts to capitalize on that stereotype and catch the opponent by surprise, although it should be noted that the lack of Leftovers might prematurely reveal it to the opponent, as it is one of the few viable Giratina sets that does not use Leftovers. While standard Giratina is more suited for stall teams, ChestoRest Giratina can be used as an aggressive spinblocker on more offensively based teams. Giratina is easily the bulkiest Pokemon in the entire game, which means that it can very easily snag one or two Calm Mind boosts. This set plays a lot like ChestoRest Kyogre, but trades power for much more overall bulk and coverage. While an offensive Calm Mind set is usually more suited to Giratina-O, its inability to hold a Chesto Berry automatically disqualifies it from running this particular set. This Giratina hits surprisingly hard after a Calm Mind or two, and outside of extremely powerful physical attacks, it will not faint without first netting at least one or two kills. To illustrate, it easily 2HKOes Extreme Killer Arceus and Dialga with a +1 Aura Sphere; neither Pokemon is able to OHKO in return, unless Dialga is carrying Choice Specs.</p>

<p>The best part about that set is that most people attempt to take it out like they would the regular defensive sets; that is, by using Toxic and attacking it while it is sleeping. ChestoRest Giratina flips that concept on its head by casually setting up with Calm Mind until its health gets low, using Rest to get back to full health, and waking up immediately thanks to the Chesto Berry. Dragon Pulse is preferred for the main STAB. Aura Sphere gives the best overall coverage as it is unresisted alongside Dragon Pulse, and most importantly, it 2HKOes Ferrothorn and Tyranitar at +1. However, if Ferrothorn is of no concern, Thunder is useful as it takes down Kyogre, Skarmory, and Lugia much more easily.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Shadow Ball can be used as the STAB attack to hit Mewtwo, Lugia, and Ghost Arceus harder, but its relatively low power and inability to take out Dragon-types is a letdown. Will-O-Wisp can be used in the last slot to cripple physical attackers, but as this set is attempting to sweep, it isn't exactly helpful. Earth Power is Giratina's best weapon against Jirachi and Metagross, who could potentially be annoying, and also grants it an easy OHKO on Heatran. Hidden Power Fire allows Giratina to OHKO Scizor and do more damage to Ferrothorn, but it is rather useless otherwise. Substitute allows Giratina to avoid Ferrothorn's Leech Seed, status, and helps it avoid getting revenge killed by faster Dragon-types, but it is largely useless outside of that.</p>

<p>A Modest nature and maximum Special Attack investment allow Giratina to hit as hard as possible, while the rest of the EVs make it as bulky as possible. A more physically bulky spread of 112 HP / 252 Def / 144 SpA can be used to survive a Life Orb-boosted Outrage from Jolly Rayquaza at full health, although the power drop is very significant. Additionally, even if Giratina does survive such a hit, it's not going to be sweeping much anyway. Giratina can reallocate EVs from its HP stat into its Speed stat to Speed creep, but doing so lowers its bulk, which might make it harder to get Calm Minds. On the other hand, it is useful for outspeeding slower Kyogre, Zekrom, Reshiram, Dialga, and Giratina and Resting or killing said Pokemon before they can harm Giratina.</p>

<p>Strong, super effective physical attacks are the key to taking down Calm Mind Giratina. Life Orb- or Choice Band-boosted Outrage from Rayquaza, Zekrom, and Garchomp can OHKO Giratina, and Choice Band Crunch from Tyranitar and Icicle Crash from Mamoswine will also leave a huge dent. In addition, Bulk Up Dialga can defeat Giratina if it has some Speed investment and Outrage. Choice Band Metagross can be problematic as it resists Dragon Pulse and has enough bulk to tank Aura Sphere, and Giratina's lack of Will-O-Wisp allows Metagross to Meteor Mash it with impunity. Skarmory can force +1 Giratina out with Whirlwind if Giratina lacks Thunder; Jirachi can also be annoying with paralysis and Iron Head flinches.</p>

<p>Physically defensive Steel-types are excellent teammates for Giratina. Forretress can Rapid Spin away the Toxic Spikes that might force Giratina to Rest earlier than is desirable, and can set up Toxic Spikes of its own, allowing Giratina to defeat Blissey and Chansey more easily. Skarmory can also switch into Outrage and set up Spikes, but it must watch out for Zekrom's Bolt Strike and Rayquaza's V-create. It is worth noting that these entry hazards are easily kept on the field by Giratina's spinblocking abilities. Magnezone can trap and KO Skarmory as well as Metagross locked into Meteor Mash. Groudon, especially Swords Dance variants, can take on Dialga, Tyranitar, Jirachi, and Metagross easily.</p>

<p>Giratina's other major enemies are specially defensive Calm Mind users. Steel Arceus resists Giratina's STABs and outspeeds it, allowing Steel Arceus to cushion Aura Sphere with its own Calm Mind; Dark Arceus and Ghost Arceus can do the same thing. Ho-Oh is therefore another great teammate for Giratina, as it can defeat most of the Calm Mind users that Giratina has trouble against. Darkrai is also an excellent offensive check to Ghost Arceus as it outspeeds and can put Ghost Arceus to sleep with Dark Void and then set up Nasty Plot to sweep. Giratina won't be able to sweep all the time either, but it will generally leave a hole in the enemy team for another Pokemon to take advantage of and sweep. As such, Pokemon that can finish off Giratina's sweep are appreciated. Steel Arceus excels at this. It not only synergizes nicely with Giratina but can also wage a winning Calm Mind war against any enemy Calm Mind Arceus that Giratina encounters, thanks to its access to Roar.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Giratina is usually seen as a wall, its amazing defenses in conjunction with Calm Mind mean it can easily set up on many threats. After a Calm Mind, it is nearly impossible to OHKO Giratina with any attack. Only extremely powerful attacks like Kyurem-W's Choice Specs Draco Meteor and Choice Band Kyurem-B's Outrage can OHKO Giratina consistently after it has used Calm Mind. If supported properly, Giratina should be able to achieve six Calm Minds, but as always, exercise discretion when setting up. Unfortunately, even after six Calm Minds, Giratina fails to 2HKO Blissey and Chansey, but both of them can be PP stalled with Pressure, a strategy that works better with Toxic Spikes support from Forretress. This set beats mono-attacking Calm Mind Kyogre and Fire Arceus one-on-one due to its resistances and Pressure.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If you want to forgo Sleep Talk, Giratina has a number of options. Shadow Ball is useful against Mewtwo, and Will-O-Wisp is an option if you want this Giratina to act as a lure for Tyranitar, or as a check to physical Arceus variants and Groudon. Roar allows Giratina to boost alongside the opponent and Roar it out.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, none of these options let Giratina defeat its counters, which include many powerful attackers such as Darkrai, Dark Arceus, Ghost Arceus, Steel Arceus, and Dialga. As such, Scizor, Genesect, Blissey, and Chansey are good options for teammates. You might want Heal Bell support from Chansey and Blissey particularly because of the BW sleep mechanics. Finally, you will probably want Toxic Spikes support from Forretress to help handle Chansey and Blissey, who give Giratina trouble otherwise. Ho-Oh also checks most Calm Mind Arceus and Darkrai for Giratina and scares of Chansey and Blissey. Heatran is a decent partner for Giratina as it resists all of Giratina's weaknesses and Giratina protects it from Groudon and Earthquake Ho-Oh. Heatran can also check Dark, Ghost, and Steel Arceus, all of whom can beat Giratina easily. Kyogre can be used to absorb Ice Beam and check most Calm Mind Arceus.</p>

<p>Weather doesn't really matter to Giratina, but Groudon is recommended as a check to the physical attackers Giratina cannot handle such as Zekrom and Rayquaza. One of the Steel-type Spikers, Forretress, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory, is a required partner for Giratina because of their type synergy and ability to lay entry hazards. Genesect can also work as a partner for Giratina, switching into Rayquaza or Zekrom's Outrage and KOing in return with Download-boosted Ice Beam. Forretress is probably the best partner for Giratina, as it also removes Spikes with Rapid Spin, which can be a particular nuisance if Giratina gets phazed while they are up. Giratina is greatly annoyed by enemy phazers, especially Perish Song Arceus, as they can completely remove its boosts, so it's recommended that you either weaken or take down the phazers so that Giratina can more easily sweep. Chansey, Blissey, Ho-Oh, and Kyogre all help check the special attackers that trouble Giratina. Kyogre's turbulent rain will make Reshiram sad while a powerful Surf can easily drown it. Chansey and Blissey can handle the special attacks that are too powerful for Giratina to handle such as a Choice Specs Dialga's Draco Meteor. They can also wake Giratina up immediately after using Rest with Aromatherapy or Heal Bell. Kyogre can set up alongside most Calm Mind Arceus formes and eventually win the Calm Mind war with Surf or Scald, thanks to the weather and Kyogre's superior special stats.</p>

<p>If Giratina is used with Groudon and Forretress, you can use Ho-Oh and Heatran, which are other excellent checks to Giratina's counters such as Dark, Steel, and Ghost Arceus. Heatran can Taunt and eventually kill most special attacking Arceus formes, and Ho-Oh can bypass Calm Mind boosts with its incredibly powerful Sacred Fire and Brave Bird. Scizor and Genesect can still work as partners to counter Darkrai and Dark Arceus. Outside of that, however, Scizor and Genesect are pretty much useless. Metagross is also a decent teammate for Giratina, thanks to its Steel typing and great Attack stat. Metagross can 2HKO most Arceus formes with its bone-shattering Choice Band Meteor Mash. Lugia can assist Giratina in walling physical or mixed attackers such as Rayquaza and Garchomp. Steel Arceus resists most of Giratina's weaknesses and beats Dark Arceus one-on-one. Excadrill gets a mention for Rapid Spin and resistances to Dragon-, Ghost-, and Dark-type moves. It can also beat Dark and Steel Arceus one-on-one.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Giratina can use Dragon Claw, but Dragon Tail is recommended for phazing, and Outrage is recommended for more power. Shadow Sneak has the merit of being able to pick off Pokemon that Giratina has worn out with its constant phazing, but outside of that it has little to no use and is generally not worth the moveslot. Earthquake allows Giratina to destroy Heatran and 2HKO Excadrill, but it is weak when hitting other Pokemon. Giratina can also utilize an attacking lead set with Magic Coat, but it is generally too unreliable. Giratina's offensive stats are mediocre especially by Uber standards. Hidden Power Fire doesn't even kill Forretress after Stealth Rock, and Ferrothorn and Skarmory can even laugh at it. If you want to go on the offensive, Giratina is not the one to fulfill your needs. Giratina-O and Ghost Arceus are the offensive spinblockers you should be using. A Choice Scarf Giratina is a gimmick because it is very weak and largely outclassed by others such as Choice Scarf Dialga. Using a Choice item also means Giratina wastes its tremendous bulk. Spite can be used effectively thanks to Giratina's massive walling capabilities. Spite combined with Pressure can easily drain tons of PP in an environment where most moves only have 8 PP. Giratina can use Substitute or Roar well on its Calm Mind sets. The former enables it to avoid status and Leech Seed while the latter eases its issues with enemy phazers, but missing out on coverage generally makes these two moves inferior.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>While Giratina is a phenomenal wall, it suffers heavily due to its common weaknesses. Darkrai, Ghost Arceus, and Dark Arceus in particular destroy it easily. Darkrai can even put to sleep another of Giratina's teammates if it is sleeping due to Rest. Giratina's complete reliance on preventing itself from being set up on through Roar or Dragon Tail makes it very vulnerable to Taunt, and if a phazer faster than Giratina, such as Lugia, confronts it, it will be rendered useless as it cannot do anything aside from statusing said phazer. Reliance on RestTalk for recovery makes Giratina that much more vulnerable to Taunt and phazing when entry hazards are up. Gyarados and Gliscor are perfect examples of Pokemon that utilize all these attributes to easily destroy Giratina. Gliscor and Gyarados can simply Taunt Giratina to prevent it from recovering, use Substitute to prevent themselves from getting phazed by Dragon Tail, and wear down Giratina with Toxic, or in Gyarados's case, Dragon Tail. Giratina doesn't even need to have one Pokemon to specifically counter it. If Giratina uses Rest and entry hazards are up, it can be continuously phazed or threatened out by the presence of an offensive Dragon-type, eventually causing it to faint due to the fact it takes a lot of damage from entry hazards as it is weak to all of them.</p>

<p>There are a few Pokemon that can counter Giratina on their own. Powerful Dragon-type sweepers such as Rayquaza, Choice Band Garchomp, Dragon Arceus, Salamence, Kyurem-B, and Zekrom can all threaten to 2HKO Giratina if they can avoid a burn when switching in. These Dragon-types won't enjoy Dragon Tail, however. If Giratina uses Rest, all of those Dragon-types can come in and force it out. If Tyranitar avoids Will-O-Wisp, it can 2HKO Giratina with Choice Band Crunch, and it is a great counter to both the boosting tank Giratina set and ChestoRest Giratina set due to the Special Defense buff Tyranitar gets from the sandstorm it creates.</p>

<p>One of Giratina's roles is spinblocking, but there is one Pokemon that even Giratina cannot stop from spinning. Cloyster can easily Shell Smash as Giratina comes in to stop it and OHKO with Icicle Spear, preventing Giratina from spinblocking. Giratina also has considerable problems with Substitute Excadrill with Swords Dance and Pain Split Forretress with Toxic. The former's Substitute cannot be broken by Dragon Tail, so if Giratina lacks Roar it will eventually get beaten down by Earthquake. The latter will never get worn down from Giratina's Dragon Tails and entry hazards due to Pain Split, meaning Giratina will be turned into permanent Spikes fodder and might eventually even go down to continuous Toxic and Pain Split damage.</p>

<p>If it is the last Pokemon, Bulk Up Dialga with Rest defeats Giratina quite handily. Dragon Arceus with Calm Mind easily beats most Giratina sets. Pokemon that have their moves boosted by an item that wield powerful STAB Draco Meteors can exploit Giratina's typing and KO it. Latios, Latias, Choice Specs Dialga, Choice Specs Palkia, Choice Specs Reshiram, and Life Orb Kyurem-W can all OHKO Giratina with a powerful STAB Draco Meteor. Reshiram in particular excels at doing this as it can come into Will-O-Wisp for free. Finally, Wobbuffet can exploit Dragon Tail's negative priority in order to Encore Giratina and help a dangerous sweeper set up.</p>
