[Overview]

<p>Jumpluff hasn't changed much this generation. However, it still sports great Speed, reaching 700 in the sun, and is only outsped under Sunny Day by Choice Scarf Deoxys-S. Jumpluff's amazing support movepool is still strong in this generation. It can provide support in the form of double status, Encore, or Leech Seed. Jumpluff didn't get anything from the fifth generation except competition from Whimsicott, but Jumpluff does provide several advantages over its Grass-type counterpart: it is immune to Ground attacks and Toxic Spikes, and has access to Sleep Powder.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set combines Jumpluff's amazing Speed and support movepool to make one annoying Pokemon. Encore can be used on a non-attacking move or Ground-type attack, rendering the opponent almost completely helpless. From there you can fire off status moves to your heart's content. Sleep Powder can cripple an opponent's Pokemon for the rest of the match, and is best used against threatening offensive Pokemon. Stun Spore allows you to potentially cripple another after you have put a Pokemon to sleep. This is helpful when using slow, bulky sweepers, as it helps them to outrun the opponents. U-turn rounds off the set by giving Jumpluff the ability to scout, after you have locked a Pokemon into a move with Encore, or used a status move on it. The EV's on the set are simple: Jumpluff's Speed is maxed out, which is necessary to outspeed opposing Pokemon and lock them with Encore or status them. After that, the rest of the EV's go into HP to maximize Jumpluff's bulkiness.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Hazard support is extremely useful for Jumpluff. Because you are locking Pokemon into moves with Encore and putting them to sleep with Sleep Powder, they will be switching a lot. You should take advantage of this and run a Stealth Rocker and/or Spiker. Jumpluff can also contribute to the residual damage itself: Toxic can be used over Stun Spore if you want to chip away the enemies' health with Encore, and Leech Seed can be used if you want more recovery. Groudon is a perfect partner for Jumpluff. The behemoth and fuzzball were made for each other. Groudon sets up sun and Stealth Rock, and Jumpluff uses the sun to put Pokemon to sleep with Sleep Powder and slow them down with Stun Spore, giving Groudon an easier time dishing out massive damage.</p>

move 2: Leech Seed

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is the pinnacle of annoyance if used correctly. The trick is to come in on a Ground-type attack or setup move, use Encore to lock the Pokemon into that move, and then put them to sleep with Sleep Powder. After that, you are free to set up Substitutes and Leech Seed the enemy as you please. Your opponent will find it surprisingly hard to take out Jumpluff if you use it correctly. If your opponent brings in something to beat Jumpluff, then simply use Encore as it breaks the Substitute, and switch into a Pokemon that resists the attack. With this strategy, and entry hazards, your opponent will be under pressure, and seriously annoyed! The given EV spread makes Jumpluff as fast as possible. 188 Defense and 68 Special Defense gives it 223 in both stats. No EVs are invested in HP, because without them, Leech Seed recovers a greater percentage of Jumpluff's health, allowing for a greater number of substitutes.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Entry hazards are a great asset to this set because Leech Seed, Encore and Sleep Powder will cause a lot of switches. Toxic Spikes are especially useful because they wear down the opponent's health very quickly when combined with Leech Seed. Protect can be used over Encore to give Jumpluff a free turn of Leech Seed and/or Toxic damage. Again, Groudon is the best partner for this set. Not only can Jumpluff cripple Pokemon with Encore and Sleep Powder, but can also pass it health through Leech Seed. Groudon in turn can set up permanent sun, and Stealth Rock to aid Jumpluff.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Reflect is a cool option that Jumpluff can run. Its Defense is considerably lower than its Special Defense, and Reflect will not only increase Jumpluff's Defense but the whole team's. Toxic can be used on either set if you are running a stall-oriented team. On the support set, Encore is useful for building up Toxic damage, and Substitute and Protect do just that on the SubSeed set.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Whimsicott is Jumpluff's biggest counter, as is immune to Leech Seed, and can shut Jumpluff down with priority Taunt. It can also cripple Jumpluff with priority Stun Spore. Lugia can take any of Jumpluff's hits, providing something has been put to sleep, OHKO with Ice Beam or phaze SubSeeder variants with Whirlwind. Ho-Oh can OHKO Jumpluff with its dual STABs, Fire and Flying, or even set up with Flame Charge. Kyogre changes the weather, cutting Jumpluff's speed, and can OHKO with Ice Beam. Scarf Kyogre can outspeed Jumpluff in the rain. Scizor can foil Jumpluff's SubSeed strategy with U-turn while Bullet Punch will 2HKO. Shaymin-S is immune to Leech Seed, outspeeds Jumpluff outside of sun, and can OHKO with STAB Air Slash. Additionally, it threatens Jumpluff's best partner, Groudon, with super effective Seed Flare. Shaymin-S can't come in on Sleep Powder or Stun Spore though.</p>

<p>Ferrothorn can be a problem for Jumpluff if it has already used Sleep Powder on another Pokemon. Encore doesn't stop it from setting up spikes either, and Ferrothorn can do massive damage to Jumpluff with Gyro Ball. Skarmory has access to Taunt, can set up Spikes and OHKO Jumpluff with Brave Bird after Stealth Rock damage. Forretress can spin Leech Seed away, set up all 3 types of hazards, and break Jumpluff's Substitutes with Gyro Ball. Jumpluff can't switch into Pokemon with powerful attacks with the exception of Earthquake/Earth Power or possibly other resisted attacks. If Jumpluff is your last Pokemon alive, it will almost always die because U-turn is its only attack.</p>
