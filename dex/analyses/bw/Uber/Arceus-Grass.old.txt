[Overview]

<p>Marvel at The Creator's endless masterpiece unfathomable to human mind: His thousand arms are sent forth like the branches of His Meadow Plate. As the unwavering protector for the creations that He Himself has shaped, Grass Arceus is perhaps the most supportive forme. He can provide boundless amounts of utility, for He is not only an excellent answer to the prevalent Groudon and Kyogre but also to the fearsome might of Excadrill, Kabutops, Kingdra, Manaphy, Palkia, Rayquaza, and Zekrom. With His marvelous resistances to Electric-, Grass-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks, He can act as a brilliant defensive pivot under rain. Unfortunately, the many talents of The Creator are not reflected elsewhere. His STAB Grass-type attacks have dismal offensive coverage, which leaves Him a liability against many of the Spikers and phazers that thrive in the Uber tier. His weaknesses to Bug-, Fire-, Flying-, Ice-, and Poison-type attacks can also prove problematic. However, despite these harsh conditions, The Creator has continued to flourish as does the life He created long ago.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although it is rather lacking in coverage and is resisted by a variety of Pokemon, Grass is defensively among the very best types in Ubers, as it provides coveted resistances to Water-, Ground-, and Electric-type attacks. Grass Arceus's wonderful bulk and blazing Speed, combined with these key resistances, make it a near-unstoppable Calm Mind user in Ubers. Thanks to these aforementioned resistances, Grass Arceus should have no difficulty getting off a Calm Mind. One of the biggest dilemmas when using Grass Arceus is whether to use Grass Knot or Judgment; the former is stronger against foes that weigh more than 100 kg, and has greater PP to boot. As this group includes most of the Pokemon commonly seen in the Uber tier, Grass Knot is usually the preferred choice. However, it must be noted that Manaphy in particular takes a pittance from Grass Knot and can threaten Grass Arceus with a Tail Glow-boosted Ice Beam. Ice Beam allows Arceus to deal with Salamence, Rayquaza, Latias, Latios, Zekrom, and Giratina-O, but leaves it vulnerable to Fire- and Steel-types. In particular, Ho-Oh, Reshiram, and Dialga, although neutral to Ice Beam, can take the attack with ease and smack Grass Arceus with their STAB attacks. Earth Power, on the other hand, lets Arceus take out Reshiram, Zekrom, Heatran, and Dialga, as well as other grounded Steel-types. However, it leaves Arceus vulnerable to Lugia, as well as most Dragon-types. Recover gives Arceus reliable recovery, making it very hard to kill outside of a super effective hit.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs and nature allow Arceus to take full advantage of its fantastic bulk and Speed. In terms of other moves, Grass Arceus can use Substitute over Recover in order to protect itself from status and thereby beat a certain pink blob named Blissey. In most cases, though, Recover is the superior option, because it does more in the way of keeping Grass Arceus alive.</p>

<p>Water-types make excellent teammates for Grass Arceus, as they cover each other's weaknesses well. The best examples are Kyogre, who summons rain to weaken Fire-type attacks, and Palkia, who is doubly resistant to Fire-type moves. Like most other Calm Mind variants of Arceus, Grass Arceus is also plagued by a massive weakness to Ho-Oh. In fact, Grass Arceus is perhaps the Arceus variant that most fears Ho-Oh, as both of its STAB moves destroy Grass Arceus easily, while Ice Beam does pitiful damage even after a boost. For this reason, Stealth Rock is recommended to stop Ho-Oh. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock and also has good synergy with Grass Arceus. However, its Fire-type STAB moves will be weakened if Kyogre is on the team, so keep that in mind.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Grass Arceus's important resistances, incredible bulk, and high Speed allow it to function as a fantastic supporter. Recover ensures that it will be around for a long time, and effectively increases Arceus's bulk. Grass Knot is recommended over Judgment because most of the common Pokemon in Ubers take more damage from Grass Knot. Grass Knot also has more PP than Judgment, which can be useful considering the ubiquity of Pressure users. The choice between Ice Beam and Earth Power depends on which foes you want Arceus to hit harder. Ice Beam destroys Dragon-types such as Zekrom, Garchomp, Rayquaza, and Giratina, while Earth Power helps against Heatran and Reshiram. In the last slot, Thunder Wave is recommended as Grass Arceus is an effective paralysis spreader, because it scares off Ground-types such as Groudon and Garchomp. Stealth Rock is also a viable option if none of its teammates can set it up; lastly, Magic Coat allows Grass Arceus to bounce back status moves and entry hazards such as Stealth Rock, making it a great lead.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>112 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Arceus to outrun maximum Speed Garchomp, while 252 HP EVs maximize Grass Arceus's overall bulk. The rest of the EVs are placed in Special Defense, as Water- and Electric-type attacks are commonly specially based. A Calm nature can be used, as it lets Grass Arceus avoid the 2HKO from unboosted Kyogre's Ice Beam.</p>

<p>Water-types make very good teammates. Kyogre and Palkia both deserve special mentions, with the former negating Grass Arceus's Fire-type weakness with Drizzle, and the latter packing a quadruple resistance to Fire-type moves. As Ho-Oh laughs at this set, Stealth Rock support is an absolute necessity. Heatran can set up Stealth Rock easily, and has great defensive synergy with Grass Arceus.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Both Ice Beam and Earth Power can be used alongside Arceus's Grass-type STAB attacks, and Recover dropped for a more offensive Calm Mind Arceus. However, due to its poor STAB coverage and useful resistances, Grass Arceus is better as a more defensive Pokemon. Will-O-Wisp can be used in the last slot on the support set, but is generally not as effective, as Arceus's main counters--Fire-types--are immune to it. Roar can be used on the last slot on the support set as well if you already have a Pokemon to set up Stealth Rock and do not care about spreading paralysis.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Ho-Oh is hands down one of the best counters to Grass Arceus, as it is able to take all of Arceus's attacks and hit back with a powerful Sacred Fire. Other counters depend on Arceus's choice of coverage move: if using Ice Beam, Fire Arceus, Reshiram, and Heatran will all wall Grass Arceus, while Ho-Oh, Lugia, Salamence, Rayquaza, Giratina-O, and Bug Arceus do the same if Earth Power is used. Blaziken can use Protect to boost its Speed and mow down Grass Arceus with Flare Blitz, which does a meaty 92.3% - 109.5%, a sure OHKO after Stealth Rock. Grass Arceus also needs to watch out for Victini, as Choice Scarf variants can outspeed and OHKO Grass Arceus with V-create. Scizor laughs at all of Grass Arceus's moves, and can dish out a large amount of damage with U-turn. In sunlight, Mewtwo can easily OHKO Grass Arceus with Fire Blast. Lastly, Chansey and Blissey can easily stall out Grass Arceus with a combination of Toxic and Soft-Boiled, while even boosted Judgment does meager damage to the duo.</p>
