[Overview]

<p>With a monstrously high base 150 Attack stat, combined with powerful and complementary Electric- and Dragon-type STAB moves, Zekrom has the power to devastate many teams. Zekrom's signature move, Bolt Strike, will leave enormous dents in even those who resist it, and forces people to run a Ground-type Pokemon or a very bulky Electric-type resistor in their teams. Even then, they will have to tread carefully against its extremely powerful Dragon-type STAB moves. While Zekrom does not have much to offer defensively, it is an excellent check to Ho-Oh and defensive Kyogre due to its resistances to Fire-, Flying-, and Water-type moves. However, Zekrom does have notable flaws in its rather middling Speed, common weaknesses, an almost useless ability, and a very limited movepool. Regardless, Zekrom's incredible strength is definitely something to watch out for.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Zekrom is quite a formidable mixed attacker, sporting a great base 120 Special Attack in addition to its obscenely high base 150 Attack. STAB Draco Meteor, bolstered by Life Orb and 339 Special Attack, is a frightening move to switch into. Even 252/4 Groudon, an otherwise easy safe switch-in to Zekrom, takes a painful 75%-88% from it. Bolt Strike complements Draco Meteor very well, providing almost unresisted coverage, as well as striking extremely hard on the physical side. Its immense strength and excellent type coverage allow Zekrom to blast through Kyogre, Blissey, Chansey, Lugia, Ho-Oh, and most Steel-type Pokemon, in addition to giving most Arceus formes a very tough time stalling and setting up. Dragon Claw is Zekrom's most reliable attack, but Outrage can be used if the extra power is needed, such as against Grass or Electric Arceus. Focus Blast allows Zekrom to hit the few Pokemon that resist its STABs, most notably Ferrothorn, but Volt Switch can be used to break Shaymin-S's Substitute and to escape from Wobbuffet.</p>

<p>The Attack EVs allow Zekrom to OHKO the standard Giratina-O with Dragon Claw after Stealth Rock damage. They also allow Bolt Strike to have a high chance of KOing Chansey after two Stealth Rock switch-ins, and to always OHKO 248 HP Scizor after Stealth Rock damage. Furthermore, assuming neutrality, 4/0 Arceus will take 71% minimum. The Special Attack EVs maximize the amount of damage Draco Meteor and Focus Blast can do. The rest are thrown into HP to give Zekrom a bit of bulk, and 4 Speed EVs allow it to outrun other base 90 Speed Pokemon that lack any investment. You may find it insufficient, however, so feel free to invest more in Speed until you feel comfortable.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If Focus Blast is too unreliable for your taste, Hidden Power Fire can also nail down Ferrothorn, and OHKO Forretress through its Sturdy ability thanks to Teravolt. This comes at the cost of one Speed and one Special Attack IV, and of being stuck with a pathetically weak move in rain. Thunder Wave is an option to paralyze potential non-Ground-type switch-ins and cripples Lugia, who could actually be a pain to fight against due to Pressure, Reflect, and Roost. As far as EV spreads go, if you're a speed freak, you might consider using maximum Speed and Special Attack, with a Hasty or Naive nature. Although Zekrom loses a considerable amount of power, the extra Speed minimizes the amount of attacks it will have to take or fear. </p>

<p>The first thing you want to consider is what role would Zekrom serve on your team. Zekrom can act as magnificent Groudon bait, and as such it makes a great partner to Pokemon such as Kyogre and Ho-Oh, both of whom would love to have the opposing Groudon gone. Zekrom also serves as a check to bulky Kyogre (watch out for Scald burns!) and Ho-Oh, and can fit in well in sun teams that struggle against them. </p>

<p>As with literally almost every Pokemon in the game, Zekrom appreciates entry hazards to aid in killing its targets. Forretress, Deoxys-S, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory can all set up Spikes and Stealth Rock. All of them but Deoxys-S also resist Dragon, and Skarmory is immune to Ground as well. Forretress also provides Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin support. Groudon can set up Stealth Rock and use its high Defense to sponge Earthquakes and Outrages, and appreciates Zekrom's ability to remove defensive Kyogre. Since Zekrom will be taking 10% damage every time it launches an attack, Wish support can be helpful. Blissey, Chansey, and Jirachi are all capable of passing Wishes to Zekrom; the former two can pass absolutely massive Wishes, while Jirachi resists Zekrom's Dragon- and Ice-type weaknesses. Also, keep in mind that Zekrom cannot handle offensive Kyogre well, and as such Palkia is a great partner.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Bolt Strike
move 2: Dragon Claw
move 3: Outrage
move 4: Fusion Bolt / Volt Switch
nature: Adamant / Jolly
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Tremble in fear of Zekrom's Choice Band-boosted and powerful, complementary STAB attacks, bolstered by a maximum Attack stat of 438. Its Bolt Strike is powerful enough to terrorize even most of the Pokemon that resist it, dealing a solid 41%-49% to max HP Dialga and 44%-52% to the standard Naughty Giratina-O. With that in mind, Bolt Strike will absolutely murder those who do not resist it. However, as tempting as it is to spam Bolt Strikes, it is unwise if any Ground-types are present, as they will absorb the blow and leave Zekrom helpless. Dragon Claw is a safe move to throw out to damage the Ground-type switch ins, and is a safe move to spam in general. However, it is somewhat weak and doesn't do a lot of damage against defensive Groudon. Outrage provides Zekrom with the ability to easily 2HKO even 252/252+ Groudon after Stealth Rock damage, and allows it to clean up slower teams, but can leave it very vulnerable to revenge killing. The sole reason Fusion Bolt takes up the fourth slot is for reliability, because Bolt Strike can miss at the worst times. Volt Switch can be used to break Shaymin-S's Substitute so a faster Pokemon can switch in safely.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Unlike the previous set, the EVs are quite simple. It promotes maximum power and gives Zekrom a fair amount of bulk. Similarly to the previous set, some Speed EVs can be added to outrun other Pokemon of similar Speed, such as Kyogre and Ho-Oh. Obviously, if you decide to use Jolly, use 252 Speed instead of HP.</p>

<p>Despite Outrage being able to 2HKO defensive Groudon, it will still be a big pain to fight as it walls the rest of Zekrom's moveset. Luckily, it isn't too hard to counter. Defensive Kyogre, Giratina-O, and Grass Arceus are some examples of excellent switch-ins to Groudon. Conversely, Zekrom could lure in Groudon and severely injure or KO it with Outrage, making it easier for other attackers, such as Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Swords Dance Arceus, to sweep--however, be sure to invest in Speed for this purpose. Physically defensive Ferrothorn is an issue as well, resisting both of Zekrom's STAB moves, and as such, Pokemon with access to Fire-type moves are great partners. Forretress can set up entry hazards on Ferrothorn while Rapid Spinning Ferrothorn's away. The lack of Life Orb means this Zekrom does not drain its own health every time it attacks, making Wish support less of a priority. Otherwise, the partners from the previous set all work well here. </p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Bolt Strike
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Dragon Claw
move 4: Volt Switch / Fusion Bolt
nature: Jolly / Adamant
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Zekrom's middling Speed can be patched up with a Choice Scarf, allowing it to act as a revenge killer. Zekrom possesses a couple of traits that separate it from its fellow Choice Scarf users Palkia, Dialga, and Garchomp. For one, its high Attack and Bolt Strike allow it to take down Mewtwo from 80% health down (73% with Jolly) and to murder Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Lugia, all of whom can give Choice Scarf Palkia, Dialga, and Garchomp issues. With Adamant nature, it can also 2HKO maximum HP Arceus (assuming neutrality, of course), while Palkia, Dialga, and Garchomp are turned into setup bait. Finally, it has access to Volt Switch, which allows it to keep up the momentum against the opponent so long as a Ground-type doesn't switch in.</p>

<p>Bolt Strike and Outrage are the bread and butter moves of this set, both possessing immense power and STAB, hitting nearly everything for neutral damage. As a matter of fact, Zekrom's Outrage is strong enough to 2HKO offensive Groudon, something Garchomp is incapable of doing. Dragon Claw is a safe move to use should locking into Outrage or Electric-type moves be risky, but it is rather weak. Finally, Fusion Bolt can be used over Volt Switch if you find Volt Switch's utility to be too little for you, and is 100% accurate, unlike Bolt Strike.</p>

<p>Adamant and Jolly are equally viable on Zekrom. With Adamant, Zekrom gains the ability to 2HKO maximum HP Arceus and to OHKO Mewtwo after Stealth Rock damage and one round of Life Orb recoil. However, it loses the Speed tie against other base 90 Choice Scarf users and +1 Speed Ho-Oh and Reshiram (due to Flame Charge). Adamant also means Deoxys-A will outrun Zekrom.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Although Zekrom is an effective revenge killer, it is incapable of handling Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Salamence, and thus, defensive Groudon is a decent partner. Since Choice Scarf Zekrom lacks the raw power of the other two sets, an anti-Groudon or Dialga is more necessary than before. Giratina-O, Grass Arceus, Kyogre, and Lugia (who also counters Dragon Dance Rayquaza) are all great choices for countering defensive Groudon. Dialga is trickier to handle, but Fighting Arceus, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Groudon, and sturdy Steel-type Pokemon that can absorb its obscenely powerful Dragon-type attacks are all decent checks. As with most Choice Scarf users in the game, Zekrom is quite vulnerable to Wobbuffet, who can trap it and OHKO back with Counter, but at this point there is not much you can do.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute + Hone Claws
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Hone Claws
move 3: Bolt Strike
move 4: Outrage / Dragon Claw
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Zekrom's average Speed stat makes it a mediocre sweeper on its own, so Hone Claws seems like the perfect choice to make Zekrom an even better sweeper by increasing its already ridiculously high Attack stat. However, this set's main purpose is not to use Hone Claws and Substitute to improve its attacking prowess. Instead, it aims to take advantage of one of Zekrom's most common switch-ins, Ferrothorn, while still maintaining the superb coverage granted by Dragon- and Electric-type attacks.</p>

<p>Substitute  allows Zekrom to set up on Ferrothorn--probably Zekrom's most common switch-in--and scout other switch-ins. Outrage and Bolt Strike are amazing STAB moves, as both are extremely powerful and have wide coverage in conjunction with each other. The choice between Dragon Claw and Outrage is up to the user. Outrage's undeniable power--it OHKOes Giratina-O and 2HKOes Max HP Dialga after Stealth Rock damage--makes it the superior option. However, if you don't want to be locked into Outrage and risk hitting yourself in confusion, feel free to use Dragon Claw. It should be noted, however, that doing so will cost you some crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as the ones that have been mentioned above.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is quite straightforward; it gives Zekrom maximum bulk and power while allowing it to outspeed base 90 Speed Pokemon that don't invest in Speed. However, you can opt to use more Speed EVs to outspeed certain foes. 8 Speed EVs outruns 4 Speed Kyogre and Groudon, 36 Speed EVs outpaces base 90s with 32 Speed EVs, such as Substitute Ho-Oh, and 164 Speed is just enough to outspeed Lugia, allowing Zekrom to strike it before it sets up Reflect. In all of those cases, you should take the EVs out of Attack, as the bulk is necessary. However, if you want a more offensive approach, you can use a spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature. This will let Zekrom outspeed everything it can at the cost of bulk and many important KOs.</p>

<p>The big decision you will need to make for this set is what item it will use. Leftovers fits this Zekrom set perfectly, allowing it to use Substitute to scout switch-ins while regaining the lost health, minimizing the consequences of multiple uses of Substitute. With a Life Orb, Zekrom will usually focus on attacking first, only using Substitute to set up on Ferrothorn; thus, it should only be used with a Jolly nature and its corresponding EV spread. Life Orb is also notable for letting Zekrom gain several key KOs that Leftovers forces it to miss out on. For example, after one Hone Claws boost, Jolly Life Orb Zekrom will always OHKO maximum HP Arceus with Bolt Strike after Stealth Rock damage; Adamant Life Orb Zekrom also has an 87% chance of OHKOing maximum HP Dialga with a +1 Outrage. Finally, with Life Orb, you have the option of using Draco Meteor over Outrage and Dragon Claw. Assuming a spread of 104 HP / 148 Atk / 252 SpA / 4 Spe, Draco Meteor will 2HKO Groudon, one of this set's biggest problems, and can also be used to lure Ferrothorn in after it is used once. The downside in doing so is that Zekrom will have serious problems getting past most Dialga.</p>

<p>Toxic Spikes and hazards completely tear this set apart, so a Rapid Spin user should be used. Tentacruel is an amazing spinner, as being part Poison-type means that it can simply clear the field of Toxic Spikes when it switches in. Groudon, Ground Arceus, and Hippowdon are immune to Bolt Strike, laugh at Outrage with their massive Defense stats, and strike back hard with their super effective STAB moves. Hippowdon and Ground Arceus can heal themselves by using Slack Off and Recover, respectively. Excadrill falls in the same boat as the aforementioned Pokemon, but it resists Outrage. Grass Arceus usually carries Ice Beam and Will-O-Wisp, resists Bolt Strike, and has the ability to Recover off the damage, which makes it a solid switch-in. However, Grass Arceus will take a lot from a +1 Outrage. Garchomp and any other faster Dragon-type Pokemon can revenge kill Zekrom. Garchomp gets a special mention, as it is able to break Zekrom's Substitute and OHKO it with Dual Chop. Like Garchomp, Cloyster also outspeeds Zekrom, and can use Icicle Spear to break through Zekrom's Substitute and OHKO it. Lugia, if faster, can set up Reflect before Zekrom gets the chance to hit with Bolt Strike, and proceed to stall it with Roost.</p> 

[SET]
name: Tailwind
move 1: Tailwind
move 2: Draco Meteor
move 3: Bolt Strike
move 4: Outrage / Volt Switch / Focus Blast
item: Life Orb
nature: Naughty
evs: 252 Atk / 80 SpA / 176 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Zekrom's mediocre base 90 Speed makes it nearly impossible for the poor Dragon to sweep, so this set attempts to remedy this by utilizing Tailwind. Under the effects of Tailwind, Zekrom can outspeed a majority of the tier, even when running mixed offensive EVs. Draco Meteor, despite lacking full investment, packs a huge punch, allowing Zekrom to heavily dent any troublesome Groudon and support Arceus that might try to halt its sweep. Bolt Strike is extremely strong with maximum Attack investment, and can do heavy damage to Pokemon, such as OHKO 0 HP Arceus after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage. The last moveslot is based on the team's needs. Outrage gives Zekrom a strong STAB move to spam after it has used Draco Meteor, but beware, as it may leave Zekrom locked in after Tailwind has ended. Volt Switch allows Zekrom to keep momentum by scouting for any potential double switches and can give Tailwind's Speed boost to another teammate. Lastly, Focus Blast allows Zekrom to kill weakened Ferrothorn, as the move always 2HKOes after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Zekrom is walled by different Pokemon depending on what it runs in the fourth moveslot. If Zekrom forgoes Focus Blast, Ferrothorn will be able to switch in with ease and can stomach any attack, as it resists all moves that Zekrom can hit it with. If Zekrom forgoes Outrage, then it risks being defeated by Latios, Latias, and specially defensive Groudon after it has used Draco Meteor. If Zekrom forgoes both Focus Blast and Outrage, then Excadrill will be able to switch in to it, avoiding the 2HKO from any move that Zekrom has, and proceed to OHKO Zekrom with Earthquake should it not switch out. Regardless of which move you choose to use, Ground Arceus and Grass Arceus will always be problematic. Partners that can help Zekrom defeat or weaken these foes are welcome, particularly those that also appreciate Tailwind's Speed boost. While practically every Dragon with a base 90 Speed stat falls in this category, Latios, Latias, Reshiram, Ho-Oh, and Rayquaza deserve special mentions; they can weaken enemy Ferrothorn, Ground Arceus, and Grass Arceus with their powerful moves while supporting Zekrom with a Tailwind of their own. Steel Arceus, though boasting high Speed, is also a great partner for Zekrom. Steel Arceus's typing allows it to resist powerful Dragon STAB moves aimed at Zekrom while allowing the titan to setup on Ferrothorn, as it resists all of the common moves that Ferrothorn can try to hit it with and can nab Calm Minds while it struggles to hurt Arceus.</p>

<p>Zekrom also appreciates Pokemon that can lay hazards, which are beneficial in easing a clean sweep. Partners, such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory, pair nicely with Zekrom, as they not only provide Stealth Rock and Spikes support, but can also absorb Outrages and Draco Meteors aimed at Zekrom while creating potential setup opportunities by attracting choice-boosted Fire-type moves. Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A also pair nicely with Zekrom, as they can easily lay Spikes down early in a match while also preventing any momentum loss thanks to their high Speed and good offensive capabilities.</p>

<p>Zekrom has a few other moves it can run in the fourth moveslot. Roost lengthens Zekrom's longevity and allows it to wall Ferrothorn, but Zekrom can now no longer maim Excadrill and Dialga. Hidden Power Fire can be used on a sun team to fry Ferrothorn and Forretress, but it hurts Zekrom's ability to prevent Dialga from coming in and taking momentum. Lastly, Dragon Claw can be used if you want a reliable Dragon STAB move that doesn't lock Zekrom in, but beware, as the power drop is noticeable.</p>

<p>The listed EV spread allows Zekrom to outspeed everything up to Choice Scarf Terrakion while under Tailwind, as well as maximize Zekrom's Attack stat, with the rest of the EVs being thrown into Special Attack to power up Draco Meteor. Naughty is the nature of choice, as it allows Zekrom to maximize its Attack while keeping its Defense intact. A Lonely nature makes Zekrom take more damage from priority, but can be used to preserve Zekrom's Special Defense. If this EV spread doesn't suit your needs then you can use a more specially offensive spread of 164 Atk / 168 SpA / 176 Spe. This allows Zekrom to 2HKO Groudon with Draco Meteor while having enough power in Bolt Strike to OHKO Mewtwo. Fully investing in Attack and Speed while entirely forgoing Draco Meteor for Outrage is also an option, but note that when you do this, you may have trouble when facing Groudon, as physically defensive variants avoid the 2HKO from Outrage and can OHKO back with Earthquake.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>As stated before, Zekrom's movepool is lackluster, and there aren't a lot of options for it to play around with. Thunder Wave can be used to slow down Lugia so it cannot stall Zekrom's Bolt Strikes with Reflect and Roost. Imprison can be used to block Draco Meteor and Outrage, but will still leave it vulnerable to Spacial Rend and Earthquake. Zekrom learns Reflect and Light Screen, and can use Volt Switch to aid in safely sending in its target teammate, but its rather low Speed and common weaknesses hinder it from setting them up easily. Finally, Zekrom learns Dragon Tail for phazing.</p>

<p>Haban Berry is an interesting option to use over Life Orb on the mixed set, which allows Zekrom to take a hit from opposing Dragons and OHKO them back with its own attacks. Air Balloon can be used to avoid Earthquake and escape Dugtrio, but will pop after getting hit by a single attack. Groudon can simply Dragon Tail Zekrom away while Garchomp can penetrate Zekrom with Outrage or Dragon Claw. Dragon Fang is an option over Life Orb for the mixed attacker if you despise taking 10% each turn due to Life Orb, but should only be used with the slower variants, as it requires investment in both Attack and Special Attack to deal a good amount of damage in the absence of Life Orb.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Zekrom is difficult to counter due to its immense strength and coverage, but there are several Pokemon in the game that can annoy it. Ferrothorn resists both Electric- and Dragon-type moves, but needs to be wary of Focus Blast from the mixed set. Also be aware that Choice Band Outrage or Bolt Strike 3HKOes specially defensive Ferrothorn. Although Groudon needs to be wary of Draco Meteor and Outrage, it can take on Zekrom's other physical attacks and retaliate with Earthquake. The best counter to Zekrom, however, is Ground Arceus, as it can take a hit and outrun Zekrom to KO it with Earthquake or Judgment.</p>

<p>Zekrom is fairly easy to revenge kill due to its low Speed and weaknesses to Ground-, Ice-, and Dragon-type attacks. Garchomp can switch into a predicted Bolt Strike and KO Zekrom back with Earthquake or Outrage. Keep in mind, however, that maximum HP Zekrom takes only 81% maximum from Garchomp's Earthquake. Palkia, Rayquaza, Dragon Arceus, and Choice Scarf Dialga are all faster than Zekrom and OHKO it with their Dragon-type attacks. Mewtwo is much faster than Zekrom and can knock it out with Ice Beam, provided Zekrom has taken a bit of residual damage. Wobbuffet can to an extent pose problems for Zekrom, as it revenge kills the Choice Scarf set, and the Choice Band set if Zekrom is not locked into Bolt Strike or Outrage. Dugtrio, though rare, can trap and revenge kill Zekrom. Choice Zekrom in particular needs to be wary of this, as Dugtrio can set up Hone Claws on a Choice-locked Electric-type move. Although practically nonexistent in the Uber metagame, Steelix is the best Choice Zekrom counter in the game, sporting a base 200 Defense to go along with its resistance to Dragon and immunity to Electric.</p>

<p>There are other ways to play around Zekrom. Against the mixed attacker, you can attempt to lure out its Draco Meteor and send in a Steel-type Pokemon to take the hit and weaken Zekrom's Special Attack, then send in Groudon to wall it. Zekrom in general hates Toxic Spikes, so laying it down will cut its rampage short. This especially applies to the mixed attacker, as it would take at least 22.5% every time it launches a successful hit.</p>
