[Overview]

<p>Kyurem-B is the black sheep... erm... dragon among the big and bad Dragon-types that dominate the Uber metagame. Teravolt lets Kyurem-B ignore Multiscale, Wonder Guard, and Sturdy, making Kyurem-B look even more unstoppable. The addition of Fusion Bolt to Kyurem's physical repertoire helps it out a lot by allowing it to smash Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Kyogre, Lugia, and Skarmory without resorting to either a lock into Outrage or constant reliance on Focus Blast's questionable accuracy and Hidden Power Fire's dependency on sunlight. Not all is glorious for the bastard Pokemon, though, as Fusion Bolt is the only notable physical move that Kyurem-B received upon its introduction. Freeze Shock at least gives Kyurem-B a physical Ice-type attack, but it does have the disadvantage of being a two-turn attack. Still, considering that electrifying base 170 Attack and modest 120 Special Attack coupled with the strongest Outrage in the game, Kyurem-B is more than capable of placing massive dents into Pokemon that don't resist its attacks. Its typing is questionable, but does give it the ability to check Kyogre and Scarf Palkia locked into Water- or Electric-type attacks. The mixed set being able to handle Groudon and Kyogre without forcing a lock into Outrage or a severe Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor is also significant for differentiating Kyurem-B from other Dragon-types. Best of all, its base 95 Speed gives it the jump over its fusion counterpart, Zekrom. Kyurem-B faces stiff competition for a teamslot from Kyurem-W, but its raw physical power does provide it with some advantages.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Possessing the strongest Outrage in the game, Kyurem-B has enough juice to always 2HKO Support Groudon provided that Stealth Rock is in play. When using an Adamant nature, it doesn't even need Stealth Rock support to achieve this. It can do at least 45.1% - 53.2% to max HP / min Def Ferrothorn, which is amazing considering Ferrothorn not only resists the attack but has good Defense as well. Dragon Claw is for consistent Dragon-type coverage and still does a number to Pokemon neutral to it. With Stealth Rock damage alone, even bulky Pokemon, such as max HP Dialga, are cleanly 2HKOed.</p>

<p>Fusion Bolt is Kyurem-B's best option against Skarmory, Manaphy, Ho-Oh, and Kyogre. All of them are easily OHKOed by it. Water Arceus and Lugia will take a massive hit, 84.5% - 99.5% for the former and 66.8% - 78.8% for the latter. However, Kyurem-B must be cautious when trying to take out Lugia because it can stall out Fusion Bolt with Roost. Since Kyurem-B does force a lot of switches, Freeze Shock is not outright useless, considering that it's a 140 Base Power STAB that has no real immunities to it and a 30% chance of paralysis as an added effect. Freeze Shock also OHKOes every Groudon and standard Ferrothorn, which could switch in to stop Kyurem-B. Sadly, Freeze Shock is unreliable most of the time and can be neutralized via Protect, so Sleep Talk can be used to allow Kyurem-B to take a Dark Void. With Sleep Talk, almost nothing is a safe switch-in to this behemoth. The nice thing is Sleep Talk selecting Outrage won't lock Kyurem-B into it.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>40 HP EVs allows Kyurem-B to survive 4 Seismic Tosses and minimizes residual damage, while 216 Speed EVs ensures it outruns everything up to max neutral base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Choice Specs Reshiram. Adamant is the preferred nature for this set since Kyurem-B wants to hit everything as hard as possible. Jolly is an acceptable nature if you are desperate to outspeed max Speed Kyogre or neutral Rayquaza. Keep in mind there is a notable power drop when using a Jolly nature, meaning Kyurem-B will fail to 2HKO Ferrothorn and Groudon 100% of the time. It is usually not worth losing the power for a slight gain in Speed. Unlike Rayquaza, Kyurem-B needs all the power it can get due to its horrible coverage. If you would rather have Kyurem-B be bulky, pouring all the EVs into HP or defenses instead of Speed can be a good idea. Since most base 90 Speed Pokemon run little to no Speed anyway, Kyurem-B will not miss out on anything significant besides certain offensive base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Zekrom and Reshiram. However, due to that reason alone, max Speed is the preferred option.</p>

<p>Ice Beam can be used with a Lonely nature to 2HKO defensive Groudon switch-ins without forcing a lock into Outrage. However, since this is a Choice Band set, Ice Beam is not recommended as Kyurem-B can already 2HKO almost anything with Outrage. Stealth Rock support is a must when using Kyurem-B since it tosses most bulkier Pokemon into KO range from Outrage or Fusion Bolt. Speaking of Stealth Rock, opposing entry hazards can be a major nuisance to Kyurem-B because it is weak to every type of hazard. Forretress and Excadrill can support Kyurem-B by spinning away entry hazards and setting up Stealth Rock or, in the case of Forretress, any hazard you prefer. Mold Breaker Excadrill has the added benefit of hitting Giratina-O with powerful Earthquakes while Forretress can use STAB Gyro Ball to neuter most Outrage-locked Pokemon and has much higher physical Defense. Groudon can set up Stealth Rock while supporting Kyurem-B with Thunder Wave if needed. Groudon is also very good at taking out Steel-types, which can wall Kyurem-B, with Fire Punch or Overheat. Kyurem-B is kind of average when it comes to Speed, so paralysis support will greatly enhance its performance. Groudon can also squash Jirachi and handle Steel Arceus that lack Will-O-Wisp to an extent.

<p>Ferrothorn can be Kyurem-B's nightmare unless it's locked into Outrage and a layer of Spikes and Stealth Rock are up. Once Ferrothorn is slightly weakened, however, Kyurem-B can bash through it with two Outrages. Protect variants are harder to handle since they can push the 2HKO back into a 3HKO and fire off STAB Gyro Ball just to piss Kyurem-B off, usually scoring a 2HKO. Magnezone isn't a bad partner for this reason. It also can pick off Forretress that lack Volt Switch, and Skarmory that opt not to use Shed Shell. If you're planning to go with this method, though, definitely use a spinner as Forretress and Ferrothorn will continuously set up entry hazards.</p>

<p>For further assurance versus Ferrothorn and Arceus-Steel, Ho-Oh can be used since Kyurem-B will likely have Rapid Spin support alongside it. While taking a Stone Edge can suck, Ho-Oh can take some of Kyurem-B's weaknesses and Kyurem-B can take some of Ho-Oh's. Kyurem-B is not reliant on the weather, but it excels at tearing holes in rain teams thanks to its resistance to Water-type attacks and neutrality to Ice-type attacks.</p>

<p>Powerful Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Reshiram in the sun can be a huge help to Kyurem-B. Terrakion appreciates Kyurem-B being able to knock around Groudon and Lugia, too. Always remember to pack a spinblocker when using Kyurem-B because entry hazards are crucial for Kyurem-B to clean up nicely. Giratina-O, Ghost Arceus, and Giratina are your best bets because the other Ghost-types are simply useless, like Dusclops, or just not fit for Ubers like Gengar. Ghost Arceus has the added benefit of not being weak to Dragon-type attacks, while Giratina-O has Levitate to avoid Toxic Spikes as well as access to some utility options such as Dragon Tail to wear down Ferrothorn when combined with hazards. Giratina is probably your best status absorber and is the bulkiest of them all, ensuring entry hazards will almost never leave the field. If you're not opting to use paralysis support, Trick Room can also work. Kyurem-B is usually slow enough to function on Trick Room teams, though it obviously will fail to outspeed some really slow threats such as Bronzong. It's also slower than Wobbuffet, so just be careful of a random Encore coming in. However, Trick Room is a rather shaky strategy in Ubers so it isn't recommended. Tailwind support from the likes of Arceus and Ho-Oh is usually more useful in general since, at +2 Speed, Kyurem-B will outspeed just about anything, including Choice Scarf Terrakion. Since burns and paralysis can become annoying, Heal Bell or Aromatherapy from Chansey or Blissey can be beneficial. They also can pass huge Wishes to keep Kyurem-B healthy if removing entry hazards proves difficult. However, Kyurem-B is generally not fit to be on stall teams, so Jirachi is probably a better choice for Wish support, although the Wish size difference is very noticeable due to Kyurem-B's high HP.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If the Choice Band set's sheer power does not impress you, Kyurem-B can also opt for a more roundabout way of getting around its counters so it can smash everything else with its STAB Outrage and underrated STAB Ice Beam. Since this Kyurem-B is a good wallbreaker, it can work nicely with stall teams since they often lack an offensive push to bust other stall teams. One must always keep in mind the reason to use this set over other mixed attackers, such as Zekrom and Rayquaza is its unique movepool, stat distribution, and incredibly powerful Outrage. It is one of the few mixed attackers not bothered by Ho-Oh thanks to Fusion Bolt.</p>

<p>Fusion Bolt handles Kyogre, Skarmory, Manaphy, Ho-Oh, and Water Arceus easily, as they are all 2HKOed at worst. Lugia can also be taken out with Fusion Bolt as long as it is slower. With the given EVs, Ice Beam is a guaranteed OHKO on max HP Groudon, and Stealth Rock is not required. It also allows Kyurem-B to trash most Dragon-types without needing the use of Outrage. For example, even physically defensive Giratina still takes a good chunk of damage (62% - 73.2%) and standard mixed attacker Giratina-O is OHKOed after Stealth Rock. Also, in case you're worried about not being able to OHKO Giratina, Outrage does a massive 78.7% - 93%, an OHKO with Stealth Rock and two layers of Spikes.</p>

<p>Focus Blast is Kyurem-B's best option for hitting Ferrothorn, Dialga, and Tyranitar without locking Kyurem-B into Outrage. Ice Beam + Focus Blast does 90.9% damage at a minimum to Ferrothorn, so Stealth Rock and two layers of Spikes is required to 2HKO. However, if Ferrothorn has Protect, then a third layer is required for the guaranteed KO. Defensive Dialga takes 63.9% - 75.2% from Focus Blast, which Kyurem-B can follow up with Ice Beam for 37.6% - 44.6%, which is a 2HKO with Stealth Rock. Ice Beam + Outrage also will 2HKO Defensive Dialga easily. Defensive Tyranitar on the other hand takes 78.2% - 93.1% from Focus Blast if it isn't holding a Chople Berry, so Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes is necessary to OHKO. Hidden Power Fire is another option when supported with sunlight as it can trash Ferrothorn and Forretress. 2HKOing Steel Arceus and Excadrill is pretty slick too. The Speed EVs give Kyurem-B the jump on neutral base 90 Speed Pokemon that invest in Speed. If you're using Hidden Power Fire, take 4 EVs out of Attack and place them into Speed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Lonely nature is preferred over Naughty. While Kyurem-B's natural Defense is higher, Naughty makes Kyurem-B more susceptible to Kyogre's attacks, which otherwise Kyurem-B does a decent job taking. In a worst case scenario, Kyurem-B can be used to take on Scarf Palkia locked into Thunder or its Water-type attacks.</p>

<p>Max Attack can be used instead of the given EV spread if you don't care about the OHKO on Groudon, as minimum Special Attack Ice Beam still 2HKOes 252 HP Groudon and OHKOes Gliscor. Roost can be used if you're nervous about Life Orb recoil and other forms of passive damage, such as Stealth Rock and sandstorm. However, it's really difficult to fit in, and you have to opt for losing an attack that might otherwise give Kyurem-B good momentum against the opponent's team. Generally, Roost is not worth using because Kyurem-B simply lacks the time to use it effectively and is better off just firing off powerful attacks.</p>

<p>Life Orb is too clutch for this set to be replaced as the extra power is crucial to gain the KOs listed. Hazards are, once again, a major necessity to help defeat bulkier Pokemon such as Ferrothorn. Stealth Rock is a must, while Spikes is highly recommended. Forretress is probably Kyurem-B's best friend again, as it can set up Spikes while being able to spin away all the nasty entry hazards on the field. Skarmory is also good since it can intercept Scarf Terrakion and Taunt defensive Pokemon such as Lugia, preventing them from recovering. Groudon is an excellent teammate as it can lay down Stealth Rock, deal with Terrakion and some faster Dragon-types such as Garchomp, and possibly cripple the opponent's team with Thunder Wave; the boost its Drought ability gives Hidden Power Fire is especially useful because the sun is needed to KO Forretress and Ferrothorn. If paired with Groudon and Forretress, Ho-Oh becomes a solid candidate because it too enjoys the sun, Rapid Spin support, and entry hazards. Ho-Oh does an awesome job tearing apart some of the other problematic Pokemon that Kyurem-B faces such as Steel Arceus and Jirachi. This set isn't as troubled by the presence of Ferrothorn as the Choice Band one, so a counter to deal with Ferrothorn is of less concern.

<p>Wobbuffet can make a good partner for Kyurem-B since it can pick off a lot of faster Pokemon such as Lugia, Mewtwo, and Choice Scarf Palkia, while using Encore to possibly provide Kyurem-B a free switch-in. Since Focus Blast is not dependent on weather, Kyogre can be used instead. It can use Thunder Wave to slow down the opponent for Kyurem-B since it rarely draws in Ground-types, helping slow down the opponent's team significantly for Kyurem-B to sweep. Spinblockers such as Giratina-O, Ghost Arceus, and Giratina are a must for this set to function at maximum potential. Reshiram works nicely with Kyurem-B, as it can roast Steel Arceus and Heatran alive thanks to Turboblaze and its immense firepower. Wish passing from Blissey, Chansey, or Jirachi can be pretty beneficial to Kyurem-B's health, although Kyurem-B is unlikely to survive long in any given match.

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Dragon Claw
move 3: Fusion Bolt
move 4: Freeze Shock / Sleep Talk
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Adamant
evs: 176 Atk / 168 SpD / 164 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Kyurem-B can also function as an effective revenge killer thanks to its extremely high base Attack and passable Speed. Unlike most Choice Scarf users, Kyurem-B can go bulky as it has a naturally high Attack stat and can afford to invest in bulk instead. With Choice Scarf, usual checks will be demolished if they are not using a Choice Scarf of their own. For example, non-Choice Scarf and Haban Berry Palkia is cleanly OHKOed by Dragon Claw before it can move.</p>

<p>Just like the previous sets, Outrage is the main sweeping move as it is Kyurem-B's only real powerful attack, strong enough to 2HKO max HP Arceus. Thanks to this set's high Speed, revenge killing it while it is stuck using Outrage becomes harder. Dragon Claw is great for picking off weakened foes as it does not lock Kyurem-B into Outrage although the power can be disappointing at times. Fusion Bolt will always 2HKO Lugia after Stealth Rock damage, and Kyurem-B always outspeeds it with this set. Besides Lugia, Fusion Bolt is also your strongest attack against Kyogre, Manaphy, and Ho-Oh, cleanly 2HKOing all at worst. For the last slot, Freeze Shock is the best option because Kyurem-B really lacks any other useful moves. Freeze Shock's extremely high Base Power allows it to OHKO Ground Arceus and Grass Arceus, preventing them from stalling out Outrage with Recover. If you hate Darkrai, Sleep Talk is an acceptable alternative as it allows Kyurem-B to freely take Dark Void. As a bonus, Sleep Talk will not lock Kyurem-B into Outrage when it is selected.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Ice Beam is a fine choice if you are desperate to OHKO Gliscor and 2HKO Groudon without using Freeze Shock. The EVs in this set are focused on giving Kyurem-B as much as bulk as possible, while retaining the ability to outrun everything up to neutral Deoxys-A. Thanks to the Special Defense investment, Kyogre can only 2HKO Kyurem-B with Water Spout and Latias's Dragon Pulse will never OHKO from full health. Kyurem-B is also very likely to survive Palkia's Spacial Rend and OHKO back with Outrage or Dragon Claw. This set works great on both stall teams and offensive teams. Unlike Zekrom, Kyurem-B is not weak to Ice and can take out both of Zekrom's main counters, Grass and Ground Arceus. Kyurem-B can also switch into Kyogre much easier, something this set highlights. Putting all the EVs into Defense instead of Special Defense seems like a good idea, but Kyurem-B is more adept at switching in on resisted special attacks particularly against rain teams.</p>

<p>Max Speed and Attack is also possible on this set just like any other Choice Scarf user. Kyurem-B cleans up better with that spread, but it can no longer come in on Kyogre easily and will be OHKOed by Palkia without fail. It is best for Kyurem-B to stick to its own niche and avoid direct competition with Zekrom, which boasts STAB Bolt Strike and better overall typing.</p>

<p>Entry hazards are still a necessity for this set, and Rapid Spin support will greatly extend Kyurem-B's lifespan. Wish support from the likes of Blissey, Chansey, or Jirachi is also appreciated, and this set can function well on stall teams. Forretress once again makes a fantastic partner for launching entry hazards, soaking up Outrages and providing Rapid Spin support. Something to take Fighting-type attacks, such as Lugia which can stop most Dragon-types that threaten Kyurem-B as well, is also needed.</p>

[SET]
name: Hone Claws
move 1: Hone Claws
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Fusion Bolt
move 4: Blizzard
item: Life Orb
nature: Lonely / Hasty
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set may seem gimmicky at first, but Kyurem-B's sky-high Attack and Ice typing make it a very powerful wallbreaker in the Ubers metagame. After a boost from Hone Claws, Kyurem-B's Outrage destroys virtually everything, even resists. For example, even with Leech Seed and Protect, standard Ferrothorn will be hard-pressed to take repeated +1 Outrages from Kyurem-B, as it takes 57.67% - 67.90% from the move. Fusion Bolt has excellent coverage alongside Outrage, as it swats aside Skarmory and Lugia without much trouble. The last move is what really sets Kyurem-B apart from other Attack boosters such as Zekrom&mdash;STAB Blizzard easily OHKOs physical walls such as Groudon and Gliscor, Pokemon that plague many physical attackers. Although Blizzard's accuracy is subpar under normal conditions, a single Hone Claws accuracy boost raises it to a much more usable 93%.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Kyurem-B has a couple of other options. Roost is an option to keep Kyurem-B relatively healthy, especially with all the residual damage that it tends to take. However, access to STAB Blizzard is generally what sets it apart from other boosting Dragon-types, such as Zekrom and Rayquaza. Ice Beam is another option if you find Blizzard too unreliable and find it hard to get a Hone Claws boost, but it fails to OHKO Groudon or do enough damage to Ground Arceus. The nature of choice can be important to Kyurem-B performance. A Lonely nature is preferred due to the power provided, which contributes to notable 2HKOes such as the one on Ferrothorn just noted. Since most of Kyurem-B's resistances are specially based attacking types, a Defense-lowering nature is preferable to one that lowers Special Defense.</p>

<p>Being a powerful wallbreaker, Kyurem-B appreciates two types of teammates: sweepers that can take advantage of damaged walls and Pokemon that can help Kyurem-B overcome its weaknesses. Kingdra is a very notable sweeper that appreciates Ferrothorn being severely weakened, as well as Groudon being removed. Other sweepers such as Excadrill, Double Dance Groudon, Dragon Dance Rayquaza, Terrakion, ExtremeKiller Arceus, and many others all appreciate physical walls such as Groudon, Gliscor, and Lugia lured out and destroyed.</p>

<p>Being an Ice-type, Kyurem-B is unfortunately weak to Stealth Rock, and has nothing to save it from Spikes. Naturally, this means that Rapid Spin users are ideal teammates for Kyurem-B. Tentacruel is an excellent long-lasting Rapid Spin user in Ubers, and can switch into Fighting-type attacks aimed at Kyurem-B. Excadrill also works brilliantly in most weather conditions, and can switch into Kyurem-B's Rock- and Dragon-type weaknesses. Forretress resists Dragon-type attacks and can also set up its own entry hazards, making Kyurem-B much harder to wall. Kabutops is also an excellent offensive Rapid Spinner that can take advantage of Kyurem-B's wallbreaking ability.</p>

<p>Physically defensive Forretress with Gyro Ball is probably the best counter to Kyurem-B, with defensive Scizor, Steel Arceus, and fast Jirachi with Iron Head all being close behind. Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Fighting Arceus, as well as faster Dragon-types, such as Palkia, Latias, Latios, Garchomp, and Salamence can also revenge kill Kyurem-B with ease. If Lugia is using a lot of Speed EVs as well as Reflect, it can stall out Kyurem-B thanks to Roost's secondary effect. Incidentally, many of these counters to Kyurem-B are excellent teammates for it. The aforementioned bulky Steel-types can switch into Dragon-type attacks, while Lugia and Latias defeat most Fighting-types. Groudon and the Giratina formes are generally good physical walls to take on Terrakion. Paralysis support from Thunder Wave Grass Arceus, Kyogre, Groudon, and Darkrai will also go a long way to help Kyurem-B sweep, while using Wobbuffet to remove revenge killers is another good idea. Also, Lugia is generally entry hazard fodder for Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>Haban Berry allows Kyurem-B to take at least one Dragon-type attack and sack the opposition with its own STAB Dragon-type attacks. Kyurem-B has the bulk to pull it off, but Stealth Rock being cleared from the field is a must as otherwise those STAB Dragon-type attacks will KO Kyurem-B even through Haban Berry. Roost can be used in the event that Stealth Rock is hard to clear off the field, but is not recommended due to Kyurem-B's offensive nature. As hilariously stupid as it sounds, Rock Smash can be used to 2HKO Ferrothorn switch-ins on the Choice Band set with Spikes support, guaranteed if a Defense drop occurs. Blizzard is an option but should only be used on the Hone Claws set. Freeze Shock can be used alongside Power Herb for a powerful initial attack. Substitute protects Kyurem-B from status, but is not as good as on some Pokemon because Kyurem-B really needs all the coverage moves it has. Endeavor can be used on the Choice Scarf set since, if you adjust Kyurem-B's HP stat correctly, it can be used as a last ditch attack if the only damage Kyurem-B took was Stealth Rock. Just be aware that it's not the most effective way to damage Pokemon that have access to recovery or are completely immune to it. Icy Wind can help Kyurem-B catch faster Pokemon off-guard, but that's about the only real use for it because of its low Base Power and imperfect accuracy. Sadly, Kyurem-B cannot learn Ice Punch or any other physical Ice-type move besides Freeze Shock.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Kyurem-B does not have many counters due to its sheer power and acceptable coverage. Steel Arceus is at the top of the list as it can near endlessly switch into Kyurem-B as it resists both of its STABs and Kyurem-B lacks any real method of clearing it aside from the inaccurate Focus Blast, the weak Rock Smash, and the sun dependent Hidden Power Fire. Choice Band Outrage is a possible 2HKO, but Judgment is likely OHKOing Kyurem-B if it has taken Stealth Rock or other passive damage. Choice Band Fusion Bolt can still do significant damage, rocking at 63.5% - 74.8%, so make sure Steel Arceus is healthy before trying to take the assault. As for Steel Arceus's options, it can also Will-O-Wisp Kyurem-B and continuously Calm Mind while recovering the damage.</p>

<p>Ferrothorn can be a major thorn in Kyurem-B's side. While Choice Band Outrage and Ice Beam + Focus Blast can 2HKO, and Hidden Power Fire in the sun can OHKO, Ferrothorn can take just about anything else Kyurem-B has to launch at it and either hit Kyurem-B hard with STAB Gyro Ball or set up entry hazards to bother Kyurem-B later on if it switches out. Forretress is in a similar vein except it is not weak to Focus Blast but has worse Special Defense. Choice Band can be pretty difficult to counter due to its immense power unless you revenge kill it. Packing Pokemon faster than Kyurem-B and forcing it to use Outrage with bulky Pokemon such as Arceus is probably the best way to handle it. Skarmory can easily take repeated Dragon Claws and Outrages thanks to its great Defense and access to Roost, but will fall to Fusion Bolt. The Choice Scarf set is a little easier to handle since it is a lot weaker. Skarmory can step into every attack other than Fusion Bolt and can take one Freeze Shock (71.3% - 84.4%). Skarmory can Roost most of the damage off, set up its own Spikes, or phaze Kyurem-B out with Whirlwind. If the option exists, Skarmory can Brave Bird Kyurem-B, though be careful as the recoil will be a little more significant than usual with Kyurem-B's high HP. Lugia is similar to Skarmory in stopping Kyurem-B, but does not resist Dragon so Reflect is mandatory to guarantee the win.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock is pretty important for limiting Kyurem-B's survival, and just as important is a spinblocker to prevent Stealth Rock from disappearing on Kyurem-B's side. Dialga, Deoxys-S, and Groudon are notable for being able to set up this essential hazard, while the Giratina formes and Ghost Arceus can spinblock effectively. In general, Outrage is Kyurem-B's double-edged sword. While Outrage can do significant damage to the majority of the Uber tier, it also leaves Kyurem-B susceptible to being revenge killed in the process due to its average Speed. Scarf Outrage is a little harder to revenge kill, admittedly, but it is also easier to wall.</p>
