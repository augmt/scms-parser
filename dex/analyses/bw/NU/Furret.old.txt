[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If at all possible, have Furret Trick its Choice item onto something like Musharna or Tangela so that it can say that it did something in battle. Failing that, the best thing that Furret has going for it is that it is very fast, meaning if the opposing team is weak enough, it can clean up late-game with its Choice Band-boosted attacks. Base 76 Attack is wholly unimpressive, though.</p>

<p>It's too bad Team Preview exists in BW, making scouting not very important at all this generation. U-turn can still be fun to knock around Musharna and Tangela while bringing in something like Skuntank or Cacturne, but a quick U-turn isn't as desirable as it used to be. Aqua Tail is there for Golem, or if that isn't a concern, Shadow Claw can annoy Misdreavus a bit.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Furret's movepool is expansive, it just can't make use of any of it. Though, Super Fang is cool and Sucker Punch is nice for priority.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Regirock is your best friend when facing down the terrifying Furret since it doesn't particularly mind getting a Choice Band or being hit by Aqua Tail. Trick is really annoying and is Furret's greatest weapon, but don't switch in an offensive Pokemon to absorb it right off the bat as Return or Double-Edge can actually leave a dent in a few Pokemon. Also, watch out for Furret giving its teammates a free switch-in with U-turn.</p>
