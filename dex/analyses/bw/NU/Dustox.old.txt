[Overview]

<p>Not even access to Quiver Dance can save this moth from being one of the worst Bugs around. The worst part is that it gets access to Compound Eyes but doesn't need it. Such a waste.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Quiver Dance
move 2: Sludge Bomb

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Switch in on Grass-types like Tangela and giggle as they are forced to switch out (assuming they've already used up Sleep Powder on something else on your team). From there, set up Quiver Dance to have a prayer of outspeeding your enemy and hope that Bug Buzz or Sludge Bomb will have enough power to KO it (it probably won't). Roost lets Dustox switch into Stealth Rock and opposing Grass-types multiple times just for the heck of it. Or you can choose Substitute to block Sleep Powder.</p>

<p>Shield Dust is cool in that Dustox won't get burned from Scald or paralyzed from Body Slam, meaning if your opponent is left with a team of Wartortle, Tangela, and Metang, you might have just won the match.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Please humor me and leave the specially defensive set of generations past in the past. A physically defensive EV spread can be used on the Quiver Dance set to laugh at Sawk and Primeape, but then it takes even longer to get enough boosts to have a chance of sweeping. Silver Wind can be fun to try and nab that +1 boost to all stats.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Unless you totally lack a Pokemon with a strong physical attack and the ability to tank a +1 base 50 Special Attack Bug Buzz / Sludge Bomb, you'll be fine.</p>
