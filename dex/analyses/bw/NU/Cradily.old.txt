[Overview]

<p>Cradily sports respectable bulk, a unique typing in NU that allows it to resist Normal-type attacks, and the ability Storm Drain, which grants it an immunity to Water-type attacks. Cradily can be customized to fit the needs of different teams as it can be both physically and specially based, can act as Stealth Rock support, and can function as a setup sweeper. Despite Cradily's versatility and bulk, its weaknesses to common attacking types hinder its usefulness in NU. Furthermore, unlike the rest of its Rock-type brethren, Cradily takes neutral damage from Flying-type attacks, which makes it less appealing to use. Nonetheless, Cradily's unique typing allows it to provide key resistances and act as a glue for a team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Cradily's Storm Drain ability allows it to switch into bulky Water-types such as Alomomola, Seismitoad, and Wartortle with relative ease without fearing a Scald burn. In addition, its Rock typing allows it to tank hits from Kangaskhan and Tauros efficiently. As a result, Cradily is a unique Stealth Rock user because it can set up against Water- and Normal-types alike without much fear. Giga Drain is Cradily's primary form of offense, doing considerable damage after a Storm Drain boost, and helps it heal health at a faster pace. Rock Slide is primarily used as a way to beat Flying-types such as Altaria. It can also do decent damage to Bug-types, although Cradily must watch out for Bug-type attacks in return. Toxic can also be considered in this slot if one wishes to forgo coverage for a more stall-oriented strategy, as it is able to poison common switch-ins such as Tangela. Recover allows for Cradily to last longer in battle, providing it much-needed longevity in combination with its resistances and bulk to tank hits from the opponent while acting as a support pivot.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>To tank hits efficiently from hard hitting physical Normal-types such as Tauros and Kangaskhan, it is usually more effective if Cradily invests in its physical bulk. Hidden Power Fire is an option to consider to take on Steel-types such as Metang and Klang, although they beat Cradily for the most part anyway. A specially based set with a Bold nature and Hidden Power Rock over Rock Slide is also viable if one wishes to take complete advantage of Storm Drain's Special Attack boost. Furthermore, one can also opt to use a completely specially defensive spread in 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD depending on the needs of the team.</p>

<p>Cradily is best used alongside a cleric and a Toxic Spikes absorber, as status severely restricts its ability to tank hits and switch in on threats. Lickilicky, Garbodor, and Musharna make great teammates as a result; Musharna in particular has Heal Bell and a much-needed Fighting-type resistance to cover Cradily's weaknesses. Metang is also a good teammate that can be used to help deal with Ice-type attacks. Given Metang's physical bulk, it works best alongside a specially defensive Cradily set; using the two together also enables Cradily to run Toxic over Stealth Rock because Metang is able to use Stealth Rock instead.</p>

<p>Cradily can be used to switch into status afflicting moves such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, then set up late-game for sweeps once its counters have been dealt with. RestTalk allows Cradily to switch in multiple times throughout a game as a defensive pivot, and Curse allows it to sweep when the time is right. Using Rock Slide makes Cradily vulnerable to both Fighting- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Throh, Gurdurr, and Golem. On the other hand, Seed Bomb makes Cradily more susceptible to Sap Sipper users such as Zebstrika, as well as Flying- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangela, Serperior, Mandibuzz, and Altaria. Steel-types in particular resist both Rock Slide and Seed Bomb, so Pokemon such as Klang and Metang are able to hinder Cradily's ability to sweep late-game if they are still present.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Suction Cups is the preferred ability because it prevents phazing, a common strategy used to nullify the effectiveness of setup mono-attackers such as Cradily. Storm Drain may also be considered in tandem with Recover over RestTalk if one wishes to use a Curse set with more coverage and utility but less opportunities to set up. If one chooses to go this route, one must use a cleric in order to heal Cradily of crippling status such as burn and poison.</p>

<p>Toxic Spikes support is appreciated for breaking down Pokemon that won't go down to Rock Slide or Seed Bomb; for example, Tangela and Exeggutor won't be able to wall Seed Bomb Cradily effectively with the presence of Toxic Spikes. Garbodor works great with Cradily because it resists both Bug- and Fighting-type moves and can lay down entry hazards with ease. Pokemon that deal with Steel-types such as Seismitoad, Charizard, and Torkoal also make great partners as they can help clear the field for a Cradily sweep. In the same vein, Gothorita is a premier trapper in NU against Fighting-types that would otherwise make it difficult for Cradily to set up and sweep.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Stockpile boosts Cradily's defenses even further, but Stockpile Cradily is a sitting duck more often than not. Mirror Coat can provide decent surprise factor and might sometimes catch an opponent off-guard, especially if a Water-type were to use Ice Beam against Cradily. Confuse Ray is another option to consider, although Cradily has better things to be doing than relying on confusion against the opponent. Earthquake can be used to hit Garbodor, Probopass, and Bastiodon for respectable damage, although doing so would require Cradily to sacrifice much more important coverage or utility in the process. Lastly, a Swords Dance set can be considered, but Cradily is too slow to pull it off effectively, especially considering the types of weaknesses that it has. Because of this, Curse is generally a much better option as it also boosts Defense.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Charizard is easily capable of 2HKOing Cradily; however, it must watch out for Rock-type moves, as Rock Slide is very common on Cradily. As such, Charizard should only be used against Cradily when it is weakened enough to be picked off in one hit. Fighting-types such as Sawk, Throh, and Primeape all deal heavy damage to Cradily and resist its Rock-type attacks.</p>

<p>Defensively, Poison-types can wall Cradily effectively; Weezing in particular can use Haze against any Curse sets and sports Will-O-Wisp in order to cripple the support set. Garbodor can also wall the support set and lay down entry hazards, but loses out to the mono-attacker set. Grass-types such as Tangela and Exeggutor can wall the support set if it does not run Toxic. Exeggutor is at a stalemate with Cradily if it runs Substitute + Leech Seed, while Lum and Sunny Day variants beat the support set but lose to Curse. Roselia can wall the support Set and lay down Spikes, but it loses to the Curse set. Steel-types such as Klang and Metang are troublesome because they resist both of Cradily's STAB moves, and Bastiodon can wall the support set as well but has to be wary of Curse.</p>
