[Overview]

<p>Rotom-S is blessed with decent stats across the board and an expansive movepool to back them up. Primarily known for its Choice Scarf set, Rotom-S has lost some limelight to Primeape and Jynx due to their higher Speed and greater coverage. Nevertheless, its great offensive typing offers a STAB Volt Switch, and its Speed covers enough significant threats that Rotom-S can see some usage as a Choice Scarf user. In addition, its typing covers many physical threats, so Rotom-S can use its large movepool to function as a wall or pivot, showcasing its versatility. However, a Pokemon with a weakness to Stealth Rock and a lack of reliable recovery cannot thrive on its own, so Rotom-S needs proper team support to function to its fullest.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Air Slash
move 3: Volt Switch
move 4: Trick
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Timid
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set functions as a revenge killer and late-game sweeper. With Thunderbolt and Air Slash as Rotom-S's most reliable STAB options, it can outspeed and KO common threats such as +2 Timid Gorebyss, +2 Carracosta, and Choice Scarf Sawk. If the opponent lacks a Ground-type, Rotom-S can easily spam Volt Switch early-game for damage and momentum. Trick is used for bulky defensive Pokemon, easily crippling whatever comes in to wall Rotom-S's attack and allowing it to switch up moves.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>While lacking in power when compared to Primeape and Jynx due to its lower attacking stat and its lower Base Power STABs, Rotom-S does have surprising fortitude, withstanding Aqua Jets from +2 Carracosta and +2 Samurott and KOing them back. Unfortunately, with its weakness to Stealth Rock, its bulk is hindered with each quarter of health lost, so keeping Stealth Rock out of play is highly beneficial, but not required. Great partners to keep Stealth Rock off the field are Choice Band Mold Breaker Sawk and Taunt Samurott, both of which fit into the offensive playstyle nicely. Ground-types are also a problem, as they are immune to Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, severely limiting Rotom-S in the match. Multiple measures can be taken, however, to alleviate this issue. For starters, Rotom-S can use Hidden Power Grass to hit common Ground-types, such as Seismitoad and Golem, for massive damage. Most Water-, Grass-, and Ice-type Pokemon can dispose of Ground-types as well; Ludicolo is a good partner because it has the bulk to switch in and threaten them with Giga Drain, Hydro Pump, or Ice Beam. Good defensive partners for Rotom-S cover its Rock- and Ice-type weaknesses, so Steel-types such as Hone Claws Metang and Shift Gear Klang are good choices for this playstyle.</p>

[SET]
name: Expert Belt

move 3: Air Slash
move 4: Thunderbolt
item: Expert Belt

evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Fitting best on balanced and offensive teams, this set acts as a lure, targeting Ground-types that switch in expecting the common Choice Scarf set's Volt Switch. Hidden Power Grass hits all of them for major damage, KOing the 4x weak Seismitoad and Golem. Air Slash and Thunderbolt are the most reliable STABs and are meant to dish out optimal damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Expert Belt is the key item for this set, because the lack of residual damage when attacking creates the impression that Rotom-S is holding a Choice Scarf. Because it is not locked into any moves, Rotom-S can use much of its large arsenal to exploit the bluff. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple almost all of NU's physical attackers, but KOing them with the appropriate coverage move is more beneficial. Also, Rotom-S could use the ChestoRest strategy for good recovery while utilizing the same masquerade, but the lack of immediate power is noticeable. Pain Split could also be used for recovery, but the lack of coverage would hurt it more.</p>

<p>Much like the Choice Scarf set, Steel-types such as Metang and Klang are good partners because they cover Rotom-S's weaknesses to Ice- and Rock-type moves. Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Sawk are great for disposing of walls that can handle all of Rotom-S's attacks, such as Lickilicky and Regice, and Sawk can possibly keep Stealth Rock off the field as well, aiding in Rotom-S's longevity. Lastly, more balanced teams can afford a Wish passer, such as Lickilicky or Alomomola, which helps keep Rotom-S alive.</p>

[SET]
name: Defensive
move 1: Pain Split
move 2: Discharge / Substitute
move 3: Air Slash
move 4: Will-O-Wisp
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 224 HP / 220 Def / 64 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A surprising set for defensive teams, Rotom-S's role is to spread harmful status conditions on many unsuspecting Pokemon. Its Flying typing allows it to switch in on the popular Fighting- and Ground-types of NU and burn them with Will-O-Wisp or hurt them with Air Slash. Discharge is preferred for its paralysis chance, and Rotom-S can create a mean para-flinching scenario with Air Slash. Pain Split is important because it's Rotom-S's most reliable recovery move. Substitute could be used instead of Discharge to ease prediction and handle more switch-ins that would threaten Rotom-S out.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The 64 Speed EVs allow Rotom-S to outspeed Timid Gorebyss before it can use Shell Smash, which is an important precaution. The rest of the EVs offer the highest amount of Leftovers recovery and maximize its bulk. It is possible to make Rotom-S specially defensive, but there is less it can wall on that side of the spectrum. It can use the ChestoRest strategy for guaranteed recovery, but the more balanced the team and the longer matches drag on, the more the strategy proves to be underwhelming. Another option is to use Volt Switch, which turns Rotom-S into a bulky pivot.</p>

<p>Metang is the best partner for this set because of its synergy with Rotom-S and its bulk, creating a sound defensive core. Defensive teams always appreciate Wish support, which comes best from Audino or Alomomola in this playstyle. Good partners that also fit the defensive playstyle are Taunt Misdreavus and Rapid Spin Wartortle because they help patch up Rotom-S's weakness to Stealth Rock.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Some viable options for Rotom-S include a Choice Specs wallbreaker set and a Rain Dance set with Damp Rock, as it can use the weather itself with Thunder or pivot to a rain sweeper with Volt Switch. It can also set up with Sunny Day, but it doesn't fit well on sun teams. Rotom-S also has access to dual screens, but its lack of reliable recovery leaves it outclassed by Musharna. A Life Orb set with Substitute and Pain Split is also viable, but it is often underwhelming with the lack of coverage. Rotom-S can take the annoying path with Confuse Ray, Thunder Wave, and Air Slash, but any strategy dependent on luck is unreliable. Some moves that it can possibly fit into a slot on the offensive sets to hit situational threats are Dark Pulse, Shadow Ball, Signal Beam, and Sucker Punch. A Charge Beam set is possible, but setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Misdreavus and Calm Mind Serperior are more reliable.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Because of Rotom-S's low power, most dedicated special walls, such as Regice, Lickilicky, Audino, and Munchlax, can handle the offensive sets. Tanks can also take most of Rotom-S's attacks as long as they have an advantageous typing. For example, Piloswine is immune to Thunderbolt and Volt Switch and can deal damage back with super effective STAB Ice-type attacks. However, if any of these Pokemon are Tricked onto a Choice Scarf, they are severely crippled for the rest of the match. Electric-types such as Eelektross, Zebstrika, and Ampharos are able to switch in on Rotom-S's STABs with minimal damage, and most generally do not fear a Choice item being Tricked onto them. Also, faster Pokemon with super effective coverage such as Choice Scarf Jynx are able to revenge kill Rotom-S quite easily. Pokemon with Taunt such as Misdreavus are able to stop the defensive set from recovering, and Pokemon that don't fear status, such as Ursaring and RestTalk users, can generally handle that set.</p>
