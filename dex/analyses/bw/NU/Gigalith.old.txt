[Overview]

<p>In a tier filled with Rock-types, Gigalith struggles to stand out. Gigalith often finds itself as a Custap lead that sets up Stealth Rock and then finishes with an attack. Its sole Rock typing makes it outclassed offensively by Golem and defensively by Regirock. A stronger Rock Blast and Explosion might make it seem better than Golem, but Golem gets STAB on Earthquake and an Electric-type immunity, which makes it better overall. Gigalith's main selling point is Sturdy, which lets it almost always survive a hit and set up Stealth Rock. Also, great offensive presence and a powerful Explosion are good reasons to choose Gigalith if you need a suicide lead.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Gigalith makes for a decent suicide lead because of its high Attack. This set aims to set up Stealth Rock quickly and then hit with a powerful attack. Explosion is the main attack for Gigalith, letting it go out with a bang. Rock Blast breaks Substitute and Focus Sash, while also being a semi-reliable STAB move. Earthquake hits Rock-types and Steel-types that would otherwise freely switch in on Gigalith. Sturdy guarantees that Gigalith can almost always set up Stealth Rock.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs outspeed uninvested Carracosta. Custap Berry lets Gigalith move before everything in its priority bracket, but does not prevent it from being outsped by priority moves. As far as partners go, Golurk, Haunter, and Drifblim are great offensive spinblockers and appreciate Stealth Rock. Stone Edge can be used over Rock Blast for added power; however, Rock Blast is much more helpful because it breaks Substitute. Normal Gem can be used as a way to boost the power of Explosion, but Custap Berryis better because of the pseudo-Speed boost it grants. Leftovers can be used for passive recovery, but Gigalith is better off as a suicide lead. Lum Berry can also be used to avoid status, but Custap Berry is consistently useful. Gigalith fits in well on offensive teams, as offensive partners such as Ludicolo, Sawk, and Braviary enjoy Stealth Rock and Explosion, which weaken walls to the point that these Pokemon are be able to break through.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Superpower can be used for a more powerful way to break through Rock- and Steel-types, but the Attack drop really hinders Gigalith. Autotomize can raise Gigalith's pitiful Speed, but Gigalith is quite vulnerable to priority, limiting the effectiveness of doing this. Choice Band can be used as an instant way to raise Gigalith's power, but Gigalith relies on its coverage and switching moves too much for this to be worth it in general. Heavy Slam hits fellow Rock-types hard but has a horrible offensive typing. Although Gigalith's main goal is to deal damage early-game, Toxic can be a surprise to physical walls which take little damage from Gigalith's attacks.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Choice Band Sawk can break through Sturdy with Mold Breaker and OHKO Gigalith with Close Combat, making it a good counter. Wartortle is the next best counter to Gigalith because can take Gigalith's attacks with ease and beats Gigalith one-on-one with Scald and Rapid Spin. Tangela can get around Gigalith by using Sleep Powder and 2HKOing it with Giga Drain. Misdreavus can shut down Gigalith by using Taunt in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp, rendering Gigalith harmless. Bulky Ground-types such as Torterra, which beats Gigalith but cannot prevent Stealth Rock being set up, and Golurk, which though it does not often run it, can get around Stealth Rock 50% of the time with Dynamic Punch are also decent answers to Gigalith. Marowak is a great answer to Gigalith because it can bypass Sturdy with Bonemerang. Alomomola can live any of Gigalith's attacks and heal off the damage with Wish or Regenerator.</p>
