[Overview]

<p>Gabite's good Speed and unique typing, which gives it good resistances, great offensive STABs, and few weaknesses, make it a decently effective user of Stealth Rock. With Eviolite equipped, it is also quite bulky physically. This lets it take strong attacks such as Choice Band Sawk's Close Combat and wear down their users with its ability, Rough Skin. However, Gabite's Attack is average, and it lacks reliable recovery. Furthermore, despite its good bulk, it lacks very important resistances to Normal- and Flying-type Pokemon's STAB attacks that most other Stealth Rock users possess. This makes it even more difficult to check these threats when using Gabite.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With Eviolite, a good ability in Rough Skin, and a great typing, Gabite finds its niche as a fast, bulky user of Stealth Rock that can deal good damage with its strong STAB moves. Stealth Rock is the main move on the set and lets Gabite support its team. Outrage and Earthquake are Gabite's strongest STAB moves and provide almost perfect neutral coverage. Toxic allows Gabite to cripple troublesome Pokemon such as Tangela, Alomomola, Mandibuzz, and Misdreavus. Alternatively, Fire Blast lets it 2HKO Leafeon, Tangela, and Exeggutor.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With the given EVs, Gabite can 2HKO standard Armaldo, Eelektross, Samurott, and Metang with its STAB move of choice. The Speed EVs let it outrun Timid Seismitoad and below. If Gabite runs Fire Blast, a spread of 208 Atk / 108 SpA / 192 Spe lets it 2HKO everything it needs to with the move while still investing in Speed and giving it the power to 2HKO all of the previously mentioned threats. Pokemon that appreciate Gabite's ability to deal with Rock- and Steel-types, such as Zangoose and Swellow, make for great partners. Grass-types such as Roselia can deal with Alomomola, a problem for Gabite if it runs Fire Blast, as well as Water-types running an Ice-type coverage move, a huge problem for Gabite. Pokemon that can deal with bulky Water-types, such as SubToxic Seismitoad, Samurott, and Ludicolo, are also good partners, with the first two even being able to set up on them.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Dragon Claw is an alternative Dragon-type STAB move that Gabite can use but it's quite weak and cannot even OHKO Altaria, a Pokemon that is weak to it. Roar and Dragon Tail are options Gabite can use to phaze the opponent, but it cannot do this consistently due to its lack of reliable recovery and setup sweepers such as Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary can still do huge amounts of damage to it at +0. Stone Edge hits Mandibuzz but has no use aside from that. RestTalk is Gabite's only means of recovery, but it is rather unreliable. Hone Claws can be used to boost Gabite's Attack, but both of Gabite's STAB moves are 100% accurate and it takes a lot of time to set up to any worthwhile point.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The best counter to Gabite is Bronzor. It resists the combination of Gabite's STAB moves, isn't 2HKOed by Fire Blast, and can set up Calm Minds while healing itself with Rest. Bulky Pokemon such as Torterra, Tangela, and Alomomola can easily take hits from Gabite, although the first two don't like taking a Fire Blast and all of them are crippled by Toxic. Misdreavus can burn Gabite and stall it out with Pain Split. Water-type Pokemon that carry Ice-type moves, such as Wartortle, Ludicolo, and Samurott, can dispose of Gabite with ease. Primeape can revenge kill Gabite with a super effective Ice Punch.</p>
