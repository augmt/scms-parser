[Overview]
<p>Persian is one of the many cats of NU, but access to Fake Out, U-turn, and amazing Speed makes it a decent scout and gives Persian its niche. While Liepard generally outclasses Persian as a scout due to Prankster, Persian has Technician to boost the power of its weaker moves such as Fake Out and Bite. However, other than its high Speed, Persian's stats are mediocre, and its moves still lack power even after a Technician boost. Generally, Persian is decent at best and struggles to carve much of a niche for itself outside of scouting.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>This set aims to scout your opponent's team while maintaining offensive momentum. Fake Out always causes a flinch and packs decent power when boosted by Technician. U-turn keeps up momentum by bringing in an appropriate check or counter to whatever is out on the field. Taunt prevents the target from using non-attacking moves, which shuts down walls such as Alomomola and also prevents entry hazards, a great plus because of Persian's tendency to switch. Bite can be used instead of Taunt as it allows Persian to hurt Ghost-types, packing decent power with Technician and a good chance to cause a flinch. Keep in mind, however, that pairing Persian with a Ghost-type check handles most Ghost-types well enough, meaning that Bite is often unnecessary. Return is used as a strong STAB attack that can finish off any weakened opponents.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>A Jolly nature is used to allow Persian to outspeed max Speed Scolipede and Serperior. A Life Orb is used to further improve Persian's damage output, but a Silk Scarf can be used instead to avoid stacking recoil with entry hazard damage. Hypnosis can be used over Taunt or Bite to put foes to sleep, but with only 60% accuracy, it's not a very reliable move.</p>

<p>This set fits on more offensive teams by giving them Taunt support and scouting for items and movesets with Fake Out and U-turn. Defensively, anything that can switch in on strong attacks aimed at Persian after it U-turns makes for a great partners. Pivot Musharna can sponge most physical attacks aimed at Persian, namely Fighting-type attacks, and then either set up with Calm Mind or Baton Pass out to something else if it causes a switch. Choice Scarf Braviary and Sawk appreciate Persian's Fake Out support to handle threats that they can't outspeed. Pretty much any offensive Pokemon enjoys the favorable match-ups Persian can set up with U-turn, especially anything that resists or is immune to Fighting-type attacks, such as Golurk or Scolipede.</p>

[Other Options]
<p>Persian has a few other options, but it lacks the stats to effectively pull off much outside of its scout set. With a set of Nasty Plot / Swift / Water Pulse / Petal Dance or Thunderbolt, Persian can make a decent special sweeper, but it won't find many opportunities to set up due to its frailty. Aerial Ace can be used over Bite for coverage against Fighting-types such as Sawk and Primeape, but leaves Persian struggling against Ghost-types. Seed Bomb can also be used over Bite as it hits Rock-types that normally resist Persian's moves hard while still dealing decent damage to Golurk. Knock Off can be used over Taunt or Bite to cripple Choice item and Eviolite users. Covet, which is boosted by Technician, can be used in combination with Switcheroo and a Normal Gem to steal an item from a foe and cripple something else with the stolen item, but is much less reliable than the scout set. Feint can be used as another STAB priority move over Bite / Taunt as it packs +2 priority, but it's much weaker, offers no additional coverage, and mostly unnecessary considering Persian's high Speed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]
<p>If Persian lacks Bite, any Ghost-type walls it entirely, only having to be careful with U-turn bringing in a check or counter. Even if Persian does have Bite, Misdreavus is only 3HKOed by it and can threaten Persian with a burn from Will-O-Wisp if it decides to stay in. Considering Persian is so frail, priority of any sort usually spells doom for it, especially from Gurdurr, which takes almost nothing from Fake Out and Return and can OHKO after Stealth Rock with Mach Punch. Steel-types such as Probopass, Bastiodon, and Metang take almost nothing from any of Persian's attacks and can set up Stealth Rock on sets that lack Taunt. Pretty much any physically defensive wall can take on Persian, only fearing Taunt. Kangaskhan can threaten Persian with Fake Out as long as it comes in after Persian. On sets lacking Taunt, Carracosta can set up Shell Smash and proceed to threaten Persian's team.</p>
