[Overview]

<p>Are you looking for a solid Toxic Spikes user in NU? Well then, keep looking. Ariados is horribly outclassed by Roselia and Garbodor which all have greater bulk, access to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and even greater offensive stats and movepools. It has Insomnia and Sucker Punch, which are things the other three don't, but unless those two tiny niches are absolutely vital to your team, Ariados's terrible stats and mediocre Attack just don't cut it in NU.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Ariados's access to Toxic Spikes and priority attacks give it a small but usable niche as a lead. Toxic Spikes is what makes the set usable. Against teams without a Toxic Spikes absorber, the hazard can easily help win games. X-Scissor is Ariados's strongest attack, and Sucker Punch provides strong priority. Finally, Baton Pass is used to try to gain momentum against the opposition. However, Poison Jab can be used in the last slot in order to deal decent damage to opposing Fighting-types. In particular, Ariados can switch into Sawk and Primeape and proceed to 2HKO them when using Poison Jab.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is used to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Sawk's Close Combat after switching into Stealth Rock. 132 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature are used to outspeed Adamant max Speed Carracosta, though an Adamant nature can be used instead to outspeed up to base 55 Speed Pokemon with no investment. In terms of team support, Alomomola makes a decent partner as its HP is gigantic and it walls the problematic Kangaskhan. A Ghost-type such as Misdreavus should be used as well in order to block Rapid Spin and ensure the Toxic Spikes that Ariados sets stay on the opponent's side of the field throughout the battle. Mold Breaker Sawk can be used to OHKO common Stealth Rock leads, such as Golem, Piloswine, and Gigalith. As grounded Poison-types absorb Toxic Spikes upon their switch, offensive Ground- or Psychic-types are recommended as partners. Golurk in particular can spinblock and use its STAB Earthquake to damage the opposition.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Ariados has few other viable options. Spider Web is a highly interesting move, but Ariados struggles to make use of it with its bad stats. It gets the always-irritating Swagger and Foul Play. Night Shade is intriguing for damaging Steel- and Poison-types but has little use beyond that. Agility can be used for a Baton Pass or an offensive set, but Ariados is outclassed severely in both jobs.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Most Poison-types, include Garbodor and Roselia, can absorb the Toxic Spikes and completely wall Ariados. The two of them can then proceed to set up Spikes for free as Ariados cannot touch them. In terms of rival entry hazard setters, Golem and Gigalith can use Rock Blast to OHKO Ariados through its Focus Sash. Golem can also outspeed Ariados with proper Speed investment so that it never gets a chance to set up. Kangaskhan can use Fake Out to break Ariados's Focus Sash, then KO with its powerful Normal-type STAB. Ariados is heavily reliant on its Focus Sash and is frail nonetheless, so two powerful hits from just about anything that is not resisted should do the job.</p>
