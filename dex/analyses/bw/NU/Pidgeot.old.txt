[Overview]

<p>As impressive as it looks, Pidgeot is terribly outclassed by most other physical Normal / Flying type Pokemon in the tier. Its mediocre bulk and offenses do little to help it differentiate itself, and while it does have a moderately good Speed stat, it misses out on important base 95 Speed tier threats such as Sawsbuck. Its combination of Brave Bird, U-turn, and Quick Attack makes it a decent enough Choice Band user, but it is nothing special.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sadly, Pidgeot's power is so mediocre that it needs a Choice Band set to actually leave a notable mark on the opposing team. Brave Bird is Pidgeot's strongest STAB move and helps it differentiate itself from Fearow. Return provides a reliable secondary STAB move and doesn't cause Pidgeot to take recoil. U-turn allows Pidgeot to scout the opposing team, escape any incoming counters, and differentiate itself from Dodrio. Quick Attack is the final move on this set, as it is a useful priority move to pick off frail or weakened Pokemon and is a move that Braviary doesn't have.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Jolly is necessary for Pidgeot to outspeed positive-natured base 90 Speed threats such as Zangoose and Kangaskhan. Life Orb can be used with Hidden Power Grass to threaten Golem and Seismitoad, but Pidgeot would usually prefer to U-turn out instead. Pursuit can be used in the last slot to catch Gardevoir on the switch, but Kadabra and Haunter&mdash;the most notable other targets it hits&mdash;outspeed Pidgeot, are powerful enough to take it out, and likely won't switch out. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Golem and Seismitoad is necessary to allow Pidgeot to have a good chance of OHKOing Choice Scarf Rotom-A and offensive Armaldo with Return and Brave Bird, respectively. As this set switches out often, Pokemon that can deter Stealth Rock from being set up, such as Choice Band Sawk and Taunt Samurott, are very useful teammates. In fact, any Fighting- and Water-type Pokemon make good teammates as they can deal with the Rock- and Steel-types that wall Pidgeot. Ground-type Pokemon, such as Golurk and Piloswine, are helpful to prevent Electric-type Pokemon from gaining momentum against Pidgeot with Volt Switch.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Choice Scarf can also be used, but most other Normal / Flying type Pokemon utilize it better with their higher power. Pidgeot has a usable special movepool, and a set with Hurricane, Heat Wave, Hidden Power Ground, and a filler move is feasible. Unfortunately, such a set isn't ideal as Pidgeot's Special Attack is mediocre at best. Tailwind is a decent support move, but Pidgeot is outclassed by Prankster Murkrow in this role. FeatherDance is also usable, but Murkrow again outclasses Pidgeot in supporting the team in this way. Whirlwind is an option, but Pidgeot's mediocre bulk doesn't allow it to withstand many attacks. Work Up is the best boosting move Pidgeot has but fails to improve its average power enough to be worth the time spent setting up. Pidgeot can set up Rain Dance and even make use of it with Hurricane, but Swanna is more effective in this role due to its STAB Surf and better Speed and power.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>While walling Pidgeot isn't difficult, it must be noted that most of the time Pidgeot will be using U-turn to scout for its counters. Steel-types, such as Probopass and Klang, wall Pidgeot and can easily set up on it. Rock-types also wall Pidgeot as long as they do not have a secondary typing which removes their resistance to Flying. Pidgeot has average power even with a Choice Band, so physically defensive Pokemon, such as Alomomola and Musharna, can easily tank any of its moves and retaliate with their STAB moves or cripple Pidgeot with status. Piloswine is a great check, as it can take any single hit from Pidgeot and threaten it with Icicle Spear and Ice Shard. Bulky Electric-type Pokemon, such as Ampharos and Eelektross, can switch in on any move but Return and threaten Pidgeot with their STAB moves. Most faster Pokemon can revenge kill Pidgeot easily due to its mediocre bulk and Stealth Rock weakness.</p>
