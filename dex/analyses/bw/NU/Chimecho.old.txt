[Overview]

<p>Chimecho is one of the many Pokemon in NU that is unfortunately outclassed in almost every way by more prominent threats in the tier. It has a huge support movepool, including Heal Bell, Wish, and Recover, which makes it seem like the ideal cleric, but it is horribly outclassed by Musharna and Lickilicky, both of which sport much better bulk. Chimecho's only niche is its access to Healing Wish, Yawn, and Taunt. These three moves allow Chimecho to effectively support its offensive teammates by giving them a second chance to sweep or clean up. However, Chimecho only fits on certain teams, and outside its access to Healing Wish, it is mostly outclassed as a supporter. </p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to force your opponent out, prevent entry hazards, keep opponents from setting up, and heal a teammate with Healing Wish. Healing Wish is the only reason to use Chimecho; at the cost of sacrificing itself, Chimecho fully heals a teammate, keeping the momentum on your side of the field. Yawn either forces the opponent out or puts it to sleep, giving Chimecho a chance to bring something in with Healing Wish. Psychic keeps Chimecho from being Taunt bait and can hurt quite a bit even uninvested. Taunt keeps opponents from setting up on Chimecho and also prevents entry hazards.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Focus Sash helps ensure that Chimecho can use at least one Healing Wish or Yawn. Either Toxic or Thunder Wave can be used over Taunt, but Taunt generally has more utility than both of them. Chimecho's typing, speed, and ability along with Taunt help it take on most of the popular hazard setters in NU. Levitate gives Chimecho immunity to the common Ground-type attacks that Stealth Rock setters, such as Golem and Piloswine, tend to carry. Chimecho's STAB Psychic hurts Roselia and Garbodor&mdash;two of the most popular Spikers&mdash;which can't touch Chimecho after being Taunted.</p>

<p>Good offensive partners for Chimecho include anything that can deal with the Dark- and Steel-types that Chimecho can't touch. Sawk and Primeape both can handle the Dark- and Steel-types that bother Chimecho and also benefit from Healing Wish and Yawn support. Sweepers in general, such as Carracosta, Samurott, and Charizard, love Healing Wish support, which can give them a second chance at sweeping or cleaning up.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Chimecho has quite a few other options to choose from, but these "options" are usually better utilized by something else. Access to Wish, Recover, and Heal Bell allows Chimecho to become a cleric; however, both Musharna and Lickilicky preform this role much better. Chimecho can also set up Reflect and Light Screen, but both Gardevoir and Serperior outclass it in this role, as they are both much faster. Although Trick Room is generally a poor strategy in NU, Chimecho can set up Trick Room and use Healing Wish next turn, bringing in a Trick Room sweeper for free and giving it maximum turns under Trick Room. Chimecho also has a wide special movepool including Charge Beam, Energy Ball, and Shadow Ball, which it can use with Calm Mind, but generally Musharna and Duosion make better users of Calm Mind due to their superior bulk. Hypnosis is an option over Yawn for instant sleep, but its low accuracy makes it unreliable.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything faster than Chimecho that carries Taunt shuts it down entirely. Both Serperior and Samurott can use Taunt against and set up on Chimecho or just attack it. Any Dark-type handles Chimecho pretty well, especially if it has access to Taunt. Skuntank can Taunt Chimecho then Pursuit trap it. Most strong STAB attacks can take out Chimecho with ease because of its poor bulk. Kangaskhan takes care of Chimecho with Fake Out and Double-Edge. Generally, the best way to handle Chimecho is to keep it from using Healing Wish.</p>
