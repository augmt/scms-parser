[Overview]

<p>Glaceon has a very high Special Attack, which makes it a powerful wallbreaker that can even 2HKO dedicated special walls such as Audino and Lickilicky. Its Ice typing also gives it good coverage in NU, hitting a good portion of the tier for high amounts of damage. Glaceon also has usable bulk, so it is capable of taking hits decently. Glaceon also has enough Speed to outpace some of the slower Pokemon in the tier. However, Glaceon's typing, while great offensively, is poor defensively, giving it numerous exploitable weaknesses and few resistances. Its movepool is also very small, giving it very limited coverage.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Specs allows Glaceon to serve as a powerful wallbreaker, being able to deal heavy damage to many Pokemon in the tier. Ice Beam serves as strong and reliable STAB, able to 2HKO Audino and Lickilicky after Stealth Rock damage. Hidden Power Ground hits Steel-types such as Probopass as well as some Fire-types such as Rapidash. Signal Beam hits Musharna hard and serves as a filler in general. The last moveslot makes full use of Glaceon's relatively poor movepool. Baton Pass allows Glaceon to switch out of its counters and resort to a teammate, while Frost Breath allows it to bypass Calm Mind Musharna.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Modest nature is chosen to attain all of the power needed. A Timid Nature is a viable alternative if one wants Glaceon to outspeed neutral nature Ludicolo, but the extra power provided by Modest is preferable. Ice Body is Glaceon's only legal ability, despite the lack of hail. Wish could be used over Baton Pass or Frost Breath to pass HP to a teammate, but the other two moves have more overall utility; Glaceon's HP is also rather low. Hidden Power Fighting is a usable alternative as it 2HKOes Piloswine and does heavy damage to Regice; the ability to hit Metang with Hidden Power Ground is often more desirable, however. Shadow Ball is also a usable alternative over Signal Beam as it hits Misdreavus as well as the lesser seen Frillish and Shedinja, but Signal Beam is often more useful as there are no Pokemon immune to it.</p>

<p>Sawk is an excellent teammate for Glaceon, as it handles Steel-types and Regice while also removing Stealth Rock users. Musharna also makes a great teammate, being able to handle Fighting-types as well as Baton Pass Calm Mind boosts to allow Glaceon to hit even harder. A Water-type such as Samurott or Carracosta can handle Fire-types which threaten Glaceon, such as Charizard. Finally, sweepers that appreciate Glaceon's wallbreaking prowess, such as Ludicolo, Choice Scarf Primeape, and Charizard, make good teammates.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Glaceon has a relatively small movepool, and there isn't much it can use aside from what is listed above. Barrier is an option that allows Glaceon to increase its bulk and Baton Pass more effectively. Unfortunately, Barrier is a very situational move at best. Wish can be used to give Glaceon some form of recovery, but despite Glaceon's bulk, its defensive typing is not very good. In addition, due to Glaceon's low HP, its Wishes are not very large. A Choice Scarf is an option to allow Glaceon to patch up its low Speed and be a decent revenge killer.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Glaceon does not have many counters due to its raw power, but it has plenty of checks thanks to its low Speed and poor defensive typing. That said, Munchlax and Regice are the best counters to Glaceon available, as their great special bulk and Ice resistance means they take little from Ice Beam and can cripple it with paralysis. Fighting-types such as Sawk and Gurdurr are able to make quick work out of Glaceon. Fire-types such as Charizard and Rapidash can also check Glaceon well, but cannot switch in safely. Carracosta can switch into a resisted Ice Beam and OHKO with Stone Edge.</p>
