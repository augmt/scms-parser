<p>Luvdisc gets the award for worst fully evolved Pokemon for three generations straight, which I guess is something.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Get in, set up Rain Dance, and hit stuff until Luvdisc keels over. Luvdisc does even better if you can get Rain Dance set up with a different Pokemon before bringing it in. The Speed EVs allow Luvdisc to outspeed Choice Scarf Electabuzz and everything slower in the rain.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Toxic might end up doing more to some Pokemon in the long run than any of Luvdisc's other moves. Blizzard can be used over Ice Beam for more power.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Just send in something that resists Water and can withstand an Ice Beam and Luvdisc will meet its end.</p>
