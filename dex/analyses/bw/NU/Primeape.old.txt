[Overview]

<p>Meet Primeape, a Pokemon which was late to arrive to the NU tier, yet has still already begun to leave an impact on the tier. While it may not have quite the same power that Sawk has or the same bulk that Gurdurr has, Primeape still stands out against its competition. There are many reasons for this, but the most notable one is its Speed. Primeape is the fastest Fighting-type Pokemon in NU with base 95 Speed, a solid Speed for NU. Additionally, with access to U-turn and a resistance to Stealth Rock, Primeape is one of the best VoltTurn users available. It can also utilize a few support moves, such as Encore and Taunt. One of the only areas where Primeape struggles to perform is facing Ghost-types. Misdreavus is a prime example of a bulky Ghost-type Pokemon that Primeape prefers to avoid. Its bulk is also lacking; this makes it fear priority moves and faster Choice Scarf users.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Primeape's most popular set in NU is its Choice Scarf set, and it is undoubtedly its best one. Primeape's largest selling point is its Speed stat which is showcased in this set. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Primeape hits an impressive 475 Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted tier. Primeape is also one of the fastest Choice Scarf users in NU. The only common Choice Scarf users with which it ties in Speed are Haunter and Jynx, and some of the only ones to beat it include Charizard, Tauros, and Zebstrika. Close Combat is chosen for the most powerful and reliable STAB in Primeape's movepool. U-turn is one of Primeape's greatest tools, allowing it to force switches to help weaken foes and scout out what the opponent wants to do without risking being KOed. Finally, Primeape rounds out its coverage with Ice Punch and Stone Edge. Stone Edge hits the Flying- and Bug-types that resist Close Combat, while Ice Punch is a more reliable option against Flying-types due to its perfect accuracy.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Jolly nature is used on this set for multiple purposes, though the main reason to is to outspeed slower Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Sawk, Pinsir, and Rotom-A, who would otherwise outspeed it with an Adamant nature. It also allows Primeape to Speed tie with other Primeape, Jynx, and Haunter. Vital Spirit is the best ability for the set, even though most of the Pokemon in the tier that would try to use a sleep-inducing move against it can either knock it out or completely wall it. Despite this, Anger Point relies on getting hit by a critical hit, which is an unreliable tactic, especially since Primeape is so frail. Defiant is a great ability in tiers where Intimidate users are more common, but the ability is rare in NU, making this ability practically useless. You may also want to use Punishment on this set, but it is pitifully weak, even after opposing Pokemon have a gathered some stat boosts.</p>

<p>Since Primeape is able to force switches while it is scouting, it appreciates support from Pokemon who can set up entry hazards. For this reason, Scolipede and Garbodor are great partners because they can both set up Spikes. When using either of these Pokemon alongside Primeape, be wary of the compounded Psychic-type weakness. Metang also gets a mention as a Stealth Rock user, but it's also a fantastic partner for taking the Psychic- and Flying-type attacks targeted at Primeape. Since Primeape struggles to defeat Ghost-type Pokemon, Skuntank's support is greatly appreciated, as it is able to trap Ghost-types with Pursuit. Finally, other VoltTurn Pokemon are great partners, as they allow your team to keep up initiative and force switches.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When equipped with a Choice Band, Primeape can make up for its middling power while still fully utilizing its great Speed. Primeape can also separate itself from Sawk with its access to U-turn, which allows Primeape to switch out against the Ghost- and Psychic-types that can wall it and bring in a partner to Pursuit trap them. Close Combat is used for a high Base Power STAB move that Primeape can spam late in the game. U-turn is used to scout the opponent's team before Primeape can mindlessly spam Close Combat, while also allowing it to switch out of its checks and counters and wear them down throughout the match. Finally, Ice Punch and Stone Edge are both used for coverage moves. The former hits Flying- and Grass-type Pokemon, such as Altaria, Tangela, and Vileplume, that either resist Primeape's STAB or take little from it. The latter can also hit Flying-type Pokemon and gives Primeape coverage against Bug-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Vital Spirit is used so Primeape can switch into Sleep Powder from Grass-types, then use U-turn to either deal good damage to them or scout out a potential switch. Primeape can also use Earthquake for coverage against Poison-types or Punishment to deal good damage against opposing setup sweepers, but these moves are typically less useful than Ice Punch and Stone Edge.</p>

<p>Primeape loves having Pursuit support to take out the Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon that wall it, making Skuntank and Sneasel ideal partners. Even with a Choice Band, Primeape lacks the power of heavy hitters such as Sawk. With this in mind, powerful wallbreakers are very useful to give Primeape an easier time later on in the match. Charizard, Eelektross, and Jynx are great to fill this role. Another way to help Primeape throughout the match is to set up hazards against the opponent. Hazards are so greatly appreciated because of Primeape's ability to force switches with U-turn and wear down its checks and counters. Scolipede and Garbodor are both great Spikers and Metang can cover Primeape's Psychic- and Flying-type weaknesses and use Stealth Rock. Finally, other users of U-turn and Volt Switch are great partners for Primeape, as they can keep up offensive momentum throughout the match. Swellow, Probopass, and Zebstrika are the best examples of this.</p>


[SET]

move 2: Encore

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set has many purposes, but one of the main reasons to use it is for its ability to bluff a Choice Scarf. Since the vast majority of Primeape sets are going to be running a Choice item, this set is able to lure in Pokemon that think they would be safe, only to be hit with an untimely Close Combat. Aside from this, Encore is easily one of the greatest support moves in the game, locking the opposing Pokemon into its last used move for three turns. Using Encore, you can lock Pokemon into set-up moves, Stealth Rock, Substitute, and more, basically giving you a chance to ruin the opponent's initiative and bring it back to your side. This makes U-turn a great choice on this set, since oftentimes your opponent will want to switch after being locked into a move. Finally, Punishment and Ice Punch are both great moves on this set. Ice Punch is more consistently reliable, but with Encore, slower Pokemon can be locked into boosting moves and subsequently hit for great damage with Punishment.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice in items is up to you. Both items are effective since they both bluff a Choice Scarf, but generally, Fist Plate is better than Expert Belt, as a neutral Close Combat hits harder than a super effective Ice Punch. It is important to note that this set is best played by bluffing a Choice item as long as possible, and you should only reveal that you are not locked into a move at the most optimal time. The surprise factor is one of the reasons why this set can be so successful.</p>

<p>Jolly is once again the preferred nature for this set because base 95 Speed is still fantastic. The added power is less noticeable than the added Speed. Vital Spirit is also still its best ability for the same reasons found in the Choice Scarf set, although this set runs Defiant better than the Scarf set due to the liberty to switch up moves. Even so, Vital Spirit is still the better option. A set with Taunt over Encore could be interesting as well, but it would primarily be used to prevent entry hazards from being placed, a job that Sawk does better due to its slightly superior bulk, greater power, and Mold Breaker. Even more so than the Scarf set, this set loves entry hazards on the opponent's side. Encore forces a lot of switches, so Spikes and Stealth Rock support is strongly recommended. Because of its frailty, Primeape hates priority, so you should pack something to take priority moves, such as Fake Out, Mach Punch, Quick Attack, and Aqua Jet. Lastly, Ghost-types are still just as big of a problem for this Fighting-type as they are most, so support from Skuntank to remove Ghost-types is once again recommended.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Primeape has loads of other options available to it, but many of them are only useful in very niche situations. One thing that can be run on either set is Toxic, as it provides a way to handle bulky physical walls that Primeape would be otherwise unable to break. U-turn is usually Primeape's way of doing this, but Toxic is a more proactive solution. Earthquake can also be used over another coverage move to hit Poison-types, such as Garbodor, but its coverage is otherwise fairly redundant. Primeape also has a solid special movepool with moves such as Overheat and Thunderbolt which can hit physical walls on their weaker Special Defense, but this is not a very viable strategy, as it uses Primeape's poor base 60 Special Attack. Final Gambit could be used, but it's a waste of potential. Primeape could be scouting or hitting hard with Close Combat instead of sacrificing itself, and with Primeape's low base 65 HP, it can't even take out the most common switch-ins. A set with Substitute and Focus Punch also shows potential, though it relies quite a bit on Encore in order to succeed, and the set is still walled by the same Pokemon that wall the above sets. Primeape can also attempt to run a set with Endure and Reversal while holding a Salac Berry. However, this set would require some major support to succeed, but once Ghost-types and priority users are eliminated, its power is immense. A set that does allow Primeape to beat some of its typical checks and counters is one that utilizes Substitute and Endeavor. Due to Primeape's fantastic Speed, this set can work really well, but Primeape misses out on either coverage or the ability to scout. Finally, either set can run Rain Dance or Sunny Day on niche support for weather based teams. Doing so often sacrifices Primeape, allowing a free switch into a weather sweeper.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Perhaps the greatest thing about Primeape is that a fast U-turn significantly hinders the ability to counter it. One way to punish Primeape for constantly using U-turn to switch in and out is through the use of Spikes. Another great way of doing this is with Rocky Helmet Garbodor, as it takes minimal damage from U-turn and inflicts major damage to Primeape throughout the course of the battle with both Rocky Helmet and Aftermath. Aside from its constant switching, Alomomola and Tangela both take minimal damage from all of Primeape's attacks and can recover health back with Regenerator. Because Primeape is not the strongest Pokemon, even Regirock can take a Close Combat in a pinch. Bulky Ghost-types, such as Golurk and Misdreavus, also give it troubles. Golurk's biggest fear is Ice Punch, and while it may not want to switch in, it can take one and retaliate with a powerful STAB Earthquake. Meanwhile, Misdreavus serves as a full counter to it; even Punishment is a 4HKO at best, and Misdreavus can just burn Primeape. Finally, faster Choice Scarf wielders and those that use priority moves can strike Primeape and knock it out before it gets the chance to attack.</p>
