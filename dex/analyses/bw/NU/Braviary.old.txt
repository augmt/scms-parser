[Overview]

<p>One of the most dangerous offensive threats in NU, Braviary is a force to be reckoned with. Along with its powerful moves and high Attack, it packs a surprising amount of versatility; for instance, its Bulk Up set gives bulkier teams problems while its Choice Band set makes for a dangerous wallbreaker. Also, unlike other Pokemon of its typing, Braviary has good bulk and coverage moves, with Superpower doing major damage to Pokemon that could otherwise withstand its STAB moves. Braviary's biggest downfall is its Speed stat&mdash;while it's not exactly slow, it is slower than most other offensive threats in the tier.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is arguably Braviary's most dangerous set&mdash;with a combination of a good bulk, access to reliable recovery, and a reliable, strong STAB move, it makes for a dangerous Bulk Up user. Not only can this variant of Braviary easily deal with defensive teams thanks to the aforementioned traits, but it can also set up on Pokemon that could otherwise deal with its other sets. For example, Braviary can set up a Substitute on Rock-types that rely on Stone Edge, such as Regirock or Carracosta, when they switch in, then use a combination of that and Roost until they run out of PP for Stone Edge, and then start setting up Bulk Ups as they are unable to damage it with a super effective attack.</p>

<p>Bulk Up is the main move on this set, patching up Braviary's uninvested Defense to cushion attacks from Rock-types in particular and making its already impressive Attack higher. Roost allows Braviary to keep itself healthy, as it tends to get worn down from a combination of Substitute, Brave Bird recoil, and repeated attacks from the opposition. Substitute allows Braviary to get in additional boosts and avoid status moves. Many weaker Pokemon, such as Tangela, Alomomola, Roselia, and defensive Seismitoad, will find themselves unable to break past Braviary's Substitutes in one hit, which means that Braviary can set up an additional Bulk Up and keep its Substitute intact for the next Pokemon. Brave Bird is the best option for the STAB move, as even though it causes recoil, nothing is immune to Brave Bird, making it more optimal for a mono-attacker than a Normal STAB move. Even without any boosts, it still does quite a bit of damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs allow Braviary to outspeed Adamant Torterra and everything slower, with the remaining EVs being thrown into HP and Special Defense. Maximum HP allows Braviary to make 101 HP substitutes, and even though users of Seismic Toss are rare, being able to set up on them is always nice. Defiant is chosen as the ability&mdash;while it doesn't come in handy too often, it is the only ability that actually helps it out. Braviary could potentially run more Speed, but there isn't much that is worth catching up to without sacrificing Braviary's bulk. Leftovers should be used as the item, as it allows Braviary to receive passive recovery as it is setting up. Return could be used for the attacking option, as it causes no recoil damage and it hits Electric-types neutrally, but Ghost-types will then wall this set completely, with Misdreavus in particular no longer being set up fodder.</p>

<p>This variant of Braviary is rather self-sufficient, but it finds it challenging to set up against Electric-types and can also be revenge killed by them. A bulky Ground-type such as Seismitoad, Piloswine, or Golurk therefore makes a good partner; they are also capable of taking down Bastiodon and Probopass, which can deal with Braviary with Roar and Power Gem, respectively. Toxic Spikes, and to an extent Spikes, support is very helpful for wearing down Rock-types quicker, as even though Braviary can potentially set up on them, they still pose a threat to Braviary. As a result, Pokemon that learn both moves, such as Garbodor and Scolipede, make good partners, and Braviary can switch into an Earthquake that might be targeted at the former. Finally, Pokemon, generally Normal-types, that struggle against Rock-types but have a means of wearing them down via coverage moves, such as Zangoose, Kangaskhan, or Tauros, appreciate the fact that Braviary can use them to set up on under the right circumstances, although note that Braviary cannot directly switch in in these situations.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Return
move 3: Superpower
move 4: U-turn
item: Choice Band
ability: Defiant
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Equipped with a Choice Band, Braviary becomes one of the most powerful wallbreakers in the tier. To put it into perspective, with the correct move, Braviary is capable of 2HKOing at worst almost every Pokemon in the tier after Stealth Rock, an incredible feat, ensuring almost nothing is safe if Braviary can predict correctly. Brave Bird is the main STAB, easily destroying any Pokemon that does not resist it, and even though the recoil damage can be annoying when in conjunction with Braviary's Stealth Rock weakness, its good coverage makes it preferable to use in most cases. Return is a less powerful, alternative STAB move, but it does have the advantage of not causing recoil damage, making it more optimal to clean the opponent's team with if the need arises. It also hits Electric-types, notably Eelektross and Rotom-S (the latter resists every other move on this set), for neutral damage. Superpower is used in order to deter Rock- and Steel-types from switching into Braviary easily; this ensures that Regirock and the like won't be able to easily wall it as they risk a 2HKO. Finally, U-turn is good for keeping momentum and scouting for switch-ins while still hitting mildly hard.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Despite the fact that the given EVs are fairly straightforward, an alternative spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe with an Adamant nature will get the jump on neutral-natured Samurott and Ludicolo while getting a bit of extra bulk. However, it is usually worth going in at maximum Speed in order to try to outspeed and OHKO opposing Braviary before they do the same back to it, as it can do that even with a Jolly nature. In the rare case Braviary receives a stat drop from an opponent's attack or ability, Defiant will make Braviary almost impossible to wall as a result. Sleep Talk is an interesting option for Braviary to act as sleep fodder to try and power through Grass-types such as Tangela even when it is statused, but unfortunately the most common sleeper is Jynx, which is a Pokemon that can outspeed and OHKO Braviary regardless. However, it's difficult to find a free moveslot for the move, however, as the listed moves are all useful in their own right.</p>

<p>Although Braviary has Superpower to defeat Rock- and Steel-types, they still get a free switch into both of Braviary's STAB moves, meaning Braviary will usually have to predict their switch-in to defeat them. As a result, a good idea would be to partner up Braviary with a Fighting-type such as Sawk that can defeat them. Running Choice Band Sawk in particular means that you can have two incredibly powerful physical attackers that can provide a great deal of offensive pressure. Thanks to Mold Breaker, Sawk can OHKO most Stealth Rock setters as well, something which Braviary likes the absence of. Swellow makes an interesting partner. Similar to the double Dragon strategy in OU, teams may be hard-pressed to deal with two strong Normal / Flying Pokemon, as Braviary can break down their checks while Swellow can finish them off thanks to its high Speed. Finally, Spikes support is suggested in order to wear down walls that might try to survive onslaughts such as Regirock and Metang. Cacturne is an example, and with a Grass STAB it performs decently against Rock-types.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Return
move 3: Superpower
move 4: U-turn
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Defiant
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Despite the fact that Braviary lacks the Speed of other Choice users common in the metagame, such as Primeape or Jynx, it makes up for it by being able to secure KOs much more easily thanks to its high-powered moves and a high Attack stat. In addition, while it will almost never outspeed another Pokemon with a Choice Scarf, it still at least outspeeds Swellow, the fastest common unboosted Pokemon in the tier, so it can still be reliable enough in most situations to revenge kill any unboosted threat. Brave Bird serves as the main STAB move, and even without any boosting item, it still hits hard enough to finish off, if not OHKO, frailer foes, while Return serves as an alternative STAB that doesn't have any recoil. Return is also better for cleaning up the opponent's team, as the lack of recoil ensures that a sweep won't be cut short in these situations. Superpower still hits Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage, but be warned that, without an item like the Choice Band boosting its Attack, it won't hit bulkier Pokemon of this type very hard. Finally, U-turn is useful to gain momentum and scout, especially early-game, and Braviary's Speed will ensure that its U-turn will usually go first.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Adamant nature is preferred on Braviary, as the only Pokemon that it would get the jump on with a positive nature are Electrode, Butterfree at +1, and certain +2 foes. However, Jolly is usable if these, along with other neutral-natured Choice Scarf users that have a base 85 Speed, such as Sawk or Pinsir, are issues, but the power is usually more important. Defiant is once again chosen as the ability, as it is the only ability that will help Braviary, while making Intimidate users such as Tauros unreliable against it. Due to the typical defensive stats of what Superpower hits super effectively, it won't be doing very much damage to them, and even with that considered, Braviary will have to predict their switch-in to hit them, as they take very little damage from its STABs. As a result, a strong Fighting-or Ground-type, such as Sawk or Golurk, can dent them with their STABs and possibly provide offensive pressure to prevent Stealth Rock from going up. Speaking of Stealth Rock, because Braviary can keep momentum with U-turn and will often have to switch in because it is a revenge killer, its weakness to the move can be troubling. A spinner therefore makes a good partner, with Wartortle being a standout example due to it doing well against Rock-types due to its typing. Other Pokemon that can learn U-turn or Volt Switch can be paired up with Braviary in order to create a VoltTurn core. Primeape provides U-turn, and its Fighting STAB makes it able to dent Rock- and Steel-types pretty well.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A Roost + 3 Attacks set with a Life Orb is an interesting option, considering it can allow Braviary to keep itself healthy and switch moves. However, Braviary's Speed issue makes it a bit hard to pull off a Roost despite its bulk. A similar set with an Expert Belt or Sharp Beak can bluff a Choice item if the need arises. Tailwind can patch up Braviary's Speed issue. In particular, a set of 56 HP / 248 Atk / 204 Spe with an Adamant nature with Tailwind, Bulk Up, Brave Bird, Roost, and a Sharp Beak can act as a mixture of other sets and helps against offensive and defensive teams. While this gives Braviary more versatility, it lowers its effectiveness against either offensive or defensive teams. Rock Slide alongside Sheer Force can act as a strong Rock move, but that is practically it, and it is generally unneeded. Heat Wave with the aforementioned ability, with enough Special Attack EVs and a Life Orb, can 2HKO Metang, which is quite possibly the only Pokemon that can wall Braviary. Crush Claw is interesting for a Normal STAB as it can provide Defense drops against the opponent, but Return has quite a bit more Base Power than it. Finally, Braviary's decent defensive stats, instant recovery, and other moves such as Whirlwind and Toxic can amount to a defensive set, but its defensive typing is not stellar.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Braviary can be tough to counter thanks to its Bulk Up set that can mess up typical counters. Metang is the closest that you can get to a counter, as with a bit of investment in Attack, it won't be set up on by Bulk Up Braviary, and its typing and high Defense allow it to take onslaughts and avoid getting 2HKOed by any of its moves. Rock Pokemon with Rock Blast, such as Golem, are generally safe bets against Braviary, only really fearing Choice Band-boosted Superpowers, and they can get through Braviary's Substitutes thanks to the move hitting multiple times. Probopass and Lairon, despite easily falling to a Superpower, are some of the best solutions against the Bulk Up set, as thanks to Power Gem and Roar they cannot be set up on at all, and they 4x resist both of Braviary's STABs. Other Rock-types, such as Carracosta and Regirock, are bulky enough, or in the case of Carracosta, have Solid Rock in order to survive a Superpower if they get hit by one, but with only Stone Edge they can have difficulty against Bulk Up sets. Alomomola can survive attacks thanks to its high Defense and can attempt to stall out Braviary with Wish. However, Alomomola is setup fodder for Bulk Up as a result of it being incapable of breaking Braviary's Substitutes even before Braviary begins boosting. Finally, if all else fails, Electrode is a somewhat reliable revenge killer, outspeeding even Adamant Choice Scarf Braviary without needing one of its own, and Jynx and Zebstrika can revenge kill any set while being capable of using a Choice Scarf of their own for the aforementioned set. Stealth Rock and Brave Bird recoil also wears Braviary down quite a bit over the match, especially Choice variants.</p>
