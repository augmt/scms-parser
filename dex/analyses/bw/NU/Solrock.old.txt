[Overview]

<p>Solrock's mediocre base stats and common weaknesses leave it unable to shine in NU. It is mostly outclassed by fellow Rock-types Golem and Regirock, which are stronger and bulkier. However, some perks do give Solrock a niche; it is best used as a dual screens user on hyper offensive teams, being one of the few Pokemon that can set up screens and Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Solrock can be fit onto teams that want to take advantage of its typing and Levitate to check top threats including Charizard, Kangaskhan, and Tauros, in addition to useful moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Morning Sun.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Solrock has a unique combination of Stealth Rock, dual screens, Explosion, and a decent typing. With its decent Speed and access to these moves, Solrock can fit into hyper offensive teams by quickly setting up the necessary moves without losing momentum. At the same time, the frail setup sweepers on hyper offensive teams appreciate the insurance provided by dual screens to set up.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock is an extremely useful entry hazard to wear down opponents for Solrock's teammates to sweep more easily. When playing with Solrock, it is better to use Stealth Rock early in the game and the screens during mid- to late-game. This is because Solrock does not have time to set up all three at once. It is also better to have the entry hazards up early to weaken the opponent's team from the start and then set up dual screens mid-game when the opponent's team is ready to be swept by a teammate. After Steath Rock and dual screens are set up, Solrock can use Explosion to weaken opponents further and provide a free switch-in to a setup sweeper.</p>

<p>Solrock can utilize Magic Coat to block Taunt, but it does not have a spare moveslot because the four moves listed give Solrock its niche. As teammates, powerful and frail setup sweepers appreciate the insurance provided by dual screens. Swords Dance Pinsir, Belly Drum Linoone, and Swords Dance Zangoose are excellent teammates for this reason. Because Solrock's support fits hyper offensive teams, offensive Pokemon that consistently pressure the opponent to weaken each other's checks and counters are good Pokemon for hyper offense.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Solrock's almost unique typing, ability, and access to Morning Sun and Will-O-Wisp allow it to function as a decent defensive Pokemon in NU. Despite the lack of defensive investment, Solrock can actually still check several Normal- and Flying-types, including Swellow and Kangaskhan, thanks to its Rock typing and Levitate. In addition, Solrock can check most Fire-types, most notably Charizard. Stealth Rock allows Solrock to support its teammates by wearing down opponents; it can set them up on the Normal- and Flying-types that it wall. Will-O-Wisp is a useful move to cripple physical attackers and wear down opponents. Morning Sun is a reliable recovery move that allows Solrock to continuously switch into opponents. These two moves set Solrock apart from other Rock-types. Finally, Rock Slide is Solrock's STAB move to defeat the likes of Charizard and Swellow.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A specially defensive set is recommended as it allows Solrock to take any hit from Choice Specs Charizard at full health. Physically defensive spreads are generally done better by the physically bulkier Regirock, but they can be considered. Solrock can utilize Baton Pass to escape Pursuit trappers and bring teammates in safely, but because it is illegal with Morning Sun, that is not recommended. Magic Coat can be considered to deflect Taunt and entry hazards, but Solrock hardly has a spare moveslot and loses to most entry hazard users anyway. Roselia is a decent teammate for Solrock as they share decent defensive synergy and can both set up entry hazards to support the team.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Solrock can potentially run an offensive set with moves such as Zen Headbutt, Stone Edge, and Earthquake, but such a set is often done better by the likes of Golem and Rampardos. Similarly, while Solrock has a decent special movepool comprising Psychic, Earth Power, and Fire Blast, a horrendous Special Attack stat makes this unviable. Solrock can potentially run a full Baton Pass set with boosting moves such as Rock Polish and Cosmic Power. Other gimmicky but interesting options in Solrock's movepool include Sunny Day, Trick Room, and Gravity, although they are often better done by other Pokemon.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Ground-types do a good job at stopping Solrock as they resist every common move that it runs; Seismitoad gets a special mention because it does not fear burns from Will-O-Wisp as much and has a super effective Water-type STAB. Special attacking Samurott can do a huge chunk of damage to Solrock without fearing Will-O-Wisp, as do most other Water-types. Misdreavus is another good counter as it is immune to Explosion and has Taunt to shut down Solrock. Speaking of which, Pokemon with Taunt can do an admirable job at shutting down Solrock because it rarely invests EVs in Attack. Gurdurr, particularly Guts variants, can switch into Solrock and defeat it with Drain Punch. Exeggutor also does a good job at beating Solrock, especially LumRest variants that shrug off burns. RestTalk users can use Solrock as setup fodder; Klang is a perfect example because it resists every move Solrock commonly runs. As for checks, strong attackers such as Choice Band Sawk can OHKO Solrock, assuming it has not set up screens or used Will-O-Wisp.</p>
