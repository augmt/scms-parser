[Overview]

<p>One of the worst things about Christmas has to be the mall Santas. Every year these vapid tokens of an overly commercialized holiday pop up all over like clockwork, intending to spread joy and cheer but doing nothing but delivering lackadaisical performances and disappointment. Many a kid's holidays have been spoiled by these mundane avatars of Kris Kringle in what can only be described as a ritualistic assassination of childhood innocence. Truly, they are a blight upon our cultural landscape, and only when they are washed from our social consciousness can some form of dignity begin to return to Christmas.</p>

<p>Everything stated in the above paragraph also applies to Delibird.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Every day Delibird is hustlin', and this set is no exception. The combination of Choice Band and Hustle allows Delibird's Attack to approach barely usable levels, and then the fun begins. Hustle makes Delibird miss its target more than fellow frosty bird Sarah Palin misses the point, so the never-miss Aerial Ace will be its best friend. Ice Shard bypasses Delibird's mediocre Speed, but if you're feeling particularly foolhardy and confident that Delibird will survive the turn, why not let it fire off an Ice Punch, the stronger STAB option on this set. Focus Punch and Brick Break are there to irritate the Rock- and Steel-types that are the bane of Delibird's existence, but it's just delaying the inevitable conclusion of Delibird being pulverized into a pile of red snow.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Much like the average New York gigolo, this Delibird will be coming and going a lot, and unfortunately its typing means that it gets a whopping 50% of its health clipped away by Stealth Rock every time it switches in, so Rapid Spin support is essential. Wartortle is probably the most adequate choice, as it doesn't double up on any weaknesses with Delibird. Spinda also learns Rapid Spin, and could be partnered with Delibird in an effort to psyche out your opponent. If the team looks this bad, then the strategy must be immaculate, right?</p> 

<p>Seed Bomb could be used in the last slot to bring discomfiture to Water-types that switch in hoping to wall Delibird's icy assaults; keep in mind, however, that Delibird will bomb harder than any seeds ever could. Adamant could be used over Jolly for an additional boost in power, but the idea of running anything but Jolly on this wintertime courier just seems blasphemous.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Delibird's Special Attack is better than its Attack before the Hustle boost, so a Choice Specs set is conceivable, but if Delibird is not being an ice-cold hustler with its Hustle boost, then there's really no point in having it on your team at all. In a cruel twist of fate, Delibird learns Rapid Spin, giving it the dubious honor of being the worst Rapid Spin user in the game. Delibird's signature move, Present, can be used for some novelty value, but let's face it, using Delibird is in itself already a gift to your opponent.</p>

<p>Fool people into thinking Delibird is a pre-evolution of Articuno and sneak it into Little Cup to see if it will do well there (it won't).</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Rock-types, Steel-types, Water-types, and even Fire-types can all switch into Delibird without much fear and threaten to tear through its wafer-thin defenses with their respective STAB attacks. Delibird is incredibly weak to Stealth Rock, so keeping it on the field is guaranteed to spell Delibird's demise; alternatively, kick some pebbles into its face and bid it adieu.</p>
