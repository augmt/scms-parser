[Overview]

<p>While Phione was a threatening Rain Dance sweeper in DPP, it is almost never used in the tier. The only reason Phione is worth using is its adored Hydration ability, and with Rest and U-turn in its arsenal, Phione makes for a decent Rain Dance setter. The only strategy Phione should attempt is to set up Rain Dance, heal excess damage with Rest, and U-turn to a rain sweeper; it doesn't have any other notable traits to take advantage of and remain successful.</p>

move 2: U-turn

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the only set that Phione can effectively pull off; it combines all of Phione's strong points into a simple strategy: providing Rain Dance for a rain sweeper. Thanks to Hydration, Phione has reliable healing in rain with Rest, allowing it to maintain longevity during the match. U-turn is very useful when switching into a rain sweeper, as it provides a safe switch. Rest is a great healing move when Rain Dance is active, as it heals Phione to full HP. While Phione has very little offensive presence, Scald should be used when Phione cannot switch out or when you're positive it can score a KO. Not only does it prevent Phione from being complete Taunt bait, but it's a great STAB move that has a 30% burn chance, which fares well against physical attackers such as Sawk. However, Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Pokemon, such as Alomomola and Lickilicky.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Damp Rock is the key to this set's success, increasing Rain Dance's longevity, giving rain sweepers more time to sweep. Phione's EV spread focuses on its physical bulk; a Bold nature maximizes its Defense, and in conjunction with Rest, this keeps Phione alive as long as possible. Phione invests no Speed EVs to make U-turn as slow as possible, switching after most opponents and getting a sweeper in for free. To this end, a Relaxed nature can be used, as it gives Phione an even slower U-turn while giving it a chance to OHKO Jynx on the switch after Stealth Rock damage. You can even lower Phione's Speed IVs to allow an even slower U-turn to rain sweepers. If Toxic is being used, it's advised to use an Impish nature to slightly strengthen U-turn. Surf can be used over Scald for more power, but it still won't do much damage off of Phione's pitiful Special Attack, while Scald's burn chance is useful.</p>

<p>Since this set is specifically made to set up Rain Dance for rain sweepers, having them as partners is mandatory. Ludicolo, Gorebyss, Swanna, and Seismitoad are prime examples of sweepers who appreciate Rain Dance support. Backup rain inducers are always helpful; Electrode, Swanna, Volbeat, and Liepard are great partners in that regard. This set is easily forced out by Taunt users, especially those Phione can't really harm, such as Misdreavus. Regice and Samurott can get rid of Misdreavus with their powerful special attacks; Samurott's STAB moves also get a boost from Rain Dance.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Phione has a very scarce movepool, and most options it does wield aren't very successful. An offensive set with Life Orb is viable, but Phione doesn't have the strength to utilize it well. Choice items can be used to increase Phione's Attack or Speed, but it loses too much momentum and doesn't have those qualities to take advantage of. Outside of this, Acid Armor, Charm, and Safeguard are some of the best options Phione has. The fact that these aren't remotely viable really shows how bad a movepool Phione has.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Phione is very easy to counter due to its average bulk and offenses. Any strong Electric- or Grass-type, such as Ludicolo, Roselia, Eelektross, and Rotom-S, can deal with Phione, but physical attackers must be wary of Scald's burn. Gardevoir, Regice, and Musharna can take any of Phione's attacks and retaliate with powerful moves of their own. Most Pokemon see Phione as setup bait; Substitute users such as Braviary can get Substitute up on Phione with ease. Many other Pokemon&mdash;even Butterfree&mdash; can set up on Phione.</p>

<p>Pokemon that don't mind being inflicted by status, such as Gurdurr, Shed Skin Dragonair, Swellow, and Ursaring, can handle Phione quite easily, not fearing Scald or Toxic. Taunt users such as Misdreavus and Liepard can shut Phione down and force it to switch out. Any wall that isn't weak to Phione's STAB move can sponge its attacks; Roselia, Tangela, and Regice are prime examples. In short, many Pokemon in the NU tier can handle Phione easily since it can't fight back, but its main goal is to set up Rain Dance, and it usually fulfills that role well. With that in mind, countering Phione isn't usually as important as countering the rain sweepers that follow it, as they are much more threatening than Phione itself.</p>
