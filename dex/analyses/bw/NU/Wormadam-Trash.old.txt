[Overview]

<p>Even though a Steel typing is very attractive in the NU tier, Wormadam-S sadly cannot keep up with the metagame. It exerts no offensive pressure and relies on Leftovers for recovery; it is easy bait for opposing setup sweepers. In fact, the only niche Wormadam-S has over other Steel-types such as Metang and Probopass is its Bug typing, which allows it to avoid the KO from many Ground- and Fighting-type attacks. While that is a nice perk, the only thing Wormadam-S will be able to do to contribute to its team is to set up Stealth Rock and wall specific Pokemon such as Kangaskhan.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Wormadam-S fits best on stall and balanced teams. It primarily sets up Stealth Rock, providing its team with a reliable damage source. Stealth Rock also limits the amount of times Fire-types can switch into it, which is nice considering that Fire-types counter this set. After setting up, Wormadam-S spends the rest of its time crippling opponents with Toxic. It also uses Protect to rack up Toxic damage and Leftovers recovery. Gyro Ball is the STAB attack of choice as Wormadam-S needs the highest damage output possible to leave any sort of dent in the opponent.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Wormadam-S uses a Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs is to power up Gyro Ball. Wormadam-S can use a more specially defensive spread to counter Psychic-types better. Anticipation is the most helpful ability because it warns Wormadam-S of any surprising coverage moves the opponent might carry. Iron Head is an option instead of Gyro Ball because it has more PP, but the lack of power is disappointing. Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves, such as Seismitoad, Camerupt, and Carracosta, make great defensive partners for Wormadam-S, and Camerupt can also phaze Pokemon trying to set up on it. Toxic Spikes support from Garbodor is very helpful to Wormadam-S as it aids in its stalling capabilities. Roselia can also set them up reliably, but stacking Fire-type weaknesses is not a safe idea. Lastly, Wish support is common in stall and balanced playstyles from teammates such as Lickilicky, Alomomola, and Audino and keeps Wormadam-S alive longer.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Due to Wormadam-S's sparse movepool, there are not many other options for it to consider. Sucker Punch can be used, but with Wormadam-S's low Attack, it won't do satisfactory damage. Endeavor is another cool option, but Wormadam-S is too slow to use it effectively. Signal Beam and Flash Cannon are two options for attacking moves, but these moves are underwhelming with Wormadam-S's low power. Lastly, Wormadam-S can set up weather, but Pokemon with better Speed and abilities are more reliable for the job.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fire-type Pokemon are great counters to Wormadam-S, with popular examples being Charizard, Simisear, and Camerupt. Strong, neutral STAB attacks usually 2HKO Wormadam-S as well; Water-, Electric-, Ground-, and Fighting-types such as Ludicolo, Eelektross, Golurk, and Sawk can 2HKO with their respective STAB moves. Poison- and Steel-types can switch in and set up entry hazards or boosting moves without fearing Toxic. Taunt users such as Samurott, Serperior, and Mandibuzz also mess up Wormadam-S's antics. Lastly, Pokemon that aren't weak to Gyro Ball and have Substitute, such as Braviary and Gorebyss, can easily set up on Wormadam-S and sweep the opposing team.</p>
