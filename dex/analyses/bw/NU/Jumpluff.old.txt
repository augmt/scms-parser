[Overview]

<p>Jumpluff was always known in previous generations as a fast pivot that could annoy the opposition with its many support moves, such as Encore and Sleep Powder. These days, it can use these moves to ease setup for its surprisingly potent Swords Dance set. Setup opportunities are not all that Jumpluff's support moves offer, as it can also act as a dedicated supporting Pokemon; its Sunny Day and pivot sets are also very effective. However, while other Grass-types in the tier cannot boast the high Speed stat that Jumpluff claims, it still falls short of many of them due to its common weaknesses to Fire-, Ice-, and Rock-type attacks, as well as its crippling Stealth Rock weakness.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Acrobatics
move 3: Seed Bomb
move 4: Sleep Powder / Encore
item: Flying Gem
ability: Chlorophyll
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is by far Jumpluff's best offensive set. Even without the help of Chlorophyll, Jumpluff can outspeed the majority of the tier, and its decent coverage lets it hit most of NU for at least neutral damage. Acrobatics is Jumpluff's strongest Flying-type STAB move, and its power is increased further when the Flying Gem is used. Seed Bomb is a Grass-type STAB move that hits hard against Rock-types that resist Flying-type attacks. Swords Dance boosts Jumpluff's Attack to acceptable levels and is the center point of the set. Finally, Sleep Powder and Encore both allow Jumpluff to set up more easily but in different ways; specifically, Sleep Powder allows Jumpluff to set up while the opponent is immobilized by sleep, while Encore can force switches, gaining momentum and allowing Jumpluff to set up.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The listed EV spread ensures that Jumpluff can Speed tie with Tauros and other max Speed Jumpluff. Substitute can be used in the final moveslot to allow Jumpluff to avoid status conditions and set up safely. Sunny Day support can benefit Jumpluff, as it is able to outspeed the entire unboosted tier with Chlorophyll. Volbeat and Liepard, both of which can also offer U-turn support to Jumpluff, are great sun inducers. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Garbodor, Regirock, and Scolipede is vital for allowing Jumpluff to secure extra KOs, such as an OHKO on Tangela after Spikes and Stealth Rock damage. Gurdurr is a great partner for Jumpluff, as it likes the support Jumpluff offers to help it set up with Bulk Up, and it threatens Sap Sipper users and Steel-types, two types of Pokemon that trouble Jumpluff, with Mach Punch and Drain Punch. Hard hitting Ground- and Fighting-types, such as Sawk and Seismitoad, can weaken Steel-types, specifically Metang and Bastiodon, both of which threaten Jumpluff. Finally, Alomomola makes a solid partner, as it is able to take priority and wall threats that Jumpluff can't defeat even with Swords Dance, such as Piloswine and Kangaskhan.</p>

[SET]
name: Support Pivot
move 1: Encore

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With this set, Jumpluff is more than capable of crippling opponents with its status moves, then switching into a sweeper with U-turn. With Jumpluff's high Speed stat, it can serve as a quick pivot with U-turn to bring a teammate in after the foe is crippled. Encore allows Jumpluff to lock slower Pokemon into a move that won't harm its team and can force switches. Sleep Powder puts potential switch-ins to sleep, giving Jumpluff the chance to bring in a potent sweeper. Finally, Leech Seed gives Jumpluff and its teammates a source of recovery and wears down the checks and counters to its teammates.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>248 HP EVs allow Jumpluff to switch into Stealth Rock four times at full HP, and the rest of the spread focuses on making Jumpluff as fast as possible. Protect is a viable option that allows Jumpluff to collect additional HP from Leech Seed, but it cannot find a place in the moveset without sacrificing something more useful overall. Toxic can be used to wear down the opponents more quickly and cripple them further, but it has trouble fitting into the moveset as well. Substitute is an option to attempt a SubSeed set, but the strategy in itself is mediocre. Giga Drain, while being rather weak, could replace Leech Seed to prevent Jumpluff from being Taunt bait, but the majority of Taunt users are slower than Jumpluff and are therefore not that big of a threat.</p>

<p>Because Jumpluff can cripple the opponent for its teammates, good partners are sweepers who appreciate that. Charizard in particular does well against opposing Grass-types and Jynx. Entry hazard support is great to have with Jumpluff, as it usually forces a lot of switches. Entry hazard setters, such as Scolipede, Garbodor, and Metang, are good options. Gothorita is also a good partner, as the momentum Jumpluff gains can be used to its advantage, allowing it to trap and KO foes Jumpluff cripples before they can switch out. Gurdurr is a great partner, as it can set up Bulk Up very efficiently thanks to Jumpluff, and it threatens Sap Sipper users and Steel-type Pokemon with its Fighting-type STAB. Because U-turn lets Jumpluff bring in a teammate on a crippled opponent, Pokemon that like having a free setup turn, such as Zangoose, Gorebyss, Ursaring, and Samurott, really appreciate the support Jumpluff offers.</p>

[SET]
name: Sunny Day
move 1: Sunny Day
move 2: Sleep Powder
move 3: Encore
move 4: Memento
item: Heat Rock
ability: Chlorophyll
nature: Jolly
evs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Jumpluff can fit into sun teams nicely with its ability, Chlorophyll, making it a great candidate for a sun inducer. Sunny Day allows Jumpluff to set up sun and provide support for sun sweepers, such as Exeggutor and Charizard. Sleep Powder can put foes to sleep and potentially allow sun users to sweep the adversary. Encore is also used to allow Jumpluff's partners to have less trouble setting up and lock walls into a less desirable move. Memento sacrifices Jumpluff to weaken the opponent, allowing the following partner to come in for free and set up more easily.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Heat Rock increases the duration of Sunny Day, and as such, should be the only item used on this set. The given EV spread allows Jumpluff to switch into Stealth Rock four times at full HP and gives it as much Speed as possible. When Jumpluff is in the sun, Chlorophyll allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted tier. Leaf Guard could be used if status is really hindering Jumpluff's capabilities, but in most cases, Chlorophyll is the superior option. U-turn is an alternative over Memento, allowing Jumpluff to set up sun multiple times over the course of a match.</p>

<p>Sun sweepers, such as Exeggutor, Charizard, Victreebel, and Rapidash, are great partners for Jumpluff, as they can take advantage of the sun it offers to capitalize on their respective abilities. Other sun inducers, such as Regirock and Volbeat, should be used along with Jumpluff so that it doesn't have all the weight on its shoulders and to have a reliable backup. Prankster Liepard is a big threat to this set, as it can Taunt Jumpluff before Jumpluff can cripple it. Pokemon that can deal with this threat, such as Sawk and Gurdurr, are great partners. Gurdurr in particular is an excellent partner for Jumpluff, as it can deal with Sap Sipper users and Steel-types, two types of Pokemon Jumpluff despises.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Aromatherapy turns Jumpluff into a fast cleric for its team, but not only does Aromatherapy have problems fitting into a moveslot, but there are also better clerics out there, such as Lickilicky, to take Jumpluff's place. Synthesis can be used over Leech Seed and Giga Drain for instant recovery, and it works even better in sun, where it heals 66% of Jumpluff's HP. Amnesia and Cotton Guard are alternative moves to increase Jumpluff's defenses, but even after a boost, Jumpluff is still quite frail. Reflect offers even more support, but because Jumpluff lacks Light Screen, it isn't worth taking a moveslot. Stun Spore can be used in place of Sleep Powder to reduce the Speed of faster opponents, but because it isn't the most reliable way to cripple opponents, Sleep Powder is usually the superior option. Finally, an all-out specially attacking set in the sun can be utilized, but Jumpluff's Special Attack is rather poor, and it doesn't have a way to boost it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bulky Pokemon in general, such as Lickilicky and Misdreavus, can typically beat Jumpluff. Electric-types resist Jumpluff's main STAB move and can hit it hard with Hidden Power Ice or an Electric-type attack. In particular, Rotom-S resists both of Jumpluff's STABs. Piloswine puts fear into Jumpluff's heart with its priority Ice Shard, which decimates it. Jumpluff can be easily revenge killed by faster threats, such as Swellow and Choice Scarf users, including Rotom-S and Jynx. Pokemon with the ability Vital Spirit, most notably Primeape and Electabuzz, can switch into Jumpluff much more easily, as they do not fear Sleep Powder. However, it's a risky move for some of them, as Jumpluff can seize the opportunity and, for example, OHKO Primeape with Acrobatics if it is running the Swords Dance set.</p>

<p>There are also a variety of Pokemon that can check Jumpluff well. Steel-types, such as Probopass, Bastiodon, and Metang, resist Acrobatics and take Seed Bomb rather well, thus checking the Swords Dance set fairly easily. They can be crippled with ease by Jumpluff's other sets, however. Sawsbuck and Miltank with Sap Sipper can check Jumpluff quite well, but Sawsbuck must be wary of Acrobatics from the Swords Dance set. Other Grass-types, such as Serperior and Tangela, take little damage from Jumpluff bar Acrobatics and are immune to Leech Seed, but they must be wary of Sleep Powder. Taunt can shut down all of Jumpluff's sets, but be aware that Jumpluff can retaliate back if it is running the Swords Dance set. Without Sleep Powder (or when Sleep Clause is activated), Jumpluff is more easy to handle because, even at +2 Attack, it is fairly weak. With the exception of the Swords Dance set, Jumpluff prefers to support its teammates, so you should focus on not letting its partners come in safely, as it is nearly impossible to prevent Jumpluff from doing its job.</p>
