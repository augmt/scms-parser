[Overview]

<p>Mesprit often gets the short end of the stick when competing against the other members of the Lake Trio, as the much faster Azelf and the bulkier yet faster Uxie are often seen as superior choices. As such, it finds itself stuck in Smogon's basement tier--BW NU. However, this sentencing is a blessing in disguise for the endower of emotions; for in NU, Mesprit is king. With great all-around stats, backed by a wide movepool of excellent offensive and support moves alike, this Pokemon is certainly a force to be reckoned with; a jack of all trades, if you will. While its mono-Psychic typing is an unpleasant trait, Mesprit's unpredictability and versatility more than make up for this shortcoming.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Mesprit's flagship set in BW NU. Despite Mesprit's unpredictability, the SubCM set is what most players prepare for, simply because it is consistently the most dangerous set. Any good NU team must have at least one Pokemon prepared to bear the burden of taking it on. This set is the premier NU bulky sweeper, and for good reason. With excellent bulk, decent Speed, and solid Special Attack, it becomes a pain to deal with if given an opportunity to set up. Substitute further complicates things as it protects Mesprit from status and potential revenge killers, allowing it to shred offensive and stall teams alike.</p>

<p>As stated before, Substitute offers protection against harmful status, cushions Mesprit from powerful attacks, and eases prediction. Calm Mind not only buffs Mesprit's already impressive Special Attack, it also increases its Special Defense, making those Substitutes even more difficult to break. Psychic is the STAB move of choice for the extra power, as there aren't many heavyweight special walls in NU. However, Psyshock can be used instead to dispatch Licklicky and Cryogonal. Either Thunderbolt or Ice Beam rounds off this set, with the former providing coverage against the likes of Probopass, and the latter providing coverage against the likes of Exeggutor and Cacturne.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Leftovers is the preferred item as it mitigates the HP lost to making Substitutes. Either Hidden Power Fighting or Shadow Ball can be considered in the fourth slot for better coverage, but both lack the power of Thunderbolt or Ice Beam, and also leave Mesprit walled by a number of Pokemon. Mesprit's Speed isn't exactly optimal, so a bulkier spread is utilized, while maximum Special Attack and a Modest nature ensures Mesprit hits like a truck. Alternatively, a 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD spread with a Bold nature can be used to maximize Mesprit's physical bulk, allowing it to set up against foes such as Throh and Hitmonchan.</p>

<p>As with any other Psychic-type, Mesprit loathes Dark-types. Sawk makes an excellent teammate, easily disposing of most Dark-types while simultaneously breaking through Cryogonal and Probopass, who wall Mesprit depending on its choice of moves. The pink pixie reciprocates by bringing down bulky Poison-types, such as Weezing, for Sawk. Skuntank is a problematic Dark-type with a secondary Poison typing that allows it to take Close Combats. Quagsire, Golem, and Torterra can all do it in with a powerful Ground STAB. Quagsire is a wall among walls, as it outright ignores Mesprit's stat boosts, so it is important to pack a reliable Grass-type, such as Tangela or Torterra, to deal with the blue amphibian. Of course, with Substitute, Mesprit can outstall a number of its checks with Toxic Spikes support. Unfortunately, Garbodor is the only viable option for setting up Toxic Spikes.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Now, what's a Mesprit analysis without a support set? Here is where the Sinnoh legendary trio's traditional utility set emerges. While Azelf and Uxie have stolen its thunder in higher tiers, Mesprit has no such competition in NU. It has the bulk to tank many hits, the movepool to run a variety of support moves, and enough attacking prowess to remain competent offensively. What more could you ask for? Thanks to these aforementioned traits, Mesprit can consistently set up Stealth Rock. U-turn is another popular choice to scout the opponent's switch-in, escape unfavorable match-ups, or simply to gain momentum. Thunder Wave and Toxic allow Mesprit to shut down troublesome sweepers. Psychic rounds off the set, as it gives Mesprit enough firepower to remain useful even after it has exhausted its support movepool.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Due to Stealth Rock's wide distribution, Mesprit can opt to use a different support move, with Rain Dance, Sunny Day, Trick Room, and Safeguard all being excellent options. Zen Headbutt can be used instead of Psychic if you prefer a physical STAB, although the slight drop in power and imperfect accuracy can leave you pulling your hair out at times. The current EV spread offers optimal overall bulk, with a slight bias towards Defense to take powerful Close Combats from Pokemon such as Sawk. A specially defensive spread is certainly a viable option.</p>

<p>Despite Mesprit's excellent defensive stats, it is easily devoured by powerful Dark- and Bug-types such as Absol and Pinsir. Powerful Fighting- and Bug-types, such as Sawk and Pinsir, can be used to remove Dark-types from the equation; powerful Rock- and Fire-types, such as Golem and Camerupt, can be used to deal with Bug-types.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice
move 1: Psychic
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Trick / U-turn
item: Choice Scarf / Choice Specs
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Now, Mesprit's Special Attack and Speed are decent, but not otherworldly. Solution? Make it otherworldly! With a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs attached, Mesprit loses the flexibility of changing moves, but becomes a much more fearsome attacker. Psychic is the most powerful move on this set thanks to STAB, and due to the lack of Psychic resists in NU, it can be spammed mindlessly once Dark-types have been exorcised. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam are both useful coverage moves, allowing Mesprit to bring down Psychic resists, such as Exeggutor. As with any other Choice item user, Trick is an excellent option, allowing Mesprit to cripple troublesome walls such as Probopass. U-turn is another viable option to scout opposing switch-ins and gain momentum.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread maximizes Speed and Special Attack, while the Timid nature ensures at least a Speed tie with other positive base 80s. A bulkier spread can be used, but that will only detract from Mesprit's offensive capabilities. Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting can be used instead to offer better coverage, although this is a moot point for Mesprit as it'll usually be locked into one move.</p>

<p>Careful prediction is obviously the key to using this set; however, Dark- and Bug-types will lick their chops whenever Mesprit comes out, as they can come in and force it out. A powerful Fighting- or Bug-type, such as Gurdurr or Armaldo, can deal with Dark-types, while a powerful Fire- or Rock-type, such as Magmortar or Regirock, can crush the Bug-types. A number of special walls, such as Lickilicky and Probopass, can pose problems regardless, so it is advisable to carry a powerful physical attacker, such as Sawk.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Shadow Ball / Thunderbolt
move 4: Hidden Power Fighting / Ice Beam
item: Life Orb
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although SubCM is undoubtedly Mesprit's flagship set, that is not to say that an all-out offensive Calm Mind set does not have merit. While Substitute is useful for many situations, this set trades that utility for coverage, speed, and power. It still possesses decent bulk, and can easily find itself an opportunity to set up. Calm Mind is, of course, the most important move on this set, driving Mesprit's modestly high Special Attack to unimaginable heights. Psychic is the STAB move of choice, and the chance of a Special Defense drop further increases Mesprit's offensive potency. Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting provide the best coverage, as these two moves hit almost every Pokemon that resists Psychic for super effective damage. On the other hand, Thunderbolt and Ice Beam still offers excellent neutral coverage, and doesn't force Mesprit to use a 30 Speed IV.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Without Substitute, Mesprit has no reason to invest in bulk, and can afford to invest in maximum Speed and a Timid nature, although Mesprit still won't be winning a gold in the 100 meter dash. Life Orb is the item of choice, and with maximum Special Attack investment, Mesprit can punch through some of the bulkiest of walls. However, a Lum Berry can be used instead to cure Mesprit of status, as you never know when a surprise Thunder Wave could cut its sweep short.</p>

<p>If you opt for the Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting combination, consider using a spread of 36 HP / 252 SpA / 220 Spe to outpace Absol, as Hidden Power Fighting forces imperfect Speed IVs upon Mesprit. With Calm Mind, Life Orb, and Hidden Power Fighting, Mesprit can defeat variants of Absol that do not carry Sucker Punch. A Modest nature can be used instead, but this only exacerbates Mesprit's Speed issues. Psyshock can be used instead of Psychic to deal with Cryogonal and Lickilicky, but the drop in power is usually not worth it.</p>

<p>As discussed before, bring along Pokemon such as Sawk, Quagsire, and Golem to exterminate Absol, Skuntank, and the like. Quagsire remains one of Mesprit's greatest foes, so be sure to pack a reliable Grass-type to wipe that smug look off its face.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Healing Wish
move 4: Psychic / U-turn
item: Light Clay
nature: Bold / Impish
evs: 252 HP / 176 Def / 80 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>"And in display C we have the third of the Sinnoh legendary trio dual screens users." That's how most people look at Mesprit, due to its inferior Speed. That being said, Mesprit has one trick up its sleeve that its upper tier siblings do not have: Healing Wish. This move allows Mesprit to rejuvenate a battered sweeper and turn the tides of the game in your favor. Not only does Healing Wish completely cure the recipient of all damage and status ailments, it also gives them a safe switch-in. Reflect and Light Screen are, of course, required on this set. Many powerful attackers turn into untouchable behemoths behind the safety of dual screens. Psychic ensures Mesprit is not Taunt bait while simultaneously providing it with decent offense. On the other hand, U-turn can be used to gain momentum if you don't want to use Healing Wish quite yet.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Unlike its offensive sets, this set does not require much support, because it's usually the one providing the support, and what a fine job it does. The possibilities are endless. You could use powerful set up sweepers, such as Absol, Samurott, and Altaria, who can use the screens to grab an easy boost. You could use slow, heavy hitting tanks, such as Regirock and Exeggutor, who can take anything and fire off their powerful attacks behind screens. Now, the few Pokemon that trouble this strategy are Taunt users and Dark-types with Pursuit. However, this set will usually be paired with Sawk and other powerful attackers who can easily take out whatever seems to be bothering Mesprit.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>With such a wide and varied movepool, it is not surprising that Mesprit can run a number of successful unorthodox sets. The most prominent of these is the Trick Room set. Not only does this bypass Mesprit's Speed issues, it also allows other slow, heavy hitters to get the jump on the opponent's frail sweepers. The apparition from Lake Verity is more than capable of imposing itself on opposing walls thanks to its base 105 Special Attack. Speaking of Special Attack, Mesprit can opt to use Charge Beam in place of Calm Mind and Thunderbolt, which would open up a moveslot for another coverage move. However, Calm Mind is useful for augmenting Mesprit's decent special bulk, while Charge Beam lacks Thunderbolt's initial power. One trait that's often overlooked is Mesprit's base 105 Attack. With a movepool consisting of Zen Headbutt, Fire Punch, Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, U-turn, and Acrobatics, Mesprit can function as anything from a Choice Band attacker to an acrobat with a Flying Gem. Rounding off Mesprit's support movepool are useful moves such as Rain Dance, Sunny Day, and Safeguard.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>A Mesprit matched up against a Skuntank just reeks of the stench of defeat. Not only is Skuntank immune to Mesprit's Psychic STAB, its secondary Poison typing means Mesprit cannot hit it for super effective damage with Hidden Power Fighting. On the other hand, Skuntank has no trouble decimating Mesprit with moves such as Sucker Punch, Pursuit, and Crunch. Absol can deal with Mesprit in a similar manner, although it must watch out for Hidden Power Fighting on the switch. Powerful Bug-types, such as Pinsir and Armaldo, can chop up the harbinger of emotions with powerful X-Scissors. Armaldo doubles as a check to the support variant thanks to Rapid Spin. Quagsire can take on any Calm Mind set, as it outright ignores the boosts thanks to Unaware, imbuing frustration into Mesprit with its dopey stare. Sturdy special walls, such as Probopass, Lickilicky, and Cryogonal, can all take on variants that lack Hidden Power Fighting or Psyshock.</p>
