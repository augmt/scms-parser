[Overview]

<p>Wormadam is just another outclassed Pokemon in NU. Despite its decent bulk, Wormadam suffers from a Stealth Rock weakness, exploitable defensive typing, limited offensive movepool, and subpar Speed. In addition, Wormadam's drawbacks make it setup bait for many sweepers, further limiting its potential in battle. Wormadam's situational defensive typing does allow it to check threats such as Ludicolo, special Samurott, and Gardevoir, but Roselia and specially defensive Ludicolo do the same and offer their team more utility. However, Wormadam's okay mixed bulk and Bug typing gives it a slight niche, as it can also check certain physically inclined threats such as Golurk.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Wormadam functions decently well on balanced teams, serving as a Water- and Grass-type check. Due to its low offensive stats, Toxic is Wormadam's most reliable source of damage. Protect can be used to rack up Leftovers recovery, stall for Toxic damage, and scout for super effective moves, or Synthesis can be used for more reliable recovery. Giga Drain hits the Water- and Ground-type Pokemon Wormadam walls super effectively while granting it some nifty recovery. Wormadam's niche over other specially defensive Grass-types is its STAB Signal Beam, which allows it to hit many more Pokemon, especially Grass- and Psychic-types, super effectively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A physically defensive spread is viable to better check Sawk and Golurk, but Wormadam's Rock- and Flying-type weaknesses leave it easily exploitable by many physical attackers. Hidden Power Rock is an option to hit the Fire- and Flying-types that can wall this set; Hidden Power Ground can hit the Steel- and Poison-types that do the same. Wormadam really appreciates Toxic Spikes support to speed up its walling process; Garbodor is the best option as it synergizes well with Wormadam, unlike Roselia. Rock-types such as Golurk and Regirock make great partners as they resist both of Wormadam's 4x weaknesses, Fire and Flying, and Wormadam can take most Fighting-, Ground-, Grass-, and Water-type attacks aimed at them. Steel-types such as Probopass also make good partners because they cover Wormadam's Ice-, Flying-, Bug-, and Poison-type weaknesses. Lastly, Choice Band Sawk, Taunt Misdreavus, and offensive Seismitoad can keep Stealth Rock off the field, drastically increasing Wormadam's longevity.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>RestTalk is an option for Wormadam to deal with status, which greatly hinders its longevity in battle. Wormadam can also go offensive with Growth, Leaf Storm, Signal Beam, Psychic, and/or Shadow Ball, but it is outclassed by sweepers with better offensive stats and Speed. Psych Up is an option so Wormadam can check threats such as Calm Mind Musharna, but it is too situational to be effective. Wormadam has access to Swagger, but it is too luck-reliant to count on. Lastly, Wormadam can set up weather, but Pokemon with better abilities and typings are more suited for the job.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Wormadam is very easy to handle in battle. First off, any Fire- or Flying-type can switch in on Wormadam's STAB attacks and KO with its own. Most Ice-, Bug-, Rock-, and Poison-type attacks will do satisfactory damage to Wormadam as well. Steel- and Poison-types are immune to Toxic and can sponge all of Wormadam's attacks. Even Choice Band Sawk's Close Combat 2HKOes Wormadam, showing how vulnerable its Defense stat is. Stealth Rock is a good check to Wormadam, as it limits the amount of times Wormadam can switch in. Status also hinders it, so any Pokemon with Toxic is a check. Lastly, clerics such as Lickilicky and Audino eliminate the poison Wormadam spreads.</p>
