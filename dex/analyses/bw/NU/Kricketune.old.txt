[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Unless you use all of dual screens, Memento, and Tailwind support, Kricketune really doesn't have a snow ball's chance in hell of sweeping. Although, a Life Orb-boosted Bug Bite does 2HKO physically defensive Musharna and OHKOes at +2. Brick Break is for Golem and Regirock, and Return is there for those dastardly Fire- and Flying-types. If that doesn't suit your taste, Night Slash can be used instead to surprise Misdreavus and Golurk.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Perish Song, Taunt, and Substitute can be used for some hilarity against exceptionally slow defensive teams. Aerial Ace hits other Bug-types slightly harder than the rest of Kricketune's moves. Knock Off gets a Technician boost and removes Misdreavus's Eviolite.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Please, just don't switch Musharna into Kricketune and you'll be in good shape.</p>
