[Overview]

<p>Metang finds a niche thanks to its ability to act as a reliable counter to many Psychic- and Normal-type Pokemon in the tier. Thanks to its decent bulk, which is enhanced further by Eviolite, Metang makes excellent use of its defensive typing to take on many of the offensive Pokemon in the tier, most notably Kangaskhan, Zangoose, Braviary, Serperior, and Musharna. Unfortunately, Metang has difficulty staying around for long due to its lack of recovery and the abundance of Ground- and Fire-type attacks in the tier. Metang's STAB moves lack coverage and have average power, which forces it to rely on Toxic to inflict damage against many common opponents.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>One glance at Metang's stats might suggest that it is suited to act as a defensive wall, but underestimate offensive Metang at your own risk, as it hits many of the offensive threats in the tier hard. Courtesy of its great bulk, Metang can also check physical and special attackers alike, such as Primeape, Serperior, Braviary, and Musharna. Unfortunately, Metang still cannot beat common leads such as Piloswine and Golem one-on-one, but it can survive an Earthquake from them, allowing it to make a move before it dies. Stealth Rock is a handy move on Metang, chipping off health from Pokemon such as Charizard and Rotom-S to which Metang can do little otherwise. Meteor Mash is a strong STAB move, 2HKOing Serperior, Primeape, and Skuntank after Stealth Rock damage. Toxic is essential for Metang to cripple Tangela and Alomomola, and it also allows Metang to beat Musharna without gambling on Meteor Mash Attack boosts. Bullet Punch might seem odd as it limits Metang's coverage, but it is incredibly useful as it allows it to pick off frail threats such as Primeape, Haunter, and Swellow.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>176 Attack EVs allow Metang to break +1 Defense Braviary's Substitute; adding more doesn't help it net any notable KOs. 80 Special Defense EVs make it easier for Metang to sponge special hits from special attackers such as Kadabra and Haunter. Even though both of Metang's abilities give little benefit, Clear Body is the better option, as it prevents unexpected stat drops from Shadow Ball and Psychic. As for other moves, Psych Up allows Metang to copy stat boosts from Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary effectively. Pursuit can be used over Bullet Punch to catch Haunter and Kadabra as they attempt to switch, but it doesn't serve much use otherwise because it's pathetically weak against other Pokemon. Earthquake enables Metang to hit the likes of Samurott and Skuntank harder, but it shouldn't stay in on Samurott anyway and Skuntank does not survive constant Meteor Mashes either.</p>

<p>As far as partners go, Ludicolo is a great teammate as it can beat the Fire- and Ground-types that Metang despises; it also handles certain Water-types such as Alomomola, Seismitoad, and special Samurott well. Misdreavus is also a good teammate, as it is immune to Ground-type attacks and can threaten Golem, Armaldo, Piloswine, and other common leads with Will-O-Wisp and Taunt. Anything that can take on strong Fire-types helps, thus making Carracosta and Seismitoad effective partners for Metang, but they should be wary of Hidden Power Grass that the Fire-types might carry. Pokemon that find Normal- and Flying-types troublesome generally appreciate Metang's presence; Serperior and Primeape are the most noteworthy of these. Alomomola can pass big Wishes to Metang and resists Fire-type attacks aimed at it.</p>

<p>With Eviolite boosting its stellar Defense, Metang becomes a usable physical wall. Metang differentiates itself from other Steel-types in NU with its amazing typing, which is greatly appreciated on stall teams as it lets Metang not only wall popular Normal-, Psychic-, and Flying-types such as Zangoose, Kangaskhan, Musharna, Braviary, and Swellow, but also keep its important resistances and take neutral hits from Fighting-type moves.</p>

<p>Metang takes advantage of its resistances by using them to find opportunities to support its team with entry hazards in the form of Stealth Rock. Meteor Mash is Metang's strongest STAB move to directly damage its foes while potentially boosting its Attack. Toxic gives Metang a way to wear down bulky Pokemon trying to set up on it that would otherwise take very little damage from its other attacks. Psych Up is used in the fourth moveslot to copy the boost from Pokemon that think they can set up on Metang, such as Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, Calm Mind Musharna with Heal Bell, Substitute + Calm Mind Serperior, and Bulk Up Scraggy.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If your team needs Metang to take special attacks, an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Careful nature can be used, as it lets Metang take hits from Pokemon such as Gardevoir and Haunter more effectively. As far as partners go, stall partners such as Alomomola, which in particular can easily take any Ground-type move headed toward Metang and provide it with recovery in the form of Wish, and others are your best choices. Zweilous is also a great partner, as it can easily take hits from special attackers such as Charizard, Samurott, and Ludicolo, and along with Metang, wall every relevant special attacker when used together. Furthermore, Metang can still cover most physical attackers. Audino and Lickilicky also pair well with Metang, as they can tank a special attack, provide recovery with Wish, and heal status conditions with Heal Bell.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Surprisingly, Metang has a lot of options in its movepool. Sleep Talk could be used  as a filler if you need someone to absorb sleep afflictions from Exeggutor. Rock Slide could be used if your team is weak to Charizard, but you'll have to predict Charizard's switch in, as it'll force Metang out most of the time. Zen Headbutt could also be used over Meteor Mash, but Metang would become setup bait for Dark-types. An offensive Metang with moves such as Hone Claws and Agility might seem good, but it won't go far with its low Speed and its average Attack. Dual screens are possible, but Metang needs Eviolite to take hits better, and it doesn't have the space in its moveset to run these moves. RestTalk might seem like a good idea, as Metang has no other recovery move and lack Leftovers, but it just doesn't have the space for it. Keep in mind that using Hone Claws and RestTalk in the same set is Metang's best bet as a RestTalk user. Finally, Rest alone can also be used as a filler if you want the recovery and have a Heal Bell user such as Audino on your team, but Metang doesn't have the moveslots to spare.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Even though Metang has some offensive presence, its lack of coverage leaves it open to being set up on by some Pokemon, including Swords Dance Charizard, Swords Dance Samurott, Rock Polish + Swords Dance Torterra, Shell Smash Carracosta, Shell Smash Gorebyss, and Rain Dance Ludicolo. Keep in mind though, that most of them won't enjoy being hit by Toxic. Other than that, Pokemon able to hit Metang hard with a special attack or strong super effective move, such as Charizard, Samurott, Seismitoad, Eelektross, Choice Band Torterra, and Golurk, can easily force Metang out.</p>

<p>Magnet Pull Probopass is great against Metang, as it is able to finish Metang off with Earth Power and takes almost nothing from Metang's Meteor Mash, but it must watch out for the occasional Earthquake. Golem can also check Metang, but keep in mind it'll come out weakened at best. Also, Pokemon commonly running Taunt such as Mandibuzz, which can take any hit from Metang, constantly wear it down with Foul Play, and heal itself with Roost, and Misdreavus, which can Heal Bell if Metang hits it with Toxic and can Will-O-Wisp Metang to wear it down, can easily kill Metang. Being grounded, Spikes hinders Metang's survivability quite a lot; add to that its lack of recovery outside of the unreliable RestTalk, and Metang is easy to wear down.</p>
