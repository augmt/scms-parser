[Overview]

<p>Chatot is a rather bad Pokemon on account of its horrible stats and poor STABs. It is rather unique in the sense that it is the only specially based Normal / Flying type in the metagame and it sits just above the base 90 Speed benchmark, but that's about it. Chatot is a decent hit-and-run special attacker, but you are better off using one of the other Flying-types in NU for any other role.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the only set Chatot can use without being outclassed by its Flying-type brethren. With a nice Speed stat, access to U-turn, and a somewhat decent movepool, Chatot makes for a good attacker. Hyper Voice is Chatot's main STAB move, and with a Choice Specs equipped, it can hit pretty hard; for example, it is capable of 2HKOing threats such as Eelektross. Heat Wave is Chatot's move of choice against the likes of Metang, which is 2HKOed by it, as well as Ghost-types, which can take the other moves on this set easily. U-turn lets Chatot escape switch-ins that wall it cold and force them out with the appropriate Pokemon and helps maintain momentum. Hidden Power Ground is used exclusively for Probopass and Bastiodon and 2HKOes them.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Timid nature lets Chatot outrun 90 base Speed Pokemon and below, such as Kangaskhan and Zangoose. For alternative moves, Hidden Power Grass hits Golem, Seismitoad, and Carracosta harder, but Hidden Power Ground suffices against Golem and Carracosta and Hyper Voice has a good chance to 2HKO Seismitoad. Pokemon that appreciate Chatot's ability to weaken Steel-types, such as Arbok and Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, make for fine partners. Choice Band Sawk is a great partner as well, as it can OHKO most Stealth Rock setters. Probopass and Eelektross form a decent VoltTurn core with Chatot, making them good options for partners as well. Skuntank is another good partner as it can trap Misdreavus; in return, Chatot can weaken Steel-types that are annoying for Skuntank to handle. Chatot can grant it a free switch by using U-turn as well.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Nasty Plot can be used, but Chatot is far too frail to set up. Encore is a decent option to let Chatot set up on resisted hits, but it still takes quite a lot of damage from them. Substitute lets Chatot avoid status and being revenge killed, but Chatot isn't staying on the battlefield for long and its Substitutes are easily broken even by resisted attacks. Taunt lets Chatot shut down walls, but it cannot do much to them anyway as it loses out on important coverage. Hidden Power Flying and Chatter are options for Flying-type STAB moves. Tailwind lets Chatot boost its team's Speed, but it cannot take a hit, so has few opportunities to set it up, and is better off attacking. Hidden Power Water lets Chatot get better overall coverage than Hidden Power Grass and Hidden Power Ground, but is ineffective against most targets as unlike the previously mentioned Hidden Powers, it does not hit its targets for 4x damage. Agility is another seemingly good option as a setup move, but again, Chatot is far too frail to utilize it efficiently.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Stealth Rock is a great way of countering Chatot, as it limits its ability to switch in repeatedly, which is especially important due to its use of U-turn. Due to Chatot's poor bulk and mediocre offenses, it is quite easy to counter with any relatively bulky Pokemon. Audino and Lickilicky can easily take a hit from Chatot and retaliate with a STAB move of choice. Probopass and Bastiodon can switch into most of its moves, but are hit hard by Hidden Power Ground. Defensive Misdreavus is barely 3HKOed by Heat Wave and can stall Chatot out with Will-O-Wisp and Pain Split. Faster Pokemon such as Swellow can easily OHKO Chatot, but must be wary of switching in. Regirock can take any hit from it bar Hidden Power Ground and retaliate with a STAB move of choice.</p>
