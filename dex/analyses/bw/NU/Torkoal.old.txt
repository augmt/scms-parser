[Overview]

<p>With very few viable Rapid Spin users in NU, Torkoal stands out from the rest with its balance of offensive and support roles. Boasting a fantastic base 140 Defense, Torkoal can effectively run a tank set, which makes it unique among the Fire-types in NU. It is also the best offensively-oriented Rapid Spin user in NU, as Shell Smash allows it to act as an offensive threat. However, Torkoal's lack of recovery&mdash;and the disadvantage of being outsped and KOed by many offensive Pokemon&mdash;can really limit its usefulness on the field. On top of this, Torkoal's typing makes it weak to the very same entry hazards it attempts to remove.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes the defensive route in providing Rapid Spin support for the team and works well on both defensive and stall teams. Physical attackers have difficulty getting past Torkoal; Sawk and Swords Dance Samurott can only 2HKO it, and Kangaskhan only manages to 3HKO. Rapid Spin is the main reason to use this set, as it offers entry hazard relief to the team. Lava Plume is Torkoal's STAB move for this set, offering a 30% chance to burn the opponent. With Stealth Rock, Torkoal can support the team even further, laying entry hazards for its team to weaken the adversary. Finally, Yawn is a great way to force switches and put Ghost-type Pokemon in a bad position if used correctly.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>248 HP EVs allow Torkoal to switch into Stealth Rock four times at full HP. Because Torkoal lacks a reliable source of recovery, Leftovers is the recommended item in order for Torkoal to last longer in the match. As bulky as Torkoal is, critical hits can still break through its defenses; Shell Armor allows Torkoal to avoid these.</p>

<p>An EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature could be used if you would rather strengthen Torkoal's Special Defense, but it is still easy to break through with special attacks regardless. A stronger Fire-type attack, most notably Flamethrower, could be used in place of Lava Plume, but the 30% burn chance Lava Plume offers often overshadows the increase in Base Power. Protect is an option in the final moveslot to scout the opponent and stall for burn damage from Lava Plume. Will-O-Wisp is also an option if you really want to guarantee Torkoal burns the opponent. Toxic can be considered to cripple Pokemom that don't mind getting burned, such as Musharna and Ludicolo. Hidden Power Grass is also an alternative to prevent Carracosta from using Torkoal as setup fodder on stall teams, but that's all it really offers. Finally, Rest is a great choice to give Torkoal a form of recovery, but it should only be used with a cleric or Chesto Berry to wake up Torkoal immediately.</p>

<p>Torkoal has difficulties dealing with Ghost-types with this set, so good partners would be Pokemon that can take care of them. Skuntank in particular does well against these threats and can Pursuit trap them, giving Torkoal a chance to use Rapid Spin. If Torkoal is hit by Toxic, it is easily worn down and defeated. Clerics such as Misdreavus, Vileplume, Audino, and Lickilicky are great selections to prevent this from happening. Because Torkoal's mediocre Special Defense is usually targeted by opponents, partners that can tank special attacks work well with Torkoal; Lickilicky and Audino are examples of such. Water-types are also difficult for Torkoal to handle, so partners that can deal with them, such as Roselia, Regice, and Zweilous, are recommended. Torkoal lacks a reliable source of recovery, so Pokemon that can offer Wish support, such as Alomomola, are great to use alongside it.</p>

[SET]
name: Smashkoal
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Rapid Spin
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Earth Power / Hidden Power Grass
item: White Herb
ability: Shell Armor
nature: Timid / Modest
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Shell Smash allows Torkoal to nail every spinblocker in NU; it even gives Torkoal the opportunity to OHKO Misdreavus with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock damage. Because of Torkoal's ability to deal with spinblockers, it has many opportunities to use Rapid Spin to remove any entry hazards from its side. While its physical bulk is high, Torkoal still has difficulty setting up on Pokemon such as Choice Band Kangaskhan, Primeape, Sawk, and Tauros, so it needa to set up on either an offensively weak Pokemon or on a predicted switch. Shell Smash's stat drop can be troublesome, but White Herb fixes that, allowing Torkoal to take hits much more easily.</p>

<p>Fire Blast is Torkoal's STAB move, and it can OHKO Eviolite Roselia and 2HKO Lickilicky and Mandibuzz after a Shell Smash. The final move of the set depends on what threat you want to cover. Hidden Power Grass allows Torkoal to OHKO Golurk and Carracosta, nearly OHKO Seismitoad, and 2HKO Alomomola after a Shell Smash. However, Earth Power allows Torkoal to deal with opposing Fire-types, such as Flareon and Rapidash.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Timid nature allows Torkoal to outspeed positive-natured base 85 Speed Pokemon and below after a Shell Smash, which includes Pinsir, Sawk, Braviary, Gardevoir, Adamant Kangaskhan, and Mandibuzz. On the other hand, a Modest nature offers more power to Torkoal. With Shell Armor, Torkoal avoids any dreaded critical hits that could unexpectedly KO it. Life Orb is an option if more power is preferred, but because Torkoal will be worn down even faster, it is not recommended.</p>

<p>The main goal of the set is to use offensive force to find opportunities to use Rapid Spin, so not many partners are required. Pokemon that appreciate Rapid Spin support, such as Charizard, Rotom-S, and Swellow, are good partners to use alongside Torkoal. If Torkoal is hit by Toxic, it will be worn down much more quickly; clerics such as Audino and Lickilicky, which also offer Wish support, are good options to help prevent this.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Torkoal has many alternative moves in its arsenal, but very few can be used effectively. Eruption is an option, as it is very powerful at full HP, but Torkoal is too slow to take advantage of the move. Overheat is also a powerful STAB move option, but Torkoal has to switch out to recover from the Special Attack drop, which loses momentum for its team. Heat Wave and Flamethrower are other STAB moves to consider if better accuracy or higher power is wanted, but they are notably weaker than Fire Blast and don't provide the good burn chance of Lava Plume. A Curse set with Gyro Ball, Stone Edge, and Earthquake is plausible, but Torkoal doesn't have a viable physical STAB move. Amnesia could be used to remedy Torkoal's low Special Defense, but Torkoal is still a bit frail in that area even after a boost. Sunny Day support is a great option, as Torkoal can offer Rapid Spin support to its teammates and use boosted Fire-type attacks in the sun, and Solar Beam would be a beneficial move to use. White Smoke could be used if stat drops are bothersome. However, stat-dropping moves aren't very common in NU. Finally, Clear Smog is a great way to deal with setup sweepers, but many of them will KO Torkoal before it can use the move.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Targeting Torkoal's lower Special Defense is one of the easier ways to defeat it, so specially offensive Pokemon, such as Gardevoir, Gorebyss, and special Samurott, can dispose of it fairly quickly. Wearing Torkoal down with Toxic or Toxic Spikes is also an effective tactic, as it has no reliable recovery, so Pokemon such as Garbodor are good to use against Torkoal.</p>

<p>There are also many Pokemon that can wall Torkoal with ease. Mantine in particular can tank any attack from any set and defeat Torkoal with its STAB moves. Altaria and Camerupt, while uncommon, can counter Torkoal very easily by tanking all of its attacks and retaliating. Specially defensive Dragonair can also tank Torkoal's attacks easily and set up against it. Most bulky Rock-types, such as Golem and Gigalith, can tank Torkoal's attacks and KO in return, but they must watch for a burn from Lava Plume or a boosted Earth Power or Hidden Power Grass. Depending on what move is in the final moveslot of the offensive set, either Frillish (if Earth Power is used) or Lampent (if Hidden Power Grass is used) can check Torkoal well. While Misdreavus can be OHKOed by Torkoal after a Shell Smash boost, it has Taunt to shut defensive Torkoal down and prevent Rapid Spin, only fearing a predicted Yawn. Torkoal can be offensively threatening if it sets up Shell Smash, while Yawn can make opponents battle with caution against the defensive set, but if you can prevent or avoid the two, Torkoal is easy to wear down and take out.</p>
