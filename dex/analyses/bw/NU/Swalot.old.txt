[Overview]

<p>Swalot faces too much direct competition from Weezing and Muk as a defensive Poison-type in NU. Swalot has bad Speed, unhelpful abilities, and relies on Pain Split for recovery. Its movepool is decent, but it has very low offensive stats. The only niche Swalot has over those Poison-types is Encore, but that is rarely enough to merit its usage.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Swalot's main niche is Encore, which allows Swalot to disrupt sweepers trying to set up on it, such as Gurdurr and Musharna. Toxic is Swalot's most reliable method of dealing damage, as its offensive stats are too lackluster to leave a serious dent. Sludge Bomb is Swalot's most reliable STAB attack, due to its high PP and decent Base Power. The potential poisoning effect is also great when afflicting switch-ins. Pain Split offers Swalot decent recovery, but Earthquake hits the Steel- and Poison-types that plan on switching into Toxic super effectively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Swalot should only use a Relaxed nature if it is using Earthquake. Protect can fit in the set to scout for moves, Toxic stall, and gain Leftovers recovery. Great partners for Swalot include Mandibuzz, which is immune to both of Swalot's weaknesses and wields outstanding bulk. Ground-types, such as Golurk and Golem, make good offensive partners for Swalot because they can eliminate the Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon that could switch in on Toxic, saving Swalot the trouble of needing Earthquake as well. Lastly, partners with Taunt are also helpful so clerics can not eliminate the status Swalot spreads.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Gunk Shot can be utilized instead of Sludge Bomb for a higher damage output, but the lower accuracy and PP are generally not worth it. Swalot has access to Yawn, which can be useful when forcing switches. Curse is a viable option as well, but Swalot is outclassed in sweeping by Curse Muk and Coil Arbok. Swalot has access to a wide variety of physical and special moves, but its offenses are too low to pull off any viable set. A Custap Berry + Destiny Bond set is optional, but is gimmicky and unreliable. Swalot can set up weather as well, but it is outclassed by Pokemon with better typings and abilities. Lastly, Swalot has access to Swagger, but the strategy is luck-based and unreliable.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Poison- and Steel-types walk all over Swalot if it lacks Earthquake. Some Pokemon, such as Weezing, Haunter, Grass / Poison types, and defensive Metang, can even handle sets with Earthquake. Taunt users, such as Mandibuzz and Misdreavus, shut down Swalot as well. Strong Ground-type attacks from Golurk, Sawk, and Golem can quickly dispose of Swalot; Psychic-type STAB attacks from Musharna and Gardevoir do the same. Substitute users, such as Gorebyss and Braviary, can avoid Toxic, but they must be wary of Encore. Lastly, clerics, such as Lickilicky and Audino, remove the status Swalot spreads and can wall Swalot for a while.</p>
