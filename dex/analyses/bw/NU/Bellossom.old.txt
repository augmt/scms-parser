[Overview]

<p>Bellossom sadly functions terribly in the NU metagame; none of its base stats are up to par, its movepool is severely lacking, it's slow, and its ability doesn't help it at all. Bellossom has the base stats for a decent special wall, but it has little reason to be used over Roselia or Vileplume. Bellossom has the small niche of being able to wall Ground- and Psychic-types, as well as Ludicolo and Samurott, but you are generally better off using one of the other two.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Bellossom's best bet is running a niche dual powder set, checking Pokemon such as specially offensive Samurott, Ludicolo, and Musharna. Sleep Powder and Stun Spore spread status throughout the opposing team, giving Bellossom's teammates several chances to set up. Giga Drain is a solid STAB attack that also grants Bellossom nifty recovery. Hidden Power Rock hits all of the Pokemon that switch into Giga Drain, such as Bug-, Fire-, and Flying-types. However, Synthesis is a reliable recovery option that can be used over Hidden Power Rock if Bellossom's longevity is important.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Sweepers such as Shell Smash Carracosta and Shift Gear Klang are great partners for Bellossom because they synergize well with it and can easily set up on a sleeping or paralyzed foe. Metang is a good defensive partner as it has similar symmetry to Klang, but it also supports the team with Stealth Rock. Lastly, Fighting-types make great partners because they can eliminate Sap Sipper Pokemon that walk all over this set.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Much like Bellossom's performance in battle, its other options are quite limited. Petal Dance is an option for greater attacking power, but locking itself into a move is too risky to be of great use. Leech Seed is an option to support the team, but Bellossom has trouble fitting it into a set. A Teeter Dance and Stun Spore combination creates an annoying paraflinch situation, but that strategy is luck-based and unreliable. Bellossom could take advantage of the sun with Chlorophyll, Solar Beam, and Hidden Power Fire, but it is outclassed as a setter by Volbeat, Custap Berry Golem, and Liepard and as a sweeper by Victreebel, Sawsbuck, and Charizard. Lastly, a Swords Dance set with Sleep Powder, Seed Bomb, and Drain Punch is doable, but the damage output is underwhelming and Bellossom can easily be revenge killed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pokemon with Sap Sipper are the greatest checks to Bellossom because they can use their boost to easily sweep Bellossom's team. Strong physical attackers such as Sawk can easily plow through Bellossom as well. Pokemon with Guts, such as Swellow and Ursaring, can switch in on a status attack if their Orbs have been activated and hurt Bellossom. Serperior can use Taunt or Substitute and takes very little from all of Bellossom's attacks. RestTalk Regice is good counter to this set as well as it can handle all of the attacks and fire back with Ice Beam. Clerics such as Audino and Lickilicky remove the status Bellossom spreads throughout the team and can sponge off all of its attacks. In general, faster Pokemon that resist Giga Drain can switch in and threaten Bellossom with their STAB moves; these include Swellow, Charizard, and Braviary. Lastly, Steel-types resist both of Bellossom's attacks, so they can easily move around Bellossom.</p>
