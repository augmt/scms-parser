[Overview]

<p>Musharna is one of the most versatile Pokemon in the tier due to a great stat distribution and a movepool that adds to its ability to perform a variety of roles. Such options include that of a defensive pivot, boosting sweeper, offensive Trick Room sweeper, and Choice Specs wallbreaker. Excellent defensive capabilities allow Musharna to check or counter most physical attackers, such as Sawk and Kangaskhan, as well as check most opposing Psychic-types, defensive threats, and most weak special attackers. Musharna has a wide, viable movepool with options including Heal Bell, Thunder Wave, Baton Pass, and Trick, while having reliable recovery of its own in Moonlight. Synchronize gives Musharna a great weapon against more defensive teams, as this allows it to cripple most defensive Pokemon that depend on status to wear it down. While access to so many useful options makes it an exceptional pick for many teams, Musharna's usefulness depends a lot on the variety of moves that it needs to run in a given situation, which highlights its biggest shortcoming in the fact that it's limited to only four of those options. It is also one of the slowest Pokemon in the tier, meaning that it is often prone to being worn down as it constantly gets pummeled by powerful attacks and passive damage. Musharna is able to threaten a lot of Pokemon that don't resist its STAB, but it tends to struggle a lot against most Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon that can either trap it or inflict said passive damage.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>In a metagame where most common Pokemon are fast and frail, support pivot Musharna has a niche as a Pokemon able to utilize its bulk to find many opportunities to support its team. Musharna is able to switch into and safely cripple a lot of offensive Pokemon that fail to 2HKO it, including every common Fighting-type and nearly every defensive Pokemon. The ability to heal with Moonlight is the most important part of the set, as it allows Musharna to continuously perform its role of countering threats, giving it more opportunities to spread status or attack when necessary. A status move is also necessary to keep Musharna from being used as setup fodder. Toxic is the most reliable option, as it cripples both defensive and offensive Pokemon alike. Yawn is a fantastic move to use alongside Baton Pass to give Musharna the opportunity to gain a lot of momentum for more offensively oriented teams. If the opponent decides to switch out of Yawn, you'll always have the upper hand as you Baton Pass into an appropriate check, and if they decide to stay in, an opposing Pokemon will be crippled for the rest of the match. Thunder Wave is also a good option to cripple opposing Skuntank as they try to switch in and Pursuit trap Musharna, and it has added utility of slowing down faster foes. Baton Pass is used to provide momentum for the team, and it is particularly useful against Dark-types and Golurk as they attempt to switch into Psychic or Thunder Wave, respectively. It also works very well with Musharna's low Speed, which gives it a lot of opportunities to bring offensive teammates that might have trouble switching in otherwise. Heal Bell can be used instead to let Musharna act as a cleric, but Baton Pass is far more valuable for more offensive teams. However, it can be especially helpful against walls that rely on status to cripple Musharna, as they are then crippled in return by Synchronize. Psychic is Musharna's primary STAB move, dealing respectable damage overall and preventing Musharna from becoming Taunt bait.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>240 HP EVs give Musharna a Leftovers number to reduce passive damage, while the rest goes to its overall bulk. The selected moves provide Musharna the most effective form of consistently supporting its teammates, but there are other alternatives that can be useful in certain situations. Reflect is unique in the fact that it allows Musharna to bypass any of the physical attackers that can reliably break through it, such as Dark-types, Golurk, and Scolipede, allowing it to either safely switch out or retaliate. The same applies to special attackers such as Shiftry or Charizard if using Light Screen. Both moves can also be used to help teammates set up.</p>

<p>Pokemon that can lure or reliably threaten Dark- and Steel-types are especially good partners, as said Dark- and Steel-types are often common obstacles that can safely switch into Musharna and dismantle it with Pursuit or Toxic, respectively. Fighting-types such as Sawk and Gurdurr are excellent examples, as they can easily threaten essentially all of those obstacles, while also being able to take advantage of the likes of Audino and other Heal Bell users that don't particularly mind Musharna's plethora of opportunities to use Thunder Wave. Musharna can also form part of a Psychic / Fighting / Dark core that focuses on eliminating each other's checks. Haunter is also a good teammate to consider, as it can take advantage of free Baton Pass switch-ins with its excellent offensive prowess, break down offensive teams with the help of Thunder Wave support, and lure and eliminate several of Musharna's checks with Destiny Bond.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While this set might seem similar to the support set, this set focuses more on obtaining a win condition by playing the role of a bulky boosting sweeper. Musharna can slowly gain boosts on many physical attackers that can't 2HKO it such as most Fighting-type Pokemon that it counters, as well as almost any defensive Pokemon that isn't a Steel-type that carries Toxic. One of the main perks of this set is that even though it is more of a sweeper, Musharna is also easily capable of functioning as a physical wall of sorts, being able to support the team in a variety of ways in the process. After a single Calm Mind boost, Musharna's Special Defense becomes extraordinarily high, making it nearly impossible to 2HKO under most circumstances. Moonlight allows Musharna to pivot against threats that it can wall, and can be used to heal up any damage taken while setting up, or give it more opportunities to set up throughout the course of the match. Psychic is the primary STAB move, and easily has overwhelming damage output after several boosts. Heal Bell is the primary filler of choice, as it allows Musharna to support its teammates and itself. The latter is especially important in allowing Musharna to function as a stallbreaker against more defensive teams, and helps prevents its sweep from being cut short from annoying status ailments. However, Baton Pass provides excellent momentum with Musharna's low Speed, and can even give a teammate a temporary advantage by passing Calm Mind boosts. Signal Beam is Musharna's main coverage move, allowing it to hit Dark- and Psychic-types that aren't troubled by Psychic.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>The given EV spread as usual gives Musharna a Leftovers number, giving it as much physical bulk as possible while the rest is dumped into Special Defense. A more offensive spread with more Special Attack investment can be used, but the problem with this is that the lack of defensive investment makes it much easier for physical attackers to break through Musharna. Likewise, Musharna can opt to run more Special Defense investment to set up more easily on special attackers such as Charizard and Eelektross, but that detracts from its ability to function as a mixed wall, and is largely unnecessary as Musharna is already boosting its Special Defense. As far as other move options go, it should be noted first of all that Musharna will have to forgo other important options, such as the ability to hit Dark-types, or to heal the team of status. Thunder Wave is nice to cripple Pokemon before Musharna attempts a sweep, and helps it better support its offensive teammates. Reflect lets it set up on a lot more physical attackers, like Scolipede and Golurk that Musharna tends to lure, while also helping Musharna escape from Skuntank's Pursuit much more reliably. Psyshock and Stored Power are neat alternatives over Psychic. The former hits special walls harder and allows Musharna to win any Calm Mind war, but is overall weaker than Psychic and more common walls in this metagame tend to be physically defensive anyways. The latter becomes more powerful than Psychic after two Calm Mind boosts, but Musharna doesn't usually have much time to get greedy with Calm Mind against more offensive teams. Hidden Power Ground can provide coverage against Skuntank, Metang, and Bastiodon.</p>

<p>Even though Musharna can make good use of its coverage moves, its abysmal Speed still leaves it vulnerable to Dark- and Steel-type counters such as Skuntank, Zweilous, and Metang. Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Sawk remain as the top suggestions for teammates as a result, as they can easily take advantage of them while also making Musharna's job easier against most special walls that can cripple it if it doesn't use Heal Bell. Ground-type Pokemon such as Golem, Piloswine, and Golurk are also good partners, as they are able to bust through most of these checks and set up Stealth Rock to provide more team support. Musharna also appreciates hazard support, as most of its checks are grounded and Musharna has a tendency of forcing many Pokemon out. Scolipede, Garbodor, and Roselia are all solid examples of supporters that can set up Spikes, and Scolipede can also help bust through opposing Psychic-types with its STAB Megahorn that can otherwise prove troublesome for Musharna.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes a different offensive approach to Musharna, taking advantage of its ability to sweep the fast, frail offensive metagame with Trick Room and Life Orb-boosted attacks. While Beheeyem might appear to pull off a set like this much more effectively due to its significantly higher offensive presence and utility with Analytic, Musharna stands out due to its notably superior bulk. This allows Musharna to find a lot more setup opportunities and heal much more reliably than Beheeyem, while still possessing enough power to break through most offensive Pokemon with the help of Life Orb. Psychic is the consistent STAB move that can hit most Pokemon quite hard, easily OHKOing most offensive Pokemon with some hazard support. Signal Beam is Musharna's best coverage move, as it hits Dark- and Psychic-types that don't take much damage from Psychic. Moonlight is one of the best filler moves on this set, healing Life Orb recoil and other damage. Hidden Power Ground aims to gain a solid 2HKO on Skuntank and Metang, while also OHKOing Bastiodon and Probopass.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>The EVs maximize Musharna's combination of power and bulk, and the IVs grant it a maximum Hidden Power Ground with the lowest Speed possible. If you do not wish to use Hidden Power Ground, simply use a 0 Speed IV instead. Leftovers can provide recovery, but this also comes at the cost of significantly cutting the set's damage output overall. It is worth noting that without Life Orb, Musharna fails to OHKO Jynx with Signal Beam after Stealth Rock. Similarly, TwistedSpoon could be used to boost the power of Musharna's STAB move without necessitating Life Orb recoil. Psyshock can hit Audino and Regice harder, but generally less enticing overall in a more physically oriented metagame. Baton Pass is good for momentum, but is generally less effective if Musharna has activated Trick Room already.</p>

<p>This set doesn't require as much support as most of Musharna's other sets, as it sports powerful offensive presence with solid coverage, allowing Musharna to threaten its checks much more efficiently. Nonetheless, Fighting-types remain as the best partners to enable a late-game Musharna sweep, which can also pair up with a Dark-type to make an effective core towards supporting one another. Bulky wallbreakers such as Gurdurr, Choice Band Lickilicky, and Eelektross can provide good backup under Trick Room, while also sharing good offensive synergy with Musharna. This set is much more vulnerable to passive damage between Life Orb damage and entry hazards, and due to the lack of defensive investment, Musharna becomes easier to wear down before it can have an opportunity to heal with Moonlight. As such, Pokemon that can help keep entry hazards away from the field are especially helpful; Choice Band Sawk for example can OHKO most of the common Stealth Rock users thanks to Mold Breaker. A safer alternative is a Rapid Spin user, notably Wartortle, as it can threaten Golurk with Scald and bypass other Ghost-types with Foresight to guarantee a Rapid Spin.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Psychic
move 2: Signal Beam
move 3: Baton Pass / Hidden Power Ground
move 4: Trick / Sleep Talk
item: Choice Specs
ability: Synchronize
nature: Modest
evs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>On paper, Choice Specs Musharna seems underwhelming, incapable of either pulling off dedicated sweeps or having the ability to keep itself alive with Moonlight. This set, however, should focus mostly on Musharna's power and ability to break through lots of Pokemon with its immediate offensive presence. This set requires a good amount of prediction to be useful, as locking itself in to an unfavorable coverage move or Psychic against a Dark- or Steel-type can leave it easily forced out. Signal Beam is the safest coverage move for this set, as it can hit Dark- and Psychic-types that its Psychic STAB doesn't cover well. Baton Pass can let Musharna escape from Skuntank switch-ins without taking any damage from potential trapping, while Hidden Power Ground can be used to 2HKO Skuntank and Steel-types. Trick gives this set a unique twist, allowing Musharna to cripple special walls or other common switch-ins, such as Skuntank and Golurk, very well. Sleep Talk can let Musharna also play the role of a sleep absorber, sponging the status from the likes of Tangela and Jynx.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>The EV spread increases Musharna's effectiveness as a tank, maximizing its offensive prowess while investing the rest into its bulk. Moonlight can find a place on the set, and especially shares some synergy with Trick, as Musharna can easily switch moves and heal anytime after Tricking Choice Specs. Psyshock can give Musharna a better matchup against Lickilicky, Audino, and Regice, but it's still generally less effective in a metagame with most defensive Pokemon like Misdreavus or Tangela being physically bulky. Shadow Ball can be used to hit Golurk and Misdreavus harder, but it provides redundant coverage with Signal Beam, in fact missing out on Dark-types, which are the biggest obstacle of this set anyways.</p>

<p>This set especially appreciates support from its teammates, so that Musharna doesn't have to risk locking itself in to Signal Beam to hit Dark-types. Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Sawk are the most reliable options in this role, as both can usually switch safely into the likes of Skuntank or Liepard and easily threaten with their STAB moves. Ground-types are solid teammates as well, as they can switch in and hit Skuntank hard with Earthquake. Colbur Berry Golurk can also help by luring Skuntank as well as by switching into and threatening Audino and Lickilicky. Destiny Bond lures such as Gardevoir and Haunter are good teammates that can remove common Dark-type switches so that Musharna can safely proceed to spam Psychic.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>As versatile as Musharna is, it is perhaps no surprise that it does have a variety of other options worth considering. Musharna can utilize Rest and Sleep Talk as recovery, but this is ultimately inferior to Moonlight and Heal Bell as the latter two don't require putting itself to sleep, don't depend on the unreliable Sleep Talk, can support other team members as well, and can provide healing each turn. Hypnosis and Yawn can allow Musharna to cripple something in the form of sleep, which is always game-changing in itself, and Musharna can have plenty of opportunities to use them with its excellent bulk. Forewarn allows Musharna to scout for coverage moves. Toxic seems enticing, but is overshadowed by the utility of Synchronize in many cases, and Thunder Wave is the better support option for more offensive teams. Rain Dance is interesting, and Musharna can make use of Baton Pass alongside it to generate momentum and get rain sweepers in for free. This does, however, further compound Musharna's four-moveslot syndrome. Rain also really lowers the effectiveness of Moonlight.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Musharna is a very difficult Pokemon to check because of its great stat distribution, defensive typing that leaves it few weaknesses, and a wide movepool that gives it a lot of options. Because of how differently they play and which filler options they choose, each of Musharna's sets has different flaws and vulnerabilities to exploit.</p>

<p>The best all-around answers, especially to mono-attacking sets, are Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon. Skuntank can come in on everything but a timely Hidden Power Ground and proceed to shut Musharna down with Taunt, trap it with Pursuit, or hit it hard with Crunch. Zweilous can just phaze it out while taking minimal damage from Signal Beam or respond with Crunch for heavy damage. Mandibuzz is another solid answer that is able to shut down Musharna a majority of the time with its typing, bulk, and access to Taunt to stop it from using its support options. However, Mandibuzz must be wary of being crippled with Thunder Wave on the switch or Toxic when attempting to hit Musharna in kind, due to Musharna's Synchronize and Heal Bell. Liepard can switch in and Encore Musharna into any move that doesn't threaten it, especially as Prankster ignores Trick Room, and proceed to set up on Musharna. Zweilous and Liepard must be wary of Life Orb or Choice Specs-boosted Signal Beam, however, as well as Trick. Generally speaking, any set that forgoes Heal Bell is susceptible to status, but you must be wary of Synchronize's effect as it can turn your strategy against you. This is where Steel-type Pokemon such as Metang, Bastiodon, and Probopass become some of the most solid answers. They resist Psychic and take very little from Musharna's coverage moves barring Hidden Power Ground and Trick, and reduce its overall performance with Toxic. Metang, Bastiodon, and Probopass are also able to stall out Heal Bell between Metang's 4x resistance to Psychic and Probopass's excellent bulk with Leftovers, alongside their immunity to Toxic.</p>

<p>In regards to other offensive Pokemon, Golurk can take two unboosted Psychic hits and proceed to 2HKO with Shadow Punch. Swoobat can outboost Calm Mind Musharna and overwhelm it with boosted Stored Power, while its typing is great for tanking most of Musharna's attacks in general, giving it many opportunities to set up on Musharna. Powerful physical Bug-types such as Scolipede, Pinsir, and Armaldo can 2HKO with their STAB moves. Haunter can Disable Musharna's Psychic and proceed to wear it down with Shadow Ball, or can serve as a last-ditch resort with Destiny Bond. Most Choice-locked attackers such as Braviary and powerful special attackers that can 2HKO it before it can start boosting with Calm Mind such as Charizard or Jynx can easily overwhelm Musharna with their sheer power, making it impossible for Musharna to safely boost.</p>
