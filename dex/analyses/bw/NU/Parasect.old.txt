[Overview]

<p>Parasect is sadly just okay in the NU tier. It's slow, not too bulky, and its typing leaves it vulnerable to many common attacking types. However, being a Bug / Grass Pokemon with Dry Skin, Parasect does have the ability to switch into some common threats, such as Golurk and bulky Water-types. The main reason Parasect should ever be used, though, is its access to Spore, one of the greatest support moves available. With it, Parasect can potentially support its team to victory.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Parasect's main job is to put an enemy Pokemon to sleep with Spore. That way, a partner sweeper has an easier time setting up. Leech Seed helps because it grants Parasect and its teammates healing opportunities. Seed Bomb hits the Pokemon Parasect can switch in on, such as Golurk, Choice Band Sawk, Support Seismitoad, and Alomomola, quite hard. X-Scissor can catch the Sap Sipper Pokemon that try to switch into Spore, such as Sawsbuck, as well as Grass-type Pokemon switching in on a predicted Leech Seed. However, Protect can also be used in that spot to scout for Pokemon with Choice items and all of the super effective attacks that Parasect attracts.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Good examples of partners for Parasect that can set up on sleeping foes are Shell Smash Carracosta and Shift Gear Klang, both of which synergize well with Parasect. Charizard also deserves a mention as an offensive partner, as Parasect can switch in on the Water-types that Charizard brings in. Fighting-types such as Choice Band Sawk can partner with it as well, eliminating Rock-types that can hurt it. Defensively, Rock- and Steel-types, such as Regirock and Metang, are the best partners, as they can handle all of Parasect's weaknesses. To additionally support these partners, Aromatherapy is an option on Parasect, as most clerics, such as Audino and Lickilicky, have a Fighting-type weakness while Parasect does not, so it might fit on a team better.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Substitute could work on Parasect, as it could form a Spore and SubSeed combination, but its lack of Speed and its frailty negate all of Substitute's advantages. Parasect's frailty, lack of Speed, lack of power, and unfortunate typing also stop it from attempting a Choice Band, Swords Dance, or Agility set, as it is too easily knocked out. Parasect's choice of coverage moves is also quite limited, as it is restrained to Aerial Ace, Shadow Claw, Brick Break, Bullet Seed, and Knock Off. One set that could work on Parasect is a dual screen set, as Spore and Leech Seed could give it many opportunities to set up.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Sap Sipper Miltank and Insomnia Magmar are two perfect counters to Parasect, as they are immune to Spore and can threaten it out. While Spore limits the number of rock-solid answers to Parasect, once one Pokemon is put to sleep, many Pokemon can switch in and severely hurt or KO Parasect, such as Regice and Charizard. Also, Grass-types who don't mind X-Scissor, such as Tangela and Vileplume, can switch in after a Pokemon is put to sleep and stop Parasect's Leech Seed shenanigans. Flying- and Fire-types easily annihilate it, and most Pokemon with a Lum Berry or Substitute can walk all over Parasect.</p>
