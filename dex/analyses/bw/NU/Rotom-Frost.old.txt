[Overview]

<p>Rotom-F is a cool Pokemon, but on the battlefield, it isn't as hot. Its unique typing is a double-edged sword; while giving it STAB BoltBeam coverage and resistances to Flying and Ground, it also leaves Rotom-F weak to Stealth Rock, Mach Punch, and common types such as Fighting, Rock, and Fire. Rotom-F sits in a Speed tier that leaves it outsped by common threats such as Kangaskhan and Primeape; it also has to rely on an inaccurate STAB move in Blizzard. It faces competition from Jynx as an offensive Ice-type, as she gets Lovely Kiss, more power and Speed, a Water immunity, and, most of all, a reliable Ice-type STAB move. Rotom-F has to rely on its resistances and greater bulk to set it apart. </p>

<p>However, Rotom-F's use is not limited to keeping your food fresh, as it is able to play around many of NU's special walls. Its SubSplit set can wear down walls before going for the kill, and it turns into a murderous fridge with a Choice Scarf, revenge killing and gaining momentum for the team. It can also extend its longevity and cripple physical attackers with its ChestoRest set. </p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rotom-F's SubSplit set allows it to set up against resisted hits or fleeing opponents and break down walls with the combination of Substitute, Pain Split, and its STAB moves. Substitute guarantees safety against powerful hits and status and eases prediction for Rotom-F, and it finds many opportunities to set up one, especially against walls such as Tangela. Pain Split not only serves as a form of recovery, mitigating Life Orb and Substitute recoil, but also helps wear down opposing special walls such as Lickilicky, working well with Rotom-F's low HP stat. Thunderbolt is Rotom-F's most reliable STAB move, being fully accurate and moderately powerful. The last move slot is a toss-up between power and accuracy. Hidden Power Ice has much less power but also has perfect accuracy, meaning that Rotom-F can use its coverage move without worry. On the other hand, Blizzard can be used for more power to achieve certain KOs, such as on specially defensive Seismitoad after Spikes; however, it has pitiful accuracy and is unreliable. </p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This Rotom-F set is best used on teams that need to wear down certain walls for a successful sweep. Life Orb is the item of choice as it grants more power and sort of makes up for the lack of power of Hidden Power Ice. While combining Life Orb with Substitute is generally a bad idea, it is useful in this case as it allows Rotom-F to deal more damage with Pain Split, and recovery alleviates the residual damage. Leftovers is a possible item, but Rotom-F prefers the extra power and extra damage caused by Pain Split. A Modest nature can be used for extra power, but a Timid nature is required to outspeed Skuntank, Sawk, and Pinsir, all of which can threaten to KO Rotom-F. This set does not really miss any extra KOs anyway, thanks to Pain Split wearing down the opponent first. </p>

<p>Good partners for this set include Fighting-types, which comfortably beat Piloswine and other specially defensive walls that Rotom-F would like to be eliminated. At the same time, Rotom-F can beat the physical walls that stop these Fighting-types. Primeape is a notable partner, as it can use U-turn to bring in Rotom-F safely. Gurdurr is another good partner that can use these special walls as setup fodder. As this Rotom-F also hates Fighting-types, Ghost-types such as Golurk and Misdreavus are appreciated to help beat them. Rotom-F also appreciates entry hazard support to nab additional KOs. For example, at least a layer of Spikes is needed to guarantee the OHKO on Golurk if using Hidden Power Ice. Golurk can also provide Stealth Rock while resisting Rock-type moves and being immune to Fighting. Seismitoad resists Fire-type moves and can set up Stealth Rock. Garbodor is a good Fighting-type resist that sets up Spikes, as well as luring in Ground-type moves for Rotom-F to switch into. Rapid Spin support is appreciated so that Rotom-F can last longer without being forced to use Pain Split. Torkoal beats most spinblockers reliably and lures Ground-type moves for Rotom-F to switch into. Wartortle can handle Fighting-types comfortably and lures Electric-type moves for Rotom-F. </p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Blizzard / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Trick
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rotom-F's Choice Scarf set faces heavy competition from Jynx, Electabuzz, and Rotom-S. However, key resistances to the BoltBeam combo, an immunity to Ground, as well as virtually unresisted STAB combo (which frees up moveslots and alleviates four-moveslot syndrome), set it apart from the crowd. Volt Switch allows Rotom-F to gain momentum for the team by scouting for switches and escaping uncomfortable situations. Thunderbolt is a reliable STAB move to be used when switching out isn't ideal. Blizzard is Rotom-F's secondary STAB move, sharing near-perfect coverage with Thunderbolt, and is preferred to make up for the lack of power from Life Orb. Hidden Power Ice is a more reliable albeit less powerful move, although you must be prepared to miss out on a great deal of power, such as no longer securing the OHKO on Golurk. Trick can be used to cripple an opposing wall whilst gaining a possibly beneficial item such as Leftovers; it also allows Rotom-F to get rid of the Choice Scarf and be free to switch moves when revenge killing is no longer needed. </p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Hidden Power Grass is an option to hit Seismitoad reliably; however, it doesn't cover much else that Blizzard doesn't. This Rotom-F set is best used on offensive or VoltTurn teams in need of a revenge killer and momentum grabber in one. Because this set switches in and out often thanks to Volt Switch, keeping Stealth Rock off your side of the field is recommended. Anti-leads such as Taunt Serperior and Samurott can reliably beat most Stealth Rock leads and prevent Stealth Rock from going up. Torkoal is a good offensive spinner capable of beating most spinblockers, and lures Ground-type moves for Rotom-F to switch into. Because Rotom-F forces more switches thanks to Volt Switch, entry hazard support is almost mandatory and helps make up for the lack of power from Life Orb, as well as to nab extra kills. For example, Stealth Rock is needed to guarantee a 2HKO against offensive Ludicolo. Seismitoad takes Fire-type attacks nicely and can set up Stealth Rock. Garbodor takes Fighting-type attacks and lures Ground-type moves while setting up Spikes. Because this set hates special walls, Fighting-types are helpful to beat them. Primeape is an exceptional partner, forming a VoltTurn core, and beats many things together with Rotom-F. To take hits from Fighting-type opponents, Rotom-F appreciates Ghost-type teammates. Misdreavus counters Sawk and Primeape pretty well. Golurk is another good partner, setting up Stealth Rock for Rotom-F, resisting Rock-type moves, and checking Sawk and Primeape. </p>

[SET]
name: ChestoRest
move 1: Rest
move 2: Will-O-Wisp
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Blizzard / Hidden Power Ice
item: Chesto Berry
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>ChestoRest allows Rotom-F to have a second lease of life, solving its issues with residual damage and preventing it from being worn down easily. With a Chesto Berry, Rotom-F can also bluff the Choice Scarf set, which is dangerous due to its amazing STAB coverage. Will-O-Wisp helps to deal with many physical attackers, especially Sawk, Golurk, and Skuntank, which it outspeeds. Will-O-Wisp can also wear down most walls and allows Rotom-F to beat Piloswine one-on-one. Thunderbolt is Rotom-F's most reliable STAB move, while Blizzard provides amazing coverage and forms the BoltBeam combo, which is hardly resisted in NU. Furthermore, those that do resist this combination, such as Piloswine, are handily beaten by Will-O-Wisp. Hidden Power Ice is another reliable&mdash;though much weaker&mdash;coverage option. Do note that Rotom-F can usually afford to miss one or two Blizzards, as it can always fall back on ChestoRest recovery.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Toxic can be used over Will-O-Wisp to wear down walls faster, but Will-O-Wisp has the benefit of beating physical attackers like Skuntank and Sawk, which is too useful to pass up. </p>

<p>Spinners are helpful as partners so that Rotom-F isn't forced to use Rest and consume its Chesto Berry so early. Wartortle and Torkoal are reliable spinners and share decent synergy with Rotom-F. Entry hazard support is also beneficial to help wear down opposing walls faster. For example, physically defensive Seismitoad needs to have taken Stealth Rock damage to be 2HKOed by Blizzard. Golurk, Garbodor, and Scolipede are all reliable entry hazard setters that can also take Fighting-type attacks for Rotom-F. Seismitoad can also do the same with Fire-type attacks. Cleric support is also beneficial to heal Rotom-F should it use Rest after consuming its Chesto Berry. Miltank is a good partner with Heal Bell, also providing Stealth Rock and resisting Fire-type moves with Thick Fat. Misdreavus is immune to Fighting-type moves, checks most physical attackers, and can use Heal Bell. Because this set is still walled by the likes of Regice and Lickilicky, teammates that dispose of them are appreciated. Sawk is a good Fighting-type teammate that hits hard. </p>

[Other Options]

<p>As you would expect from a refrigerator, there are several other options for Rotom-F. An offensive Life Orb set consisting of Volt Switch, Thunderbolt, an Ice move, and Will-O-Wisp can be used, although this makes Rotom-F easier to wear down. A Choice Specs set is possible, but this limits Rotom-F's coverage and with its Speed no longer considered high, it is forced out more often. A defensive set is possible to make use of Rotom-F's useful resistances, but its typing also leaves it vulnerable to common attacking types. Discharge or Thunder Wave can be used, especially on the ChestoRest set, but Rotom-F prefers to either hit hard with Thunderbolt or spread burns. Signal Beam can be used to hit Exeggutor and Cacturne accurately, but has no other use. Charge Beam can be used to turn Rotom-F into a boosting sweeper, but it will be forced to forgo an important move. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit opposing Rotom-F and Piloswine, but it has little use apart from that due to its low Base Power. </p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The hardest part about countering Rotom-F is that most of its switch-ins either hate a burn, dislike getting Tricked a Choice Scarf, or have a high HP stat that leaves them vulnerable to Pain Split. The first step to countering Rotom-F is to set up Stealth Rock to take advantage of the fact that it switches in often, as this wears it down and forces it to use its recovery move (if any) earlier. Munchlax with Whirlwind can check Rotom-F pretty well, as its high Special Defense and Thick Fat ability lets it take hits, forcing Rotom-F to retake Stealth Rock damage while it heals up with Rest. Regice has a titanic Special Defense stat and Rest, allowing it to take hits all day long and can also break Rotom-F's Substitutes with some investment. Piloswine is one of the select few that resists the BoltBeam combo and stops Thunderbolt completely, while standing a chance to break Rotom-F's Substitutes, but dislikes a burn. Miltank with Thick Fat and Milk Drink can take hits and heal up while threatening back with Body Slam. Grumpig, as long as it has Rest, can also stall out Rotom-F thanks to Thick Fat and decent Special Defense. Lickilicky can beat the Choice Scarf and ChestoRest sets by walling them, restoring health with Wish, and using Dragon Tail to phaze out Rotom-F. Gurdurr can take a hit and heal HP with Drain Punch, or simply pick off a weakened Rotom-F with Mach Punch. However, all of these hate getting Tricked a Choice Scarf on the switch. Golem and Gigalith can use Rock Blast to defeat Rotom-F if Sturdy is still intact. Rotom-F is also walled by opposing Rotom-F, and the one with Hidden Power Fighting or Rest is likely to win. Finally, revenge killing Rotom-F with super effective or powerful moves can suffice. The likes of Primeape, Swellow, and Charizard can outspeed Rotom-F and KO it as long as it isn't hiding behind a Substitute. </p>
