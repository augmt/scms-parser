p>Cherrim's average base stats, frailty, and bland movepool leave it almost unusable in the current NU metagame. Cherrim's unique ability, Flower Gift, does give it a niche as a mixed sun sweeper, but Pokemon such as Victreebel, Sawsbuck, and Charizard should always be considered first due to their superior Speed and offensive stats.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set should only be used on sun teams, though even then Cherrim's low Speed stat prevents it from doing much damage before being knocked out. Cherrim's Attack and Special Defense boosts with Flower Gift grant it a slight niche over Victreebel. Healing Wish further differentiates Cherrim from other sweepers, allowing it to give stronger, faster sweepers another chance to deal some damage. Solar Beam allows Cherrim to hit hard itself, while Giga Drain can be used for longevity, pairing well with Cherrim's Special Defense boost from Flower Gift. Nature Power allows Cherrim to deal physical damage and is its strongest option against Poison-types, Probopass, and Bastiodon. Hidden Power Fire hits really hard in the sun, but Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit threats such as Mandibuzz that wall the set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Growth is an option for Cherrim, allowing it to boost both of its attacking stats. Good partners for Cherrim are Volbeat and Liepard, which can set up sun reliably with their Prankster ability. Golem and Regirock also set up sun well, and they cover many of Cherrim's weaknesses. Lastly, Victreebel, Charizard, and Sawsbuck make good offensive partners in the sun, considering they sweep better than Cherrim in the first place, and greatly appreciate Cherrim's Healing Wish.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Cherrim can attempt a defensive set with Aromatherapy, Leech Seed, and Synthesis, but its defensive stats are too low for this to function well. Cherrim can set up weather itself, but Pokemon with better typings and abilities such as Liepard and Volbeat do the job much more reliably. GrassWhistle is an option for Cherrim to cripple an opponent with sleep, but its accuracy is too shaky to rely on. Petal Dance enables Cherrim to do high, consistent damage outside of the sun, but Cherrim shouldn't be used outside of the sun anyway. Weather Ball is an option over Nature Power, but if you want to use Weather Ball, Victreebel is the much better wielder. Lastly, Cherrim can go physical in the sun with Seed Bomb, Return, and Nature Power, but it is completely outclassed by Sawsbuck.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Faster Pokemon with super effective coverage such as Braviary and Swellow can KO Cherrim before getting hit; Charizard in particular can do this and can take advantage of the sun itself. If Cherrim lacks Hidden Power Rock, bulky Flying-types such as Mandibuzz and Mantine wall it. Taunt users such as Liepard and Serperior can stop Cherrim from using Healing Wish and prevent its teammates from setting up sun as well, greatly limiting its performance. Lastly, Protect stalls sun turns and thus reduces Cherrim's potential as well.</p>
