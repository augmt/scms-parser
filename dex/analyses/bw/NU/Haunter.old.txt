[Overview]

<p>Despite being an NFE, Haunter is a great offensive spinblocker with good offensive presence and Speed. This ties in well with its great movepool, making Haunter an unpredictable Pokemon to face. Specifically, Haunter's access to support moves such as Destiny Bond, Disable, Pain Split, Trick, and Will-O-Wisp is what makes it so threatening. While it is incredibly frail, Haunter has excellent immunities to Normal-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves that give it opportunities to switch in safely. Unfortunately, that frailty is still Haunter's downfall, as it is terribly weak to Pursuit and common priority users. Haunter's Speed might hit a great benchmark, but there are many Pokemon that can still outspeed it; Haunter also hates risking a Speed tie because of its frailty.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With decent coverage and good Speed, Haunter makes for a very potent offensive Pokemon. Shadow Ball is a powerful STAB move and hits the common Psychic- and Ghost-types of the tier for super effective damage. Sludge Bomb is a slightly stronger STAB and has great neutral coverage alongside Shadow Ball. Its decent poison chance can also help Haunter wear down its counters, such as Lickilicky, Audino, and Regice, which gives them a harder time repeatedly switching in against it. Hidden Power Ground rounds out Haunter's coverage, hitting Steel-types and Skuntank hard. Destiny Bond is the final move on this set and is especially useful to lure in Skuntank so that Haunter's teammates have an easier time sweeping later on in the game.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Thunderbolt is the most notable other option for the set, as it allows Haunter to OHKO Samurott, Mantine, and Choice Band Braviary and also 2HKO Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary and standard Golbat. Fighting-types such as Sawk and Primeape are very useful teammates, as they can demolish Steel-types, Regice, and Skuntank, all of which threaten Haunter. Seismitoad is also a decent partner for similar reasons, and it can take out Regirock and set up Stealth Rock as well. In return, Haunter can threaten the Grass-types that Seismitoad dislikes facing. Eelektross pairs well with Haunter because it can defeat Mandibuzz and most Ground-types with little trouble. As Haunter's Destiny Bond can allow it to lure and defeat Pokemon such as Skuntank, Psychic-types such as Jynx, Gardevoir, and Musharna are good partners to take advantage of this.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Haunter has some excellent immunities and resistances to common attacking types, and many Pokemon only have one move that can effectively damage it; this set takes advantage of that fact. With its good Speed and high offensive presence, Haunter can easily force switches and set up a Substitute to act as a buffer against attacks and status. Even if the opponent breaks its Substitute, Haunter can simply Disable the move and possibly block the opponent's only means to hurt it. When Haunter has successfully Disabled a move and kept a Substitute intact, it is free to start inflicting damage upon the opposing team. Shadow Ball provides coverage against the Psychic- and Ghost-types that would otherwise threaten it. Sludge Bomb is a stronger STAB move that provides good neutral coverage alongside Shadow Ball; its poison chance is also very useful to wear down Pokemon that Haunter cannot defeat with brute force and allows it to stall out opposing Pokemon with Substitute.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Because set forces many switches, entry hazard support is very beneficial to punish your opponent; Toxic Spikes are particularly useful against Pokemon that do have a second move to damage Haunter, as Haunter can stall them out with Substitute to the point where it can successfully KO them. Scolipede and Roselia are options for setting up both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, but their Poison typing clashes with Haunter's. Stealth Rock support from Rock- or Ground-types such as Golem and Seismitoad is very useful as it allows Haunter to OHKO Charizard with Sludge Bomb. Both Rock- and Ground-types can also assist Haunter in handling counters such as Mandibuzz and Skuntank, and Haunter can prevent opposing Rapid Spin users from removing entry hazards. Fighting-types, most notably Sawk and Gurdurr, can generally switch in against Dark-types and threaten not only them, but also specially bulky Pokemon such as Regice, Lickilicky, and Audino. This set particularly enjoys the removal of Steel-types, so Magnet Pull Probopass is a great teammate to handle them. As Haunter appreciates switching in safely, a slow Volt Switch from Eelektross can be quite valuable.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf

move 4: Trick

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its important Speed benchmark, Haunter can act as a decent Choice Scarf user, as it is capable of revenge killing fast threats such as Swellow and boosted Gorebyss. Shadow Ball is Haunter's most important STAB move on this set, as it is the only move that provides decent super effective coverage. Sludge Bomb threatens slower Chlorophyll users such as Exeggutor in the sun, and it also provides decent neutral coverage. While Haunter's power is only decent, it has Trick and Destiny Bond to be more of a threat. Haunter's Speed makes Destiny Bond a great move against offensive Pokemon that it has trouble taking out in one hit, such as Samurott and Kangaskhan. Trick is extremely useful for crippling defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Munchlax, as well as bulky setup sweepers such as Musharna.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Thunderbolt is a viable third offensive move to make it easier for Haunter to revenge kill Pokemon such as Samurott and Braviary. As this set utilizes Choice Scarf, the removal of priority and Pursuit users is advised as Haunter is quite vulnerable to them. Fighting-types such as Sawk and Gurdurr handle most users of these moves well, most notably Skuntank and Kangaskhan. Wallbreakers such as Eelektross and Samurott are invaluable, as they can weaken Haunter's counters enough that it can power through them. Eelektross can also provide a slow Volt Switch to give Haunter a free switch-in. This set enjoys having opposing Steel-types removed, as Trick is its only way of crippling them, which makes Magnet Pull Probopass a great teammate. Stealth Rock support from Ground-types such as Piloswine and Seismitoad is helpful, as the damage allows Haunter to 2HKO even standard bulky Samurott with Sludge Bomb.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A Life Orb set utilizing Substitute and Pain Split is viable to allow Haunter to wear down bulkier Pokemon and heal itself in the process. A set with Substitute and Will-O-Wisp can also be used to catch physical threats such as Skuntank and Golem off guard, luring in and weakening some of its main counters. Hidden Power Fighting is a viable alternative to Hidden Power Ground, as it has perfect neutral coverage alongside Shadow Ball, but it fails to damage Skuntank and Metang as effectively. Protect is another method to scout for Pursuit users, but it doesn't provide enough utility to be worth a moveslot. Giga Drain is a possible coverage move that provides some recovery and can take down Seismitoad and Golem. Sludge Wave is slightly stronger than Sludge Bomb, but it doesn't gain any notable KOs and the lower poison chance makes it an inferior choice. Haunter can use Eviolite to enhance its poor bulk, but it is still frail and the item doesn't particularly help any of its sets. Choice Specs can enhance Haunter's power, but its STAB moves aren't great moves to be locked into without the Speed provided by Choice Scarf to make use of its utility moves. Hypnosis can be very helpful in removing one of Haunter's counters, but it is very unreliable and can only affect one Pokemon at a time.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Mandibuzz is one of the best counters to Haunter, only fearing Trick, Thunderbolt, and a possible poison from Sludge Bomb. It can then retaliate with Taunt, Whirlwind, or Foul Play, and Roost allows it to outlast Haunter most of the time. Golbat, similarly to Mandibuzz, only fears Trick and the rare Thunderbolt, and it can retaliate with Brave Bird, Taunt, or Whirlwind. If Haunter lacks Hidden Power Ground, most Steel-types can reliably wall Haunter even when they are Tricked a Choice Scarf. Munchlax walls Haunter but dislikes Trick. Skuntank is a decent check, as it threatens Haunter with its Dark-type moves, most notably Pursuit. However, many of Haunter's sets have a way to at least bother (if not cripple or defeat) Skuntank in the process. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Regice, Lickilicky, and Audino can wall Haunter, but they hate being Tricked. Specially defensive Regirock can take a couple of hits from Haunter and threaten it back with its STAB move, but it has trouble dealing with the SubDisable set, as Haunter isn't threatened by most of its other moves. Faster Pursuit users, such as Scolipede and Tauros, can trap and OHKO Haunter easily; Choice Scarf Tauros is notable because it can even outspeed and trap Choice Scarf Haunter. Pokemon with multi-hit moves, such as Piloswine and Golem, can threaten Haunter even with a Substitute up. Priority moves from threats such as Kangaskhan and Samurott can threaten Haunter despite its great Speed. Finally, any Choice Scarf user that is faster than Haunter can threaten it due to its poor bulk.</p>
