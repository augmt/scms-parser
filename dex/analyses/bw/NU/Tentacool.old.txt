[Overview]

<p>While not a top-tier Pokemon, access to Rapid Spin, Toxic Spikes, and reasonable bulk gives Tentacool a niche in NU. Stall teams really enjoy its typing and Special Defense because Tentacool counters Ludicolo and Charizard, two Pokemon that can easily wreck stall teams. In addition, Tentacool's vast movepool has many viable options to choose from. However, lack of reliable recovery and a pitiful Defense stat really hinder its performance in battle. Its bad offenses also make it easy setup fodder to most Pokemon and its need for extensive team support is a hindrance.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rapid Spin is a move in short supply that Tenacool can wield. Stall teams are prone to entry hazards, so their removal benefits the team greatly. Toxic Spikes is outstanding as well, severely crippling any opposing team without a Rapid Spin user or grounded Poison-type. Scald is a good STAB move that also has the opportunity to burn physical attackers switching in to hurt Tentacool. However, Sludge Bomb can be used instead as a stronger STAB attack, and it allows Tentacool to take care of Ludicolo faster. Toxic is the last move to allow Tentacool to severely cripple Pokemon with Levitate or a Flying typing and is more reliable if the opposing team has a grounded Poison-type.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The 80 Defense EVs are there primarily so Tentacool can survive defensive Seismitoad's Earthquake. Knock Off is a cool option for Tentacool as it can remove items from the opposing team's wallbreakers and remove Leftovers from walls trying to beat Tentacool's team. Mandibuzz is a great defensive partner for Tentacool as it can take on most of the physical attackers trying to beat Tentacool and is immune to two of Tentacool's weaknesses. Misdreavus also works well as a physical wall because it can spinblock. Many Pokemon easily set up on Tentacool, so phazers such as Bastiodon are good at forcing them out and Wish + Protect users such as Audino are helpful at Toxic stalling them out. Audino also passes Wishes to Tentacool, which is mandatory to keep it alive.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Protect can be used for scouting and racking up Toxic damage, but Tentacool has trouble fitting it into a moveslot. Giga Drain and Ice Beam are good coverage moves, but they too cannot easily be used by Tentacool. Other moves that Tentacool has access to but simply cannot wield effectively are Mirror Coat, Haze, Barrier, and Confuse Ray. Lastly, Tentacool can use RestTalk for recovery, but it cannot make the other two moveslots effective alone.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Most physical attackers can easily break through Tentacool; even Sawk's resisted Close Combat is near a KO. Tentacool stands no chance against a STAB Earthquake. Taunt users, such as Mandibuzz and Misdreavus, prevent Tentacool from supporting its team with Toxic Spikes. Misdreavus also spinblocks, and Tentacool fails to get past most other Ghost-types as well. Substitute in general is a great counter to Tentacool, as it cannot break though most Substitutes. Grounded Poison-types are also great for removing Toxic Spikes, which really dampers Tentacool's team's walling abilities. Electric-types scare Tentacool out and can gain momentum for their team with Volt Switch.</p>
