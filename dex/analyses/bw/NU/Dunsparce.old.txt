[Overview]

<p>Even when Dunsparce was first introduced, it was ignored and neglected. Now, Dunsparce has entered a new low in usage; it isn't recommended on any serious NU team, as there are many other Normal-types in the tier that can outclass Dunsparce in many aspects. The only reason Dunsparce should ever be looked upon is its access to Glare and its ability, Serene Grace, together granting it a niche with a high paraflinch chance. With that said, Dunsparce cannot just fit onto any team; serious support is needed for it to be of use.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A paraflinch set is the only thing Dunsparce should be running, as it takes advantage of its one niche, but it also relies on luck. Thanks to Coil, Roost, and its viable defenses, Dunsparce can run a defensive set. While its Special Defense isn't great, it is enough to tank hits. To reach an acceptable level of bulk, two Coils are usually needed. Special attackers have some issues with it as well. The goal of this set is to paralyze the opponent and either switch into a teammate to set up or continually flinch the opponent.</p>

<p>Glare is recommended in the first moveslot; while its initial accuracy might not be perfect, after a Coil boost, Glare is a dangerous move, as it can paralyze any Pokemon, even Ground-types. However, if you want to have a STAB move for Dunsparce, Body Slam can be used, boasting a 60% chance to paralyze the foe. Coil is an important move to the set as well, as it allows Dunsparce to be an decent physical wall aincreasingly its offensive prowess. Choosing which move to use in the third moveslot reflects on the choice of the first moveslot. If Body Slam is used, Rock Slide is recommended, as having two similar STAB moves of the same type generally isn't a good idea. If Glare is used, Headbutt is the move of choice. Roost is the final move of the set, healing Dunsparce in a pinch and maintaining its HP throughout the match.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Serene Grace is the key aspect to the set, as it allows Dunsparce to consistently immobilize the opponent. Leftovers increases Dunsparce's longevity. Dunsparce runs a defensive EV spread so it can tank as much attacks as possible, rather than attacking. 252 Special Defense EVs help balance Dunsparce's defenses after a Coil boost, and a Careful nature maximizes it, raising it to acceptable heights. As for other move options, Bite can be used in the third moveslot to deal with Ghost-types while still attaining the paraflinch strategy. Thunder Wave can be used in the first moveslot for a reliable 100% accuracy, unlike Glare. However, after a Coil, Glare outclasses Thunder Wave, as it not only has reliable accuracy, but can hit Ground-types, something Thunder Wave cannot. Finally, Substitute is an option, as status completely cripples Dunsparce. It works well with Roost, allowing Dunsparce to survive much longer. However, finding a moveslot for it can be difficult.</p>

<p>Since Dunsparce's goal is to spread paralysis to your adversary, Pokemon that appreciate slower opponents are good partners to Dunsparce. Mixed Samurott and Choice Band Golurk aren't very fast, so they'll appreciate slower opponents. They can also deal with Golem and Gigalith, two Pokemon Dunsparce can't scar. Status conditions annoy Dunsparce, so clerics such as Musharna and Miltank are great choices; the former being able to deal with Tangela, a Pokemon that walls Dunsparce, while the latter can heal statuses that are inflicted on Dunsparce while aiding in spreading paralysis to Pokemon. Poison-types such as Skuntank are good allies, as they can absorb the dreaded Toxic Spikes that Dunsparce despises. Even when it's fully invested in Special Defense, Dunsparce is still weak to special attacks. Special walls, such as Gardevoir, Regice, and Flareon, can take the special attacks for Dunsparce; in return, Dunsparce takes the physical attacks for them. Finally, Ghost-types such as Golurk and Misdreavus bring grief to Dunsparce, only fearing the rare Bite. Skuntank is a good counter to both of them, only fearing of Misdreavus's Will-O-Wisp.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>While Dunsparce only has one viable set, it has many other options that require much more team support. A RestTalk set is viable with Coil, but unless Dunsparce can set up quickly, it will be easily defeated. Aqua Tail is an alternative coverage move against Rock- and Ground-type Pokemon, but it doesn't offer much beyond that. Finally, a combination of Curse and Gyro Ball is plausible, as it not only raises Dunsparce's Attack and Defense, but it makes Gyro Ball stronger by moving slower against its adversary.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Dunsparce is in most cases very easy to defeat, but if it begins setting up with Coil or spreads paralysis to your team, it becomes increasingly difficult to defeat. Taunt users, specifically Misdreavus and Liepard, are prime choices to shut down Dunsparce. Pokemon that can potentially brush off paralysis, such as Shed Skin Dragonair, Gurdurr, and Roselia, can easily set up on Dunsparce. Substitute users such as Serperior and Eelektross can avoid Dunsparce's Glare and phaze it out with Dragon Tail before it can set up.</p>

<p>There is a plethora of Pokemon that can outright KO Dunsparce; most special attackers such as Gardevoir can tear through Dunsparce, but they must be wary of Glare. Fighting-types and strong physical attackers, such as Sawk and Swords Dance Armaldo, can handle Dunsparce easily.</p>

<p>Ironically, if Dunsparce is statused, it is rendered useless. Misdreavus and Probopass can status Dunsparce and take very little from its attacks. Toxic also completely checkmates Dunsparce, as it has no way to remove status by itself. Lastly, the majority of physical walls, such as Alomomola and Golem, can sponge any of Dunsparce's attacks.</p>
