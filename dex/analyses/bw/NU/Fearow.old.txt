[Overview]

<p>In a tier with a flock of excellent Normal / Flying Pokemon, Fearow struggles to not be outclassed, especially by Braviary. Fearow's most notable niche is its to outspeed potent threats such as Haunter and Sawsbuck without without a Choice Scarf and ability to hurt Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon with Drill Run. However, Braviary simply has more power and a stronger move to break through such Pokemon. Being both frail and weak to Stealth Rock also means that Fearow is easily worn down throughout the course of a match. Most unfortunate is the fact that Fearow lacks Brave Bird and has to rely on the considerably weaker Drill Peck for its Flying-type STAB move, making most of its avian competition better options overall.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>As Fearow already has decent Speed, this set focuses on powering up Fearow's average Attack to make up for the average Base Power of all its moves. Return is Fearow's most reliable STAB move, and Drill Peck provides useful coverage against Ghost- and Fighting-types. Drill Run is what differentiates Fearow from most other Normal / Flying types, as it allows Fearow to damage most Rock- and Steel-types significantly. The last move is for utility purposes, with U-turn being the more useful option to allow Fearow to scout the opposing team and escape its counters. Pursuit is more situational, but it takes advantage of Fearow's Speed to defeat Haunter whether it stays in or switches out.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band maximizes Fearow's average power and works better with U-turn so that Fearow doesn't get worn down too much from recoil and Stealth Rock damage. However, Life Orb makes use of Fearow's overall coverage and utility, as even a Choice Band doesn't completely make up for the average Base Power of its attacks. Life Orb is not the best item to pair with U-turn simply because the recoil prevents Fearow from switching in up to five times with Stealth Rock up as its EV spread allows. Roost can be utilized with Life Orb to mitigate all the residual damage Fearow takes, but it will rarely have an opportunity to use it due to its poor bulk. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Golem and Metang is required to allow Fearow to OHKO Haunter with a Choice Band Pursuit even if it do not switch out. As Fearow is quickly worn down by Stealth Rock itself, offensive pressure from Pokemon such as Choice Band Sawk and Taunt Samurott is helpful in order to prevent the opponent from setting them up easily. Teammates that are immune to Electric-type moves, such as Seismitoad and Lightningrod Zebstrika, are good partners as they prevent Fearow and its team from being taken advantage of by Volt Switch users.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Choice Scarf is a usable item, but Fearow has very mediocre power without any boosts. Double-Edge is a stronger STAB move, but Fearow doesn't appreciate the extra recoil. It also doesn't gain too many notable KOs, and being illegal with Sniper makes it barely worth a moveslot. Fearow can support its team with Agility and Baton Pass, but it is mediocre in this role and can't even use Baton Pass with Sniper. Tailwind can also support Fearow's team, but it doesn't last long enough to make it worth a moveslot most of the time.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Physically defensive Pokemon, such as Alomomola and Mandibuzz, easily tank any of Fearow's moves and can severely damage it due to its poor bulk. Regirock is also an excellent counter as it doesn't take too much even from Drill Run and can retaliate with its STAB moves or cripple Fearow with Thunder Wave. In fact, most Rock- and Steel-types can easily tank at least one Drill Run and retaliate unless they are 4x weak to it. Anything faster than Fearow, most notably Electric-type Pokemon such as Electabuzz, can easily revenge kill it due to its low defenses. The same poor bulk also means that any Pokemon that can take a hit from Fearow can inflict massive damage on it.</p>
