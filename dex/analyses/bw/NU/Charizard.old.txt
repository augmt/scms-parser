[Overview]

<p>Even in previous generations, Charizard was known as a very threatening Pokemon. Charizard is very versatile with balanced offenses, a large movepool, and great Speed, which all allow it to run a vast variety of sets. For that reason, Charizard is mostly seen on offensive teams, including but not limited to sun teams where its Fire-type attacks are much more powerful. Its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock can hinder its ability to sweep, but it can also work to Charizard's advantage, bringing it into Blaze range quickly. With such great power and versatility, it's safe to say that Charizard is the strongest Fire-type Pokemon in NU.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set truly displays Charizard's raw power, wallbreaking through teams quite easily. Even specially defensive Pokemon, such as Lickilicky and Regice, take severe damage from Charizard's attacks. Fire Blast is Charizard's main STAB move, as it has enough power to defeat specially defensive behemoths such as Probopass. Air Slash is Charizard's secondary STAB, and it hits Pokemon immune to Fire-type attacks, specifically Flash Fire Flareon and Rapidash. Hidden Power Grass offers good coverage against the Water- and Rock-types that resist its Fire STAB. Lastly, Flamethrower cleans up weakened teams well, especially if accuracy is a dire need over power.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Blaze is superior to Solar Power on this set, as sun isn't truly needed to power up Charizard. Overheat is a very powerful alternative Fire-type move, but its Special Attack drop is undesirable, and it doesn't have much of a larger damage output than Fire Blast. Focus Blast can be used for additional coverage, but because of this set's sheer power, it is no longer needed, as all of Charizard's attacks can defeat its main threats without the aid of Focus Blast.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin support is always going to be useful with Charizard, especially when it wants to be on the field for as long as possible to inflict massive damage to the adversary. Wartortle is one of the best spinners to use with Charizard due to its ability to tank Water- and Rock-type attacks well. Once again, Mold Breaker Sawk can stop Stealth Rock from being set up through offensive pressure for Charizard. While Charizard has enough strength to not rely on sun support, having it would be great to further boost Charizard's Fire-type attacks; Volbeat and Regirock are good partners for that role. Finally, Charizard's main objective is to weaken the opposition for its allies, so teammates that can sweep up the weakened team are good to have. Sawsbuck and Exeggutor are options for that role if sun support is offered, and Dragonair and Klang work well with Charizard outside of the sun, as they can cover the other's threats well.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Charizard already rests at a great Speed tier, but when it's holding a Choice Scarf, it transforms into an excellent revenge killer. It's a great choice when a player is in need of a Pokemon that can clean up weakened teams. Charizard doesn't need to rely on sun support for this set, as it can function solely without it. Fire Blast and Flamethrower are both Fire-type move options; the former is mostly for revenge killing threats while the latter is for cleaning up the weakened adversary. Focus Blast is a great coverage move to KO Pokemon Charizard cannot dent with its other moves, such as Regirock, Golem, Probopass, and Lickilicky. The final moveslot is a filler option based on what threat you wish to cover. Air Slash allows Charizard to check Modest Ludicolo in the rain, as it hits Ludicolo harder than Fire Blast. On the other hand, Hidden Power Grass allows Charizard to dent Seismitoad.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Scarf allows Charizard to outspeed the majority of the tier, including Scolipede, Jynx, and Choice Scarf Sawk. With Blaze, Charizard can use Stealth Rock to its advantage; after switching into Stealth Rock twice, Charizard can activate Blaze, which powers up its Fire-type moves. Tailwind can be used in the final moveslot to give its teammates extra Speed if Charizard isn't capable of finishing off the opposing team. Solar Power and Solar Beam can also be used if Charizard were to be used on a sun team.</p>

<p>While Rapid Spin support isn't necessary, Charizard will be switching in and out often due to being locked into a move, so having spinners would be useful. Once again, Wartortle is the best choice of spinner for Charizard. Offensive pressure could be used as well if you'd rather avoid using a spinner; Pokemon such as Mold Breaker Sawk and Samurott are good options in that department. Charizard also appreciates having a partner or two that could heal it from status conditions or recover its lost HP with Wish. Alomomola, Lickilicky, and Miltank, who can all use their formidable bulk to take attacks Charizard cannot take, are great partners for that role. Because Charizard would usually be used on offensive teams, having partners who could weaken the opposition beforehand, such as Samurott and Eelektross, are recommended. Finally, entry hazard support can come in handy for Charizard, as it can score many more OHKOs with entry hazards on the field. One example would be Regice, as it can be OHKOed with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock damage. Garbodor and Carracosta are good choices for entry hazard setters.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Charizard is usually seen ravaging opponents with its Special Attack, Swords Dance allows Chairzard to take full advantage of its Attack stat. Swords Dance is the center point of the set, as it raises Charizard's attacks to astounishing heights. After a Swords Dance, Charizard has the power to 2HKO Alomomola and OHKO Lickilicky, Regice, and Tangela with its STAB Acrobatics, which has increased power on the first hit thanks to the Flying Gem boost and still a high 110 BP after it is consumed. Earthquake provides great coverage alongside Acrobatics, and Roost allows Charizard to heal itself whenever it seizes the opportunity.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Blaze is Charizard's only viable ability, as Charizard has no need to rely on sun support with this set. A Fire-type move such as Flare Blitz or Fire Punch is optional in the final moveslot if you crave another STAB. However, it doesn't offer much besides hitting Eelektross harder, as Acrobatics and Earthquake already wields near-perfect coverage together. Thunder Punch is a good option to dish out more damage to Water-type Pokemon, but Acrobatics already does a large amount to most of them, bar Carracosta.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin support is always helpful for Charizard to grant it more switch in opportunities, so a spinner such as Wartortle is a great partner. Jynx and Mold Breaker Sawk can also stop Stealth Rock from being up through Lovely Kiss and offensive pressure, respectively. Regirock can easily defeat Charizard, even when it has a Swords Dance boost. Gurdurr and Samurott are examples of Pokemon that can KO Regirock so Charizard can continue sweeping the opposing team. Status conditions can cripple it, so Heal Bell support from Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Misdreavus are recommended. Entry hazard support helps weaken the opponent to make it easier for Charizard to sweep, so entry hazard setters, such as Carracosta and Garbodor, are great partners.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Charizard's high Special Attack and Speed allow it to function as an exceptional sweeper. Its strong STAB moves and good coverage are highlighted in this set. Charizard is a great addition to many teams that struggle against physical walls such as Tangela and Weezing. Fire Blast is one of Charizard's powerful STAB moves, and it guarantees an OHKO against Eviolite Roselia and Braviary. Air Slash is its secondary STAB option; while Fire- and Flying-type moves overlap in type coverage, Air Slash is great against Fire-immune Pokemon and Water-types. Hidden Power Grass offers even more coverage to Water- and Rock-type Pokemon. It specifically hits Seismitoad hard, OHKOing all common variants of it. However, Substitute can be used to avoid status conditions that would otherwise cripple Charizard. Roost is the final move of the set; it enables Charizard to heal itself if it switches into Stealth Rock, as well as allowing it to maintain longevity on the field.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb gives additional power to Charizard's attacks. Blaze is the best choice of ability for this set, as Charizard can OHKO a 176 HP / 0 SpD Golurk with Fire Blast when it is activated. However, if Charizard is used on a sun team, Solar Power can replace Blaze to strengthen its attacks. Solar Beam could also be used in such a scenario, replacing Hidden Power Grass. Leftovers can be used in lieu of Life Orb for consistent healing. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast if accuracy is preferred over power. Finally, Focus Blast can be used in the third moveslot to hit Normal- and Rock-types harder, but it's an unreliable choice due to its lackluster accuracy. Tailwind can also considered over Roost, making priority the only way to outspeed Charizard.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin support is recommended, as Charizard would be easy to defeat if it comes in with Stealth Rock on the field. Wartortle is a prime spinner for Charizard, as it can also help against Regirock. Mold Breaker Sawk is a great partner for Charizard as well, as it can stop Stealth Rock from being set up through offensive pressure. Another option that isn't required is running Sunny Day support for Charizard, as it appreciates a Fire-type attack boost; Volbeat and Regirock are good choices for this. If Sunny Day support is used, sun sweepers, such as Sawsbuck, Exeggutor, and Rapidash, are recommended as Charizard's partners. Even with Charizard's immense strength, having entry hazards on the field can turn several 2HKOs into OHKOs. Kangaskhan and Miltank (without Thick Fat) are two examples of Pokemon that could be OHKOed by Charizard after being weakened by Stealth Rock and Spikes. Regirock, Garbodor, and Scoilpede are great partners in laying these entry hazards.</p>

<p>As for more specific partners, Roselia and Tangela are great to use alongside Charizard, as they can handle Water- and Rock-type Pokemon it has difficulty against, specifically Alomomola, Samurott, and Carracosta. Mantine in particular can take anything Charizard can throw at it and retaliate back with its Water-type attacks. Electric-types, such as Rotom-S, are good allies that can get rid of Mantine. If Substitute isn't used in the third moveslot, Charizard is prone to status conditions, especially paralysis. Misdreavus and Miltank, both of which can weaken the adversary with status moves of their own, can heal Charizard of status with Heal Bell.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>One of Charizard's most interesting alternative options is Belly Drum. It's a great way to maximize Charizard's power, but it leaves Charizard vulnerable to being revenge killed, and it doesn't have many opportunities to set it up safely. Charizard could also be self dependent with setting up Sunny Day instead of relying on a partner, but it wouldn't want to waste a precious moveslot for it. Dragon Dance is an excellent way to boost its Speed and Attack, but since Acrobatics&mdash;one of Charizard's best physical moves&mdash;is illegal with Dragon Dance, Swords Dance is the preferred option. Flame Charge is another way to boost Charizard's Speed, but it is a weak STAB option.</p>

<p>Heat Wave is a combination of good power and accuracy; however, it is not that much stronger than Flamethrower and has 10% less accuracy than it, making Flamethrower the superior STAB choice of the two. Hone Claws can help with accuracy problems as well as boosting Charizard's Attack; however, most of Charizard's inaccurate moves are special attacks, and Hone Claws boosts physical attacks, making it unnecessary. Toxic and Will-O-Wisp can allow Charizard to support its team, but it doesn't have the moveslots to fit them in. Finally, Charizard has some subpar attacking options, such as Shadow Claw, Rock Slide, and Brick Break, to consider in terms of additional coverage.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>It is difficult to outright counter Charizard due to the variety of sets it can run and its great coverage. Utilizing Stealth Rock is one of the most effective ways to weaken Charizard, so Pokemon who can successfully lay Stealth Rock on the field, such as Regirock and Golem, are good ways to weaken it. In fact, Rock-types in general are your best bet against Charizard, specifically ones who can take a Hidden Power Grass or Focus Blast. Carracosta, Regirock, and Golem are all great in dealing with Charizard. Carracosta can switch easily in Charizard's dual STABs and threaten it with Aqua Jet or potentially set up a Shell Smash. Regirock can tank any hit from Charizard and it back with either Rock Slide or Stone Edge. Golem can switch into Charizard's dual STABs, but struggles against non-Choice sets that can take a Sucker Punch and OHKO back with either Hidden Power Grass or Focus Blast. Due to their naturally good Defense, all three of them are capable of taking on Swords Dance variants of Charizard without having much to fear.</p>

<p>There are many Pokemon that can only defeat a specific variant of Charizard. Mantine, Flareon, Zweilous, and Dragonair can easily take on any specially offensive set Charizard has with their respective properties, but they all can be easily defeated by the Swords Dance set. Choice Scarf Pokemon have a chance of outspeeding and KOing Charizard, granted it doesn't hold a Choice Scarf itself; Rotom-S and Primeape are examples of such. While it can't take many of Charizard's attacks, Floatzel can outspeed Charizard and attack it with its Water-type moves. In contrast, Samurott cannot outspeed Charizard, but it can tank a hit and OHKO with its Water-type attacks or even go for the priority Aqua Jet. Specially defensive Wartortle can tank any of Charizard's sets bar Swords Dance and use Scald against it. Alomomola can be used as a good pivot against Charizard, taking any hit and switching out to the appropriate Pokemon while recovering HP with Regenerator. If Alomomola happens to switch into a Swords Dance or Choice variant, it can take the opportunity to cripple Charizard with Toxic or set up a Wish as well.</p>

<p>There are also other ways to make it easier to defeat Charizard. Using a rain team against it is an excellent way to weaken its Fire-type moves, and Swift Swim users, such as Ludicolo, Gorebyss, and Armaldo, can then outspeed and KO Charizard with their boosted Water-type attacks. Inflicting status on Charizard is another good way to cripple it; Miltank can outspeed and paralyze a non-Choice Scarf Charizard while Alomomola, who struggles against the specially offensive sets, can take on the Swords Dance set to land a Toxic. Using Liepard to inflict parafusion on Charizard can be risky, but it's highly effective. Finally, it's especially annoying for Charizard to go against priority users due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Kangaskhan is a good example of such, as it can check it with Fake Out and Sucker Punch.</p>
