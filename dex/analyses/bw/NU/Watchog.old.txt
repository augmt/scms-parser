[Overview]

<p>Let's take an overdone concept, make it as shitty as possible, give it the creepiest eyes known to Pokemon, and release it into the world just to watch the Pokemon fandom squirm. ~Game Freak</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Watchog has been busy in his kitchen trying to whip up a set out of the bare movepool Game Freak has given this pathetic meerkat. And when I say bare, I mean stark naked. You have to give it some credit though, as an Analytic and Life Orb-boosted Return actually comes close to OHKOing Sawk.</p>

<p>The fun pretty much stops there though. About the most that Watchog is going to do is Super Fang the opponent's Regirock, and then die later in the battle. Its ultimate dilemma is that it needs the extra power from Analytic, but is too frail to afford to go last. Oh well&mdash;such is the brutal life of the African wild.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Watchog isn't short on disruptive moves, but they don't do it much good since it's not going to last very long in battle. It's got Light Screen to support the team, but so does more than half of the tier. It's got the combination of Swords Dance + Baton Pass, but so does Ledian and I think we all know which is the cuter one, and therefore the better choice. Crunch, Low Kick, Seed Bomb, Aqua Tail, Thunderbolt, Flamethrower, and Grass Knot are about all that are available for coverage moves. Low Kick is nice to kick Regirock in the junk after you've hit it with Super Fang, but it still only 2HKOes it, even after the Super Fang. Seed Bomb and Aqua Tail can get rid of Golem, but again, so can half the tier. Crunch is nice in theory to hit Misdreavus&mdash;too bad it outspeeds and burns Watchog first.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Just don't switch around too much and let it Super Fang half your team and you'll be fine.</p>
