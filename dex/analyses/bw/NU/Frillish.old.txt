[Overview]

<p>Frillish has a lot of cons that prevent it from being effective on many teams. It has a niche on stall teams as a bulky spinblocker with reliable recovery that can check Pokemon such as Samurott and Charizard, but fails to be worth its weight more often than not. Frillish is extremely weak and slow&mdash;its only viable offensive moves are Scald and Night Shade&mdash;causing it to be setup fodder most of the time. Frillish faces a lot of competition for the role of a bulky Water-type, but as it is effective at dealing with the most common spinners&mdash;Wartortle, Torkoal, and Armaldo&mdash;it does merit some use on stall teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A physically defensive set is used as Frillish's typing is much more suitable for physical walling; with the investment, Frillish can take hits from threats such as Tauros, Pinsir, Swords Dance Samurott, and Primeape, and also avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Sawk without Stealth Rock. With good prediction, Frillish even has a good chance to beat Skuntank.</p>

<p>With its nice Special Defense, useful resistances, and Eviolite, Frillish can be quite specially bulky even without defensive investment. Frillish has more reliable recovery when compared to Misdreavus's Pain Split, as Recover consistently heals half of Frillish's health. Night Shade is used as the offensive move, as it deals a stable 100 damage on each use and does not rely on Frillish's horrible offensive stats. Frillish has another advantage in its typing, which permits it to defeat the common Rapid Spinners in the tier: Wartortle, Armaldo, and Torkoal. Will-O-Wisp is a great move to cripple opponents and cushion Frillish from powerful physical attacks. It is best used when predicting an opponent to switch into a physical attacker. Taunt is great to block Heal Bell users or boosting sweepers, but is more difficult to use due to Frillish's low Speed; fortunately it can still be used to reliably stop Musharna and Audino as they are slower. Scald can be used instead of Will-O-Wisp despite Frillish's low offensive stats, as strategic usage of the move can deal decent damage to super effective targets, especially on the likes of Golem, Armaldo, and Torkoal. Water Absorb is the preferred ability because Frillish appreciates the extra immunity.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>100 Speed EVs are invested to allow Frillish to outspeed and Taunt Modest Torkoal before it can use Shell Smash as well as Taunt Audino and Lickilicky before they can use Heal Bell. You can use a specially defensive set if you wish, as it is completely viable in the metagame; just shift the Defense EVs into Special Defense. 148 Speed EVs can be used to allow Frillish to outspeed minimum Speed Wartortle. This can be useful to Taunt it and prevent it from using moves such as Toxic and Foresight, allowing Frillish to reliably stop all of the Rapid Spinners in the tier. Toxic can replace Will-O-Wisp if Scald is used, although the latter is usually too good to pass up. Despite Frillish's ability to counter all the Rapid Spin users in the tier, Frillish should only be used on stall teams, as it has no offensive presence at all. One should consider Misdreavus or Alomomola as their roles overlap with Frillish; they should not be used on the same team.</p>

<p>Good teammates for Frillish are those that set up entry hazards. Roselia and Garbodor can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes while absorbing the Toxic Spikes that might linger on your field. Meanwhile, Probopass, Bastiodon, Golem, and Torkoal can set up Stealth Rock. Finally, great teammates include bulky Pokemon that can phaze the opponent to rack up entry hazard damage, such as Roar Bastiodon, Dragon Tail Lickilicky, Circle Throw Throh, and Whirlwind Mandibuzz.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Cursed Body can be used, but it relies on luck and is thus unfavorable. Shadow Ball and Ice Beam are other offensive options that Frillish has, but considering its low Special Attack, the moves won't hit very hard. Magic Coat is actually a really good option and can replace Taunt in the set, but is very prediction-reliant and only for advanced players. Frillish can also play a role in Trick Room support, but this is best left to other users such as Musharna, Duosion, and Audino. Frillish also has access to Acid Armor and Refresh, but these are gimmicky options at best.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pokemon that do not fear Will-O-Wisp can take Frillish head-on. These include Toxic Boost Zangoose and Guts users such as Swellow, which take advantage of Frillish's weaker Defense stat and hit hard. Powerful Electric- and Grass-types that are common in the tier can switch in easily and KO it; Eelektross, Roselia, Rotom-A, and Ludicolo are prime examples. Finally, a faster Taunt user such as Mandibuzz, Misdreavus, or Skuntank can halt Frillish in its tracks and force it out.</p>
