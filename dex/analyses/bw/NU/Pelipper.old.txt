[Overview]

<p>Although Pelipper's defenses may not be stellar, its Water / Flying typing is very useful in the NU metagame for checking Pokemon such as Scolipede, Ludicolo, Charizard, Samurott, and most Golurk variants. Its access to Roost gives it a niche to differentiate itself from Mantine, who has to rely on the ResTalk strategy to keep itself alive. However, a weakness to Stealth Rock hampers its survivability and makes it harder for Pelipper to wall what it needs to, and a 4x weakness to Electric-type attacks makes it a magnet for Volt Switch. Its combination of moves, however, can make it a difficult Pokemon to bring down without being inflicted by burn or being hit by Toxic.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Pelipper can run a solid defensive set thanks to Roost, its great resistances, and usable defenses. This set focuses on handling special attackers, as Pelipper can naturally handle many physical attackers thanks to Scald and good Defense. The first move on the set, Scald, is STAB and gives Pelipper a chance to burn its opponent. This is especially useful against physical attackers and Life Orb attackers, as the chip damage from the burn will considerably reduce their longevity. Roost heals in a pinch and is a must on this set, as it is one of the numerous things that sets Pelipper apart from Mantine. Toxic allows it to further counter Ludicolo and other Life Orb sweepers, as the damage will rack up fast. The fourth move is up for grabs: Hurricane is a strong secondary STAB that has perfect accuracy in rain&mdash;which will only really come into play against Ludicolo&mdash;and dents most Pokemon that think they can switch in safely into Scald, while U-turn gives you momentum and surprises Jynx who think they can switch into your Water-type STAB.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Rain Dish is the best ability for this set, as it allows dual recovery with Leftovers in rain. It will mainly come into play against Ludicolo. Even outside of rain, Pelipper can check Ludicolo. The EVs are fairly self-explanatory: 248 HP allows it to switch into Stealth Rock four times, 216 Special Defense lets Pelipper take minimal damage from Ludicolo and special Samurott, and 44 Defense EVs allows it to take on Swords Dance Samurott better.</p>

<p>Good partners to this set are Pokemon that can take Electric-type attacks, such as Zebstrika and Golurk. Metang is also a great partner, as Pelipper resists the Fire- and Ground-type moves that it is weak to, while Metang takes on with ease the Rock-type moves Pelipper is weak to. Pelipper also enjoys partners that can prevent Stealth Rock, such as Mold Breaker Sawk and Taunt Misdreavus.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Pelipper does not have many other options that are worth using. It can attempt to go fully offensive with a Rain Dance set consisting of Hydro Pump and Hurricane, but Mantine fulfills that role better because it has superior bulk and access to Swift Swim. It can also try a defensive Rain Dance set, with Rain Dance over Toxic, as dual recovery with Leftovers in rain, boosted Scald and 100% accurate Hurricane turn it into a decently powerful mixed wall that is hard to switch into. Pelipper can also go physically defensive, but it misses out on Ludicolo, which is important. It can also use Tailwind to support its team, or Knock Off to annoy Choice users and Eviolite Pokemon.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Electric-types such as Eelektross, Rotom-S and Rotom-F, Zebstrika, and Electabuzz force out the pelican repeatedly, racking up Stealth Rock damage on it while freely using Volt Switch to gain momentum. Speaking of Stealth Rock, it is also very annoying, as even with Roost, Pelipper will be hard-pressed to find time to heal itself. Duosion can take everything that Pelipper throws against it. Regice and Lapras can switch into Pelipper and force it out with Thunderbolt, but without Rest the first one is susceptible to Toxic. Carracosta also threatens it with Stone Edge, but it can't switch in because of the risk of being burned by Scald. Pelipper is also faster than Jolly Carracosta.</p>
