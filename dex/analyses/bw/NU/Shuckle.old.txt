[Overview]

<p>In a nutshell, Shuckle is a bad Pokemon. Despite its massive defenses, it comes with many flaws. It has an absolutely horrendous base 20 HP, which makes it not as bulky as its defenses might suggest. Shuckle also lacks any offensive presence whatsoever&mdash;not even Seismic Toss&mdash;which leaves it setup fodder for many Pokemon. Shuckle's typing is also not remarkable defensively, only giving it one useful resistance in Normal. What Shuckle can do is wall common Normal-types, set up Stealth Rock, and use a couple of utility moves such as Encore, Knock Off, and Toxic. However, this is not enough to justify Shuckle's use, as all of these things can also be done by much better NU Pokemon. Overall, Shuckle is much more trouble than it's worth, and one who intends to build a serious team should stay as far away from it as possible.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Shuckle's best bet at accomplishing anything in NU. With this set, Shuckle can use its somewhat usable bulk to set up Stealth Rock and disrupt the opponent while it dies at a moderate pace. Shuckle can wall Normal-types such as Kangaskhan, which does help it in a few situations. Stealth Rock is Shuckle's most useful support move, especially with the many Pokemon weak to it in NU. Toxic is Shuckle's only real way of doing any damage and can wear down bulkier Pokemon such as Alomomola. Encore can lock other Pokemon into setup moves so Shuckle can switch out to a teammate that can remove them. Finally, Knock Off removes Eviolite from Misdreavus, Roselia, and Metang, among other useful items. Protect, however, is useful if one aims to stall with Toxic damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Shuckle aims to go physically defensive in order to wall Normal-types and take at least one hit from Sawk. Wartortle, Mold Breaker Sawk, and Taunt Samurott could be useful to prevent entry hazards, as Shuckle is terribly weak to them. Cleric support from the likes of Misdreavus, Audino, and Musharna could also be useful, as Shuckle despises status. Wish support from Alomomola and Audino is also useful because Shuckle lacks reliable recovery.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Shuckle has very few viable option aside from those listed. It gets Contrary and can use it with Shell Smash to boost its defenses, but no recovery and lack of offensive presence let it down. Rest could serve as a recovery move, but the sleep mechanics along with Shuckle's massive entry hazard weakness make this a bad idea. Shuckle also gets some other gimmicky moves such as Power Split, Power Trick, Sunny Day, Guard Split, and Acupressure. Unfortunately, Shuckle's utility is already very limited, and none of these moves allow Shuckle to do anything useful.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Entry hazards are the best way to dispose of Shuckle. Any form of entry hazards will wear down Shuckle at a moderate pace and make it much easier to remove. Users of Substitute can also take advantage of Shuckle, although they must beware of Encore. Steel-types such as Metang and Klang can laugh at Shuckle's attempts to do anything useful and hit it hard with their STAB moves. Poison-types such as Roselia and Garbodor do not mind Toxic and can wear Shuckle down with repeated attacks. In general, any Pokemon that can hit Shuckle super effectively can make quick work of it. Finally, Taunt and Trick users such as Mandibuzz and Rotom-S can put Shuckle out of commission and in general prevent it from doing anything meaningful.</p>
