[Overview]

<p>Lumineon is terrible in NU; it has no offensive pressure, low defensive stats, no reliable recovery, and only okay Speed. With such a wide movepool, one would think Lumineon has much to offer for the tier; alas, it does not. Lumineon's only remotely viable set revolves around supporting the team with either Rain Dance or Tailwind, but in both cases, it is still extremely outclassed. Other Pokemon should definitely be considered before choosing Lumineon for your team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lumineon has the ability to set up Rain Dance and Tailwind, both of which allow its teammates to sweep the opposing team much more easily due to their extra power and/or Speed. U-turn allows Lumineon to pivot to the most appropriate teammate much more reliably than it could by just switching out. Waterfall is Lumineon's STAB move of choice due to its reliable accuracy, decent power, and nifty flinch rate; however, Lumineon still will not do much damage. Lastly, Toxic is a source of constant damage that allows Lumineon to cripple walls that can sponge its partner sweepers' attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Damp Rock and Swift Swim should be used if Lumineon is using Rain Dance to support the team, while Leftovers and Storm Drain are most helpful on Tailwind sets.</p>

<p>Good partners for when Lumineon uses Rain Dance are Swift Swim sweepers, such as Ludicolo, Seismitoad, and Mantine, all of which can spam their high-powered STAB attacks with little to fear. Electric-types, such as Zebstrika, can take the Electric-type attacks aimed at Lumineon and use a high powered Thunder under rain. Lumineon can team with Liepard or Volbeat, as their Prankster ability is much better for setting up rain. Good partners for when Lumineon uses Tailwind are Choice Band Sawk, Rampardos, Golurk, and Charizard, all of which pack great power but are easily revenge killed outside of Tailwind.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Lumineon can use an Eject Button to switch out immediately after it sets up Rain Dance or Tailwind, which grants an incoming sweeper more turns to make use of the situation, but this scenario is situational and unreliable. Scald is also an option simply because of its burn chance, but Lumineon prefers to use physical attacks because U-turn is very important. Lumineon has access to many other offensive moves, such as Ice Beam, Signal Beam, and Hidden Power, but its offensive stats are too low to put any of them to good use. Aqua Ring can be used in a stall situation with Toxic and Protect, but Lumineon is frail enough to be OHKOed by many threats. Psych Up is an option, but Lumineon is too weak to accomplish much even with matched boosts. Lastly, Lumineon has access to Swagger, but the move is luck-reliant and therefore unreliable. Then again, Lumineon needs luck to accomplish much anyway.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The best way to truly counter Lumineon is to stop it from setting up, so positive-natured base 85 Speed Pokemon and up that can KO Lumineon, such as Jolly Sawk, Choice Band Primeape, Serperior, most Electric-types, and most Choice Scarf Pokemon are going to accomplish the job. Nevertheless, even if it sets up, most strong neutral or super effective STAB attacks will KO Lumineon as well. Protect is great for stalling Rain Dance or Tailwind turns, considering how limited the moves are already. Clerics, such as Audino and Lickilicky, can eliminate the poison Lumineon spreads and can sponge attacks from most rain sweepers as well.</p>
