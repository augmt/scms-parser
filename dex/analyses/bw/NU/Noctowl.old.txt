[Overview]

<p>Noctowl is a decent specially defensive Pokemon, but there isn't much of a reason to choose it over Mandibuzz. It has poor physical bulk&mdash;leaving it prone to getting forced out by many physical attackers&mdash;a poor defensive typing, and unlike Mandibuzz, a movepool that lacks useful tools such as Taunt and Foul Play. Noctowl's only niche is Insomnia, which, together with its great special bulk, allows it to wall most Grass-types with ease, but more often than not, this isn't enought to justify using it over Mandibuzz.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the best set that Noctowl can pull off in NU. Roost is necessary for Noctowl to stick around as it will get worn down quite quickly by Stealth Rock. Whirlwind is important as well, as Noctowl would be setup fodder for multiple Pokemon without it. It also allows Noctowl to wear down the opponent's team when paired with entry hazards. Due to Noctowl's low Special Attack, Night Shade is generally the best way for Noctowl to deal damage as it only leaves Noctowl walled by Normal-types. Air Slash can also be useful as it gives Noctowl a way to hit Normal-types and lets it beat Grass-types more easily. However, keep in mind that Noctowl will then be walled by Steel-types. Finally, Toxic is there to let Noctowl cripple and wear down the opponent's Pokemon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Magic Coat can be used to prevent Noctowl from getting hit by Taunt or to prevent entry hazard setup, but Noctowl has problems fitting it in as it needs all four of its moves. Reflect is also an interesting option for Noctowl, as it would help it take on physical attacker better, but like Magic Coat, it is hard for Noctowl to find spaces for it.</p>

<p>Because Noctowl's best way to beat a Pokemon is by wearing it down, Garbodor and physically defensive Roselia are great partners for it as they provides Spikes and Toxic Spikes to wear down the opponent's team even more and can take on physical attackers such as Sawk and Gurdurr for Noctowl thanks to their typing. Piloswine also pairs well with Noctowl, providing Stealth Rock, an immunity to Electric-type attacks, and a resistance to Ice-type attacks thanks to Thick Fat. Finally, Steel-types such as Metang and Klang are good partners for Noctowl as they can deal with the opponent's Rock-type Pokemon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Despite being an awful Pokemon, Noctowl has access to some interesting support options such as Psych Up, Feather Dance, Psycho Shift, Hypnosis, and Thunder Wave. However, these are only useful in certain situations,and Noctowl can't really afford to ditch one of its standard moves for any of them. Noctowl can also go offensive with its Tinted Lens ability, Heat Wave, Hyper Voice, and Air Slash, but it isn't strong enough to break walls by itself and would need way too much support to work.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Rock-types such as Golem, Regirock, and Carracosta can all easily take a Night Shade and OHKO Noctowl with their STABs. Physical attackers in general are a pain for Noctowl as it has horrible physical bulk, which leaves it 2HKOed by pretty much any decently strong move. Electric-types such as Rotom-S, Eelektross, and Electabuzz can also easily KO Noctowl, only fearing Toxic. Ice-types such as Piloswine and Regice easily beat Noctowl too with their Ice-type STABs. Swellow, Zangoose, and Ursaring are immune to Noctowl's Night Shade, can use Toxic to their advantage to boost their power with Guts or Toxic Boost, and can easily OHKO Noctowl with Facade. Steel-types such as Metang, which is only 4HKOed by Night Shade and can retaliate back with either Meteor Mash or Toxic, can also easily take on Noctowl. Finally, Noctowl is easy to wear down with status as it puts Noctowl on a timer, limiting its survivability.</p>
