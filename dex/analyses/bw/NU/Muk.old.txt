[Overview]

<p>Muk is pretty solid as far as Poison-types go, especially among the ones that can absorb Toxic Spikes. Its solid Attack and Special Defense as well as good movepool allow Muk to tango with some of the most powerful special attackers in the tier. It has a unique ability which causes its contact moves to be capable of inducing poison, which is not only great for inflicting chip damage on opponents, but it's also hilarious when your Ice Punch poisons someone. What separates Muk from other slow Poison-types is Shadow Sneak, which turns it into a good offensive check to Jynx. However, Muk is slow and easy to wall as its coverage moves aren't quite strong enough to get the job done against bulkier opponents, and common weaknesses in Ground and Psychic hold it back. However, Muk still holds its own well in the NU metagame, and anything that can poison you while smacking you at the same time shouldn't be taken lightly.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Poison Jab is your main STAB and has a nice 30% chance to poison, while Poison Touch stacks another 30% chance. To put it into perspective, that's a 51% chance to add a free 12% damage over time effect with your main move, and 30% chance for its other attacks, which is pretty cool no matter how you look at it. Shadow Sneak is Muk's priority and despite being pretty weak, it is important to hit Jynx, Haunter, and Kadabra which otherwise harass or threaten Muk. Ice Punch has great coverage, hitting Ground-types such as Golurk and Flying-types such as Mandibuzz and Golbat for decent damage. On the other hand, Fire Punch nails Metang and Scolipede, the latter of which can use Muk as easy Spikes fodder otherwise. The last move depends on what you want Muk to do: Memento helps a teammate to set up on the crippled opponent when Muk is running low on HP or has outlived its usefulness; Curse allows Muk to set up itself, using its good bulk and Toxic immunity to harass defensive teams and providing the power to break through.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Brick Break is an option to hit Probopass and Bastiodon, as well as hit Normal-types harder. A specially defensive spread with Curse is viable, but the lack of immediate power hurts its potential. Haze is cool in the last slot to stop boosters, though Muk is a tad bit slow for that, and Memento can already function similarly. Muk works very well with Mandibuzz because it is immune to both of Muk's weaknesses and can defeat threats like Golurk, while Muk can attempt to tank attackers that would prove too much for Mandibuzz to handle, such as Ludicolo and Eelektross. Ground-types such as Golurk and Seismitoad can defeat Regirock and other Rock-types that threaten Muk, as well as hitting Poison-types that wall Muk; Golurk can also hurt bulkier Psychic-types and Ghost-types such as Musharna and Misdreavus. Sawk works well because it can take down Rock- and Steel-types that can potentially wall Muk, while Muk returns the favor by poisoning walls so that they are more susceptible to Sawk's attacks. A lot of offensive Pokemon, such as Carracosta and Kangaskhan, work well with Muk because the extra poison damage it inflicts on walls such as Piloswine and Misdreavus can be the difference getting a KO and 2HKO. On the other hand, defensive Pokemon, more specifically those with Wish such as Audino and Alomomola, can keep Muk healthy and extend its longevity, while they can take advantage of poison by stalling with Wish and Protect.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Poison Jab / Gunk Shot

move 4: Explosion
item: Choice Band
ability: Poison Touch
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band gives Muk extra power, especially when you consider its Poison-type STAB can threaten two of the bulkiest physical walls in the tier: Tangela and Alomomola. Poison Jab is reliable STAB and has a ridiculous chance to inflict poison, but Gunk Shot can 2HKO Alomomola, especially if poison is taken into account, but at the cost of not having Poison Touch's benefit nor good accuracy. Shadow Sneak is for priority and can take out frail Psychic-types and Ghost-types, with its power being more pronounced thanks to Choice Band, such as nabbing the clean OHKO on Jynx. Ice Punch is for hitting Ground-types and bulky Flying-types, though Gunk Shot does more damage against the majority of Flying-types. Fire Punch is an option to hit Scolipede and Metang, especially the former which could otherwise use Muk as an easy setup opportunity. Finally, Explosion lets Muk go out with a bang when it is almost down, taking most opponents down with it.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Brick Break can be used to hit Steel-types and Rock-types that are immune to or resist Muk's STAB, namely Bastiodon, Carracosta and Probopass, as well as hitting Piloswine for super effective damage, but otherwise Ice Punch is better to hit Ground-types, especially Golurk. Seismitoad and Golurk are good teammates to beat common Rock- and Ground-types. Charizard is a good teammate for Muk because it can beat Metang and other Steel-types and provides a safe switch-in to Ground-type attacks, while both Pokemon can weaken walls for each other. Psychic-types like Musharna and Gothorita make for decent teammates as they can take on the Poison-types that Muk cannot break, such as Garbodor and Arbok, and offer support. Physical attackers such as Tauros and Kangaskhan appreciate this set's ability to lure in and weaken Alomomola with powerful hits and poison.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sticky Hold is a decent option, but there aren't a lot of Trick users, much less those which can survive Muk's onslaught comfortably enough to even think about Tricking the Black Sludge onto something else; the extra poison chance is great against offensive teams. Destiny Bond is usable as it allows Muk to bring down an opponent it cannot otherwise beat, but Muk would much rather blow itself up than wait for the opponent to KO it and risk playing around Destiny Bond; it is also too slow to make use of it properly. Thunder Punch hits Alomomola harder than Poison Jab, but Poison Jab and poison damage does more damage over time and can't be passively healed off as easily, plus it's even more useless against Ground-types. Muk has some interesting special attacking options such as Giga Drain, Thunderbolt, and Flamethrower, but a low Special Attack stat makes them inferior, and even then Seviper and Weezing do this better. Dig's main purpose is to hit Poison-types, but giving them a free turn to do anything and switch out to a resist or Flying-type hardly makes this worthwhile.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Muk is a bit trickier to counter safely when you consider Poison Touch and its decent matchup against most Psychic-types. Fellow Poison-types such as Garbodor, Scolipede (although it has to watch out for Fire Punch), Arbok, Weezing, Golbat, and even Skuntank can all take on Muk as it has no practical way of hurting them and Poison Touch is ineffective against them; they can proceed to beat down and / or set up all over Muk or, in Weezing's case, cripple Muk with Will-O-Wisp. Not even Curse can help Muk much against them, as they can either use Clear Smog, Taunt, or boost alongside Muk and outdamage it with Earthquake. Steel-types such as Metang, Probopass, and Bastiodon are in much the same boat due to their Poison immunity, though they have to confirm Muk's coverage move before getting comfortable. Ground-types like Seismitoad, Golurk, Torterra, and Piloswine all threaten with their STAB Ground-type attacks, though Golurk and Torterra have to watch out for Ice Punch. Rock-types such as Golem, Carracosta and Regirock do well too, taking little damage from most, if not all of Muk's attacks, though those that take longer to beat Muk are at a greater risk of Poison Touch poisoning them. Regirock and Metang aren't even affected by Memento due to Clear Body and also wall Muk, though Metang can be worn down with Fire Punch while Regirock can succumb to poison. Misdreavus takes little from Shadow Sneak and can burn Muk to cripple it, though it risks being poisoned by Poison Touch when attempting to do so. Musharna can tank non Choice Band-boosted hits and retaliate with its Psychic-type attacks.</p>
