[Overview]

<p>Torterra, with its well-rounded stats and high Attack, was made to be an offensive tank. Add to that its access to two powerful STAB moves in Wood Hammer and Earthquake, and a unique typing that resists the popular EdgeQuake combination, and you've got one of the best Choice Band users in NU on your hands. With its good natural bulk Torterra can also easily set up Stealth Rock, as it has good match-ups against most Stealth Rock setters, or set up a Rock Polish, which gives it the ability to sweep late in the game. Torterra's STABs are resisted by some common types in NU, such as Grass-, Bug-, and Flying-types, so it often has trouble dealing with switch-ins. Sadly, its unique typing doesn't help against Water-types, which Torterra has difficulty countering, especially as it also can't always survive their common Ice-type coverage.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Wood Hammer
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Bullet Seed / Toxic
item: Choice Band
ability: Overgrow
nature: Adamant
evs: 88 HP / 252 Atk / 168 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band is Torterra's best set, letting it hit hard from turn one and OHKO or 2HKO a lot of defensive Pokemon, such as Musharna and Alomomola. Torterra's strong STAB moves in Wood Hammer and Earthquake are the key to the set, hitting any Pokemon hard that tries to switch in on it. Stone Edge is useful, as it gives Torterra the chance to hit incoming Flying-types, such as Mandibuzz and Altaria, which love to switch in on it. Bullet Seed is in the fourth moveslot because it allows Torterra to not only KO threats through Sturdy, but also break Substitutes and have a Grass STAB move without recoil. Toxic can also be used in the last moveslot to catch incoming Tangela and Mandibuzz.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread gives Torterra the ability to outspeed base 45 Speed Pokemon with maximum investment, such as Golem. Choice Band is used over Life Orb, as Choice Band gives Torterra more power behind its moves without losing as much health to recoil. A bulkier spread of 180 HP / 252 Atk / 76 Spe can be used, as it lets Torterra outspeed base 65 Speed Pokemon with minimum investment, such as Alomomola.</p>

<p>Superpower can be used in the last moveslot to hit incoming Sap Sipper users, such as Sawsbuck and Miltank, but keep in mind Earthquake can still 2HKO both of them. Stealth Rock can also be used to bluff a defensive set and surprise your opponent later with a strong Choice Band-boosted move.</p>

<p>If Torterra is running Bullet Seed, it'll pair well with Charizard because Bullet Seed will OHKO through Sturdy and Focus Sash so that common hazards setters won't be able to set up, and Charizard is easily able to OHKO or 2HKO most of Torterra's counter and checks. Torterra also pairs well with other Flying-types, such as Braviary and Swellow, who love to see Rock- and Steel-types and Alomomola off the field. Additionally, Torterra pairs greatly with Shell Smash Carracosta. Torterra can take out bulky Water-types such as Seismitoad, who Carracosta struggles to beat, and Carracosta can switch in and set up on Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-type attacks that Torterra attracts. Regirock is a great partner for Torterra, as it can beat a lot of the Flying-types that annoy Torterra and set up Stealth Rock to ease its job. This set also loves paralysis support from Pokemon such as Musharna, as such support gives Torterra the ability to outspeed faster threats.</p>

[SET]
name: Tank
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Wood Hammer
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Synthesis
item: Leftovers
ability: Overgrow
nature: Adamant
evs: 180 HP / 252 Atk / 76 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is a more defensive approach to Torterra, as it's designed to set up Stealth Rock and be able to take hits for the team. Wood Hammer and Earthquake are mandatory, being Torterra's two most powerful STAB moves. Synthesis is a reliable recovery move to help Torterra survive longer.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread gives Torterra the ability to outspeed uninvested Alomomola. An EV spread of 88 HP / 252 Atk / 168 Spe with Bullet Seed over Wood Hammer can be used, as it'll let Torterra outspeed Golem with maximum investment and KO through Sturdy. It's also useful against Substitute users and has no recoil. An EV spread with more investment in bulk could be run with moves such as Toxic, Roar, and Leech Seed, but Torterra's typing makes such a set less than stellar.</p>

<p>Stone Edge can also be used over Synthesis if you don't want Torterra to be setup fodder to the multiple Flying-types running around in NU, such as Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary. Toxic can also be used to catch Grass- and Flying-types, such as Tangela, Braviary, and Mandibuzz, on the switch to cripple them. Life Orb could be used over Leftovers if you need the power, but keep in mind Torterra enjoys recovering HP every turn, even if it isn't very much.</p>

<p>Torterra pairs well with Pokemon who love the removal of Rock-, Steel-, Ground-, and Water-types, such as Swellow, Braviary, Charizard, Carracosta, Zangoose, and more. It also pairs well with Pokemon able to take Ice-type moves, such as Water- and Steel-types and Piloswine. Garbodor with Rocky Helmet is also a great partner, as it makes any U-turn user think twice, and it can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes to support the team. Finally, Pokemon able to take strong special attacks like Thick Fat Munchlax, who resists Fire- and Ice-type attacks, and Probopass, who resists Flying- and Ice-type attacks, are also great partners. </p>

[SET]
name: Rock Polish
move 1: Rock Polish
move 2: Wood Hammer
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Stone Edge
item: Life Orb
ability: Overgrow
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Unlike its other sets, which are used early in the game to punch holes in defensive teams or to simply set up Stealth Rock, this set is better used later in the game. Rock Polish is mandatory, as it gives Torterra the ability to sweep when teams are weakened enough. Wood Hammer and Earthquake are also mandatory, as they give Torterra two strong STAB moves to work with. For the fourth moveslot, Stone Edge is used to hit Flying-types and the other Pokemon who resist its STAB.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Jolly is used over Adamant because, without Jolly, Torterra can't outspeed the following Choice Scarf users: Braviary, Sawk, Gardevoir, Rotom-S, and Rotom-F. Even though Torterra will have less power behind its moves, outspeeding these threats is way more important. If you really want to use Adamant, an EV spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe lets Torterra outspeed Swellow at +2.</p>

<p>Swords Dance can be used over Stone Edge, giving Torterra the ability to break through stall. Other items can also be used over Life Orb, such as Grass Gem and Lum Berry, as they will let Torterra survive longer. Those items are better if you decide to run Swords Dance.</p>

<p>Charizard, Jynx, and Eelektross are great partners, as they can easily kill Tangela, Weezing, and Mandibuzz, the banes of this set's existence. This set also needs entry hazards to make its job easier later in the game. Stealth Rock users, such as Seismitoad and Piloswine, and Spikes and Toxic Spikes users, such as Garbodor and Scolipede, are all great partners for Torterra.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There are a lot of great moves in Torterra's movepool, but other Grass-types might end up outclassing it. For example, Torterra could use a dual screens set with Light Clay, but Serperior is better at this as it's faster than Torterra and has access to Taunt. Torterra could also run a SubSeed set, but this is better used by Jumpluff and Serperior. Torterra is too slow and those two have better support movepools, including options such as Encore and Taunt. Special moves such as Giga Drain, Earth Power, and Leaf Storm could also be used, but Torterra's higher Attack stat is way more useful. Seed Bomb could be an option over Wood Hammer on any set, but Torterra needs the power of Wood Hammer to turn 3HKOs into 2HKOs. Swords Dance allows Torterra to punch big holes in opposing teams in the early-game, even scoring an OHKO on Musharna. Finally, Curse could be used, but Torterra is so slow it's easy to revenge kill with common Ice-type coverage or simply a strong super effective move from a faster opponent.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Torterra's best counters are Tangela and Weezing, as they can easily take a hit from it and force it out with Sleep Powder or Will-O-Wisp. They also commonly run coverage moves that are able to hit Torterra for super effective damage, such as Hidden Power Ice and Flamethrower.</p>

<p>Flying-types, such as Rotom-S, Swellow, and Braviary, can easily come in on an Earthquake and finish Torterra off, but keep in mind Torterra can use Stone Edge or Rock Polish on the switch, making it dangerous. Any Pokemon able to outspeed or take a hit from Torterra and hit it for super effective damage can easily kill it; examples include Charizard and Piloswine, who can also easily finish Torterra off with a Fire Blast or priority Ice Shard, respectively. U-turn users are also hard for Torterra to deal with, as they can easily wear it down until they can KO it with their strongest move. Strong special attackers such as Exeggutor and Samurott can also outspeed or take a hit from Torterra and finish it off. Also, if Jynx is using a Choice Scarf, it can outspeed boosted Torterra and OHKO with Ice Beam. Bear in mind that it can't switch in though. Finally, Torterra can kill itself from recoil quite quickly, so smart switching will make Torterra much weaker.</p>
