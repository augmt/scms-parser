[Overview]

<p>Dewgong is overall a poor Pokemon due to its middling stats, which renders it unable to perform a given role effectively. A Water / Ice typing gives it many common weaknesses and its lack of recovery makes it unable to wall anything for extended periods of time. Additionally, Dewgong faces competition with Walrein and Lapras, as the former has Thick Fat and the latter has Perish Song. Dewgong's niche over those two Water / Ice type Pokemon is the fact that it has access to both. Being outclassed by Walrein by virtue of bulk and stalling capabilities, and having poor offensive stats overall, Dewgong struggles to find a spot on a good team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Perish Song is Dewgong's only saving grace, as it lets Dewgong defeat common Pokemon that are not affected by Toxic, such as Duosion and Heal Bell Musharna. Toxic is an essential move which deals damage to the opponent every turn. Thick Fat grants Dewgong very useful type resistances to Fire and Ice, allowing it to take hits from powerful Fire-type attacks such as a Fire Blast from Choice Specs Charizard. However, Dewgong is hampered by its lack of reliable recovery, severely dampening its viability in the tier. Thankfully, Protect lets Dewgong gain extra Leftovers recovery, somewhat compensating for the lack of reliable recovery. It is also good for scouting and stalling out the opponent with Toxic. Ice Beam and Surf are obvious attacking moves that damage the opponent, with both getting a STAB boost. Ice Beam is is chosen as the main offensive move as it is able to hit most Poison-types hard, especially Grass / Poison Pokemon. Surf provides helpful coverage against Steel-types who are also immune to Toxic.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Encore is a good move that can be used&mdash;it sets Dewgong apart from the rest&mdash;being able to lock the opponent into a move and provide free switch-in opportunities for teammates. Toxic Spikes support is recommended to start the stalling immediately when the opponent switches in, as opposed to having Dewgong leave itself vulnerable that turn when using Toxic. Roselia and Garbodor are great Toxic Spikes users that support Dewgong, as they both resist the Grass-type attacks that Dewgong dislikes and can also force those Grass-types out.</p>

<p>Torterra is a great partner for Dewgong as it resists Rock-type moves, has access to Stealth Rock, can easily prevent Seismitoad or Golem from setting up Stealth Rock by using Bullet Seed, and is immune to Electric-type moves, thus having wonderful synergy with Dewgong. Meanwhile, Dewgong can easily handle the Ice-type attacks aimed at Torterra. Sawk is also a good partner for Dewgong as it can easily prevent Stealth Rock with Mold Breaker and beat Rock-type Pokemon for Dewgong. Rapid Spin support is vital for Dewgong to function. Torkoal is the best spinner to pair with Dewgong as it resists Grass-type moves, can spin away entry hazards and set up its own, and can beat Steel-types for Dewgong as well.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Dewgong has access to great priority moves in Fake Out, Aqua Jet, and Ice Shard. However, their damage output is low and they rely on Dewgong's Attack stat, making them rather useless. Blizzard can be used for more power, but it is inaccurate and Dewgong is outclassed by Walrein as a user of it. Hydration + Rest seems like a good idea, but Dewgong is easily forced out due to its poor defensive typing and thus will rarely stay in to utilize the rain turns.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Entry hazards can easily wear down Dewgong due to its weakness to Stealth Rock and lack of reliable recovery. Furthermore, Dewgong is easily forced out, ensuring that it will take plenty of damage from entry hazards on each switch-in. Faster Grass-types such as Sawsbuck, Ludicolo, Victreebel, and Shiftry can easily OHKO Dewgong if they can switch in safely. Most Electric- and Fighting-types with decent offensive presence can easily OHKO Dewgong as well; some of these Pokemon include Electabuzz, Sawk, Ampharos, Gurdurr, and more. Additionally, Steel-types such as Metang can wall Dewgong to high heavens as they are immune to Toxic and take nothing from Dewgong's weak Surf. Finally, Taunt users, particularly Mandibuzz and Misdreavus, can temporarily halt Dewgong's usage of support moves and also cripple it with either Toxic or Will-O-Wisp, respectively.</p>
