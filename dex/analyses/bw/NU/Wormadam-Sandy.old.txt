[Overview]

<p>The only thing Wormadam-G has going for it in NU is its unique typing, which allows Wormadam-G to function as a unique wall. However, its movepool is bare outside of Stealth Rock, it's slow, and it has no reliable recovery moves, making it easy bait for most setup sweepers. Most of the time, you are better off using defensive Piloswine, or Golurk.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Stealth Rock is the most important move in Wormadam-G's arsenal because it deals constant, reliable damage to the opposing team. Other than that, all Wormadam-G can really do is stall with Toxic and Protect. Protect also scouts for super effective attacks and racks up Leftovers recovery, which can be useful at times. Earthquake is Wormadam-G's most reliable attacking option, as it hits the Poison- and Steel-types that are immune to Toxic super effectively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>To benefit its stalling, Wormadam-G really appreciates Toxic Spikes support from Pokemon such as Roselia and Garbodor. Fire-types such as Charizard and Torkoal also make good partners for Wormadam-G since they cover its weaknesses and can take out Grass-types that can manipulate this set. Water-types such as Carracosta and Samurott cover many of Wormadam-G's weaknesses and also make good partners.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Rest is a viable option because status cripples Wormadam-G and it appreciates the recovery, but Wormadam-G doesn't learn Sleep Talk, so a cleric partner such as Audino or Lickilicky is necessary if Wormadam-G takes that route. Psych Up can be used with Wormadam-G so it can take on Pokemon such as Bulk Up Gurdurr and Calm Mind Musharna better. However, Wormadam-G still cannot do much damage to those Pokemon, so it is generally not worth it. Wormadam-G has access to weather moves, but it is outclassed by Pokemon with better abilities, offenses, and typings. Bug Bite is an optional second STAB, and Rock Blast can be used to hit the Flying-types that counter the set. Bulldoze or Rock Tomb can be used to slow down switch-ins. Lastly, Wormadam-G has access to Swagger, but its reliability is too luck based to perform well.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any super effective Flying-, Fire-, Ice-, or Water-type coverage move checks Wormadam-G since it has no reliable way to heal itself; RestTalk users and Guts users of those types outright counter Wormadam-G. Grass-types resist Earthquake and have many ways to minimize or neutralize Toxic damage, such as Tangela with Regenerator, LumRest Exeggutor, and Substitute Serperior. Taunt users also shut down Wormadam-G, especially Mandibuzz, Misdreavus, and Serperior, all of which take little to no damage from Earthquake. Substitute users such as Braviary and Sawsbuck, which are immune to and resist Earthquake, respectively, can avoid Toxic and can set up on Wormadam-G. Poison-types that are not weak to Earthquake, such as Roselia and Weezing, can easily attack or set up on Wormadam-G. Lastly, clerics can eliminate all of the status that Wormadam-G spreads.</p>
