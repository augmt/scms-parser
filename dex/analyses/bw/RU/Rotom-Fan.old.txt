[Overview]

<p>Sporting a double immunity to Ground-type moves, a great defensive typing, and above average stats, Rotom-S is definitely a threat to watch out for in RU. A combination of Rotom-S's solid Special Attack and Speed make it a deadly sweeper, while access to Trick, Will-O-Wisp, and Pain Split turn it into a great team supporter. Despite its double immunity to Ground-type moves--even a triple immunity with Air Balloon--Rotom-S does have its weaknesses: losing 25% of its health to Stealth Rock doesn't help it as a sweeper nor supporter, and common weaknesses to Rock and Ice make it much harder to compete. Even without its precious Ghost typing, Rotom-S is a formidable threat, and it shouldn't be taken lightly.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set attempts to utilize Rotom-S's good defensive stats and usable support movepool to cripple the opponent. The idea is to burn physical attackers, Volt Switch to a counter, and proceed to KO the opponent. Although it doesn't have perfect accuracy, Will-O-Wisp is Rotom-S's best utility move, and paired with Pain Split or Substitute, Rotom-S becomes a decent wall. Volt Switch turns Rotom-S into a useful scout, but Thunderbolt can be used if you prefer more power. Air Slash provides reliable STAB and hits Bulk Up Gallade super effectively, whilst Hidden Power Ice gains perfect type coverage alongside its Electric-type STAB. Pain Split is a semi-reliable recovery move, and it helps Rotom-S take on specially defensive walls such as Clefable. Substitute helps Rotom-S avoid status from the likes of Tangrowth and Clefable, and provides protection from physical attacks such as Stone Edge.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>136 Speed EVs and a Bold nature give Rotom-S enough Speed to outrun neutral-natured Ludicolo and below. This includes the majority of RU's walls, slow sweepers, and anything crippled by paralysis. Maximum HP EVs provide optimal bulk and stability, while the remaining EVs are placed into Defense for additional bulk. A physically defensive spread is preferred as Rotom-S can take on the likes of Swellow, Braviary, and Golurk with ease. A specially defensive spread is viable, allowing Rotom-S to take on Lilligant and friends, but it's inferior to the physical spread as it loses the ability to take on powerful physical attackers, such as Aggron.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin support increases Rotom-S's survivability, making it an excellent addition to your team. Kabutops can provide Rapid Spin support, remove Rock- and Ice-types that threaten Rotom-S, and it appreciates the removal of Fighting- and Grass-types. Pokemon who also appreciate the removal of those threats are excellent teammates. As such, Aggron is an amazing partner to Rotom-S, as it is a formidable sweeper after its counters have been removed, capable of tearing through whole teams. Omastar and Kabutops also appreciate the removal of both Grass- and Fighting-types and have great type synergy with Rotom-S. Ground-types, such as Golurk, can take care of Lanturn and Magneton that can wall Rotom-S, while Samurott can deal with Fire-types that are immune to Will-O-Wisp, such as Entei.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice
move 1: Volt Switch / Thunderbolt
move 2: Air Slash
move 3: Hidden Power Grass
move 4: Trick / Thunderbolt
item: Choice Scarf / Choice Specs
nature: Timid / Modest
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Rotom-S's obligatory Choice set; a Choice Scarf is used to raise Rotom-S's Speed, while Choice Specs is used to raise its Special Attack. This set performs well against the common Tangrowth and Slowking core in RU, but unfortunately Rotom-S's Stealth Rock weakness combined with constant switching makes it difficult to survive. Volt Switch is the primary move to gain momentum and ease prediction, but Thunderbolt can be used for additional power. Air Slash provides secondary STAB and a means to hit Grass-types super effectively, whilst Hidden Power Grass deals with Quagsire and Rhydon. Trick is used in the final slot to cripple walls, such as Clefable, but Thunderbolt can be used along with Volt Switch in the first slot to deal additional damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is pretty self explanatory; maximum Speed and Special Attack investment means Rotom-S has enough Speed to outrun most Pokemon in RU while retaining a decent amount of power to hit the opponent. A Timid nature should be used with Choice Specs, while a Modest nature is recommended with a Choice Scarf. A Modest nature can be used with Choice Specs, but this leaves Rotom-S vulnerable to speedy Pokemon such as Gallade and Kabutops. Hidden Power Ice can be used over Hidden Power Grass, but it doesn't provide any substantial coverage.</p>

<p>This set appreciates Rapid Spin support more than the others due to its constant switching. Kabutops is an excellent Rapid Spin user as it can switch into Ice- and Rock-type moves aimed at Rotom-S. Sandslash is another fine choice as it can take care of Rock-types and set up Stealth Rock. This set also forces a lot of switches, making entry hazard support another great addition. Crustle and Ferroseed are two of the best entry hazard setters, while Uxie, Roselia, and Scolipede receive honorable mentions. Grass-types, such as Lilligant and Tangrowth, can take on Lanturn with their STAB moves, while Golurk can power its way through Magneton and other Electric-types. Pokemon that appreciate the removal of bulky Water- and Grass-types make excellent teammates. Feraligatr appreciates the removal of Ferroseed and Tangrowth, while Moltres can scorch its way through teams that lack a Water-type.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute + Charge Beam
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Charge Beam
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Hidden Power Ice
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 64 HP/ 232 SpA / 212 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The idea behind this set is to create a Substitute on a switch, raise Rotom-S's Special Attack with Charge Beam, and attempt a sweep. While this set is outclassed by its other appliance formes, Rotom-S can boast a better defensive typing and the ability to take on dangerous threats such as Absol. Substitute gives Rotom-S a safety net against status and powerful attacks, while Charge Beam is Rotom-S's boosting move. Thunderbolt provides reliable STAB, and combined with Hidden Power Ice it creates psuedo-BoltBeam coverage, hitting everything in the tier except Magneton, Shedinja, and Lanturn for neutral damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>212 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Rotom-S to outrun neutral base 90 Speed Pokemon, such as Lilligant and Moltres. This allows Rotom-S to set up a Substitute as Lilligant attempts to use Sleep Powder or KO Moltres before it can attack. Air Slash and Hidden Power Fighting can be used in place of Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice; make sure you move 4 EVs from Special Attack into Speed if you do so, as Hidden Power Fighting lowers Rotom's Speed IV.</p>

<p>As this set attempts to dish out as much damage as possible, entry hazard support is recommended. Ferroseed can switch into Rock-type moves and set up Spikes, while Qwilfish can switch into Ice-type moves, set up Toxic Spikes, and soften physical attacks with Intimidate. Other supporters include Roselia, Crustle, and Scolipede. Rapid Spin support is helpful as well; Kabutops and Sandslash can switch into Rock-type moves and set up Stealth Rock, while Rotom-S can cover their Grass-type weakness. Golurk and Lilligant are helpful teammates as they can deal with the numerous Electric-types, such as Magneton and Lanturn, that wall Rotom-S. Pokemon that appreciate the removal of bulky Water-types are recommended as well; Fire-types, such as Moltres, and Ground-types, such as Golurk, are good examples.</p>

[SET]
name: SubSplit
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Pain Split
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Air Slash
item: Life Orb
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set acts as a wallbreaker and offensive pivot. The idea is to create Substitutes until Rotom-S's HP is low, then utilize Pain Split to restore its health, in turn weakening the opponent. This works especially well against walls, such as Clefable, as Rotom-S can weaken them into KO range of one of its attacks and finish them off. Another advantage of this set is Rotom-S's great typing and ability to force switches, making it easy to create Substitutes and score free damage. The moveset is pretty self-explanatory; Substitute and Pain Split are used to safeguard Rotom-S from status, weaken the opponent, and keep Rotom-S healthy, while Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice provide excellent type coverage. Air Slash can be used over Hidden Power Ice if you prefer a more powerful STAB move, but it loses the super effective hit on Dragon-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs and nature are fairly simple; a Timid nature with 252 Speed EVs give Rotom-S enough Speed to outrun neutral base 90 Speed Pokemon, such as Moltres, while 252 Special Attack EVs help it deal as much damage as possible. HP EVs aren't recommended as Rotom-S will restore a larger percentage of its health when its HP is low. Furthermore, the lower Rotom-S's HP, the more damage Pain Split inflicts upon the opponent. If you want to invest in anything other than Special Attack or Speed, defenses are the way to go.</p>

<p>Since this set doesn't have Leftovers, Stealth Rock is of a greater concern. Kabutops, Cryogonal, and Sandslash are helpful teammates to remove it from the field, while Taunters, such as Drapion, can stop it being set up in the first place. Entry hazard support is always helpful for an offensive Pokemon, making teammates such as Crustle, Ferroseed, and Uxie, good choices. Electric-types, such as Magneton, wall this set cold, making Clefable, Golurk, and Rhydon great teammates. Electivire can also take on Electric-types and gain a boost from Motor Drive, but requires top-notch prediction to be effective. Hard hitters, such as Entei and Moltres, appreciate the opponent's team being weakened, and make it significantly easier to pull off a final sweep.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Rotom-S's movepool isn't very impressive, but there are a few viable options left. Sunny Day or Rain Dance can be used to support its teammates, and Rain Dance pairs nicely with Thunder. A dual screens set is plausible, but there are better users of the strategy. Toxic can be used to wear down its counters, but Will-O-Wisp is usually superior. Discharge can be used over Thunderbolt or Volt Switch if you prefer the higher paralysis rate, but it's slightly weaker and may miss out on KOs. Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit Quagsire super effectively, but it doesn't provide any additional coverage outside of that. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types harder than any of its other moves, but it provides no extra coverage. Rest and Sleep Talk could work in theory, but its Stealth Rock weakness severely hampers it. Finally, Rotom-S can abuse a paraflinch set with Confuse Ray / Discharge / Air Slash / Pain Split, but it's a bit gimmicky.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Lanturn and Magneton are two of the best counters to Rotom-S; they both resist Rotom-S's STAB and have access to powerful STAB moves of their own. Lightningrod Manectric is another great choice as it gains a boost from Rotom-S's Electric-type attacks and resists Air Slash. Clefable can take on unboosted Rotom-S, but it faces problems with the SubSplit set. Specially defensive Grass-types, such as Ferroseed and Roselia, can wall sets without Air Slash, but they can't do much to Rotom-S in return. Quagsire and Rhydon beat sets without Hidden Power Grass, but neither of them appreciate a burn from Will-O-Wisp. Pokemon with Rock Blast can defeat sets with Substitute; Rhydon, Cinccino, and Crustle are great choices. Altaria can take on most sets without Hidden Power Ice, while Natural Cure and Roost keep it healthy and free from status. Heal Bell users can cure paralysis or a burn, making Miltank, Clefable, and Altaria decent checks. Keeping Stealth Rock on the field will wear down Rotom-S, so Ghost-types, such as Spiritomb, can be used to block Rapid Spin attempts.</p>
