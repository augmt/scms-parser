[Overview]

<p>In a tier like RU that plays host to scores of viable Grass-types, it is incredibly important for a Grass-type to be able to carve a niche for itself in order to avoid becoming outclassed in its role. Fortunately, Exeggutor hardly suffers in this regard; due to its unique movepool, typing, and stats, Exeggutor is an impressively flexible Pokemon. Its solid defensive stats, backed by a sizable base 125 Special Attack, allow Exeggutor to fill both offensive and defensive roles comfortably, making it a challenge to switch into until its set has been determined. To supplement this further, Chloropyll and Harvest can both be utilized rather effectively by Exeggutor, meaning it can function as anything from a dangerous sun sweeper to an irritating Leech Seed user. Even as a Grass-type, Exeggutor distinguishes itself reasonably, as its Psychic typing allows it to threaten common checks to Grass-types, such as Bouffalant, Druddigon, Emboar, and Entei. Of course, this is not to say that Exeggutor is by any means perfect, as many aspects of RU still give it trouble. Due to Pursuit becoming an increasingly useful commodity for offensively inclined teams, Exeggutor becomes less and less likely to hold up throughout a match, and the ability of Toxic Spikes to put a timer on some of its sets isn't doing it any favors either.  Furthermore, Exeggutor's underwhelming base 55 Speed leaves much to be desired, as even Sunny Day variants lack the Speed to outpace Choice Scarf users such as Rotom, while anything else can very easily fall prey to a plethora of powerful and common offensive Pokemon.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to the combination of Lum Berry and Harvest, Exeggutor can switch into common status moves from Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Slowking, and either cripple the foe with Sleep Powder or retaliate with one of its STAB moves. In the first slot, Rest is used to heal off residual damage taken from entry hazards and resisted moves, and is risk-free thanks to Lum Berry. When Exeggutor should use Rest depends on the foe's team. For example, if Exeggutor is at half health and the foe has a Slowking out, Exeggutor should use Rest immediately so it doesn't get KOed by Fire Blast the next time it switches into it. In the second slot, Sleep Powder is used to incapacitate common switch-ins such as Moltres and Druddigon. Leaf Storm occupies the third slot, and thanks to its immediate power, it OHKOes several Pokemon that Giga Drain cannot, including Slowking and Lanturn. It should be noted that Exeggutor has the strongest Leaf Storm in RU, which is a boon over other Grass-types like Sceptile. Giga Drain can be used for its reliability, but be warned, as missing out on the previously mentioned KOs could be crucial. The last slot is dedicated to a Psychic STAB move of choice. Psyshock is generally the better option, as it 2HKOes Lilligant after a Quiver Dance boost and OHKOes Roselia and Cryogonal after Stealth Rock. However, Psychic can be used to guarantee an OHKO on Emboar, as well as land a solid 2HKO on Tangrowth. It should be noted that Exeggutor's part Psychic typing is a huge advantage it has over other Grass-types, as it not only pressures common sleep inducers such as Emboar and Druddigon, but also destroys Amoonguss and Roselia, which would normally be threatening to other Grass-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs allow Exeggutor to outpace minimum Speed Lanturn while also making it as powerful and bulky as possible. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Steel-types like Escavalier, but it is very difficult to fit into Exeggutor's moveset. Pokemon that resist Exeggutor's weaknesses are good partners. Steelix resists five of Exeggutor's weaknesses and walls Escavalier. In return, Exeggutor can deal with Poliwrath and Qwilfish, which would otherwise give Steelix problems. Entei and Kabutops are also good partners, as they not only destroy Escavalier and Moltres, but also form a dangerous Fire / Water / Grass core. Qwilfish is another solid partner as it can switch into Durant and Entei and either cripple them with Thunder Wave or use them as a Spikes fodder. In return, Exeggutor deals with Rotom-C and Sceptile fairly well. It also deals with non-Hidden Power Lilligant, assuming that Exeggutor has Psyshock and Lilligant uses Sleep Powder the turn Exeggutor switches in. It should be noted that all of the aforementioned Pokemon appreciate Exeggutor's ability to absorb Scald, as many of them fare poorly against bulky Water-types and are greatly hindered when burned.</p>

[SET]

move 3: Psyshock

evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Exeggutor makes a naturally threatening sun sweeper; its high Special Attack stat allows it to burn through offensive teams with the sun up, and while fairly slow, Chlorophyll allows it to outpace most common revenge killers by a hair. What's more, Exeggutor is also rather proficient at setting up the sun on its own merit, as between its moderate bulk and threat of either a powerful attack or a Sleep Powder, it can force many Pokemon out, giving it the window necessary to use Sunny Day. Accordingly, SolarBeam is the most potent STAB move Exeggutor can utilize, as it is the most powerful and consistent move in its arsenal under the sun. On the other hand, Giga Drain offers Exeggutor a Grass-type STAB move that is usable both in and out of sun, and the recovery it provides is useful for mitigating the HP lost from Life Orb recoil and similar chip damage. Psyshock complements Exeggutor's Grass-type attacks nicely, allowing it to comfortably dispatch Pokemon, such as Emboar and Amoonguss, that would otherwise keep it in check. Sleep Powder is a very useful multi-purpose tool for Exeggutor, as it can either give it the turn necessary to set up Sunny Day safely or allow it to circumvent a potential check to it, whether it's a defensive response, such as Clefable, or an offensive one, such as Absol. However, the added coverage provided by Hidden Power Fire shouldn't be overlooked either, as with it in tow Exeggutor can much more proficiently sweep teams lacking a healthy special wall or Sucker Punch user, breezing through Pokemon such as Escavalier, Ferroseed, and Tangrowth that might have otherwise kept it in check.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The extra Speed provided by a Timid nature allows Exeggutor to outpace several important threats, both inside and out of the sun; most defensively inclined Pokemon cannot outpace Exeggutor outside of the sun, and Accelgor and Choice Scarf Rotom-C can't quite outpace it with the sun up. However, the extra power offered by a Modest nature shouldn't be overlooked, as it is capable of reinforcing KOs on notable Pokemon such as Sceptile, Gallade, Lilligant, and more. Generally, the extra power provided by Life Orb makes it the most useful item for Exeggutor, as it otherwise finds itself just short of a plethora of KOs. However, for a dedicated sun team, Heat Rock's ability to extend the turns of Sun can prove invaluable, allowing Exeggutor to sweep teams much more comfortably once they have been worn down. Hidden Power Fire can replace Psyshock on this set, which allows Exeggutor to hit Steel-types while retaining Sleep Powder, which is perfectly acceptable if it is being used as a standalone sweeper. However, this isn't an advisable choice if Exeggutor is being used on a dedicated sun team, since this leaves it unable to threaten Entei, Emboar, or Druddigon, all of which are particularly threatening to sun teams. Explosion, alongside a Naive or Rash nature, is also a useful option for Exeggutor when being used on a dedicated sun team; not only does it inflict substantial damage on problematic Fire- and Dragon-types, but it also gives a free switch to another sweeper that can capitalize on the sun Exeggutor sets up.</p>

<p>The most optimal partners for Exeggutor are those that can appropriately capitalize on the sun it brings. Choice Scarf Emboar is one such example, capable of not only utilizing the sunlight to fire off sun-boosted, STAB Flare Blitzes, but also comfortably taking on most of the Steel-types that check Exeggutor, should it forgo Hidden Power Fire. Entei fares similarly, though its lower Speed makes it unable to adequately deal with Durant. Moreover, Rock-types, such as Rhydon and Regirock, make very useful partners to Exeggutor, offering Stealth Rock support and a fallback to powerful Fire- and Flying-type attacks. Regirock in particular is a very useful pivot for dedicated sun teams, as it is capable of setting up sun itself and keeping momentum with Explosion.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Due to Exeggutor's reasonable natural bulk and high Special Attack, it makes a naturally proficient user of Choice Specs. Leaf Storm's damage output is incredible, 2HKOing even bulky Pokemon resistant to it, such as Druddigon and Entei, after Stealth Rock damage, and is therefore Exeggutor's primary means of dealing damage. With this in mind, Psyshock does an excellent job of patching up many of the "blind spots" of Leaf Storm, hitting more resilient resistances, such as Amoonguss and Moltres, as well as Sap Sipper users like Bouffalant for impressive damage. This also gives Exeggutor a more consistent STAB option, preventing dedicated special walls, most notably Clefable, from being able to simply absorb a Leaf Storm and recover off most of the damage, effectively forcing Exeggutor out. Of course, certain noteworthy Pokemon, namely Escavalier and Ferroseed, are capable of weathering these attacks rather well regardless, meaning Hidden Power Fire makes an excellent tool for drawing in and incapacitating the same. Due to both Exeggutor's admittedly sparse attacking options and lack of real necessity for further coverage, Sleep Powder makes a perfectly viable option for its final moveslot, allowing it a comparatively safe option for crippling a wide assortment of Pokemon without much risk. Of course, due to the limited application of both the final two options, Giga Drain is worth considering over both, as having a consistent Grass-type STAB move and semi-reliable recovery does grant Exeggutor somewhat more leeway mid-game, both in switching into weaker attacks and throwing around attacks without consequently becoming vulnerable to opposing setup.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given Speed investment allows Exeggutor to outpace uninvested Lanturn (assuming for the use of Hidden Power Fire), though it is more than viable to invest further in Speed. With maximum investment and a Timid nature, Exeggutor is capable of outpacing the vast majority of defensively inclined Pokemon, as well as bulky attackers such as Aggron and Bouffalant though the loss in bulk and Special Attack are both evident. Psychic can be used over Psyshock, as its increased damage output against targets such as Entei and Tangrowth can be useful at times, though typically the usefulness of Psyshock outweighs that of Psychic.</p>

<p>Choice Specs Exeggutor is best utilized as a means of paving the way for another sweeper, which should be reflected upon in partner usage. Calm Mind sweepers such as Uxie and Mesprit appreciate Exeggutor's ability to beat down on Steel-types, though they retain similar typing, and offensive Water-types such as Feraligatr and Samurott are capable of spring-boarding off Exeggutor's ability to pressure opposing bulky Grass-types. Similarly, Rock-types such as Kabutops and Rhydon appreciate Exeggutor's ability to pressure Grass-, Steel-, and Water-types decently, and in return provide a solid fallback to Fire- and Flying-type attacks.</p>

[SET]

nature: Quiet
evs: 232 HP / 24 Def / 252 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Due to its naturally low Speed and high damage output, Exeggutor makes for a very threatening Trick Room user. With a Quiet nature and minimal Speed IVs, Exeggutor is able to "outspeed" everything faster than uninvested base 34 Speed Pokemon under Trick Room, effectively allowing it to get the jump on the vast majority of the tier. From there, Leaf Storm becomes a very dangerous move to switch into, dealing hefty damage to even moderately bulky resistant Pokemon, such as Entei and Druddigon. However, the stat drop that comes with Leaf Storm can be unappealing, as it often forces it to switch out afterwards, and therefore Giga Drain is a perfectly acceptable and comparatively safer alternative as a Grass-type STAB move. Psyshock complements either move rather well, allowing Exeggutor to burst through bulky resistances such as Amoonguss and effectively pressure specially defensive Pokemon as well. In terms of sheer usefulness, Sleep Powder is the most effective choice for the final moveslot; it not only helps Exeggutor find a window to safely set up Trick Room, but also prevents it from becoming vulnerable to opposing setup upon using Leaf Storm. Sleep Powder also provides Exeggutor a means of circumventing Sucker Punch attempts from Pokemon such as Absol and Spiritomb, both of which are inherently problematic for Trick Room users to handle.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Harvest, while not offering any immediate benefits for the set, does prevent Exeggutor from having its Speed stat compromised by any potential Sunny Day inducers, as rare as that may be. While it doesn't truly capitalize on Harvest, a Colbur Berry is a viable alternative for Exeggutor if the drop in power isn't an issue, as the reinforced ability to take on Sucker Punch users and similar Dark-type attacks is rather useful for circumventing some of its offensive checks. Psychic offers an alternative Psychic-type STAB move, and while Psyshock is often preferable for its ability to break through special walls more comfortably, the extra damage against more physically bulky Grass resistances, such as Entei and Tangrowth, gives Psychic some merit. Exeggutor can forgo Sleep Powder for Hidden Power Fire, aiming to take on bulky Steel-types more comfortably, which is hardly unreasonable when considering that an uninvested Escavalier, a very threatening Pokemon under Trick Room, is capable of naturally outpacing Exeggutor under Trick Room. Moreover, Explosion can replace Sleep Powder, as it gives Exeggutor the ability to set up Trick Room for a partner and immediately give that partner a safe switch in, inflicting reasonable damage to most opposing Pokemon in the process.</p>

<p>Naturally, bulky attackers pair nicely with Exeggutor, capitalizing on Trick Room and supporting Exeggutor defensively. Examples of this include Druddigon and Aggron, as they not only are capable of thrashing teams with their powerful attacks under Trick Room, but can also greatly pressure Steel-types alongside Exeggutor, limiting their effectiveness in checking this core. Emboar, particularly Choice Band and mixed variants, also makes for a useful partner to Exeggutor; it benefits greatly from the Trick Room support Exeggutor provides, and in return provides a strong pivot into Pokemon such as Escavalier and Tangrowth. Slowking, despite sharing a Psychic typing with Exeggutor, provides a solid secondary Trick Room setter that supports it offensively, and the duo is capable of either threatening or overloading one another's check effectively.</p>

[SET]
name: Leech Seed
move 1: Leech Seed
move 2: Sleep Powder
move 3: Substitute / Protect
move 4: Psyshock / Hidden Power Fire
item: Sitrus Berry
ability: Harvest
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 156 Def / 100 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Between respectable bulk, a series of significant resistances, and an impressive level of recovery via Harvest-fueled Sitrus Berries, Exeggutor can function as an impressive defensive tank. This vitality, when coupled with the recovery offered by Leech Seed, makes Exeggutor very difficult to KO, while simultaneously chipping away at the opponent. However, it is often difficult to initiate that Leech Seed cycle due to Exeggutor's lack of offensive presence, which is where Sleep Powder comes into play; by incapacitating a Pokemon for a minimum of one turn, Exeggutor is capable of safely setting up its Leech Seed, thereby improving its chances of stalling out the opponent. From this point, Exeggutor's primary objective becomes extending its own staying power, furthering its ability to chip away at Pokemon. For this purpose, Substitute is the option that offers the most tangible benefits to Exeggutor, protecting it from both status and powerful attacks while sapping away HP with Leech Seed. However, due to Exeggutor's low Speed, it is not always realistic to stall out by the merit of Substitute alone. Therefore, Protect makes a reasonable alternative, similarly allowing Exeggutor to stall out the opponent and providing the ability to scout moves in lieu of the ability to more effectively avoid status. Psyshock ensures that Exeggutor is not entirely reliant on Leech Seed to inflict damage upon the opponent; it allows Exeggutor to apply pressure to most Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed, apply additional pressure to Pokemon with recovery moves, and prevent Qwilfish, the most notable Taunt user of the tier, from shutting it down and setting up entry hazards on it. Hidden Power Fire, though it sacrifices the consistency of a STAB move and the ability to combat Qwilfish, is capable of similarly pressuring Grass-types, while threatening some significant targets Psyshock misses out on, such as Durant, Escavalier, and Ferroseed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread, in tandem with a Bold nature, seeks to maximize Exeggutor's ability to tank and whittle away at physically based threats, with enough Speed to outpace minimally invested Lanturn, allowing it to either put Lanturn to sleep or set up a Substitute before compromising itself to status. A faster spread, specifically 248 HP / 16 Def / 244 Spe, can be used in order to get the jump on the vast majority of defensively inclined Pokemon and bulky attackers, though Exeggutor sacrifices a substantial amount of bulk in doing so. Due to the very precise nature of the set, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to make room for alternative move options to work with. However, it is technically possible to utilize Giga Drain over either Protect or Substitute, shifting Exeggutor's role from a stall-oriented tank to that of a defensive pivot, though it does face some serious competition from Tangrowth and Amoonguss in this role.</p>

<p>Exeggutor greatly benefits from Toxic Spikes, as the additional damage they can accrue alongside Leech Seed facilitates the stalling process immensely, though they can also be highly detrimental to it if they remain on its side of the field. Therefore, a Poison-type Toxic Spikes setter, such as Qwilfish or Drapion, is very helpful. Furthermore, supporting Exeggutor with a cleric, such as Clefable or Lickilicky, can further bolster it against the possibility of life-shortening status. In addition to status, Magic Guard users, such as Clefable and Sigilyph, give Exeggutor a great deal of grief, as they can't be stalled out through Leech Seed or status. A Pursuit user, such as Absol, Escavalier, or Spiritomb, does wonders for this dilemma, either isolating and KOing them or bringing them down to the point where Exeggutor can usually take them out with a Psyshock upon their next switch-in.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Although Sleep Powder is generally the most consistently significant, Stun Spore could be used either over or alongside it to allow Exeggutor to cripple faster threats on the switch, though the majority of common switch-ins to it are naturally slow. Exeggutor could utilize Reflect and Light Screen, either in a dedicated dual screens set or as a stand-alone support option, but often Uxie outclasses it in both respects. Of course, Exeggutor's Attack and complimenting physical movepool is also usable, albeit somewhat weaker overall, and it is therefore more than capable of utilizing a Swords Dance set to capitalize on this. However, Exeggutor's low Speed makes it ill-suited in a sweeping role outside of either Trick Room or sun, and even under these conditions it requires notable team support in order to avoid being otherwise outclassed. An option not mentioned directly is that of a mixed attacking set, utilizing Exeggutor's decent Attack stat with moves such as Nature Power and Low Kick, which under sun can prove fairly effectual. However, it should be noted that, with some rare exceptions, many targets of these moves are aptly covered with either Psyshock or Hidden Power Fire, making the idea of spreading EVs across multiple stats somewhat undesirable.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>As Exeggutor is a moderately versatile Pokemon, outright countering it is a rather daunting task, though it hinges largely on two issues: what set it is running, and whether or not it has put something to sleep with Sleep Powder. Bulkier sleep absorbers, such as Entei, Escavalier, and Druddigon (particularly defensive variants), make for fairly safe initial switch-ins, only being threatened heavily by the more offensive Exeggutor variants and in turn threatening Exeggutor with their own strong attacks. The latter two are even capable of pressuring fleeing Exeggutor with Pursuit, further improving their ability to combat it. Pokemon immune to Sleep Powder, such as Bouffalant, Magmortar, and Sap Sipper Miltank, are generally capable of switching into and subsequently threatening Exeggutor, though none of these Pokemon appreciate switching into a Psyshock from more offensively oriented Exeggutor, and Magmortar specifically has a reasonable chance of being OHKOed by an unboosted Psyshock after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>After Sleep Powder has been utilized effectively, far more Pokemon find the opportunity to switch into Exeggutor safely; Pokemon such as Bulk Up Braviary, Druddigon, and Uxie all switch into Exeggutor's attacks with moderate ease, then threaten it in one way or another in turn. Strong Fire-types, such as Emboar and Entei, fall similarly into this category, though neither stomach Psyshock particularly well. Furthermore, once Sleep Powder has been used, Pursuit users, such as Absol, Escavalier, and Spiritomb, have a much easier time switching into and picking off Exeggutor, as long as they remain wary of the appropriate attacking move. Of course, should Exeggutor be lacking an item to boost its damage output, namely Choice Specs or Life Orb, issues with switching in are significantly diminished, as it becomes much easier to switch into and absorb Exeggutor's attacks, though this in turn means that it will be far more durable thanks to Harvest-renewable berries. Magic Guard Pokemon, namely Clefable and Sigilyph, are perfect examples of Pokemon that prey on a less offensive Exeggutor, being capable of safely switching into and finding free turns against most, if not all, defensively oriented Exeggutor. Moreover, while Harvest-reliant variants of Exeggutor do prove fairly difficult to wear down, they are rather susceptible to lure sets, such as Expert Belt Manectric and Rotom-C, which puts it in a position of caution when taking on such Pokemon. Of course, while this isn't the most ideal means of approaching Exeggutor offensively, it can be worn down by stacking hazards such as  Toxic Spikes, which puts a draining timer on any Exeggutor lacking Lum Berry, and continuing to force it out with Pokemon such as Accelgor, Cryogonal, and Galvantula, though they do struggle to switch in under normal circumstances.</p>
