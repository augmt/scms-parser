[Overview]

<p>A remnant of the rebellious late 90's fashion trends, Jynx's competitive merits are by no means as grotesque as her aesthetics. Sporting an excellent base 115 Special Attack, coupled with a superb base 95 Speed, Jynx is one of the most potent special attackers in RU. Dream World bestowed Jynx with one amazing ability, Dry Skin. With Dry Skin, Jynx can set up on bulky Water-types such as Lanturn and Alomomola. Moreover, Jynx's signature move Lovely Kiss allows her to incapacitate almost any opponent, then taking advantage of the situation to set up a Substitute or acquire a Nasty Plot boost.</p> 

<p>Unfortunately, the bane of Jynx's existence is her frailty, horrendous defensive typing, and her Stealth Rock weakness. To make matters worse, priority attackers run rampant in RU and almost all of them can outright OHKO Jynx. Jynx's movepool doesn't give her any relief either, as she frequently has to rely on two inaccurate moves in Lovely Kiss and Focus Blast to sweep; if either of the aforementioned moves miss, it will likely mean the end of Jynx. While taking an attack isn't in her best interest, dishing one out most certainly is. When played to her strengths, Jynx's offensive prowess is daunting.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Coalescing Jynx's pivotal attributes of Speed, power, coverage, and a reliable sleeping move, Jynx is able reach her full offensive potential with this set. Ice Beam is Jynx's most powerful reliable move, OHKOing bulky Pokemon such as Druddigon and Braviary. Psyshock targets Pokemon that Ice Beam cannot break past, namely pesky special walls such as Clefable, Cryogonal, and Lanturn. Focus Blast destroys Steel-types such as Steelix and Magneton. Due to Focus Blast's unappealing accuracy, Hidden Power Fire can be used. On top of the improved accuracy, Hidden Power Fire has the added bonus of OHKOing Durant and Escavalier. With Lovely Kiss, Jynx can potentially disable a counter for the entirety of the match; from there, Jynx can bombard the foe with attacks or let a teammate remove it.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Energy Ball is a reliable option to OHKO Kabutops and to nail Slowking, who would otherwise wall Jynx. Nasty Plot and Psychic are two other options. Psychic hits physical walls such as Hariyama and Alomomola, while Nasty Plot boosts Jynx's Special Attack to terrifying levels. Finally, Jynx can use Choice Specs to boost her power without the cost of recoil. If Jynx does use Choice Specs, she should probably use Trick over Lovely Kiss, giving up a sleep move but allowing her to cripple a wall such as Slowking.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock support is much appreciated as it allows Jynx to put more pressure on the opponent. Speaking of Stealth Rock, the pointed stones limit Jynx's switching opportunities. Thus, Kabutops partners well with Jynx, eliminating Stealth Rock and dealing with troublesome Fire-types. In return, Jynx can take out Rotom-C and Lilligant, two problematic Grass-types. Just like Kabutops, Poliwrath and Slowking can take on an array of pesky Fire-types like Typhlosion and Entei.</p> 

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Jynx's poor bulk makes her vulnerable to priority attacks and faster threats. An intact Substitute mitigates this flaw. Nasty Plot is the second most important aspect of the set, as after a few boosts, Jynx will be powerful enough to 2HKO Slowking and Lanturn, Pokemon who resist her attacks. Ice Beam is the chosen attack because no Pokemon is immune to Ice-type attacks, meaning Jynx can even plow through resists after a Nasty Plot boost or two. Lovely Kiss ensures that Jynx gets to set up at least one Nasty Plot by disabling a counter or a faster revenge killer.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Life Orb can be used over Leftovers to gain a power boost, however, it will limit the amount of times Jynx can set up a Substitute and make her reliant on Wish support from either Clefable or Alomomola. Psychic or Psyshock can be used over Lovely Kiss so that Jynx isn't walled by Fire- and Water-type Pokemon, and another coverage move of choice can work as well. Do keep in mind that, without Lovely Kiss, Jynx will accumulate fewer boosts on average.</p> 

<p>Jynx appreciates entry hazard support, as well as a way to handle Cinccino and Klinklang. Ferroseed and Steelix can both set up Stealth Rock and deal with Cinccino, a troublesome Pokemon for any Substitute user. Rapid Spin support from Cryogonal and Kabutops is not necessary, however, it extends Jynx's longevity, giving her more opportunities to come in and set up. Roselia, Omastar, and Qwilfish can set up Toxic Spikes in order to break down resilient walls; they can also set up Spikes to soften up the opposing team. Offensive Grass-types such as Sceptile and Lilligant can break through bulky Water-types, letting Jynx sweep more easily. In the same vein, Fighting-types like Gallade and Fire-types such as Moltres can destroy the plethora of Steel-types that harry Jynx.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Ice Beam
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Focus Blast 
move 4: Trick / Lovely Kiss
item: Choice Scarf

nature: Timid
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to her good movepool, incredible damage output, and great Speed, Jynx can effectively run a Choice Scarf. Ice Beam allows Jynx to OHKO +1 Lilligant and Choice Scarf Moltres after Stealth Rock. Psychic lets Jynx revenge kill a weakened Feraligatr and Kabutops, as both of them will be unable to touch Jynx with Aqua Jet thanks to her ability, Dry Skin. Choice Scarf Jynx is able to outspeed Cinccino, Durant, +2 Omastar, and +2 Aggron and OHKO them with Focus Blast after Stealth Rock. Trick can be used to cripple Slowking, while Lovely Kiss can put a threatening Pokemon like +2 Escavalier out of commission.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs maximize Jynx's Speed and Special Attack, making the most of her power. The other four EVs are put into Defense rather than HP to let Jynx switch in on Stealth Rock four times before dying. Energy Ball allows Jynx to more reliably revenge kill Feraligatr and Kabutops. Psyshock can be used to target specially defensive Pokemon like Lanturn and Cryogonal. Finally, Hidden Power Fire can be used to revenge kill Durant and Escavalier.</p>

<p>Jynx appreciates powerful wallbreakers such as Moltres, Absol, Gallade, and Sceptile are needed in order to soften up the opposing team, allowing it to clean up fairly easily. Entry hazard support from Druddigon and Scolipede is also helpful in chipping away at the opposing team. Rapid Spin support from Cryogonal and Kabutops is useful because Jynx will not be restricted to the amount of times it can switch in. Finally, Pokemon who can get rid of priority users like Spiritomb are also good partners. Of those Pokemon, Klinklang and Aggron can use Spiritomb as setup bait.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Jynx can use her well-known Luna set; a Calm Mind set with max HP and Speed. Luna is not quite as effective is it used to be due to the offensive nature of the current metagame; however, with stall teams becoming more common, the Luna set is an incredible weapon against the archetype. Taunt can be used to stop slower Pokemon from setting up effects, especially Stealth Rock. In a similar vein, Magic Coat can bounce back entry hazards or status afflictions. Signal Beam is an interesting attack that can target both Psychic- and Dark-type Pokemon; however, Ice Beam will usually hit harder. Due to Jynx's frailty, Focus Sash can be used, giving her more opportunities to attack. Grass Knot hits Slowking harder than Energy Ball, but it does very little to Lanturn, making it an inferior choice. Finally, Shadow Ball can target Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon making it an acceptable option as well.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Countering Jynx can be cumbersome before Sleep Clause is activated; once it is, Slowking is Jynx's best counter. Slowking takes very little from most of Jynx's attacks and can melt her with Fire Blast; however, Slowking has to avoid an Energy Ball or a boosted Blizzard. Sleep Talk users such as Emboar, Escavalier, Entei, and defensive Spiritomb can all absorb Lovely Kiss and scare Jynx out. Cryogonal and defensive Magneton can both check Jynx fairly well. Cryogonal has to watch out for Psyshock while Magneton has to steer clear of Focus Blast. Specially defensive Escavalier is also a great check so long as Jynx does not have Hidden Power Fire. Entei's great bulk, resistance to Ice-type attacks, and powerful priority move in Extreme Speed make it one of the best Jynx checks in RU. Speaking of priority attacks, Choice Band Spiritomb, Absol, Gallade, and Hariyama can all take advantage of Jynx's pitiful defenses and revenge kill her with their priority moves. Absol, Spiritomb, and Escavalier can even Pursuit trap Jynx on a predicted switch.</p> 

<p>Stealth Rock helps deal with Jynx, as the residual damage piles up quickly, especially if she uses Life Orb. Finally, because of Jynx's lackluster defenses, any Pokemon that is faster than Jynx and carries a strong neutral attack can outright OHKO her. Cinccino gets a special mention as it is even able to revenge kill Jynx behind a Substitute thanks to Rock Blast and Tail Slap. Accelgor, Galvantula, and Archeops can all outspeed Jynx and OHKO with their powerful STABs. So long as Stealth Rock is not on the field, Typhlosion can switch in once on Jynx and OHKO with Fire Blast.</p>
