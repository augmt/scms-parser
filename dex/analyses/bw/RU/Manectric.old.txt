[Overview]

<p>RU is not short of Electric-types and Manectric is one of the better ones out there. Sporting great coverage with solid Special Attack and Speed, Manectric is able to threaten defensive and offensive teams alike. Manectric is one of very few Choice Scarf users that can revenge kill +2 Omastar and +1 Lilligant without too many issues. Utility moves in the form of Volt Switch and Switcheroo only augment Manectric's ability to wield Choice items effectively. It is also blessed with a great ability in Lightningrod. Thanks to this ability, Manectric is capable of not only absorbing Electric-type moves like Volt Switch and Thunder Wave but is also capable of sweeping thanks to the Special Attack boost granted if Lightningrod is activated. Manectric makes for one of the best Choice Scarf users in RU because of these traits.</p>

<p>However, Manectric does have some issues to overcome in RU. Although it has high Special Attack and Speed, Manectric's defenses are meager and can even make switching into a defensive threat like Lanturn a bit of a risk. Manectric's lack of usable resistances and immunities only magnifies this problem. While Electric / Fire / Grass coverage is still very good, it is now flawed with Druddigon being such a common threat. Although Manectric can utilize Hidden Power Ice to navigate past Druddigon, this would open it up to Rhydon, thus leaving quite the difficult choice when it comes to choosing a Hidden Power type. While Manectric may not be the best Electric-type in the tier, it is certainly a threat you need to be ready for.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Manectric has all of the qualities necessary to be a solid Choice Scarf user. Equipped with a momentum-building move, Switcheroo, and the ability to revenge kill serious threats that few other Choice Scarf users can, Manectric is the best example of an "insurance" Pokemon for offensive teams to use. Volt Switch allows Manectric to build or maintain offensive momentum while scouting for possible checks and counters. Overheat is an incredibly useful tool for Manectric, as it OHKOes +1 Lilligant, something almost no other Choice Scarf user can do without taking a hit first. Thunderbolt is a great cleaning move for Manectric and also allows it to use a STAB move and stay on the field if the need arises. Switcheroo rounds out the set and allows Manectric to cripple an opposing wall that it might have difficulty beating otherwise, such as Rhydon or Clefable.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Lightningrod should always be used as it grants Manectric an immunity to all Electric-type moves, including Thunder Wave. The resulting Special Attack boost can even aid a possible late-game sweep. Hidden Power Grass can be used to deal with Rock Polish Rhydon and Golurk, but both are quite rare and Golurk is hit just as hard by Overheat. Hidden Power Ice is an option if Druddigon is really annoying you, but it will fail to 2HKO most variants. Flamethrower can be used over Overheat if you find yourself using Switcheroo a lot, and if you don't like the Special Attack drop that is caused by Overheat. However, you must be wary that Flamethrower misses the OHKO on +1 Lilligant, a major target that Manectric can KO with Overheat.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, Manectric is more of an "insurance" Pokemon to use when threats get out of control, so it doesn't require a lot of support to function at optimal capacity. Manectric has a hard time with Druddigon, as even Switcheroo will only limit Druddigon's effectiveness. For this reason, Steel-types such as Aggron and Escavalier make for good partners to sponge its powerful Dragon-type attacks while immediately threatening Druddigon with their STAB moves. Rapid Spin support is welcome as it will let Manectric use Volt Switch with much more freedom. Kabutops fits the bill nicely as it can lure in Electric-type moves for Manectric to switch in on. Cryogonal isn't bad either as it's immune to Ground-type moves, but it does struggle against the most common spinblocker in the tier, Spiritomb. Mesprit is a solid partner, in particular its Choice Specs set. Mesprit is immune to Ground-type moves and can quickly weaken the special walls that may try to stop Manectric from revenge killing or going on a late-game sweep with Choice Specs-boosted Psyshocks. Manectric also functions well on VoltTurn teams. Braviary, Rotom-C, Eelektross, and the aforementioned Mesprit can all use either Volt Switch or U-turn if you choose to use a VoltTurn core.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to capitalize on Manectric's great coverage and solid Speed to turn it into a wallbreaker that can still pose a legitimate sweeping threat with its base 105 Speed and Special Attack. Volt Switch is Manectric's main STAB move on this set, as it allows Manectric to scout out how the opponent wants to play against it, thus giving you an advantage the next time Manectric comes in. Flamethrower is used for its consistency and lack of Special Attack drops. It allows Manectric to easily get past the likes of Ferroseed, Steelix, and Tangrowth, all of which may come in to take Manectric's Electric-type STAB moves. Thunderbolt provides Manectric with a reliable STAB move that allows it to stay in and clean up late-game when the chance arises. In the last slot, a Hidden Power type needs to be chosen. Due to how common Druddigon is, Hidden Power Ice is generally preferred to allow Manectric to 2HKO all but specially defensive variants of Druddigon. However, Hidden Power Grass is an option to OHKO Rhydon, a serious threat that can easily demolish Manectric otherwise.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The item choice is a tough one, but the ability to switch moves and bluff a Choice item with Expert Belt is generally preferred. Choice Specs is still a solid option for the significant power boost Manectric gains, especially on bulkier targets it can't hit for super effective damage, such as Uxie, Spiritomb, and Mesprit. Life Orb might seem like a middle ground of sorts, but it wears down Manectric way too quickly. Overheat and Switcheroo are two options to consider if you use Choice Specs. Overheat can destroy Cryogonal, but it has little use outside of that. Switcheroo can cripple walls, but Manectric can just as easily use Expert Belt, or even Life Orb, to break them down with its great coverage.</p>

<p>This set is one of the best Regenerator core killers in the entire tier, so Pokemon that appreciate not having to deal with these types of Pokemon are great teammates. Fire-types such as Emboar and Entei enjoy having Slowking and Alomomola removed from play so they can use their powerful STAB moves with more freedom. Kabutops provides Rapid Spin support, draws in Electric-type moves, and enjoys not having to deal with Tangrowth and Ferroseed. Fighting-types such as Gallade and Hitmonlee are more than capable of taking out Clefable and Cryogonal, which can open the door for Manectric to sweep late-game. Rhydon can be a pretty big pain for this set if Manectric lacks Hidden Power Grass, so having something that can take its powerful moves can be helpful. For this reason, Torterra can be a pretty solid partner as it resists Ground-type moves and it appreciates having Tangrowth removed since it matches up well against most other defensive Pokemon in the tier. Manectric still performs well on VoltTurn teams, so pairing it with Pokemon such as Braviary and Mesprit can be worthwhile. Braviary appreciates Manectric's ability to remove most Steel-type Pokemon while Choice Specs Mesprit can easily break down special walls, such as Clefable and Lanturn, with its STAB Psyshock.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Manectric doesn't have a very wide movepool, but there are a few options to look at. Discharge and Charge Beam are alternative STAB moves that Manectric can use. Discharge has a better paralysis rate and Charge Beam can boost Manectric's Special Attack, but the utility of Volt Switch and reliable power of Thunderbolt is generally preferred. Thunder Wave can cripple faster threats, but Manectric is usually being met with more defensive Pokemon that can tank some of its attacks. Manectric has Howl to boost its Attack along with Wild Charge, the elemental fangs, and Crunch, but its base 75 Attack is mediocre at best. Light Screen can cushion special attacks for Manectric and its team, but even then, Manectric will still be taking serious damage from most powerful special attackers.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The best answers to Manectric are Clefable and Lanturn. Clefable is able to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Thunderbolt while Lanturn only fears the odd Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Grass. Dragon-types such as Druddigon and Zweilous can switch in on the Electric- and Fire-type moves Manectric commonly carries and deal major damage with their powerful STAB moves. However, both need to be careful of a possible Hidden Power Ice. Rhydon is in a similar boat in that it can take on any Manectric lacking Hidden Power Grass as Eviolite sets can avoid the 2HKO from Hidden Power Ice, but a Switcheroo can quickly limit its defensive capabilities. Offensive Pokemon that have good special bulk, such as Gallade and Bouffalant, are good checks, as they can tank any hit and KO back with their powerful STAB moves. Entei is able to take on Manectric decently well as it can use its STAB Flare Blitz or a powerful Extreme Speed to hit Manectric hard. Rotom resists Manectric's STAB moves and it can use a STAB Shadow Ball to deal significant damage to Manectric. Golurk isn't OHKOed by a super effective Hidden Power and can easily KO back with Earthquake.</p>

<p>Priority moves are another way to deal with Manectric as its meager defenses means it will take quite a bit of damage from most of them. Absol and Spiritomb are able to use Sucker Punch and both can even Pursuit Manectric if it decides to switch out. Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee can hit hard with STAB Mach Punch; Hitmonchan's is backed by a Life Orb and Iron Fist, while Hitmonlee's will usually be powered up with a Fighting Gem. However, you shouldn't be switching these threats into Manectric as it has a high possibility of Volt Switching out. Cryogonal is a great answer to the Choice Scarf set, but it has a much harder time with the special attacker set. Speaking of the special attacker, it is outsped by Durant, Sceptile, and most other Choice Scarf users in the tier. If all else fails, you can use your own Manectric to take advantage of possible Volt Switches and Thunderbolts to gain a Special Attack boost to try and sweep. However, you must take caution in going this route, because Overheat or even Hidden Power will hurt.</p>
