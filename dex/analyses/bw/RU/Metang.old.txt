[Overview]

<p>Right after the release of Pokemon Black 2 and White 2, the Smogon tiers were once again updated based on the usage over the last three months; pretty standard and predictable stuff for the most part. But here's the big surprise, possibly the biggest surprise of all the tier shifts: Metang, humble little Metang sitting in PU, has risen to RU. What the hell?! If you use Metang in a few battles, you will see that what it lacks in stats, it makes up for with one, very special quality. You see, Metang creates an automatic win condition whenever it enters the battle; unless the opponent can stop laughing before the timer runs out, they will lose--no matter what!</p>

<p>Billy Mays here with a limited time offer; our brand new product for the RU tier. Combining the incredible defensive capabilities of the Steel-type and Eviolite, Metang will make a splash hit for all those watching at home. For just the cost of one teamslot, you can get your own Metang today, as well a beautiful Eviolite stone that can be used as a gift, or a Cell Battery to make sure your Metang doesn't run out of juice! But that's not all! Call now and we will add an extra Stealth Rock to your order! This decorative piece is perfect for filling your Stealth Rock needs!

Get yours today for not three teamslots, not even two--call now and get our limited edition Metang at the price of only a single teamslot!

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>We are not responsible for hair pulling, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, or death caused by this product. Use at your own risk, and don't allow children near its small parts. Your Stoutland are allowed to go near it though, because unlike our rival business's product, Escavalier, Metang is much more fire retardant; as long as Metang doesn't get hit by a Fire Fang, it has nothing to fear from your pet Stoutland or Herdier! As one satisfied customer once said:</p>

<p><strong>&lt;TLCNU&gt;</strong> Escavalier literally is 2HKOed by Stoutland Fire Fang, Metang was undoubtedly the much better choice.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Despite the effect that Metang has on a battle when it enters the field, it is not without its flaws. Perhaps the most crippling of these is that if your opponent manages to contain their laughter and keep playing the battle, you're basically playing with one Pokemon down. Aside from everything, the best counter to Metang is in fact, another Metang! Metang loses to everything, including itself, so keep that in mind when you are using it.</p>
