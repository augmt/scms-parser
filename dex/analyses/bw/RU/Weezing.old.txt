[Overview]

<p>In a tier full of physical attackers, each of which has the power to devastate an entire team, there is one Pokemon that can take them all on: Weezing. With an excellent defensive typing in Poison, which resists the powerful Fighting-type, access to Will-O-Wisp to burn opponents, and semi-reliable recovery in the form of Pain Split, Weezing is an excellent choice for a physical wall. Don't get too excited though; Weezing, although bulky, is not impossible to break through. Weezing's Special Defense is nothing compared to its Defense and he will fold to powerful special attacks. Despite having recovery, Pain Split is not very reliable on a weakened Pokemon, so Weezing has issues taking repeated physical attacks. This, along with competition from Tangrowth and Uxie, places Weezing under the radar when looking for a physical wall. Don't worry, though, as Weezing is still an incredible defensive Pokemon</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Weezing makes an excellent switch-in to all of the Grass-, Bug-, Poison-, and especially Fighting-type Pokemon in the tier. Whether it is Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, or Gurdurr, Weezing always comes out on top against these threats. Will-O-Wisp is one of Weezing's main selling points, allowing him to become nearly unbreakable if he can land a burn on a physical attacker. Weezing beats two of the most common hazard users one-on-one; Ferroseed and Qwilfish are felled by Fire Blast and Thunderbolt, respectively. These two moves are preferred as attacks over Sludge Bomb, as they provide superior coverage. Pain Split is Weezing's most dependable method of recovery, and it drains health away from the opponent. Sadly, it is not reliable against weakened opponents, so Weezing might struggle to survive later in the match.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A now age-old argument is which hazing move is better: Haze or Clear Smog. While Clear Smog does damage, Haze bypasses Substitutes and Steel-types such as Klinklang. It is a matter of preference as to which hazing move to use, if any at all. Rest is an option over Pain Split if you want a method to remove status. If you use Rest, it is recommended that you use Sleep Talk over one of the attacking moves. Whichever recovery move you use, it is advisable to provide Weezing with Wish and cleric support. Clefable makes an excellent teammate, taking special attacks for Weezing and being able to heal him with a large Wish. In return, Weezing aids Clefable by taking the Fighting-type attacks that Clefable despises. Miltank also makes an excellent teammate for removing Weezing's sleep with Heal Bell if Weezing packs Rest over Pain Split.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Will-O-Wisp

nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Weezing, despite usually having pitiful special bulk, can actually tank a special hit or two when fully invested. This set makes him an excellent check to resisted special attackers such as Sceptile and Lilligant. Weezing can now switch in on resisted special attacks and start his walling game. Will-O-Wisp allows Weezing to spread burns to stop plotting physical attackers, while Rest + Sleep Talk allows Weezing to be an excellent sleep absorber that can reliably switch into Lilligant. Pain Split is still an option, however, as it heals him without putting him to sleep. Because Weezing may be running only one attack, Flamethrower is the best option for this set. If you are running two attacks, Fire Blast is viable for the added power.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Haze and Clear Smog are always options over Thunderbolt to counter Lilligant. Stockpile can be used over Will-O-Wisp with Toxic Spikes support to stall out opponents easily. Once again, Weezing enjoys Wish support from a Pokemon such as Clefable, as well as cleric support from Pokemon such as Miltank. Sludge Bomb is an option if you are running a mono-attacker set, but it leaves you vulnerable to Steel-types. Weezing also pairs well with specially defensive Pokemon such as Slowking and Munchlax to take Psychic-type attacks and strong special attacks for him, while both also appreciate Weezing checking Tangrowth for them.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Memento is a trump card to support one of your setup sweepers, but it is counterproductive for a wall to faint itself. Toxic sets a timer on the opposition, but it conflicts with Will-O-Wisp and Weezing has a hard time finding a moveslot for it. Taunt can be used to stop setup sweepers from using Weezing as setup fodder, but Clear Smog and Haze wipe the boosts clean anyway.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Powerful Psychic-type attackers such as Slowking and Gardevoir will crush even specially defensive sets; in fact, without major special defensive investment, most special attacks will make Weezing explode. Typhlosion gets a special mention as it can safely switch in on Will-O-Wisp and start wreaking havoc with Eruption. Entei is one of the few physical attackers that can stop Weezing, being immune to Will-O-Wisp and seriously hurting Weezing with Flare Blitz. Medicham can lure in Weezing expecting to take a High Jump Kick and 2HKO with Zen Headbutt. Swellow can take advantage of the burn from Will-O-Wisp and threaten Weezing with a STAB Facade, but cannot absorb a Thunderbolt. On top of all of this, due to a near lack of recovery, Weezing has trouble taking repeated attacks and will fall eventually.</p>
