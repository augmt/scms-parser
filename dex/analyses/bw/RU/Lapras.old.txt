[Overview]

<p>Used by Ash in the Orange Islands as his "HM Slave," Lapras is back as a force to be reckoned with in the BW RU metagame. It received a great ability in Hydration from the Dream World, but is hindered by the lack of permanent weather in RU. Its other ability is Water Absorb, giving it a way to restore its HP outside of Rest + Hydration. It also has a superb base 130 HP stat and a solid base 95 Special Defense stat. However, Lapras is held back from becoming a fantastic wall due to its weakness to Electric-type attacks, which are common in the RU tier. While Lapras's other stats are nothing short of average, it does have access to great boosting moves in Curse and Dragon Dance, allowing it to become an offensive threat quite easily. Unfortunately, its awful base 60 Speed makes the Dragon Dance set less effective; however, it can still be major problems to the opposition. While it may not look that deadly, after a couple of boosts, Lapras can easily destroy teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Anyone who considers Lapras "cute" will get manhandled by this set. Despite its timid appearance, Lapras is actually a solid user of Dragon Dance, one of the premier boosting moves in the world of competitive Pokemon. Waterfall is its main STAB move, and is helped significantly by Lapras's access to Return, forming the mostly unresisted Water + Normal combination. Ice Shard is the main option in the last slot, giving Lapras priority STAB; it also helps Lapras with its middling Speed, as it is relatively slow even after a Dragon Dance. Substitute is also an option in the last slot, blocking status and letting Lapras set up more easily on weaker attackers. Water Absorb makes foes pay for spamming Water-type attacks, and Leftovers gives Lapras a way to recover its health outside of the unreliable Water Absorb. Life Orb is also an option to let Lapras hit harder, but its recoil is undesirable.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread lets Lapras outrun positive base 110 Speed Pokemon after a Dragon Dance when a Jolly nature is used. An Adamant nature helps Lapras hit harder but lets Pokemon, such as Archeops and Galvantula, outrun it after a boost. 252 Attack EVs maximize Lapras's offensive capabilities, and the remaining EVs are dumped into HP for added bulk. Lapras is set apart from other Dragon Dancers in RU because of its bulk, allowing it to survive priority moves from the likes of Absol and Entei; it can also survive a Mach Punch from Hitmonchan. Most Pokemon utilizing Choice Scarf are also unable to OHKO Lapras. However, Fighting-types still pose a problem for it, reducing the opportunities it has to set up. Therefore, Ghost-type Pokemon, such as Spiritomb and Dusknoir, are good partners for Lapras.</p> 

<p>Magneton is also a good partner, as Ferroseed stops Lapras cold. It also appreciates Rapid Spin support; Sandslash is a great partner since it spins and can provide Stealth Rock. Hazard support is also useful, aiding Lapras in tearing through the opponent's team; Ferroseed gets a special mention as it sets up hazards easily and defeats most Electric-types in the tier. Zen Headbutt is an option over Return to hit Fighting-types harder, but the coverage Return provides usually makes it the better option. Finally, Lapras can go mixed with Hydro Pump or Ice Beam in the last slot to more easily defeat the likes of Steelix and Tangrowth.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Curse
move 2: Waterfall

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Dragon Dance would seem to be the best stat boosting option for Lapras, it also has access to Curse, a more defensive boosting move. Unlike the Dragon Dance set, this set attempts to set up late-game when all of the opposing Fighting-, Electric-, and Grass-types are either severely weakened or knocked out. Thanks to its gargantuan base 130 HP, Lapras can sponge non-super effective hits quite easily, allowing it to set up and decimate the opposition. Waterfall is the STAB move of choice, and Avalanche is Lapras's secondary STAB move, allowing it to deal massive damage to the opposition as it will be moving last basically every turn. Ice Shard is another option, however, allowing Lapras to bypass the Speed drops from Curse and hammer opposing sweepers. Finally, Toxic wears down walls that would otherwise be too much of a problem for Lapras to take down itself. Water Absorb is the ability of choice, giving Lapras a chance of restoring its health. Leftovers is the item of choice, restoring a little bit of Lapras's health at the end of every turn. However, a Chesto Berry can be used with Rest over Toxic in order to provide Lapras with a way to restore its HP and get rid of status.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Entry hazards and status can be problems for this Lapras. This problem is compounded if Lapras is not running ChestoRest. A simple way to solve this problem is to run a moveset of Curse / Waterfall / Rain Dance / Rest with a Chesto Berry and Hydration as the ability, Lapras can heal itself of all damage dealt to it and also become "immune" to status. This set works best on a rain team, so Lapras does not have to constantly set up its own rain. Also, entry hazards are still a problem, so a spinner, such as Sandslash, is a big help.</p>

<p>This Lapras also appreciates the removal of phazers, such as Mandibuzz, and Fighting-, Electric-, and Grass-types. Ghost-types, such as Spiritomb, can be good partners, as they can completely wall Fighting-types. Fire-types can take care of Grass-types, but they will be hampered if Lapras is running a HydraRest set, as the power of their STAB Fire-type attacks is reduced in rain. Most of the Electric-types in the RU metagame are extremely frail, and are easier to get rid of. Finally, entry hazard support is very beneficial, allowing Lapras to have a much easier time demolishing the opposition; they especially help with taking out Pokemon such as Galvantula and Manectric.</p>

[SET]
name: Perish Trapper
move 1: Perish Song
move 2: Whirlpool
move 3: Rain Dance
move 4: Rest
item: Grip Claw / Damp Rock 
ability: Hydration
nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes full advantage of Lapras's defensive prowess and access to Hydration. By utilizing a nifty move in Whirlpool in tandem with Perish Song, Lapras can trap and KO many common switch-ins, such as Ferroseed. Perish Song and Whirlpool are the cruxes of this set, annoying the opposition. The combination of Hydration and Rest (HydraRest) is necessary for this set, restoring Lapras to full HP and removing any status ailments. Damp Rock can be used in order to prolong the effects of Rain Dance, but Grip Claw is the item of choice, extending the longevity of Whirlpool and making sure that the foe will stay trapped until Perish Song knocks it out.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is catered to benefit Lapras's Special Defense, as the wide variety of Fighting-types in RU means that a physically defensive spread is not as worthwhile. However, Lapras can still tank hits from physical attackers, particularly attacks from weak walls such as Ferroseed. This Lapras, like all the other variants, appreciates entry hazard support, so a spinner is a very good partner; Sandslash receives special mention since it is immune to Electric. As always, Ghost-types are good teammates as well and can spinblock, which is especially helpful since once opponents discover Lapras's set, they will be forced to play more carefully and switch out more often. Unlike the other Lapras variants, this Lapras should be paired with Pokemon that appreciate certain walls being sent to their graves. For example, Feraligatr benefits greatly from the removal of Ferroseed. Also, when using this Lapras, be aware that Pokemon with Whirlwind, Roar, U-turn, or Volt Switch can escape from it. Consequently, do not be too hasty when trapping the likes of Mandibuzz and Uxie.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Lapras has a wide variety of other options, and they all have their uses. Lapras can utilize a special attacking set with Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt, but its low Speed in combination with the high amount of Fighting- and Electric-types in tier make this an unappealing option. Lapras can, however, utilize those moves, such as Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, on the Dragon Dance set, decimating the likes of Steelix and Tangrowth. Hidden Power Fire is also an option for destroying Lapras's number one enemy, Ferroseed, but it should not be used if Lapras is utilizing HydraRest. Heal Bell is also an option, allowing Lapras to free itself and its teammates from pesky status ailments. Confuse Ray is also an option to annoy the opposition, but Lapras has difficulty finding room for such an unreliable move. Finally, Roar can be used in order to let Lapras phaze out dangerous threats and rack up entry hazard damage.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Lapras can be decimated by any strong Fighting-type attack, making the likes of Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan major threats. Sceptile and Galvantula can also destroy it, sinking it with Leaf Storm and Thunder, respectively. Rock-types, such as Kabutops, can also destroy it. Lanturn walls almost all of Lapras's sets and escapes from Whirlpool with Volt Switch, but it must be wary of Toxic if it is not using Heal Bell. Finally, Ferroseed is the greatest counter to Lapras, resisting the Water + Normal combination and wearing it down easily with Leech Seed. However, it must be wary of the PerishTrap set, which will spell the end for Ferroseed quickly.</p>
