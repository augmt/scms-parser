[Overview]

<p>Hindered by a horrible movepool, bad typing, and a severe Stealth Rock weakness, it's no wonder that Articuno is often overshadowed by its legendary counterpart Moltres in RU. Although Articuno doesn't have the same offensive presence that Moltres does, it boasts an amazing base 125 Special Defense stat and a decent base 90 HP stat, making it a capable phazer and stalling Pokemon. With the Pressure ability, as well as reliable recovery in the form of Roost, Articuno can be a great defensive asset to the right team if provided with the proper support.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the only set that Articuno can pull off effectively. Because of its nonexistent attacking capabilities, you must instead take advantage of Articuno's high defensive stats. With entry hazard support, Articuno serves as an effective phazer or Toxic staller. However, because it relies solely on Ice Beam for damage, it is recommended that Roar be used over Toxic so that Steel-type Pokemon cannot wall or set up on Articuno. Substitute is useful for Pressure stalling, racking up poison damage, avoiding status, and scouting for dangerous attacks. When combined with Pressure, Substitute allows Articuno to PP stall even super effective moves such as Stone Edge and Thunderbolt. Provided Articuno is faster, it can alternate between Substitute and Roost until the opponent runs out of PP or dies from poison damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Articuno requires both Rapid Spin and entry hazard support in order to maximize its effectiveness at stalling. Kabutops is a solid choice thanks to its decent synergy with Articuno. If Roar is used in the fourth moveslot, an alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD can be used, as the extra bulk is helpful to a dedicated phazer. With 84 Speed EVs, Articuno outruns some notable Pokemon such as minimum Speed Uxie and Drapion, Adamant max Speed Bouffalant and Crawdaunt, and bulky Rotom-C and Gallade.</p>

<p>Articuno struggles to do anything to Steel-type Pokemon; therefore, trappers such as Gothorita and Magneton are excellent choices for dealing with them. At least one dedicated counter to Steel-types is necessary when running this set, as there is nothing Articuno can do to prevent Pokemon such as Shift Gear Klinklang from setting up.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Articuno's movepool is sadly lacking. Ice Beam aside, Articuno's offensive options are limited to Hurricane and Hidden Power; sadly Articuno does not have the raw power of Moltres to warrant going offensive. However, Articuno does have a few viable support options; Tailwind and Heal Bell are great choices, as with proper management of Stealth Rock, Articuno can easily handle the frequent switching that these moves require. Haze can be used to defeat slower stat boosters, though Articuno can rarely find a moveslot for it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Generally, countering Articuno is not a difficult feat. Almost any Steel-type Pokemon can take it on; Klinklang can easily set up on or KO Articuno, and strong physical attackers that outrun Articuno can usually force a switch if it isn't behind a Substitute. Hitmonlee, Primeape, Entei, and Aggron are just a few common choices. Even some special attackers can take advantage of Articuno's horrible defensive typing. Typhlosion and Moltres absolutely wreck it with their STAB Fire-type moves, while Magneton resists both Toxic and Ice Beam and can easily set up on it. Even when behind a Substitute, Pokemon with access to Rock Blast such as Crustle and Cinccino pose as a severe threat to Articuno.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Articuno gets Snow Cloak as its Hidden ability, but cannot use it in RU because it is banned in all standard tiers besides LC and Uber. Even if this wasn't the case, Snow Warning is banned in RU anyway, so it would be far inferior to Pressure regardless.</p>
