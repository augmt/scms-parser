[Overview]

<p>Gallade is the most versatile Fighting-type in RU. With a great stat spread, superb movepool, and solid typing, Gallade is capable of running many sets, ranging from a Choice Band set to a specially defensive set and almost everything in between. Gallade's versatility is further enhanced by setup moves such as Swords Dance, Substitute, and Bulk Up, along with a very high Attack stat. Additionally, Gallade's great Special Defense allows Gallade to run bulkier boosting sets while its typing leaves it with few exploitable weaknesses. This unpredictability leads to major difficulty when dealing with Gallade, as simply knowing what setup move it has won't make it any easier to handle.</p>

<p>Gallade has a few limitations that keep it from plowing through most teams. It suffers one of the most severe cases of four-moveslot syndrome in RU, as it will never be able to cover all of RU's major threats at once. The ubiquity of Spiritomb also doesn't help either, as it's immune to both of Gallade's STABs and has the bulk to handle anything else Gallade tries to throw at it offensively. Gallade's base Speed might be good, but it's not blazing fast, and a low Defense stat means most faster physical attackers will force Gallade off the field. Nevertheless, Gallade is a top threat and should be prepared for when building any team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Gallade's most commonly seen set in RU. With a base 125 Attack stat, a solid base 115 Special Defense, and a decent typing both offensively and defensively, a bulky Swords Dance set fits Gallade perfectly. This is aided by Gallade's decent base 80 Speed, which allows it to outspeed most defensive Pokemon with minimal investment.</p>

<p>Swords Dance is Gallade's boosting move of choice on this set. Once Gallade gets in, it can easily threaten out an opposing Pokemon and set up a Swords Dance on the switch. Drain Punch is the primary STAB move, which has solid power, great coverage, and the ability to restore Gallade's HP which sets it apart from other offensive sets by significantly increasing its longevity. This is important as few Pokemon possess the ability to outspeed and OHKO Gallade. Psycho Cut is a solid secondary STAB move that is able to get past many Pokemon that can take Drain Punch, such as Qwilfish, Amoonguss, and opposing Gallade. The last slot gives Gallade coverage on Pokemon that can handle its STAB combination. Night Slash is preferred to handle Mesprit, Sigilyph, and Uxie. However, Leaf Blade is an option to get past Alomomola, Quagsire, and Rhydon, the latter of which is not OHKOed by +2 Drain Punch when holding Eviolite and can retaliate with a powerful STAB Earthquake that will leave Gallade extremely susceptible to the next thing that comes in. Regardless of whether one chooses Night Slash or Leaf Blade, both will hit Slowking and Golurk hard, which is important as both can handle Gallade's STAB moves and retaliate with Psyshock or Shadow Punch, respectively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>56 Speed EVs allow Gallade to jump ahead of neutral base 55s such as Omastar and Bouffalant. The remaining EVs get placed in HP to improve Gallade's overall bulk. Lum Berry is the best item for this set, as it gives Gallade a one-time immunity to status, which is important when trying to set up against more defensive teams. However, Leftovers is also an option, as Gallade will take its fair share of hits during a sweep and a single round of Leftovers recovery can sometimes be just what Gallade needs to survive an incoming attack and KO its target. X-Scissor is the most notable coverage move not used on this set, being the best move Gallade has for Tangrowth and still retaining coverage on all Psychic-types except for Sigilyph. Stone Edge is an option for crushing Moltres while also hitting Spiritomb harder than any other move. Finally, Shadow Sneak is an option to pick off weakened threats, but it still isn't very strong even after a boost and will struggle to KO many threats unless they have a low Defense stat.</p>

<p>Entry hazards are a necessity for this set in order to compensate for the lower power of Drain Punch. On offensive teams, Omastar, Scolipede, and Smeargle are effective partners while more balanced teams can use Ferroseed, Rhydon, and Qwilfish. Spiritomb is an absolute pain for this set, as it can survive any boosted attack and 2HKO Gallade with Shadow Sneak or OHKO it with Foul Play after a Swords Dance boost. Emboar is a very good partner for this reason, as not only does it handle Spiritomb nicely, but it also deals with Escavalier, another major problem for this set. Other Fire-types, such as Typhlosion, Entei, and Moltres, can also be used to handle these threats. Entei and Moltres can are also royal pains for this set in addition to being good partners; Qwilfish is able to check Entei and Escavalier while Lanturn is a good answer to Moltres. Paralysis support is welcome so Gallade doesn't have to take as many hits. The aforementioned Qwilfish and Lanturn are solid options to provide this, as are Ferroseed and specially defensive Druddigon. Although it has Night Slash, Gallade will have some problems with Sigilyph thanks to its powerful Flying-type STAB. Spiritomb can be used to trap and KO Sigilyph to ensure Gallade's sweep isn't interrupted. Mesprit is also a feasible option thanks to having access to both Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, while its access to Healing Wish can also give Gallade a second chance to sweep if it gets stopped earlier on.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute + 3 Attacks
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Drain Punch
move 3: Night Slash / Leaf Blade
move 4: Psycho Cut
item: Life Orb
ability: Justified
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Gallade is capable of boosting its Attack stat with Swords Dance and Bulk Up, a simple Substitute + 3 Attacks set suits Gallade very nicely. Thanks to the sheer offensive presence Gallade imposes when it enters the battle, it can force many switches, thus buying it time to set up a Substitute to ease prediction and showcase its great coverage.</p>

<p>Substitute shields Gallade from revenge killers and status moves, which are two common methods of dealing with it. Once it's behind a Substitute, Gallade can unleash its great power and coverage to pick apart the opposing team. Drain Punch is the chosen STAB move and it gives this set great staying power. With it, Gallade is able to deal serious damage and heal itself of the HP it lost through making Substitutes and Life Orb recoil. Gallade's coverage move comes down to whether you need it to be more of a standalone attacker or a lure for a teammate. Night Slash is the more useful move for Gallade itself as it easily 2HKOes Uxie, Mesprit, and Sigilyph. This allows Gallade to better handle Uxie, and to seriously dent or KO two of the most common offensive responses to Gallade. However, if you need Gallade to handle physical walls to aid a teammate, then Leaf Blade is perfectly usable. With it, Gallade is able to take on the likes of Alomomola, Rhydon, and Quagsire without a second thought, which can easily clear a path for a teammate to sweep unimpeded. Regardless of the move you choose, both will hit Slowking, a very common threat, for super effective damage. Psycho Cut fills up the last moveslot as it allows Gallade to get past Qwilfish and Amoonguss without much difficulty, while also OHKOing Emboar, a common revenge killer that typically targets Gallade.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Jolly nature is used to ensure Gallade outspeeds positive base 75s, notably Smeargle. Although you can use an Adamant nature to give Gallade more power, the ability to outspeed Smeargle unconditionally is usually too important to give up. If Gallade outspeeds Smeargle, then it's unable to cripple Gallade with Spore. With the offensive EV spread, it's easy to understand that you would want to use Close Combat. However, this is not advised under any circumstances as the staying power and flexibility Drain Punch brings is just too good to give up. The reason Gallade is able to use a Life Orb in the first place is because of the healing side effect of Drain Punch, and the use of Life Orb will help to offset the power difference between Drain Punch and Close Combat. X-Scissor is the most notable coverage move that can be used on this set. It's the strongest move Gallade has to handle Tangrowth, and it will retain coverage on all Psychic-types with the exception of Sigilyph. Stone Edge is another alternative coverage move that can be used if you absolutely hate Sigilyph and Moltres. However, Sigilyph is hit hard enough by Night Slash and Moltres is OHKOed by Psycho Cut after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>Entry hazard support will go a long way to supporting this set as the opponent will likely be forced to switch again after Gallade sets up a Substitute. Smeargle, Omastar, and Scolipede can provide Stealth Rock and Spikes support for more offensive-minded teams while more balanced teams can turn to the likes of Rhydon, Qwilfish, Ferroseed, and Mesprit for this support. Druddigon particularly makes for a very solid partner as it can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also keep up offensive pressure. As Gallade isn't the fastest thing in RU, paralysis support can be helpful as well to make it even easier for Gallade to sweep late-game. The aforementioned Ferroseed can provide this support on top of Spikes support while keeping Spiritomb in check without too much difficulty. Lanturn can also provide paralysis support and check Moltres throughout the match. It can also provide cleric support and use a slow Volt Switch to allow Gallade to switch in freely. Because this Gallade can be both a sweeper and a wallbreaker, it's very easy to form an offensive core with. Most Fire-types work very well with this set. Emboar is a great example, as it can easily check Spiritomb and Tangrowth, and it cleans up weakened teams with Flare Blitz after Gallade has done its job. Other Fire-types such as Typhlosion, Entei, and Moltres can also be effective in this regard. Without Night Slash, a Pursuit user such as Absol or Escavalier can be effective to trap Psychic-types such as Uxie and Mesprit. If Gallade forgoes Leaf Blade, it will need help to get around Alomomola and Quagsire. Grass-types such as Sceptile, Rotom-C, and Lilligant fit the bill nicely as they will find it much easier to sweep if Gallade has removed special walls. On the other hand, you can use a Spikes user such as Ferroseed or Roselia to take advantage of the low offensive presence these two Water-types have, which could help Gallade break past them later.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a more offensive approach to Swords Dance. While this set lacks the longevity and flexibility of its bulkier counterpart, this Gallade is much less reliant on boosting to leave its mark on the opposing team. Swords Dance skyrockets Gallade's already dangerous Attack stat, while Close Combat is the chosen Fighting STAB move, as its incredible 120 Base Power allows Gallade to even weaken some Pokemon that resist Fighting-type moves after a boost. Psycho Cut is Gallade's secondary STAB move and hits the likes of Qwilfish and Amoonguss much harder than Close Combat would. Night Slash is the preferred option in the final slot, allowing Gallade to get past bulky Psychic-types such as Uxie, Slowking, and Mesprit much more easily. However, Shadow Sneak is an option to fend off revenge killers and faster, frail Pokemon like Rotom and Archeops looking to take advantage of the defense drops caused by using Close Combat.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Because Close Combat lowers Gallade's defenses with each use, a fully offensive EV spread is utilized. A Lum Berry is still the preferred item to get a one-time immunity to status, which can often mean the difference between a sweep and a crippled Gallade. However, a Life Orb is certainly viable, as with a Life Orb, Gallade is even less reliant on boosting than it already is and can be turned into more of a wallbreaker. Adamant is the preferred nature to give Gallade more power and to, again, lessen the reliance on setting up to deal major damage. However, Jolly can be used if outspeeding neutral-natured base 92s and below, such as Rotom-C, Hitmonlee, and Lilligant, is desired. Leaf Blade is the only coverage option worth considering. Although a super effective Leaf Blade only hits as hard as a neutral Close Combat, it can be useful against the likes of Rhydon and Alomomola when the defense drops from Close Combat aren't desired. However, Night Slash and Shadow Sneak are generally the better moves to use.</p>

<p>Gallade appreciates entry hazard support to gain more KOs and ensure that its targets can't take advantage of the defense drops from using Close Combat. Smeargle, Omastar, and Accelgor can utilize entry hazards on more offensive teams, and Druddigon, Roselia, and Uxie can be used on more balanced teams. With the defense drops from Close Combat, this Gallade is extremely vulnerable to being revenge killed. For this reason, paralysis support from Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Lanturn, and Slowking can be very helpful. As always, Spiritomb is an absolute pain for Gallade, as Gallade has no hope of OHKOing it while Spiritomb's Shadow Sneak does a real number on it. For this reason, Emboar, Entei, and Aggron are all good partners as they can all effectively handle Spiritomb. Sigilyph is problematic thanks to its STAB Air Slash and Psyshock. A Spiritomb of your own can trap and KO Sigilyph with Pursuit so Gallade can sweep without fear later. Fast attackers are solid teammates as they can pick up Gallade's slack if it can't complete its sweep. Sceptile, Swellow, and Choice Scarf variants of Rotom-C, Emboar, and Braviary can all work nicely in this role. Other powerful attackers such as Druddigon and Durant work well with Gallade, as a combination of two strong physical attackers can overwhelm the opponent. Another Fighting-type is especially good since Gallade can weaken Psychic-types with Night Slash to pave the way for a Hitmonlee or Medicham sweep.</p>

[SET]
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Wish
move 2: Protect
move 3: Drain Punch
move 4: Will-O-Wisp
item: Leftovers
ability: Steadfast
nature: Careful
evs: 248 HP / 244 SpD / 16 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Gallade is more commonly known for its offensive prowess, it can also take advantage of its stellar Special Defense and typing to use a specially defensive set that can beat some of the metagame's most threatening special attackers. Specially attacking Sceptile, Rotom-C, Galvantula, Expert Belt Magmortar, and Omastar are only a few of the threats that Gallade checks. Gallade has many unique traits that separate it from the rest of RU's special walls; the most notable of these is access to reliable recovery in the form of Wish. Also, Gallade is resistant to Stealth Rock, making it hard to wear down through double switches unless your opponent has Spikes up. These traits make Gallade perfect for defensive balance or full stall teams.</p>

<p>As said before, Wish is a great move that Gallade has access to and helps set it apart from Pokemon like Uxie, which is more physically bulky. Protect ensures that Gallade receives the recovery from Wish, as without it Gallade could just be forced out again and again until it is within 2HKO range from a threatening sweeper. Protect can also be used to scout moves from Choice item users such as Slowking and Switcheroo Manectric. Be careful though, as Protect gives your opponent a free turn to set up, and sometimes it's best to use Will-O-Wisp to deter a physical sweeper that might try to get a free boost off of Protect. Drain Punch is a reliable STAB move that still hits decently hard even without investment thanks to Gallade's high base Attack, and has that cool side effect of regaining a bit of health afterwards. Will-O-Wisp is another great move for Gallade, as it can cripple its common switch-ins easily such as Spiritomb and Escavalier. As mentioned before, it also ensures that Gallade isn't setup fodder for any moderately bulky physical sweeper; Pokemon such as Feraligatr and Fraxure will think twice about setting up as opposed to attacking.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Almost maximum HP and Special Defense investment is used to make Gallade as specially bulky as possible, while 16 Speed EVs outrun Adamant Aggron so that Gallade can burn it or just KO with Drain Punch after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Steadfast is the only ability that Gallade can use with Wish; Justified would be the superior choice if not for its illegality on this set. Thunder Wave and Toxic are alternative status moves that can be used, but even if you are building a team around either of these two statuses, Will-O-Wisp is still better the majority of the time. Stone Edge serves one purpose and one purpose only: to OHKO Moltres as it tries to switch in for free. Drain Punch is better in just about every other situation though, so only use Stone Edge if your team is absurdly weak to Moltres. Zen Headbutt is a middle ground between Drain Punch and Stone Edge; however, it still doesn't KO Moltres even after Stealth Rock and has only a trivial amount of higher Base Power, so only use it if you're extremely worried about Accelgor getting a Special Defense drop or a critical hit, as Zen Headbutt hits that harder too. Drain Punch is a lot better because of its perfect accuracy and healing side effect.</p>

<p>Gallade doesn't really require any specific support, but there are some Pokemon that it works better with than others. Regirock is a great partner for this set, as it can take on nearly all of the special attackers that Gallade has trouble with, such as Moltres, Sigilyph, and Substitute + Calm Mind Uxie and Mesprit, and can also check Entei. In return, Gallade can easily pass Wishes to compensate for Regirock's lack of reliable recovery. Qwilfish is another solid partner that can check a good amount of physical attackers that Gallade struggles with such as Entei, Escavalier, and Feraligatr. It also lacks reliable recovery, and can set up Spikes to take advantage of the many switches that Gallade forces due to its sheer special bulk. Similarly, Alomomola checks many of the same things that Qwilfish does and can form a dual Wish core with Gallade that can be very hard to break. Gallade struggles against opposing Psychic-types, especially those that can set up on it with Substitute or a Lum Berry; Spiritomb and Escavalier are two of the best Psychic-type killers in the metagame, and they too appreciate Wish support as they can be worn down quickly due to frequent switch-ins and commonly don't use Leftovers. Spiritomb is a better check to Sigilyph while Escavalier has better synergy with Gallade, resisting Ghost-type moves, and is better against the Dark-types that also typically pose a threat to Gallade such as Spiritomb and Absol. Status is extremely crippling to this set, especially burn, so using a cleric as a teammate is also a good idea. Lanturn beats Moltres and appreciates Wish support, although Misdreavus, Miltank, and Lickilicky are also good choices.</p>

ability: Justified
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Gallade is most commonly seen striking fear into an opponent with a setup move, the simplicity of a Choice Band can also be quite effective. The inability to switch moves or set up is made up for with the immediate power boost Gallade receives from said item. Close Combat is the main STAB move on this set. With a massive 120 Base Power, few things will be safe from Gallade's wrath. The defense drops are somewhat mitigated with the hit-and-run nature of this set. Psycho Cut allows Gallade to lay the hurt on Qwilfish and Amoonguss without much difficulty. Night Slash is very important for being able to deal with Uxie and Slowking and keeping them from trying to cripple Gallade with paralysis or a burn. The last slot reinforces Gallade's coverage on certain threats. Stone Edge is preferred, as it's the strongest move Gallade has to hit Spiritomb with while it also destroys any Moltres that tries to switch in. Leaf Blade provides a safer move to use in order to hammer Alomomola, Rhydon, and Quagsire, but keep in mind that a neutral Close Combat will hit just as hard as a 2x super effective Leaf Blade.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Adamant nature is preferred because Choice Band Gallade is primarily used as a wallbreaker. However, Jolly is feasible in order to outspeed Absol and Smeargle while also tying with other positive-natured base 80s such as Mesprit and Kabutops. There aren't really any other moves to consider on this set as Gallade's Close Combat will often be hitting harder than other super effective coverage moves, such as X-Scissor.</p>

<p>Entry hazard support goes a long way to help Gallade break down walls such as Tangrowth and Alomomola. Smeargle, Crustle, and Omastar are solid choices for offensive teams of which this Gallade is usually found on. Partners that can check Spiritomb are a must for this set, as Gallade will be incapable of using either of its STAB moves with freedom if it is around. Pokemon such as Escavalier, Steelix, and Emboar can be used for this. This variant of Gallade is the most vulnerable to status because it lacks any method of healing. For this reason, clerics and designated status absorbers are very helpful. Clefable can absorb status rather easily and is capable of keeping Gallade healthy with Wish. On the other hand, Lanturn provides cleric and paralysis support to help Gallade while also checking Moltres, lessening the pressure on Gallade to predict its switch in with Stone Edge. A Pursuit user, such as Absol and Escavalier, can be used to clear out bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types so Gallade can freely use Close Combat. Due to its fantastic wallbreaking capabilities, Choice Band Gallade pairs very well with fast physical attackers that are capable of cleaning up a team that Gallade has left its mark on. Choice Scarf Braviary and Emboar are solid examples of this, while Swellow and Entei can use their combination of speed and power to finish off the opposing team. If a wallbreaking core is desired, Choice Specs Rotom-C and Typhlosion as well as mixed attacking Samurott work nicely with Gallade.</p>

[SET]

nature: Careful
EVs: 240 HP / 212 SpD / 56 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Gallade's other sets become a major threat after just one turn of set up, this set attempts to use Bulk Up to slowly become a threat while simultaneously becoming more and more difficult to revenge kill. While this might be the hardest set to pull off a sweep with, it is also the hardest offensive set to revenge kill and use walls to deal with thanks to heavy investment in special bulk and boosting its Defense through Bulk Up.</p>

<p>Bulk Up is the chosen boosting move for this set, as it boosts Gallade's great Attack stat and subpar Defense as well. Drain Punch fits the goal of this set perfectly; it provides solid power and simultaneously heals Gallade in the process, thus increasing its longevity. The coverage option is a difficult choice, as it will leave Gallade open to certain defensive threats. Night Slash is generally preferred thanks to the neutral coverage it gets with Gallade's Fighting STAB while being able to smash Slowking, Uxie, and Mesprit. Substitute fills in the last slot to shield Gallade from status and to make revenge killing this set that much harder.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread looks odd, but it is actually quite simple. 56 Speed EVs is necessary to outspeed neutral-natured base 55s such as Omastar and Bouffalant, and 240 HP EVs hits an optimal HP number for making Substitutes. The remaining EVs get thrown into Special Defense, and when combined with a Careful nature, Gallade gains far more setup opportunities against special attackers such as Sceptile, Lanturn, Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and support Uxie.</p>

<p>Entry hazard support is more important for this Gallade set than any other due to the low initial power it has. Ferroseed, Qwilfish, and Rhydon are solid choices for this role, as this Gallade will usually find itself on more balanced teams. Entei and Escavalier are perhaps the biggest issues for this set, as both can still OHKO Gallade at +1 Defense with Flare Blitz and Megahorn, respectively. Alomomola, Qwilfish, and Rhydon can be used to check Entei while Moltres, Emboar, and Typhlosion can keep Escavalier at bay. Spiritomb is still a bit of a pain for this set thanks to the lack in initial power. Emboar, Aggron, and Escavalier can all keep Spiritomb in check. Even with this set's heavy investment in special bulk, Moltres's STAB Hurricane will still run right through Gallade. For this reason, Lanturn is a solid partner to not only keep it in check but to also provide paralysis support so Gallade has to take fewer hits. Other paralysis inducers, such as Ferroseed and Uxie, can also be helpful so Gallade isn't forced to use Substitute as often.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Thanks to its wide movepool, Gallade has plenty of other options at its disposal. A Choice Scarf set seems like a perfect fit thanks to Gallade's base 125 Attack and a somewhat middling Speed stat when not holding said item. However, Medicham is much better for this role thanks to Pure Power. Gallade has the elemental punches available to it, but for the most part, they aren't really useful when compared to Gallade's main attacks. Earthquake is powerful, but it runs into the same problems that the elemental punches do. Like many other Psychic-types, Gallade has access to Calm Mind, as well as various special moves such as Psyshock, Focus Blast, and Thunderbolt. However, a paltry base 65 Special Attack makes this a bad option for Gallade.</p>

<p>In terms of support options, a combination of Taunt and Will-O-Wisp can be used to break down stall teams, but these types of teams aren't too common in RU. A dual screens set with Memento is usable, but it faces stiff competition from Uxie and Mesprit in this role, as both have better overall bulk than Gallade. A set utilizing Trick Room is possible to make up for Gallade's mediocre Speed. However, it still runs into competition with Uxie and Mesprit, and on top of that, it lets major threats such as Escavalier and Druddigon outspeed Gallade. Destiny Bond is gimmicky, but it can net a surprise kill every once and a while. Finally, a SubDisable set is possible a la Gengar in OU, but Gallade's lack of immunities limits its viability.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gallade is difficult to counter due to its versatility, power, coverage, and support options, but there are ways to deal with each set. Spiritomb, specifically with a defensive set, is the best response, as it is able to handle every Gallade set thanks to its immunity to both of Gallade's STABs, solid bulk and Foul Play. If it lacks Rest, however, it must be careful around specially defensive sets because Will-O-Wisp can cripple offensive Spiritomb. Choice Specs Slowking can tank all of Gallade's unboosted attacks and can OHKO with Psyshock; similarly, defensive Slowking can take hits more easily and 2HKO with Psyshock or burn Gallade with Scald. Moltres and Mesprit are two of the safer options to handle Gallade, as each resists one or both of Gallade's STAB moves. can outspeed, and only fear one of its coverage moves. Perhaps the easiest way to deal with Gallade is to use its major case of four-moveslot syndrome to your advantage. Most sets use a setup move and two STAB moves, so finding out its coverage move will go a long way when handling Gallade. If Gallade lacks Leaf Blade, Alomomola and Quagsire can handle it admirably. Without Night Slash, Mesprit becomes all the more dangerous while Uxie can generally outlast Gallade in most scenarios. Tangrowth only fears a +2 Close Combat and the rare Ice Punch and X-Scissor, and it can KO a slightly weakened Gallade with a STAB Power Whip on its weaker Defense stat. However, Bulk Up sets can set up on Tangrowth without Power Whip. Escavalier is capable of overpowering Gallade with its powerful STAB Megahorn, but the Substitute set 2HKOes with Drain Punch and might have a Substitute up to block Escavalier's first attack, and the specially defensive set can cripple Escavalier with a burn. The specially defensive set struggles with most Flying-types; Pokemon such as Braviary, Moltres, and Sigilyph are more than capable of dealing with this set. Cinccino can easily check the Substitute set, but it has no hope of actually switching into it thanks to its frailty.</p>

<p>Preying on Gallade's base 80 Speed and lackluster base 65 Defense is perhaps the easiest way to limit the damage Gallade can do. Choice Scarf users such as Emboar and Braviary do quite well, while naturally fast Pokemon such as Swellow, Tauros, and Durant are capable of smashing Gallade before it gets a chance to strike them. Pokemon that can take a hit and KO back with a STAB move, such as Golurk and Exeggutor, can check Gallade as well. Priority users can also be effective, with examples being Entei, Spiritomb, and Feraligatr. Note that Sucker Punch users such as Absol run the risk of activating Justified if they are unable to KO Gallade and will likely be hit with a decisive blow after the attack. As Gallade will often want to use a setup move before attacking, one can always resort to offensive pressure to limit Gallade's chances to setup. However, this is risky as Gallade usually has enough raw power and coverage to do damage even without a setup move, and the Choice Band set doesn't set up at all.</p>
