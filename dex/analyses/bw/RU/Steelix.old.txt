[Overview]

<p>Large, silver, and sleek, stare in awe at Steelix. That menacing grin is not only for show, as Steelix practically laughs at half of the tier for the pittance in damage it receives. A reliable Steel / Ground typing gives it nine resistances and two immunities, while an astonishing base 200 Defense backed by a great base 75 HP makes Steelix one, if not THE, premier physical wall in the RU tier. With the proper EV investment, it can take both physical and special hits, being a great check or counter to threats such as Galvantula, Escavalier, and Aggron. Don't forget about Sturdy, which acts as a pseudo-Focus Sash. A godawful base 30 Speed and an average base 85 Attack are slightly concerning, but don't let that depress you; even that poor Speed is beneficial, as it enables Steelix to hit hard with Gyro Ball, an especially deadly move against various frail sweepers such as Sceptile. Steelix easily fits in with almost any team, ready to grin and bear the brunt of an opponent while setting up Stealth Rock on a whim!</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The gold standard for Steelix; it takes resisted physical hits like a boss while getting the most desired entry hazard up easily. Stealth Rock is right at home in the RU tier, as it wreaks the myriad of Bug-, Flying-, and Fire-types that await. From there, Steelix wants to retaliate with a semblance of force. Earthquake grants this as its primary STAB move, putting a dent on anything it hits super effectively. Gyro Ball is its secondary STAB move that is useful against frail foes that are speedier than Steelix. It OHKOes Archeops and deals 78.59 - 92.25% damage to Primeape, a guaranteed OHKO with Stealth Rock and two layers of Spikes. Gyro Ball also does a decent number against Rotom, should it lack a super effective Hidden Power or Will-O-Wisp.</p>

<p>The final move is quite a fickle one, though. Because Steelix attracts unwanted attention from Pokemon wanting to set up on it, particularly those who resist or have no problem taking on its STAB moves, a phazing move is desired. The benefit is twofold, as the forced switch also racks up entry hazard damage. With access to two phazing moves, Steelix must make a choice; Roar has been a mainstay in Steelix's arsenal since GSC. Accuracy and the ability to phaze through an opponent's Substitute still make it the primary choice. However, Taunt ruins the chance of a Roar to be bellowed, so Steelix has the option of turning to a secondary phazing move. Dragon Tail deals damage while forcing out the opponent, meaning that damage is caused to both shifted Pokemon when in lieu with entry hazards. However, there are two downsides to Dragon Tail; it doesn't phaze through a Substitute, and the 90% accuracy may result in a costly miss.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread ensures that Choice Band Archeops and Choice Scarf Primeape 3HKO Steelix with Earthquake and Close Combat, respectively, factoring in Stealth Rock on the field. The remaining EVs bolster Steelix's underwhelming Special Defense. If you prefer to take special attacks a bit better, an alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 96 Def / 160 SpD can be used. Though you trade in the 3HKO guaranteed with the standard spread (a 5.86% chance of being 2HKOed by Choice Band Archeops and Choice Scarf Primeape without Stealth Rock), the additional special bulk ensures that only a 3HKO occurs from unboosted special attackers such as Life Orb Rotom.</p>

<p>If Stealth Rock or phazing is left to another Pokemon, Steelix has other options to take on its checks. Toxic can be used against bulkier walls such as Tangrowth, bulky Water-types, and defensive Ghost-types such as Dusknoir and Spiritomb. Stone Edge nails Moltres and Scyther on the switch in. However, because Stealth Rock already robs them of half of their health, it should really be considered only if you have another teammate setting up Stealth Rock. In any case, recall that with no EV investment, the only things Stone Edge will be dealing any meaningful damage to is frail foes weak to Rock-type attacks. Finally, Rest is an option to keep Steelix around longer; against physical attackers who can barely scratch Steelix, it is the perfect way to recover its health. However, the sleep mechanics this generation make sleep undesirable, so the importance of a cleric becomes clear in the case that Steelix is forced out.</p>

<p>Because Steelix is weak to some very common types in the metagame, it appreciates Pokemon who can absorb Ground-, Water-, Fighting-, and Fire-type attacks. It therefore has perfect synergy with Rotom, Slowking, and Poliwrath, who, in return, appreciate Steelix's resistances and immunities. Cleric support is appreciated, as Steelix hates being burned and will love being healed if it carries Rest. Misdreavus carries Heal Bell, so if Steelix packs Rest, it can easily wake it up. Much like Rotom, it also provides anti-spin support. Alomomola is another bulky Water-type with good synergy, with the added benefit of providing Wish support. Gardevoir is also a decent package, carrying both Wish and Heal Bell alongside good special bulk to compliment Steelix's natural physical bulk. If its counters are eliminated, Steelix is very difficult to take down, phazing away boosting sweepers and wearing down opponents. Therefore, Steelix adores entry hazards alongside the Stealth Rock it lays.</p>

[SET]
name: Custap Berry
move 1: Stealth Rock

move 3: Heavy Slam
move 4: Explosion
item: Custap Berry
ability: Sturdy
nature: Adamant
evs: 212 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Looking for a way to counter Choice Band Druddigon, set up Stealth Rock, and keep momentum all in one Pokemon? Boy, do I have the answer for you. This Custap Berry set is about the only way Steelix will fit on an offensive team without giving up momentum by being weak and slow as hell. Switch into a Pokemon that Steelix checks, such as Druddigon, Durant, or Escavalier, set up Stealth Rock, throw around an Earthquake or two, and then once Steelix is in Custap Berry range, use Explosion to get Steelix out of the way and bring in a teammate safely.  This Steelix is meant to be played hard and fast, so you should ultimately not feel too bad about losing it in the long run. Heavy Slam is chosen over Gyro Ball as the Steel STAB move due to its greater damage across the board to a varied amount of Pokemon, particularly against other slow Pokemon like Amoonguss.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Attack is maxed, and 44 Speed EVs are run to outpace minimum Speed Spiritomb. The rest of the EVs are dumped into HP to increase overall bulk. Rock Blast can be used over Heavy Slam since Moltres can otherwise come into this set and set up a Substitute without issue. Getting Stealth Rock set up quickly and getting a teammate in for free is a huge draw for using this set, so frail setup sweepers make excellent teammates, particularly Lilligant, Sigilyph, and Sceptile. Neither Kabutops nor Cryogonal like switching into Steelix, meaning Stealth Rock is unlikely to get blown away while it's in.  Once Steelix Explodes out, offensive pressure can then keep those two from spinning away the hazards. This Steelix likes switching into Rotom and other Volt Switch users as it immediately captures momentum from them and allows itself to set up Stealth Rock; however, defensive Will-O-Wisp Rotom will give Steelix a bit of trouble and probably force it to Explode. If you're worried about Rotom you can run Crunch in place of Heavy Slam, though Heavy Slam should be enough to ward off most Rotom.</p>

[SET]
name: Sheer Force
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Iron Tail / Iron Head
move 4: Crunch
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
ability: Sheer Force
nature: Adamant
evs: 212 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Steelix's niche in RU is being able to tank most physical attacks like a boss, set up Stealth Rock, and phaze the opponent out. With this set, Steelix retains the ability to counter physical attackers like Cinccino and check Druddigon, lures in its common checks, and poses a significant offensive threat to the opponent, meaning it is best suited for balanced teams. Earthquake is Steelix's main STAB move of choice despite revealing its Life Orb. Iron Tail, despite its horrible accuracy, is chosen as the Steel STAB because it hits like an absolute nuke with Sheer Force and Life Orb. However, it should only be used when the power is absolutely needed due to its terrible accuracy. Iron Head is a good alternative to Iron Tail and won't miss, but it misses out on a few KOs: the guaranteed 2HKO on Amoonguss, the OHKO on bulky Swords Dance Gallade after Stealth Rock, a high chance to OHKO Kabutops after Stealth Rock, the OHKO on Lilligant, a small chance to 2HKO Uxie after Stealth Rock, and a high chance to OHKO Sigilyph. However, with Life Orb, the move retains many of the same 2HKOs, so depending on how you want to play with Steelix and the team it's on, Iron Head can still be a great move choice. Crunch takes the last slot to annihilate Rotom and easily 2HKO Slowking and other Psychic-types without needing to rely on Iron Tail.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>44 Speed EVs are used to outpace minimum Speed Spiritomb and, more importantly, Amoonguss and Slowking. Rock Slide gets the Sheer Force boost and is a great tool to lure in and destroy Fire-types like Moltres. Leftovers is usable over Life Orb to better bluff the standard defensive set, and Steelix is still decently strong thanks to Sheer Force.</p>

<p>This set is a great lure for common switch-ins to Steelix, particularly those that like to use it as setup bait, such as Qwilfish. This set always 2HKOes Qwilfish with Earthquake after Stealth Rock and Intimidate, and easily 2HKOes Amoonguss with Iron Tail. This set also survives Life Orb Durant's Superpower, and can OHKO in return with Earthquake (only after the Defense drop from Superpower, though). The luring aspect of this set is what makes it work as well as it does, and it makes a great alternative to Golurk, which is not as physically bulky.</p>

<p>Good teammates include Slowking, which has exceptionally good type synergy with Steelix and loves the removal of Pokemon like Amoonguss. Magmortar is another great teammate to take out Tangrowth with and make great use of the holes that Steelix punches into the opponent's team. Pokemon that enjoy Qwilfish being removed or maimed by this set make good teammates too, Escavalier and Emboar in particular.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A Curse set is an option should you want to maximize Steelix's physical bulk and give it a better attacking role. It works best if its counters are gone, as it will gradually get slower as it uses Curse. Rock Head should not even be considered, as Double-Edge is the only worthwhile move to make use of it. Defensive sets love the protection of Sturdy, while offensive sets would, for the better part, prefer Sheer Force. Speaking of Sheer Force, Steelix has an expansive physical movepool to make use of it, but its Speed is a letdown. Rock Polish and Autotomize can mitigate this somewhat, but even after one boost, a max Speed Steelix is still outsped by Archeops by two points. RestTalk remains a viable strategy in that it enables Steelix to reuse Sturdy, but Steelix wants free usage of its moves. In addition, Taunt royally screws such a set.</p>

<p>Crunch is available to hit Ghost-types such as Rotom. Bulky Ghost-types can easily shrug off the damage, though. The elemental fangs are available too; Fire Fang has merit in that it can help against Ferroseed and Escavalier. Otherwise, they should really be considered only with Sheer Force, as Steelix is not causing much damage without it. Explosion turns Steelix into fiery pieces of shrapnel to pierce an opponent, though the nerf of it in BW makes it an inferior option. Finally, Taunt is an odd choice for such a slow Pokemon, but it helps against boosting sweepers such as Cosmic Power Sigilyph. It also shuts down most Clefable, and makes one-on-one confrontations with Ferroseed much easier.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bulky Water-types such as Poliwrath and Slowking can take on anything Steelix throws at them and retaliate with their STAB moves. Rotom has no fear of any moves that Steelix can throw at it, bar the unlikely Crunch. A burn from Will-O-Wisp also ruins Steelix's average Attack, though it should be noted that without Will-O-Wisp, Steelix can win with Gyro Ball. For that reason, Rotom-C takes on Steelix more reliably thanks to an increase in bulk. Omastar, in spite of a weakness to Ground-type attacks, can beat Steelix thanks to its good Defense. In the same vein, Tangrowth has very little to worry about against Steelix. Ferroseed and Clefable become threats to Steelix that don't pack Taunt. Speaking of Taunt, it ruins efforts to set up Stealth Rock and stops Roar from working.</p>

<p>Bulky Ground-types such as Rhydon and Sandslash are great checks to Steelix, as both outspeed and can wear down Steelix with Earthquake. In Sandslash's case, it can also use Rapid Spin to eliminate Stealth Rock. Fire-types such as Entei and Magmortar can check Steelix, but an Earthquake when switching into Stealth Rock can spell doom for both. Moltres fears nothing bar the rare Stone Edge, but likewise detests the appearance of Stealth Rock, especially because it strips half of its health upon switching in. Fighting-types such as Gallade and Medicham are also decent checks against Steelix, though they don't appreciate a Gyro Ball to the face.</p>
