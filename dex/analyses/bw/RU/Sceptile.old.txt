[Overview]

<p>Sceptile is widely regarded as one of the best offensive Pokemon in RU. This is largely due to its nearly unmatched Speed, above-average Special Attack, and useful Grass typing. Additionally, unlike most Grass-types, Sceptile actually has access to a coverage move not named Hidden Power in the form of Focus Blast, which it can use to hit Steel-types and various Sap Sipper Pokemon. This also means that Sceptile is free to run a different Hidden Power that gives it coverage on Fire-types, such as Hidden Power Rock. On top of that, Sceptile can also take you by surprise by attacking from the physical side with a very dangerous Swords Dance set. It's not all peaches for Sceptile though, as its subpar Defense and average Special Defense make it quite vulnerable to priority and only let it get so far. Nevertheless, when used correctly, Sceptile is hands down one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the tier and is sure to leave its mark in any battle it takes part in.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Arguably Sceptile's most dangerous set, this variant attempts to set up a Substitute on the numerous Pokemon that it can threaten, such as Kabutops, Slowking, and Aggron, and then let its high Speed and Special Attack do the rest. A Substitute does many good things for Sceptile, including allowing it to avoid status conditions, particularly paralysis, evade Sucker Punch, a relatively common priority move that could cause Sceptile issues, and ease prediction if in the case a faster Pokemon, such as Accelgor, or a dangerous Pokemon, such as Escavalier, switches in. However, arguably the best part about a Substitute is that it allows Sceptile to get into Overgrow range almost whenever it wants to. In case it is incapable of doing enough damage to finish off the opponent, Sceptile can repeatedly use a Substitute until it has a low enough HP and then attack with an Overgrow-boosted STAB Giga Drain. Giga Drain can not only heal off the damage from the Substitutes, but it also keeps Sceptile from getting worn down too quickly from its Life Orb and is thus used as its main STAB.</p>

<p>The remaining two moves are used for coverage. Focus Blast is a godsend for Sceptile, as it obtains coverage against Steel-type Pokemon and Sap Sipper users such as Bouffalant and Sawsbuck. Focus Blast is also Sceptile's strongest option against Pokemon such as Emboar, and in normal situations, it does more damage than Giga Drain (although its shaky accuracy must be considered in these cases). Hidden Power Rock covers Fire-, Bug-, and Flying-types such as Moltres and Sigilyph. Due to Focus Blast, Sceptile, unlike other Grass-types, can afford to run Hidden Power Rock without needing to worry about most of the targets that Hidden Power Fire would otherwise hit.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Sceptile should always run maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs with a Timid nature, as it is hard-pressed to take a hit, and a Life Orb is used to hit harder itself. A Life Orb also results in recoil damage, which can help get Sceptile into Overgrow range. There are other Hidden Powers that Sceptile can consider using over Hidden Power Rock. The first of these is Hidden Power Fire, which gets an OHKO on Escavalier, a Pokemon that could otherwise cause problems for Sceptile. Hidden Power Ice is similar, as it gives Sceptile a reliable way to 2HKO Druddigon; Hidden Power Ice also allows Sceptile to run 31 Speed IVs unlike the other two Hidden Power options, which can allow Sceptile to outspeed and OHKO other Sceptile. Both Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Ice also hit Amoonguss and Roselia super effectively, but they still don't do that much to either of them. Ultimately, however, Hidden Power Rock is more useful in most situations to deal with Moltres and other similar Pokemon.</p>

<p>Amoonguss and other bulky Grass-types are generally problems for Sceptile, even if it runs a super effective Hidden Power. Therefore, strong Fire-type Pokemon such as Entei or Emboar make good partners, as they can OHKO any Grass-type in their path, can take a Megahorn from Escavalier and retaliate, and can act as a sleep absorber if the need arises. Entei can also deal with Accelgor and Cryogonal, two Pokemon that Sceptile might have trouble with. In return, Sceptile can directly switch into and subsequently threaten bulky Water-types, which are common switch-ins to Fire-types. Water-types are also helpful partners, as they can withstand hits from Fire-types that threaten Sceptile, particularly Choice Scarf Emboar and Entei, and they can also KO Aerodactyl, a rather common Pokemon that is faster than Sceptile. Qwilfish is a standout example, as its excellent physical bulk allows it to take many hits, and its access to Spikes helps wear down opponents such as Escavalier and Druddigon so that Sceptile can finish them off more easily. Bringing a Fire- and Water-type also results in a Fire / Water / Grass core, which is rather effective in RU.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sceptile functions well as an all-out attacker as a result of its high Speed and Special Attack. Although many Sceptile sets have the issue of not running very powerful moves, a STAB Leaf Storm completely alleviates this issue, and because it's nearly twice as strong as Giga Drain, its power is rather terrifying, doing over 50% damage to even bulky special walls such as Clefable. Leaf Storm also does quite a bit of damage to some of Sceptile's offensive checks, with Entei and Druddigon taking about 50% damage from it. Although the side effect will often cause Sceptile to switch out afterwards, the raw power of the move usually means Sceptile should use it unless there is a bulky resist to Leaf Storm on the opposing team. Focus Blast hits Steel-types and Sap Sipper Pokemon such as Bouffalant hard, which might try to switch into Leaf Storm. Hidden Power Rock covers Flying-, Fire-, and Bug-types, particularly Moltres, which packs a 4x resistance to Leaf Storm. Finally, because Sceptile tends to switch out a lot, Giga Drain is an alternative STAB that helps recover HP lost to entry hazards and Life Orb recoil. It also makes a good move to clean up teams with, considering it is accurate and does not have an undesirable side effect.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Life Orb is the preferred item, as it allows Sceptile to switch its moves, and Giga Drain can heal off Life Orb damage. However, Choice Specs is a viable option as well, considering Leaf Storm might make Sceptile a hit-and-run attacker and will therefore not need to switch moves too much. Once again, Hidden Power Ice or Fire are viable options for Druddigon and other Dragon-types or Escavalier and other Grass-types, but Hidden Power Rock is more useful in most situations due to Moltres and other Fire-types being so common and dangerous, as providing a free switch-in for Moltres is generally not a good idea.</p>

<p>Sceptile is prone to being revenge killed by Pokemon holding a Choice Scarf, especially the common Emboar. Water-types, such as Kabutops or Slowking, make good switch-ins to Emboar, and although Rapid Spin is not needed, Kabutops might be helpful with its Rapid Spin support if Choice Specs is the chosen item. Water-types also help deal with the naturally faster Aerodactyl, and Kabutops can take a hit from Swellow as well. This particular Sceptile is also prone to being hit by Sucker Punch due to its poor physical bulk and lack of a way to avoid the move. Steelix makes a good partner as a result of this, as it can take on most physical attackers that carry the move, especially Druddigon, which resists Sceptile's STAB. It may also be worth using a Fighting-type such as Hariyama to check Sucker Punch users as an alternative due to Dark-types being weak to their STABs, particularly Absol, which has coverage moves for Steel-types. Finally, because Sceptile is almost completely walled by Amoonguss and Roselia, packing a Fire-type such as Entei or Emboar is a good idea, as they can easily deal with the Grass-types and not be crippled by sleep-inducing moves thanks to Sleep Talk.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While it may seem odd to let Sceptile's special attacking prowess go to waste by using it as a physical sweeper, this set has a few perks over the others. For one, it can more readily take advantage of Sceptile's Dream World ability, Unburden, which takes the already fast Sceptile and makes certain that nothing outspeeds it. Secondly, Sceptile's physical movepool is actually much better than its special movepool. Finally, there's the fact that this set actually has a means of boosting its offense, something the specially offensive sets lack. Swords Dance allows Sceptile to double its Attack in a single turn and lets it sweep much more easily. Leaf Blade is the STAB move of choice here, as its respectable 90 Base Power will do good amounts of damage to anything after a Swords Dance boost. The last two slots are dedicated to coverage moves. Earthquake and Drain Punch both demolish Steel-types, but the former trades super effective coverage on Normal-type users of Sap Sipper and Ferroseed for a higher Base Power and the ability to maim grounded Fire- and Poison-types such as Entei and Drapion. Acrobatics is used not only to ensure the activation of Flying Gem, but also because of its high Base Power and super effective coverage on opposing Grass-types and Bug-types, bar Ferroseed. If you choose to forgo Acrobatics, then Rock Slide can be used to land a good hit on Flying-types such as Moltres that would otherwise have no trouble countering this set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs ensure that, before an Unburden boost, Sceptile ties with base 105s if it runs Adamant and at worse ties with opposing Sceptile with Jolly. Attack is then maximized and the remaining EVs are placed in Defense to slightly cushion Sceptile against physical priority. Adamant is preferred with Flying Gem as Sceptile is missing out on the power that Life Orb provides and gets a ton of Speed once it activates Unburden. If you're confident you can get Unburden to activate, you can get away with running 0 Speed and invest all of the EVs in Sceptile's bulk, since even without any investment, Sceptile outruns Timid Choice Scarf Manectric--the fastest thing you'll see in RU. Grass Gem is also an option to activate Unburden, but Flying Gem ensures Sceptile always has access to a fully powered Acrobatics. A Jolly nature and Overgrow should be used when Sceptile forgoes the use of a Gem to activate Unburden. Stick to the given moves; all of Sceptile's effective coverage moves have been talked about.</p>

<p>This set is pretty self-sufficient as it is, but it benefits from the standard things all offensive Pokemon benefit from, namely entry hazards and the weakening of its checks. Uxie can set up Stealth Rock and then give Sceptile a good setup opportunity with its trademark Yawn + U-turn combo. Spikes users such as Smeargle and Crustle also make good partners. Strong physical attackers that can severely dent opposing physical walls, perhaps even a second Swords Dance sweeper, are also appreciated. Kabutops has decent defensive synergy with Sceptile and can either punch holes into enemy defenses or take advantage of the holes Sceptile punches and sweep itself.</p>

[SET]
name: SubSeed
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Leaf Storm / Giga Drain
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Focus Blast
item: Leftovers
ability: Overgrow
nature: Timid
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Despite the introduction of Whimsicott, which is the be-all and end-all of SubSeeders, Sceptile can also fill this niche and differentiates itself from the cotton ball due to its ability to hurt opposing Pokemon through direct offense in addition to passive damage. The strategy here is to use Leech Seed as a Pokemon switches in, then use Substitute to protect Sceptile from status and attacks while regaining most of the sacrificed HP though the aforementioned Leech Seed. Whenever the opportunity presents itself, Sceptile is free to fire off a powerful Leaf Storm or do more consistent damage with Giga Drain. It's worth noting that Sceptile also has the option of using Substitute until it is in Overgrow range in order to fire off an even stronger STAB attack. Hidden Power Fire is the coverage move of choice because it lands a super effective hit on all the Grass-types that would otherwise wall this set. Focus Blast is a viable alternative because it maintains coverage on Ferroseed and makes it possible for Sceptile to beat Sap Sipper users such as Sawsbuck and Bouffalant. It does, however, come with the unfortunate side effect of leaving Sceptile completely walled by Roselia and Amoonguss.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs ensure that Sceptile outpaces as much as possible, Speed tying with other Sceptile at the very least, and maximize its Special Attack. You may also choose to run max Speed; this is especially useful if you opt against Hidden Power Fire as Sceptile's coverage move, as this would mean it doesn't need to run a 30 Speed IV, essentially ensuring its always faster than opposing Sceptile. Doing this also comes with the benefit of recovering a greater HP percentage though Leech Seed every turn. Hidden Power Ice is also an acceptable coverage move, as it still gets super effective coverage on all the Grass-types in the tier, bar Ferroseed.</p>

<p>This particular Sceptile variant appreciates entry hazard support more than any other due to the sheer volume of switches it forces. Smeargle can act as a very effective suicide lead, often getting at least two layers of entry hazards up before going down. This, of course, means that you will also have to invest in a spinblocker to prevent the hazards from being blown away; Spiritomb and Rotom both fill this role quite nicely. Because Sceptile cannot possibly cover every relevant threat with a single coverage move, it also appreciates a partner who can take advantage of the Pokemon that don't mind its chosen coverage move. If you went with Hidden Power Fire, then Sap Sipper users such as Miltank and Bouffalant are the main issue. Luckily, every Pokemon with access to this ability shares the Normal typing, allowing you to take advantage of it by pairing Sceptile with a sturdy Fighting-type, such as Gurdurr or Hariyama. On the other hand, if you decide to go with Focus Blast, then pairing Sceptile with a Fire-type that can take advantage of the Grass-types which will wall this set is a good idea.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sceptile has access to a few other moves that have not been covered in the above sets but may prove to be useful if your team is in need of such support. Grass Whistle, despite its unreliable accuracy, can be used to put an opposing Pokemon out of commission--often permanently thanks to BW's sleep mechanics. Endeavor may also be considered, with Sceptile using its blazing Speed to cripple something just before it goes down. A Sunny Day + Solar Beam set with Hidden Power Fire and Focus Blast as coverage can also be used, but most of the time Sceptile will find itself missing the additional power Leaf Storm provides or being unable to set up and stay in a second turn to attack. Another option for Sceptile is to take advantage of both its offenses and go mixed. This, however, would require it to split its EVs, something that it is not keen on doing. A specially-based Unburden set with Grass Gem is also viable, but Sceptile is usually fast enough as it is and Life Orb brings more consistent results. Finally, White Herb may be used to provide Sceptile with the ability to fire off two consecutive, full-powered Leaf Storms, but this can prove to be a very situational tool.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Straight-up countering Sceptile is impossible due to its versatility and tendency to use different Hidden Powers for coverage. However, if you manage to figure out which Hidden Power type Sceptile is carrying, then the task of countering it becomes much easier--at least as far as special sets are concerned. Roselia and Amoonguss are the safest switch-ins, as they only fear Acrobatics due to their high Special Defense allowing them to take even super effective Hidden Powers and have Poison-type STAB to retaliate with. Altaria is probably the next safest switch-in, as it resists the Grass- and Fighting-type attacks Sceptile commonly carries and doesn't take too much from Hidden Power Rock due to its awesome Special Defense. However, if Sceptile happens to be carrying Hidden Power Ice or is a Swords Dance variant with Rock Slide, Altaria is no good. Similarly, Moltres and Charizard resist every move Sceptile commonly carries, except for Rock-type ones which hit them 4x super effectively. A specially defensive Flareon also works quite well as a counter to the special sets, but the Swords Dance variant will almost certainly be able to OHKO it after setting up. Cryogonal is in a similar boat, but it fears being hit by two consecutive Focus Blasts and will definitely lose to the Swords Dance set. Ferroseed and Pokemon with the ability Sap Sipper, such as Bouffalant and Miltank, also work quite well if Sceptile happens to be lacking Focus Blast--and Hidden Power Fire in the case of the former. Many of the aforementioned Pokemon have a fatal weakness to Stealth Rock though, so you need to be careful. Accelgor, Aerodactyl, and various common Choice Scarf users outpace Sceptile too, so you can always try to deal with it this way; watch out for Unburden sets though.</p>
