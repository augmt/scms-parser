[Overview]

<p>At a glance, Emboar doesn't exactly seem to stand out. The last car on a train of potent Fire-types occupying RU, Emboar is found constantly vying for spots occupied by well-established powerhouses such as Entei and Moltres. However, Emboar retains several unique attributes that allow it to differentiate itself from its Fire-type brethren. Emboar's secondary Fighting typing not only grants it a potent secondary STAB attack for breaking through a variety of Pokemon, but also a neutrality to Stealth Rock, making it easier to switch in and out, as well as granting it an important resistance to Sucker Punch so that it can check Pokemon such as Absol and Spiritomb effectively. Emboar's 110 / 65 / 65 defenses are well suited for it, allowing it to check Pokemon such as Sceptile, Escavalier, and Durant, while also minimizing recoil damage.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, Emboar retains certain glaring flaws. Emboar's poor Speed tends to hold it back quite often, only marginally outpacing Sceptile when wielding a Choice Scarf. The vast majority of Emboar's movepool retains nasty side effects, ranging from recoil to stat drops, hurting its longevity and staying power. Moreover, with common Pokemon such as Slowking, Qwilfish, and Rhydon innately keeping it in check, Emboar has to rely on solid team support to function properly. Emboar can prove a dangerous threat and valuable asset to any team, though to do so it must receive proper support.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>By utilizing a Choice Scarf, Emboar is capable of mitigating its low base Speed to become a dangerous immediate attacker. Though a Choice Scarf does not by any means make Emboar exceedingly fast, only achieving a Speed of 376, it does allow Emboar to outpace and threaten several common and dangerous Pokemon, such as Sceptile, Durant, and Jynx, with ease. Flare Blitz is Emboar's STAB move of choice, hitting many common Pokemon hard and allowing Emboar to threaten bulky Pokemon such as Tangrowth. Superpower offers a high-powered secondary STAB move for Emboar, providing respectable neutral coverage alongside Flare Blitz, as well as hitting Rock-types particularly hard. Wild Charge rounds off Emboar's coverage, allowing it to hit Slowking, Qwilfish, and Moltres hard, while also generally hitting bulky Water-types such as Poliwrath consistently, allowing Emboar to KO it after a little prior damage. With its bases covered in terms of coverage, Emboar can reinforce its ability to switch into common sleep inducers such as Lilligant and Jynx with Sleep Talk.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>In terms of alternative moves, Head Smash can be utilized to punish Fire-types attempting to switch into Emboar as well as breaking through moderately bulky Flying-types such as Sigilyph that can take a single Flare Blitz or Wild Charge, though Stealth Rock does help wear down most of these Pokemon to the point where they can be dispatched by other means. Fire Punch is also a solid alternative, providing Emboar a Fire-type STAB lacking recoil, improving its survivability mid-game. Earthquake is capable of hitting Fire-types that switch into Flare Blitz and the Poison-types that switch into Superpower such as Drapion and Qwilfish, making it worthwhile if only as a "safe" attacking move.</p>

<p>Emboar appreciates Grass-types for their ability to wear down bulky Water-types for it, Sceptile and Amoonguss being two pertinent examples. Electric-types such as Rotom are also quite useful, being able to threaten common Pokemon that resist Emboar's STAB attacks as well as offering a respectable pivot to fall back on when Emboar is threatened by speedy Flying-types. Emboar functions very well in a Fire / Water / Grass core, and accordingly Water-types such as Feraligatr and Kabutops make solid partners, wearing down opposing Water-types and taking advantage of Emboar's ability to wear down Grass-types for them.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Combined with its impressive 123 base Attack, high-powered attacks, and the Choice Band, Emboar becomes an incredibly potent wallbreaker. Emboar's Choice Band-boosted Flare Blitz is ridiculously powerful, hitting even harder than Entei's, and is capable of breaking through the vast majority of Pokemon. Superpower compliments Flare Blitz very well, allowing Emboar to maintain solid neutral coverage against a variety of Pokemon, as well breaking through bulky Rock-types such as Regirock. Wild Charge allows Emboar to hit bulky Water-types without the stat drops of Superpower, as well as hitting Pokemon such as Moltres that resist its dual STAB. Sleep Talk is a useful tool for Emboar to switch into sleep inducing Grass-types such as Lilligant, allowing it to absorb the sleep and retain a solid chance to OHKO it the next turn with either Superpower or Flare Blitz.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With 20 Speed EVs, Emboar is capable of outpacing minimum Speed Lanturn, allowing it to 2HKO with Superpower before it can hit back, and the remaining EVs are invested in HP to allow Emboar to take hits and recoil damage better. However, Emboar can bump up its Speed investment to outpace other defensive Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Qwilfish. Moreover, though it does not improve its wallbreaking capabilities, Emboar can run a spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature to outpace Adamant Absol. Head Smash can be used to more definitively take on Fire-types, though for the most part they cannot stomach unresisted hits from Emboar after Stealth Rock damage. Fire Punch offers a reasonably powerful Fire-type STAB that doesn't sap Emboar's HP with recoil damage.</p>

<p>Since Choice Band Emboar has no real "counters" in the strictest sense of the word, partners for Emboar are largely Pokemon who can take advantage of its wallbreaking capabilities. Flying-types such as Swellow and Braviary appreciate Emboar's ability to break through Rock- and Steel-types, allowing them to take advantage of STAB attacks. Additionally, Water-type sweepers such as Kabutops and Feraligatr appreciate Emboar's ability to draw in and wear down Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Slowking to prepare a sweep. Emboar also provides a solid switch-in to Rotom-C and specially oriented Sceptile, which both Kabutops and Feraligatr fear. Emboar is one of the better Pokemon for stacking Fire-types, as it lacks the Stealth Rock weakness of other Fire-types and thus is less reliant on Rapid Spin support to perform at optimal capacity, making it a potent partner for Entei, with very few Pokemon being capable of taking the brunt of both Pokemon's attacks continuously.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker

evs: 72 Atk / 252 SpA / 184 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Emboar is most commonly seen using its incredible Attack stat with its high Base Power physical attacks, you shouldn't forget that Emboar has a solid Special Attack stat with some great special attacks as well. This set aims to use Emboar's often overlooked Special Attack stat to catch some conventional counters to Emboar off guard without giving up Emboar's ability to check the likes of Escavalier and Absol.</p>

<p>Fire Blast lets Emboar beat Steelix, Tangrowth, and even Qwilfish without taking recoil damage, as they are all either OHKOed or 2HKOed. Stealth Rock support is needed to 2HKO Qwilfish, however. Superpower hits Pokemon such as Entei and opposing Emboar hard and is also Emboar's best bet against incoming Lanturn. The stat drops aren't nearly as detrimental to this set due to Emboar's larger reliance on special attacks. Grass Knot deals with the physical walls that Fire Blast cannot; Poliwrath, Rhydon, and Alomomola are all hit incredibly hard while defensive Slowking is 2HKOed after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. The last slot either reinforces Emboar's coverage or gives it some added utility. Wild Charge is generally preferred for the more consistent hit on Slowking and Qwilfish, but Emboar will need Stealth Rock support in order to 2HKO Slowking. It also gives Emboar a way to KO Moltres on the switch with Stealth Rock support, as it walls this set otherwise. Sleep Talk is a viable option as well, as Emboar matches up well against most sleep inducers in the tier. However, do note that Emboar lacks the Speed and bulk that its other sets have, which can sometimes hurt it when trying to absorb sleep and still defeat its inducer.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The nature and EV spread aim to get the most out of Emboar's solid Special Attack stat. 184 Speed EVs are required to outspeed defensive Qwilfish and ensure Emboar can land two hits on it before being hit with a possible Waterfall. The remaining EVs go into Attack to pump up Superpower and Wild Charge. A Rash nature is used so Emboar's physical bulk isn't compromised, thus allowing it to still deal with Escavalier and Spiritomb relatively well. Expert Belt is the recommended hold item for mixed Emboar, as it has great super effective coverage and is able to bluff a Choice item very well. For example, it can predict a Slowking switch-in with Wild Charge and then surprise an incoming Pokemon with an Electric-type immunity, such as Rhydon or Manectric, with the appropriate move. However, Life Orb is a possibility for a more consistent power boost. Be sure to watch Wild Charge usage with Life Orb though, as the combined recoil will quickly take its toll on Emboar if it's used too excessively. Hidden Power Ice is the most notable other option to consider for this set, as it can handle Druddigon. Hidden Power Electric can be used if you desire an OHKO on Qwilfish after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Finally, Earthquake is able to 2HKO Lanturn. However, Superpower will generally handle it well enough over time anyway due to Lanturn's lack of reliable recovery.</p>

<p>Like with any other offensive Pokemon, Emboar appreciates Stealth Rock support to turn many 3HKOs into 2HKOs. With Stealth Rock support, Emboar is able to 2HKO Qwilfish with Fire Blast and 2HKO Slowking with Wild Charge. Offensive teams can turn to the likes of Omastar, Smeargle, and Crustle for early-game Stealth Rock support, and more balanced teams can find Golurk, Rhydon, and Druddigon to be effective. Mesprit is perhaps the most notable Stealth Rock user due to its ability to get Emboar in safely with U-turn, as it commonly draws out the likes of Steelix and Absol for Emboar to handle. Emboar struggles with Uxie and Mesprit, as it can't immediately overwhelm them nor can it outspeed them. For this reason, Escavalier makes for a fine partner; not only can it trap these Psychic-types with Pursuit, but it can also run Sleep Talk so Emboar doesn't have to worry about having to use it. Gallade is a great offensive partner for this set as Emboar can lure in and 2HKO Slowking, one of Gallade's most prominent checks. If Emboar decides to use a Life Orb, then Rapid Spin support from Kabutops can be a worthy addition to ensure Emboar doesn't wear down too quickly. Because this Emboar is able to handle most physical walls in RU, fast physical attackers are great teammates to take advantage of the holes it punches into the opposing team. With Steelix and Rhydon out of the way, Swellow and Choice Scarf Braviary will have few problems with going on a late-game sweep. If Emboar is able to successfully eliminate Tangrowth, then Rock Polish Torterra becomes a very terrifying foe to face, while a fallen Qwilfish or Poliwrath will make Durant's life much easier. Fast special attackers can also be effective; Sceptile, Galvantula, Choice Scarf Rotom-C, and Shell Smash Omastar all appreciate special walls being weakened or outright KOed.</p>

[SET]
name: Defensive
move 1: Flare Blitz
move 2: Superpower
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Protect
item: Leftovers
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Emboar is often seen as an offensive Fire-type due to its fantastic STAB combination and coverage, people often overlook its 110 / 65 / 65 defenses and great defensive typing, which allow defensive variants to check a surprising number of threats. Unlike some its fellow Fire-types that can be used defensively, such as Entei and Moltres, Emboar is not weak to Stealth Rock, which means that it is significantly more difficult to wear down throughout the match, and since entry hazards are omnipresent in RU, this gives Emboar a very distinct advantage over its competitors. Together, these factors make this variant of Emboar a worthy addition to any Fire / Water / Grass core in need of a solid check to threats such as Durant, Escavalier, Lilligant, Accelgor, and Klinklang.</p>

<p>While their side effects might be off-putting, Flare Blitz and Superpower are Emboar's best STABs for this set, as they are simply the strongest physical attacks that Emboar has at its disposal. Though attacks such as Fire Punch and Brick Break might seem more appealing due to their lack of negative effects, Flare Blitz and Superpower give Emboar some much-needed power to make up for this set's lack of offensive investment, and let it do serious damage to the Pokemon that might attempt to switch in on it. Will-O-Wisp is a huge part of this set's effectiveness, as it allows Emboar to neuter physically offensive threats, allowing it to take their attacks with greater ease. Furthermore, Will-O-Wisp is incredibly effective against many of Emboar's common switch-ins, such as Rhydon, Feraligatr, Kabutops, Aerodactyl, and Druddigon, as these Pokemon will typically switch in expecting one of Emboar's STAB moves, only to be quickly crippled by a burn. Finally, Protect rounds off this set by allowing Emboar to scout for dangerous moves, as well as giving it a crucial extra turn of Leftovers recovery. While this might not seem that important, Protect also lets Emboar play mindgames with the opponent, and the extra turn of Leftovers recovery can occasionally cause Emboar to move out of KO range from certain attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A physically defensive spread is generally best for defensive Emboar, as it lets Emboar take on the biggest range of threats, including Durant and Escavalier, which are otherwise fairly difficult to check. A physically defensive spread also allows Emboar to survive a slew of powerful attacks from strong, physically offensive Pokemon and retaliate with Will-O-Wisp to cripple them for the rest of the match. However, a specially defensive spread is also a viable option, as it allows Emboar to check the likes of of Lilligant and Sceptile with greater effectiveness while still acting as a decent answer to Durant and Escavalier. However, Durant and Escavalier are far more difficult to answer effectively, and as RU is largely dominated by physically offensive threats rather than specially based ones, a physically defensive spread will generally prove to be the better option.</p>

<p>Due to Emboar's incredibly vast movepool, there are a plethora of options that one can use over the suggested moves. For starters, if you really dislike the negative effects of Superpower and Flare Blitz, Hammer Arm and Fire Punch are viable options, though Fire Punch is noticeably weaker and Hammer Arm might miss in crucial situations. Alternatively, you can replace Will-O-Wisp with Toxic in order to lure in and cripple defensive Water-types such as Alomomola and Slowking; however, this means that Emboar can't cripple Druddigon and other physical attackers anymore and that Qwilfish can switch in without any threat. Finally, if you do not find the extra Leftovers recovery from Protect particularly useful, you can replace it with Roar in order to deter setup sweepers, Wild Charge to somewhat threaten Moltres and Slowking on the switch, or Taunt to prevent the likes of Alomomola from passing Wishes as easily.</p>

<p>Defensive Water-types such as Qwilfish, Alomomola, and Slowking give this set huge problems, as it cannot do anything to them barring a burn from Will-O-Wisp, and they can proceed to either threaten it with their STAB Water-type attacks or support their team by setting up hazards or passing huge Wishes to their teammates. To make up for this, it is recommended that you support Emboar with Grass-type Pokemon such as Sceptile, Lilligant, Rotom-C, and Roselia in order to take advantage of the defensive Water-types that Emboar tends to lure in so effectively. Furthermore, while Emboar has fantastic physical bulk, its weaknesses mean that it cannot effectively check certain physical threats, in particular Ground- and Flying-type ones such as Golurk and Braviary. In order to make up for this shortcoming, it is recommended to pair Emboar with another physical wall that can cover the threats it is unable to beat. Alomomola is particularly effective, since it is also able to pass huge Wishes to Emboar, which helps make up for the latter's lack of reliable recovery. In general, this Emboar fits best on a balanced Fire / Water / Grass core, as these cores are able to effectively cover most of Emboar's weaknesses.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Emboar has a rather expansive special movepool that includes Focus Blast, Fire Blast, Grass Knot, and even Scald, as well as a solid base 100 Special Attack to work with, though for the most part the surprise value and ability to overcome Alomomola isn't worth the drop in overall power that such a change mandates. Arm Thrust is an interesting option, as it offers Emboar the ability to OHKO Focus Sash users such as Smeargle and a Fighting-type STAB that doesn't reduce its stats, though its usefulness doesn't go far beyond that. Flame Charge can mitigate Emboar's mediocre Speed in a similar manner to Choice Scarf, but unlike Choice Scarf it requires a free turn to set up and is thus punished even more by Aqua Jet users or other faster Pokemon. Toxic is feasible for non-Choice Band sets, as it cripples Pokemon such as Slowking and Alomomola that can generally switch into Emboar repeatedly without too much hassle, though the fact that both such Pokemon have Regenerator to passively neutralize a few turns of Toxic damage while resetting the Toxic turns greatly devalues this.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bulky Water-type Pokemon are the usually the best responses to Emboar, with Slowking, Poliwrath, Qwilfish, Quagsire, and Alomomola all being able to take everything but Choice Band-boosted Wild Charges fairly comfortably and pressure it with their STAB attacks (Quagsire being the exception as it's immune to even Wild Charge). Slowking and Alomomola in particular are very strong switch-ins, with Regenerator preventing them from being worn down as easily. As Emboar is vulnerable to every form of entry hazard and relies upon recoil moves as its primary source of damage, entry hazards are an excellent solution to limit its time on the field. Kabutops and Feraligatr can stomach Emboar's Flare Blitz well and threaten it with Aqua Jet, with the former capable of further capitalizing on Flare Blitz by ascertaining a Speed boost from Weak Armor. Druddigon takes on Emboar rather well, resisting all of Emboar's common attacks barring Superpower and damaging it with Rough Skin. Despite a weakness to Fighting-type attacks, Rhydon's excellent physical bulk allows it to shrug off everything barring Choice Band-boosted Superpowers and threatening Emboar with its powerful Earthquake. Uxie's natural bulk and resistance to Superpower means that it can switch into Emboar rather easily, from which point it can either paralyze it with Thunder Wave or immediately threaten it with a STAB Psychic. Emboar's lower base Speed means that even with a Choice Scarf it is only outspeeding Pokemon like Sceptile by a hair, meaning faster threats such as Swellow and Aerodactyl can easily revenge kill it.</p>

[Unreleased]

<p>Emboar's Dream World ability is Reckless, which is a very useful ability for it, as most of Emboar's commonly used moves are recoil-based, meaning that it will have a more wholly relevant ability to work with, though the increased recoil will in turn reduce its lifespan in a match.</p>
