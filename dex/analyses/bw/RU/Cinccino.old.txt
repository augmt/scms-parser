[Overview]

<p>Don't be fooled by Cinccino's cute and harmless appearance, for it is a very threatening Pokemon. Its ability, Skill Link, allows it to make good use of its signature move, Tail Slap, to hit harder than almost any Pokemon around. Thanks to Cinccino's use of multi-hit moves, not even Substitute and Focus Sash users are safe against it, which also allows Cinccino to be a great weapon against Smeargle. It is also one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, sitting at a high base 115 Speed, even outpacing the speedy Scolipede. On top of that, Cinccino has a decent Attack stat and a good movepool to work with. With all of these qualities, Cinccino is certainly a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>However, don't think that Cinccino is without its flaws. It has absolutely no way to hit Steel- and Ghost-types, and for this reason, it often needs quite a bit of support to work to its full potential. Additionally, Cinccino also has horrible defenses; 75 / 60 / 60 means any decently powerful hit will OHKO it, and a lack of any useful resistances aren't helping Cinccino either. However, don't let these flaws deter you from using Cinccino, as it is still a threat that is not to be overlooked.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Cinccino's standard cleaning set. Its high Speed allows it to outpace a vast majority of Pokemon in RU, while its solid Attack allows it to sweep weakened teams. Its good coverage also complements its cleaning ability, meaning it can hit many Pokemon except for Steel- and Ghost-types for at least neutral damage. That said, Tail Slap is the STAB move of choice here, taking advantage of Skill Link and hitting for a massive 125 Base Power. Bullet Seed is the preferred coverage move, hitting Kabutops, Rhydon, and Slowking for heavy damage. Rock Blast is a great move to use with Skill Link as well, hitting Moltres and Crustle in addition to dealing decent damage to Escavalier. Finally, Aqua Tail is chosen to dent weakened Steelix and Aggron.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Maximum investment has gone into Attack and Speed to be as fast and powerful as possible. A Jolly nature is chosen in order to be able to outspeed Jolly Scolipede and Archeops, two Pokemon it wouldn't be able to outspeed with an Adamant nature. A Life Orb is the chosen item here to increase Cinccino's likelihood of successfully executing a sweep. King's Rock is usable, as with Cinccino's use of multi-hit moves and high Speed, it can cause flinches; however, the loss in power without Life Orb is very noticeable. Finally, U-turn can be used to switch out of common counters such as Steelix and Spiritomb, but the Life Orb damage along with entry hazards will quickly rack up.</p>

<p>As Cinccino very often struggles against Steel-types, a Pokemon such as Magneton or Magmortar can be immensely helpful. The former can trap the Steel-types and eliminate them, while the latter simply roasts them while providing offensive synergy with Cinccino as well as absorbing Will-O-Wisp. Pursuit support from the likes of Spiritomb and Absol is great in order to eliminate Ghost-types such as Rotom and Misdreavus. Finally, entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Scolipede, Roselia, and Qwilfish aids Cinccino in nabbing KOs on some bulky Pokemon such as Druddigon and Slowking.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Tail Slap
move 2: Bullet Seed
move 3: Rock Blast
move 4: U-turn
item: Choice Band
ability: Skill Link
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes a slightly different approach from the previous one. While a Life Orb provides Cinccino with late-game sweeping prowess, a Choice Band gives Cinccino enough power to be able to break through most defensive cores. A Choice Band also does not wear down Cinccino like a Life Orb does; and it can hence utilize U-turn more effectively, allowing it to serve as an effective hit-and-run attacker and hard hitter at once. This set also scores KOs on bulkier Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Slowking.<p>

<p>Tail Slap is Cinccino's STAB move of choice, hitting with great power against many Pokemon. Bullet Seed deals with Kabutops, Omastar, and Rhydon, all of which resist Tail Slap, while Rock Blast pummels Moltres and Braviary. Finally, U-turn serves as a scouting move to allow Cinccino to escape from its common switch-ins such as Steelix and Escavalier.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Jolly nature is chosen here to again be able to outpace maximum Speed Scolipede and Archeops. Choice Band allows Cinccino to deal with threats it would be unable to break through otherwise, such as Amoonguss and Slowking. Skill Link is the chosen ability to get the most out of Cinccino's moves. Technician is significantly less useful, as with it, Cinccino must rely on a higher degree of luck as opposed to Skill Link guaranteeing five hits out of every move. Technician can, however, be useful in some situations for the extra power provided in each hit. Aqua Tail is a usable option in the final moveslot to hit Steelix. However, because it can only achieve a 4HKO at best, it isn't particularly useful. An Adamant nature is a viable alternative if the extra power is needed, especially given that Cinccino outspeeds base 100 Speed opponents such as Typhlosion and Charizard regardless. However, with an Adamant nature, Cinccino loses the ability to outspeed Archeops and Scolipede.</p>

<p>Cinccino will very often struggle with Steel- and Ghost-types such as the aforementioned Escavalier, Steelix, and Spiritomb. This makes a Fire-type such as Entei or Moltres important, as they can severely damage the former, while absorbing Will-O-Wisp from the latter. Users of Pursuit, such as Spiritomb and Absol, are also very helpful to keep Ghost-types that keep Cinccino at bay. Magneton is also a good teammate, trapping Steel-types, while Volt Switch can allow it to form a VoltTurn core to keep up offensive momentum. For this reason, along with attaining KOs on bulky Pokemon such as Amoonguss, entry hazard support from the likes of Qwilfish, Smeargle, or Crustle is greatly appreciated. Qwilfish also serves to check the Fighting-types that may give Cinccino trouble.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Tail Slap

move 3: Rock Blast
move 4: U-turn
item: Choice Scarf

nature: Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>As opposed to the previous set, this one functions as an anti-lead and revenge killer. With this along with the multi-hitting moves Cinccino packs, it can defeat common leads such as Aerodactyl and Accelgor while maintaining decent power. A Choice Scarf also grants Cinccino the ability to outspeed things it normally wouldn't be able to without it, such as Choice Scarf Emboar and Rotom-C as well as Sceptile. Tail Slap is the preferred STAB move for its extra power over Return. Bullet Seed, as previously mentioned, is a great coverage move to maim incoming Kabutops and Rhydon. Rock Blast serves to hit Aerodactyl and Scolipede. Finally, U-turn is the chosen move in the final moveslot in order to scout common switch-ins, particularly Spiritomb and Steelix.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Adamant nature is chosen here because with a Choice Scarf boosting Cinccino's Speed, a Jolly nature is unnecessary. Skill Link is important to ensure all of Cinccino's moves hit at maximum power. As Cinccino sometimes might not hit hard enough, especially against bulky Pokemon such as Slowking and Druddigon, entry hazard support from the likes of Qwilfish or Smeargle is greatly appreciated, and the former can check Fighting-types quite well. A Fire-type such as Entei or Moltres is also useful to severely damage Steel-types while being able to safely take on Ghost-types. Alternatively, Magneton can trap the Steel-types and hit them while taking little damage from most Ghost-types, and its access to Volt Switch also allows it to keep offensive momentum. Finally, as previously mentioned, users of Pursuit, such as Absol or Spiritomb, are helpful to keep Ghost-types at bay.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Cinccino's list of other viable options is quite sparse. Sing may seem like a cool move due to its sleep inducing effect, but its horrible accuracy is a big letdown. Furthermore, Cinccino is too frail to make use of such moves and is better off attacking outright. Wake-Up Slap is an interesting move to hit Steel-types such as Aggron and Ferroseed, but the move is weak without the less reliable Technician. Return is more reliable than Tail Slap, but is significantly less powerful and gives up one of Cinccino's main selling points, the safe removal of Smeargle and Scolipede. Knock Off can remove Eviolite from the likes of Roselia and Ferroseed, but the move is weak and has little utility. Finally, Calm Mind is a usable move to boost Special Attack, along with a usable special movepool in Hyper Voice, Grass Knot, Thunderbolt, and Focus Blast, but Cinccino's low base 65 Special Attack and bad defenses aren't doing it any favors.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Steel-types such as Steelix and Escavalier stand as Cinccino's greatest counters. The former takes little from any of Cinccino's attacks and can wear it down while the latter can come in and severely damage it with Megahorn. Ghost-types such as Spiritomb and Misdreavus also take little to nothing from any of Cinccino's attacks and can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Druddigon and Ferroseed can come in on Tail Slap and wear down Cinccino quickly with Rough Skin and Iron Barbs, respectively, dealing damage for each hit of Tail Slap. Some faster opponents, such as Sceptile, can make quick work of Cinccino. Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-C and Emboar, as well as priority users such as Absol and Entei can revenge kill Cinccino quite easily. Finally, Tangrowth can also take repeated onslaughts from Cinccino and either incapacitate it with Sleep Powder or repeatedly hit it with Giga Drain.</p>
