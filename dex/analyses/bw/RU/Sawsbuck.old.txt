[Overview]

<p>All things considered, Sawsbuck is a very interesting Pokemon. Its unique Normal / Grass typing offers both an effective dual STAB and a set of helpful resistances and immunities. Its offensive stats, while not by any stretch of the imagination amazing, are enough to allow Sawsbuck to function as a dangerous and even versatile offensive threat, sporting a solid base 100 Attack and a Speed stat that allows it to outpace a large amount of the metagame. Sawsbuck's access to Sap Sipper is also an incredibly useful attribute in a metagame where Grass-type attacks abound, allowing Sawsbuck to switch into and, with some prior damage, dispatch the various Grass-types of the tier. Better yet, as walls such as Tangrowth grow less prominent and Alomomola and other such Pokemon become more common, Sawsbuck is becoming better. However, as one would imagine, Sawsbuck is far from perfect, and its low defenses and only slightly above average Speed make it fairly easy to keep in check with priority and faster Pokemon. While walls that handle Sawsbuck are decreasing in use, generally bulky Pokemon such as Escavalier and Druddigon are growing more common, both of whom handle Sawsbuck without too much trouble. While it's far from a bad Pokemon, Sawsbuck does require appropriate team support to function at its fullest potential.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Though commonly used for its offensive prowess, Sawsbuck can also serve as an effective team player through the use of Baton Pass. Sawsbuck's unique set of resistances and immunities, which is backed by the threat of its powerful STAB attacks, allow it to find numerous opportunities to set up a Substitute to safely pass off to a teammate or simply dish out damage on its own. Baton Pass also allows Sawsbuck to absorb a Grass-type attack with Sap Sipper and pass an Attack boost off to a partner, allowing it to effectively make use of its ability even before the Grass-type in question is in the range where a +1 Return can dispatch it. Substitute, aside from being an excellent tool for bringing in a more frail Pokemon safely, gives Sawsbuck the leeway to play around Ghost-types like Misdreavus that rely on status to combat it. Return is a very consistent STAB move and is critical for threatening Grass-types such as Lilligant and Amoonguss that Sawsbuck enjoys switching into to net an Attack boost. Horn Leech complements Return nicely, hitting Rock-types that would otherwise shrug off Return and providing recovery that allows Sawsbuck to produce more Substitutes throughout the match.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe would yield bulkier Substitutes, but in doing so, Sawsbuck loses a moderate amount of offensive presence, failing to 2HKO common Pokemon such as Slowking and Moltres. Double-Edge offers Sawsbuck a slightly more powerful Normal-type STAB to work with, but the recoil is detrimental to its effectiveness as a Substitute passer. Berries used in a pinch, most notably the Salac and Liechi Berry, can be utilized over Leftovers in order to pass more significant buffs to a partner, but the consistent recovery of Leftovers allows Sawsbuck to serve a longer lasting role throughout a match.</p>

<p>The most useful partners for this set are those that struggle to take hits well, as they benefit the most from the ability to switch in freely through Baton Pass. Absol, Archeops, and Durant all are good examples of such Pokemon, as they are not only very difficult to stop behind a Substitute, but also appreciate the potential Attack boosts passed to them through Sap Sipper. Similarly, slower Pokemon such as Aggron and Druddigon can utilize the Substitutes Sawsbuck provides to mitigate the disadvantage bestowed by their low Speed, wearing down the Steel-types that can check them. Entei is another useful partner for this set, as it is is capable of breaking through the bulky Grass- and Steel-types that bother Sawbuck and can also bait bulky Water-types that Sawsbuck can set up on.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sawsbuck's unique STAB combination and respectable offensive stats allow it to serve as a very effective Swords Dance sweeper. Sawsbuck's useful set of resistances and immunities offer it a variety of opportunities to set up, and with Swords Dance boosting its Attack to a potent 598 in a single turn, it quickly becomes a dangerous offensive threat. Return provides Sawsbuck with an excellent STAB option that has reasonable neutral coverage and few drawbacks. Double-Edge, while resulting in some extra recoil, provides a useful boost in power that allows Sawsbuck to comfortably KO Pokemon such as Sceptile and Scyther without a boost. Horn Leech complements Sawsbuck's Normal-type attacks rather nicely, offering it a secondary STAB that not only provides recovery but also helps it beat the various bulky Water- and Rock-types of the tier. Nature Power rounds off Sawsbuck's coverage, allowing it to hit Steel- and Fire-types particularly hard while having the added benefit of evading Sucker Punch from Absol and Spiritomb. On the other hand, while dropping Nature Power for Substitute makes Sawsbuck susceptible to Steel-types, this allows it to more effectively set up on defensively-inclined Water- and Ghost-types and also prevents it from being revenge killed as easily by faster Pokemon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Adamant nature is a viable option, and Sawsbuck can really benefit from the extra power against Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Uxie; in exchange, Sawsbuck cannot outspeed Pokemon such as Lilligant, Moltres, and Rotom, all of whom are important to outpace. The choice between Life Orb and Lum Berry is generally that of power versus safety, as Lum Berry grants Sawsbuck added insurance switching into potential Will-O-Wisps and Scalds without fear of being crippled. In terms of alternative items, Leftovers can be used alongside Substitute to procure guaranteed HP recovery to produce more Substitutes, but usually the recovery from Horn Leech is sufficient. Salac Berry is also an interesting option with Substitute, as it allows Sawsbuck to more effectively sweep faster teams once priority users have been dispatched. If this is used, an EV spread of 12 HP / 244 Atk / 252 Spe would prove optimal, guaranteeing that the Salac Berry is activated after three uses of Substitute. Baton Pass is a viable choice in the final moveslot, as it allows Sawsbuck to maintain momentum early in the game while even having the potential to pass Attack boosts gained from Sap Sipper and / or Swords Dance. Jump Kick offers similar coverage to Nature Power, trading perfect accuracy and the ability to evade Sucker Punch for the ability to hit Ferroseed for significant damage and prevent Archeops and Aerodactyl from getting a totally free switch into Sawsbuck. Megahorn can also be used, as it allows Sawsbuck to break through bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth with much less difficulty.</p>

<p>Choice Scarf Emboar makes a solid partner for Sawsbuck, switching into and threatening most Steel-types comfortably and in turn baiting bulky Water-types for Sawsbuck to set up on. Magneton is also proficient at eliminating troublesome Steel-types for Sawsbuck, and its plethora of useful resistances to Bug-, Ice-, Flying-, and Poison-type attacks all benefit Sawsbuck. Offensive Water-types, particularly physically-inclined ones such as Kabutops and Feraligatr, provide helpful sponges for the Ice- and Fire-type attacks Sawsbuck draws and help to wear down Tangrowth and other such shared checks over time.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>By forgoing setup, Sawsbuck can function as a potent immediate attacker thanks to its assortment of unique coverage options and high-powered attacks. Return is Sawsbuck's STAB move of choice, hitting most Pokemon neutrally without any immediate negative repercussions. Double-Edge, on the other hand, offers a more powerful Normal-type STAB, but the recoil that comes with it can be detrimental to Sawsbuck's performance at times. Horn Leech offers a moderately powerful secondary STAB whose recovery allows Sawsbuck to heal passive damage acquired from switching into entry hazards and weaker attacks. Nature Power rounds off Sawsbuck's coverage, allowing it to hit Steel-types hard while also allowing it to avoid Sucker Punch from the likes of Absol and Spiritomb. Megahorn's useful super effective coverage is the icing on the cake, allowing Sawsbuck to inflict impressive damage upon common switch-ins such as Tangrowth, Uxie, and Mesprit.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice between Choice Band and Life Orb is largely affected by what role Sawsbuck is meant to fulfill on a team. The extra power of Choice Band is invaluable for breaking through defensive Pokemon such as Steelix, Alomomola, and Tangrowth; however, the ability to switch moves makes Life Orb the superior option if Sawsbuck is meant to serve as late-game cleaner or wear down defensive cores for another Pokemon to sweep. Jump Kick can be used to thrash Ferroseed switch-ins, but Nature Power remains a far more consistent and safe attack option. Alternatively, moves such as Wild Charge and Feint Attack can be utilized to bait and wear down certain Pokemon such as Moltres, Misdreavus, and Drifblim should they be impeding another Pokemon's sweep, but Megahorn generally covers more relevant Pokemon. Baton Pass, while not immediately beating any particular threats, gives Sawsbuck the ability to scout the opponent early in the match, even passing the occasional Sap Sipper boost off to a partner. Likewise, Synthesis can be used to capitalize on the switches Sawsbuck forces, allowing it to recover its HP safely; this does mean dropping a valuable coverage option, though.</p>

<p>Golurk is a useful partner for Sawsbuck, providing good defensive synergy with it and either supporting it with Stealth Rock or helping to overload physical walls with its powerful Choice Band set. Fire-types, such as Emboar and Moltres, both are capable of switching into and pressuring Steel-types like Escavalier and Steelix that give Sawsbuck trouble and look to Sawsbuck to take on bulky Water-types in return. Additionally, Water-types such as Kabutops and Slowking both offer solid defensive synergy with Sawsbuck and can capitalize on its ability to wear down Water- and Grass-type Pokemon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Though it has mostly ignored until this point, Chlorophyll is far from a bad ability, and in the context of a dedicated sun team, Sawsbuck is very capable of utilizing this ability effectively. Agility is also an option to boost Sawsbuck's Speed, but the commonplace nature of priority does somewhat restrict its effectiveness. A dedicated Baton Pass set can be used to pass either Swords Dance or Agility boosts to a partner, but it does waste Sawsbuck's offensive capabilities, and there are superior partners for such a task. Support options such as Aromatherapy and Thunder Wave have niche use on offensive sets, but a fully support-based set is outclassed by bulky Grass-types, such as Roselia and Ferroseed. Leech Seed is a useful tool that can be used alongside Substitute to wear down otherwise impenetrable checks like Escavalier over time.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Certain defensive Steel-types, namely Steelix and Ferroseed, are very capable checks to Sawsbuck and take only meager amounts from its attacks and can either threaten it with Gyro Ball or set up entry hazards on it. Tangrowth and Amoonguss are both capable of sponging most of Sawsbuck's attacks repeatedly thanks to their good natural bulk and Regenerator ability, and they can pressure Sawsbuck with the appropriate Hidden Power or Poison-type STAB, respectively. Weezing, while moderately uncommon, is also a stalwart check to Sawsbuck, taking a pittance from most of its attacks and being capable of either crippling it with Will-O-Wisp or threatening it with its STAB attacks.</p>

<p>Despite its limited list of defensive checks and counters, Sawsbuck is much less lucky with offensive threats. Bulkier Bug-types such as Escavalier, Durant, and Scyther all capably stifle Sawsbuck, as they are able shrug of its assaults and threaten it with their STAB attacks. Faster Pokemon, such as Galvantula, Accelgor, Typhlosion, and Sigilyph, can all outpace and KO Sawsbuck with the appropriate attack, but they face difficulty switching in. Lastly, priority users such as Entei and Hitmonlee can keep Sawsbuck in check, with the former even being able to use Sawsbuck as a springboard to activate its ability, Unburden.</p>
