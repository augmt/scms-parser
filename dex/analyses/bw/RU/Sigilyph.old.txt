[Overview]

<p>Sigilyph is one of those Pokemon that has always been able to stand out in RU. With an amazing ability in Magic Guard giving it an immunity to any residual damage, Sigilyph can become a well-rounded threat in any match. Its good Special Attack and Speed give it scary offensive potential. BW2 made it even better, as Heat Wave was added to its arsenal, making an offensive set more viable and not as easily walled. Sigilyph can also perform a defensively inclined role with Cosmic Power, Roost, and Stored Power to effectively deal damage. It's not absolutely flawless, however. Sigilyph is not very bulky before setting up, with only 72/80/80 defenses and a multitude of common weaknesses. Don't let that deter you from using Sigilyph, though, because it can be a very effective Pokemon when given the right circumstances.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is by far Sigilyph's best set. With no Life Orb recoil thanks to Magic Guard, Sigilyph can become a powerful offensive threat while staying healthy throughout the match. The choice between Psychic and Psyshock is up to personal preference. Psyshock hits special walls such as Clefable and Cryogonal on their weaker physical defense, while Psychic hits neutral targets harder. Heat Wave is an essential coverage move that hits Escavalier, Steelix, and Ferroseed for super effective damage. The third slot is a toss-up between Air Slash and Energy Ball. Air Slash hits Dark-types for major damage, usually 2HKOing them, while Energy Ball hits Slowking, Crawdaunt, Rhydon, and Lanturn super effectively. Roost provides reliable recovery so that Sigilyph can stay healthy.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs allow Sigilyph to get the most out of its offensive capabilities. A Timid nature is chosen to maximize Sigilyph's Speed, which is unique and allows Sigilyph to outspeed Pokemon such as Drapion and Lilligant. Life Orb is the primary item, and because of Magic Guard its recoil is negated, giving Sigilyph a free 30% power boost. Dark Pulse could be used to hit Uxie and Slowking for super effective damage, but has little use otherwise.</p> 

<p>This set is vulnerable to Dark-types such as Spiritomb and cannot break through Uxie and Slowking easily, so Pokemon such as Escavalier or Durant can work as partners to severely damage them. In return, Sigilyph can dent Poliwrath and Qwilfish, common answers to Durant and Escavalier. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Smeargle and Crustle can make sweeping easier by wearing down Sigilyph's common switch-ins. For example, Slowking is 2HKOed by Energy Ball after switching into Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Spiritomb can also make a fine partner for Sigilyph, as it nicely spinblocks and Pursuit traps Slowking, Uxie, and Cryogonal. Spiritomb can also take hits from Normal-types, such as Cinccino and Tauros, which are typically sent in to revenge kill Sigilyph.</p>

[SET]
name: Cosmic Power

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is what Sigilyph is most known for. A Cosmic Power set can annoy teams with its combination of decent speed, ability to burn physical attackers, and a move that boosts both of Sigilyph's defenses. Cosmic Power is the crux of the set, as it boosts Sigilyph's decent defenses to a point where it is very hard to kill, even with super effective hits. Roost provides reliable recovery so that Sigilyph can stay healthy and cushion weaker Electric- and Ice-type moves. Psycho Shift in conjunction with a Flame Orb will burn physical attackers, most importantly Dark-types. This is because Sigilyph can outlast certain Dark-types thanks to their physically offensive nature. Stored Power rounds up the set, as it is the best way to damage an opponent's team, and after a few boosts Sigilyph can be on its way to a potential sweep.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread invests in Sigilyph's bulk as much as possible while outspeeding max Speed Drapion in order to burn it before it threatens with a super effective Crunch. Because of its unique ability, Sigilyph will not take any damage from the burn inflicted by its Flame Orb and can cripple physical attackers with Psycho Shift. Air Slash could be used for damaging Dark-types, but burning them is more effective. Most Dark-types are physically oriented, so Sigilyph can outstall them with a couple of boosts under its belt, while Air Slash provides a weak attack with little use but to hit anything immune to Stored Power. Calm Mind can boost its Special Attack, but it will miss the Defense boost that Cosmic Power offers. Stored Power will typically wipe out a team after many boosts, so boosting Sigilyph's Special Attack is not needed. Whirlwind is another option it can run, as many of the Pokemon trying to phaze Sigilyph will be naturally slower than it, so it's an effective way of keeping its boosts under its belt. However, Whirlwind should only be used with entry hazards, since if a Pokemon tries to constantly phaze Sigilyph the latter will win out thanks to the damage that racks up.</p>

<p>Calm Mind Spiritomb is an absolute nightmare for this set, as it doesn't mind a burn thanks to Rest and can use Sigilyph as setup fodder. Slowking and Mandibuzz can also be a nuisance, as they have reliable recovery in Slack Off and Roost. Mandibuzz is immune to Stored Power as well, and Slowking can take multiple Stored Powers and outstall Sigilyph. Klinklang and Aggron can easily switch into Spiritomb thanks to their Steel typing. Aggron can heavily damage Spiritomb and Mandibuzz, and Klinklang can set up on Spiritomb with Shift Gear. Both Pokemon also bait in Fighting- and Ground-type moves, which can give Sigilyph a way to easily set up. Choice Band Spiritomb itself makes a good partner, as it can Pursuit trap Slowking and Uxie, damaging them and clearing a path for Sigilyph to sweep. It can also absorb Tricks that Pokemon such as Rotom use to cripple Sigilyph. Powerful Fire-types, such as Entei and Choice Specs Typhlosion, are immune to burns and can muster enough power to 2HKO Sigilyph even after a Cosmic Power boost. Therefore, Pokemon such as Rhydon, Slowking, and Qwilfish make fantastic partners, as all can switch into the powerful Fire-type attacks thrown at Sigilyph with ease. Speaking of Fire-types, they make good partners for Sigilyph, as they can switch into a defensive Spiritomb with ease and severely damage it so that Sigilyph has more free rein later in the match. As this Sigilyph set lures in Dark-types and can burn them, Pokemon such as Archeops, Cinccino, and Kabutops can take advantage of a lack of a strong Sucker Punch that could otherwise prematurely end their sweep.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind

move 4: Roost
item: Life Orb

nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Even with a decent Special Attack that can plow through much of the metagame, Calm Mind is a fine option to boost Sigilyph's Special Attack to even more deadly levels. Calm Mind is the basis of this set, as it allows Sigilyph to boost its Special Attack and Special Defense to become a larger threat. The choice between Psyshock and Psychic is again up to personal preference. Psyshock can be used to hit special walls hard on their weaker physical side, while Psychic is a superior option in dealing out massive damage to neutral targets. Heat Wave is an essential move for hitting Escavalier as well as Steelix, as both Pokemon can comfortably take a Psychic. Roost rounds up the set, as it allows Sigilyph to remain in good shape throughout the match as well as ease the pressure of setting up on weak special attacking threats.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are straightforward, as they try to get the most out of Sigilyph's offensive capabilities, and along with a Timid nature, Sigilyph can outspeed a large portion of the metagame. Life Orb is the preferred item, as it gives Sigilyph a boost in damage without recoil thanks to Magic Guard. A Flame Orb could be used in conjunction with Psycho Shift over Roost, making Sigilyph more self-sufficient in exchange for longevity, as well as giving it the ability to easily set up on Grass-types thanks to an immunity to sleep. This also allows Sigilyph to burn Dark-types and keep them from tearing through it. Whirlwind is another option that Sigilyph can run, as it allows it to win Calm Mind wars against Pokemon such as Uxie, as well as rack up entry hazard damage on common switch-ins such as Entei. As for other offensive options, Air Slash could be used as a secondary STAB move to destroy frailer Dark-type switch-ins such as Absol. Energy Ball is another coverage move that could work as it hits Slowking and Quagsire, but has little use otherwise. Both moves could go over Roost, but Roost provides the ability to set up with more ease and keeps Sigilyph healthy throughout the match.</p>

<p>Spiritomb, Slowking, and Uxie are all very irritating to this set, as they have the ability to tank hits from Sigilyph. Spiritomb also threatens Sigilyph with a super effective Dark STAB while Slowking and Uxie can potentially paralyze Sigilyph and make it essentially worthless. Durant and Escavalier make good partners, as they hit most of Sigilyph's counters for heavy damage while Sigilyph can remove their counters, such as Poliwrath, with a swift Psychic. Choice Band Spiritomb can also make a nice partner, as it can Pursuit trap the Psychic-types that come in to wall Sigilyph as well as absorb Tricks thrown at it. It cannot be emphasized enough that Sigilyph needs Dark-types out of the way for this specific set, as Absol can KO it comfortably with a STAB Sucker Punch while Drapion can effectively wall Sigilyph. Therefore, Poliwrath makes a good partner because of its nifty resistance to Dark-type moves, effectively walling them to no end, and it can phaze them out with Circle Throw, which can rack up entry hazard damage. Speaking of entry hazards, support from Pokemon such as Smeargle, Crustle, and Qwilfish give Sigilyph the ability to nab KOes more comfortably. Qwilfish also has the added benefit of taking strong Flare Blitzes and Bug-type attacks aimed at Sigilyph.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sigilyph has Thunder Wave, which can be useful for spreading paralysis around, but it is better left to spreading burns or hitting opposing Pokemon hard. Hypnosis is another move in its arsenal, but it has shaky accuracy and Sigilyph has better moves to work with. Sigilyph can set up dual screens, but Uxie can do the job much better with more overall bulk and Memento. A Substitute + Calm Mind set can work to some degree, but it is usually better left to Uxie as well, which has much better bulk. Sigilyph has some other interesting options, such as Ice Beam, but it provides little use or coverage. Tinted Lens could be used over Magic Guard for the extra power to break through resists, but generally the immunity to Life Orb and Stealth Rock damage is more useful. A Choice Scarf set can be used with Tinted Lens, but generally a Life Orb set is more useful on offensive terms.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Spiritomb is a big irritant to any of Sigilyph's sets as it has the substantial bulk to take any hit Sigilyph throws at it and can Pursuit trap Sigilyph. The Calm Mind variant can easily set up on Cosmic Power Sigilyph, as it doesn't mind a burn thanks to Rest and is immune to Stored Power. Bulky Psychic-types, such as Uxie and Slowking, can take any hit Sigilyph throws at them and cripple it with Thunder Wave. They can also outlast the Cosmic Power set thanks to their enormous special bulk, and Slowking has Slack Off to recover any damage Sigilyph may do to it. A specially defensive Drapion with Rest can usually beat any Sigilyph variant, as it will take any hit Sigilyph can throw at it and Rest off the burns that Sigilyph tries to cripple it with. Other Pokemon with good special bulk such as Clefable and Cryogonal can take hits from offensive variants but must be wary of Psyshock. Lanturn also makes a good counter to any offensive sets lacking Energy Ball thanks to its good special bulk and can hit Sigilyph with a super effective Thunderbolt. Dark-types, such as Absol or offensively oriented Drapion variants, are immune to Psychic and can usually nail Sigilyph very hard with their Dark STAB, but must be wary of Air Slash, which can effectively OHKO both of them after some entry hazard damage. Fire-types, such as Entei or Magmortar, can easily switch into the Cosmic Power set and hit Sigilyph hard with a strong Fire STAB. However, most Fire-types will not enjoy taking a hit from an offensively inclined Sigilyph. Fast Pokemon such as Cinccino and Aerodactyl can hit Sigilyph hard with Rock Blast or Stone Edge, respectively, while Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-C can outspeed and nail Sigilyph with a strong move. Powerful moves from Pokemon will usually deal out massive amounts of damage to Sigilyph, as its average bulk cannot usually keep it sturdy without any sort of boost.</p>
