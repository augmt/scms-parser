[Overview]

<p>In a tier ridden with many powerful Electric-types such as Rotom-C, Manectric, and Rotom, one might be left wondering how Magneton stands out. The answer lies in its ability, Magnet Pull. With this ability, Magneton is able to trap and KO many dangerous Steel-types such as Escavalier, Durant, and Aggron, depending on the set it runs. A unique Electric / Steel typing also gives Magneton some solid resistances to Dragon-, Electric-, Grass-, and Bug-type moves, among others. However, this is a double-edged sword as Magneton is left weak to the many powerful Fire- and Fighting-type moves in the tier along with a whopping 4x weakness to Ground. Due to its NFE status, Magneton can use Eviolite to bolster its defenses to capitalize on the previously mentioned resistances it has. Choice items are also a possibility thanks to its high Special Attack and access to Volt Switch. Magneton's Speed is okay but certainly nothing amazing, thus leaving it outsped by a myriad of offensive threats, including Durant should Magneton not run a Choice Scarf. While it has solid defenses and great resistances, Magneton is compromised by a low HP stat that can let many of the offensive Steel-types hit it really hard should they predict it switching in. If one can get around its faults, Magneton can be a great addition to many teams, especially those that center around Pokemon that have problems with Steel-types.<p/>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With STAB Volt Switch, the highest Special Attack stat of any Electric-type in RU, and enough Speed to outpace most defensive Pokemon, a Choice Specs set suits Magneton very well, as the extra power lets it get through Aggron and Steelix, two Steel-types Magneton usually struggles with. Thunderbolt is a strong and accurate STAB move that Magneton can use to punch holes in opposing teams. Volt Switch is great for any Choice item user, and Magneton is no different, as it allows Magneton to do serious damage and scout for potential checks and counters. Hidden Power Fire is a necessity to remove Steel-types that Magneton traps, such as Escavalier, Ferroseed, and Steelix. Flash Cannon rounds off the set by hitting Ground- and Dragon-types, such as Rhydon, Druddigon, and Golurk, that typically switch into Magneton's Electric STAB moves.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Timid is the primary nature to outspeed the likes of Adamant Kabutops and Adamant Gallade. Modest can be used as Magneton will still outspeed Omastar and Crawdaunt, while the boost in power secures the OHKO on Cryogonal with Flash Cannon and gives Magneton a 56.25% chance to OHKO Choice Band Emboar after Stealth Rock; it also ensures the OHKO on Choice Scarf variants of Emboar. Hidden Power Ground is a noteworthy alternative to hit Magneton and Lanturn much harder while still retaining coverage on Steelix.</p>

<p>Any Pokemon that appreciates the removal of bulkier Steel-types such as Escavalier, Steelix, and Ferroseed can be a good teammate. Perhaps the most dangerous is Druddigon, as very few things can stop its rampage after Steel-types are removed. Fraxure is a rarely seen Dragon-type, but it too can greatly benefit from the removal of Steel-types and possibly sweep the opposing team. Flying-types such as Swellow and Braviary are able to sweep more easily with Steel-types removed, while Psychic-types like Mesprit and Uxie appreciate not having to worry about being Pursuit trapped by Escavalier. Speaking of Psychic-types, Slowking is a solid defensive partner as it can switch into most of the threats that force Magneton out. Hidden Power Rock variants of Lilligant can also be quite dangerous once Magneton is able to remove opposing Steel-types. VoltTurn teams welcome Magneton's ability to remove Steel-types and maintain momentum. Rotom-C, Cinccino, and Braviary are all teammates that appreciate the removal of Steel-types and can maintain the momentum Magneton gains.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes a more defensive approach to trapping Steel-types. The boost provided by Eviolite allows Magneton better handle more offensive Steel-types, such as Escavalier and Aggron. Thunderbolt is still the primary STAB move as it is strong and reliable. Volt Switch allows Magneton to scout for checks and counters. Hidden Power Fire deals with Steel-types that Magneton traps, easily taking out the likes of Escavalier and Ferroseed. Flash Cannon is a secondary STAB move to handle the Ground- and Dragon-types that take Magneton's Electric STAB moves easily. Substitute and Charge Beam can replace Volt Switch and Flash Cannon respectively to set up on Steel-types that Magneton traps, but Ferroseed is the only one that won't break its Substitutes on average, and the only other attacks Magneton can safely set up a Substitute against is Iron Head from the likes of Escavalier and Aggron.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread lets Magneton avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Escavalier's Megahorn while also outspeeding maximum Speed Adamant Aggron. A Timid nature with a fully offensive spread can be used to outspeed Adamant Kabutops and Adamant Gallade. Discharge has a nifty 30% paralysis chance that can help slower powerhouses such as Druddigon and bulkier Gallade variants, among others.</p>

<p>This Magneton has problems with Steelix and Durant, so teammates that are able to take care of them are helpful. Slowking fears very little from Steelix and can use its STAB Water-type moves to take it down. Emboar and Moltres have a 4x Bug resistance and a Steel resistance to handle Durant's STAB moves, and both can roast the ant with their Fire-type STAB moves. This variant of Magneton handles bulkier Steel-types such as Escavalier better than its other sets, so teammates that can take advantage of such Steel-types not being around are good choices. Druddigon and Fraxure have a much easier time using their powerful Dragon-type STAB moves with Steel-types out of the way, while Psychic-types such as Mesprit and Slowking appreciate not having to worry about Escavalier. Hidden Power Rock variants of Sceptile and Lilligant can switch into Ground-type moves, and lure in Fire-types that Magneton struggles with, such as Moltres and Entei, and take them out with Hidden Power Rock. VoltTurn teams appreciate this Magneton's ability to switch into most Steel-types and remove them from battle, so Pokemon such as Cinccino, Rotom-C, and Mesprit can make for solid teammates.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While base 70 Speed is certainly nothing to be blown away by, it is more than enough to allow Magneton to effectively use a Choice Scarf. With the boost in Speed, Magneton is able to outspeed the likes of Durant, Sceptile, and Choice Scarf Emboar. Thunderbolt is Magneton's most reliable STAB option with great power and perfect accuracy. Volt Switch provides utility and allows Magneton to scout for checks and counters. Hidden Power Fire wipes out Durant and does significant damage to Sceptile, hence hitting two Pokemon that Magneton is normally incapable of outspeeding. Flash Cannon rounds off the set by hitting the likes of Rhydon and Druddigon harder than any other move Magneton has.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Timid is absolutely necessary to keep Magneton in front of Durant, Sceptile, and Choice Scarf versions of Emboar. Due to the lack of power when compared to other sets, it is generally not advised to use another Hidden Power type as Magneton needs Hidden Power Fire to OHKO Durant and deal as much damage to Sceptile as possible. This Magneton is perhaps the best failsafe option for teams that struggle against Durant, so Pokemon that appreciate not having to worry about the steel ant are good choices. Sturdy Psychic-types such as Uxie and Slowking can switch into many of the Pokemon that can force Magneton out while benefiting from the absence of Durant. This Magneton has significant issues with Steelix, so teammates that can handle it are appreciated. Slowking fears little from Steelix, while Moltres only fears Roar forcing it off of the field and can uses its powerful STAB moves to open up holes in an opposing team for Magneton to clean up later in the match. VoltTurn teams can benefit from Magneton's ability to outspeed and eliminate Durant and Sceptile from the match. Braviary, Mesprit, and Cinccino are all decent options for VoltTurn teams looking to take advantage of Choice Scarf Magneton's qualities.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Magneton's movepool is somewhat limited, but there are some options to look at. A specially defensive set with Rest and Sleep Talk can tank multiple hits, but the BW sleep mechanics make this a very inconsistent option. One can use Endure with a Custap Berry to ensure Magneton gets off a mimimum of at least two attacks, but this fails to capitalize on Magneton's Steel-trapping capabilities, although it allows Magneton to trap Durant without a Choice Scarf and revenge kill Rock Polish Aggron. Magneton has access to both Reflect and Light Screen, but it is largely outclassed by the faster and bulkier Uxie. Magic Coat is an option, but Magneton is able to threaten most entry hazard users offensively. Magnet Rise can allow Magneton to more safely eliminate Steelix. Metal Sound can force switches, but Magneton usually just wants to spend a free turn by attacking. Rain Dance can be used in conjunction with Thunder, but Magneton will struggle to take out Steel-types, especially Escavalier.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Magneton has no real counters, as its primary job is to eliminate certain Steel-types depending on the set it is running. There are, however, plenty of checks to the steel trapping magnet. Lanturn is a complete stop to Magneton outside of the rare Hidden Power Ground. Gallade and Hitmonlee are perfectly capable of outspeeding Magneton and crushing it with their powerful Fighting-type STAB moves. Hariyama can't outspeed Magneton, but it has the bulk to tank a hit and fire back with its strong STAB Close Combat. Emboar and Entei can tank a hit and retaliate with their strong Fire-type STAB moves. However, they will both fall to an Electric-type STAB move from the Choice Specs set should Stealth Rock be up. Clefable avoids the 2HKO from Choice Specs Thunderbolt, but it can be defeated should it get unlucky with Flash Cannon Special Defense drops. Steelix and Durant are two Steel-types that can actually stand up to Magneton depending on the set being used. Steelix only fears the Choice Specs set, while Durant only has to worry about the Choice Scarf set. Choice Scarf Durant can even use Baton Pass to escape from Magneton.</p>

<p>Ground-types such as Rhydon and Golurk can come in for free against Magneton's Electric-type STAB moves, but they must be wary of Flash Cannon. Druddigon is 2HKOed by Choice Specs Flash Cannon, but it can take any other attack and proceed to OHKO Magneton with Earthquake. Quagsire isn't very common, but it is only 3HKOed by Flash Cannon and can OHKO Magneton with a STAB Earthquake. Manectric has Lightningrod to benefit from Electric-type moves and it resists Flash Cannon as well while typically carrying Overheat or Flamethrower as a coverage move. Rotom resists Magneton's STABs, but it will fail to do much in return outside of Will-O-Wisp and the extremely rare Hidden Power Fire. Magneton's Choice sets are rather frail thanks to its awful base 50 HP. Powerful resisted attacks such as Druddigon's Outrage and Escavalier's Megahorn can actually 2HKO it.</p>
