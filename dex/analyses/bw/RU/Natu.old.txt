[Overview] 

<p>Natu was a forgotten Pokemon in DPP. It was one of the many NFE Pokemon that never saw any use, and its evolution, Xatu, didn't do any better. But in BW it got two huge gifts: Eviolite and Magic Bounce. Although it is still outclassed by Xatu, it doesn't have to worry about it because the big bird is in UU, giving Natu a chance to shine in RU. With an incredible ability, good bulk, and reliable healing in Roost, it helps the team in many ways. However, Natu does have its drawbacks. Horrendous offensive stats mean that Natu will often become set-up bait. Natu also has a Pursuit weakness, and while Reflect somewhat mitigates this, it still gives the little bird trouble. Finally, while Natu can be quite bulky on either side, it cannot be both due to its low HP stat, and must choose to invest in either physical or special bulk.</p>

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>This set is Natu's best bet for team support. With very good physical bulk and passable special bulk, Natu deters most of the premier hazard setters in RU from doing their jobs, such as Qwilfish, Roselia, Uxie, and Ferroseed. Also, with its 4x resistance to Fighting, and immunity to Ground, Natu is a very nice defensive pivot that helps your team take on all the Choice item-utilizing Fighting-types in RU, such as Medicham, Primeape, and Hitmonlee.</p>

<p>Roost is Natu's most important move, as it keeps it healthy throughout the match, and also lets it stall out slower threats using Electric, Ice, and Rock attacks. For example, Regirock, who commonly runs Stealth Rock, cannot OHKO Natu with its Rock attacks, so Natu can switch in, take the first hit, and then slowly recover back. Reflect lets Natu survive the onslaught from Pursuit trappers, such as Spiritomb and Absol. In the third slot, a status move is chosen so that Natu can do something besides reflect non-attacking moves. Thunder Wave neuters common switch-ins to Natu, like speedy Electric-types, and is better for annoying offensive teams, while Toxic hits every Pursuit user in RU and is better for pestering stall and balanced teams. Finally, U-turn is chosen for the last slot to help the team gain momentum, and escape Pursuit users if Reflect is not up.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are put into HP and Defense to maximize Natu's physical bulk, since most of the hazard setters are physical and Natu is best suited as a physical wall. 248 HP EVs ensure that Natu is able to survive four switch-ins with Stealth Rock in play (if the opponent manages to get it up).</p>

<p>Wish can be used with Protect (or Roost but then you rely only on U-turn to stop Pursuit trappers) over Roost and Reflect if you want to provide your team with some healing, and Toxic-stall better. Take note, though, that Natu is already set-up bait, so use Protect wisely. You can run a spread of 248 HP / 136 Def / 80 SpD / 44 Spe with a Bold nature if you want to survive two Bug Buzzes from Lead Accelgor, preventing him for setting up Spikes. You can also run a spread of 248 HP / 164 Def / 96 Spe with a Bold nature to outspeed max Speed, neutral natured base 50s. Natu will always have trouble with special Ice, Electric, Dark, and Ghost moves, so teammates that can take those attacks are helpful, especially Magneton, Steelix, and Drapion. Finally, Pokemon that enjoy Stealth Rock off the field are excellent teammates, such as Moltres, Entei, Typhlosion, Swellow, and Braviary.</p>

[Other Options] 

<p>A specially defensive set with a spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Careful nature could be used to better take on specially oriented hazard setters, such as Omastar and Accelgor, but those Pokemon often run offensive sets and are not as common as the other hazard setters. Also, as emphasized earlier, Natu's typing is more suited for taking physical hits. Night Shade, Haze, and Trick Room are all viable options for Natu. Night Shade can be used over U-turn to deal consistent damage and break Substitutes from Pokemon that could set up on you before. Haze can be used to stop stat boosters, and Trick Room can be used to support slower sweepers.</p>

[Checks and Counters] 

<p>Natu doesn't have many straight-up counters because its main job is bouncing back hazards and then switching out. Your best bet against Natu is to use faster Pokemon with Substitute or Pokemon that don't mind the status move that Natu carries. Strong Ice, Ghost, Dark, and Electric attacks from the special side will also put a huge dent in Natu. Manectric deserves a special mention, as it is immune to Thunder Wave, doesn't mind Toxic if it has a Choice item, and scouts the switch-in with Volt Switch. Finally, Pursuit users can give Natu problems if Reflect is not up.</p>
