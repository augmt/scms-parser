[Overview]

<p>Torterra is a strange case of a Pokemon. With solid defenses, good Attack, and high-powered STAB options, Torterra can fill quite a few roles in the RU metagame. With its solid Grass / Ground typing, Torterra can take up a defensive role by checking or outright countering many of the common Electric-types in the tier, with Rotom-C, Rotom, and Magneton being the most important ones. Torterra's access to Stealth Rock and Synthesis only make these defensive sets better as it lets Torterra support its team and stay around for a long time. Offensively, Torterra has great STAB options in Wood Hammer and Earthquake, thus allowing it to deal with dangerous threats such as Druddigon, Amoonguss, and Alomomola quite nicely. Torterra also has a great boosting move in Rock Polish to fix its otherwise poor Speed.</p>

<p>In spite of these great attributes, Torterra can find life difficult in RU. Despite its great STAB combination and solid coverage move in Stone Edge, Torterra has no hope of breaking through Tangrowth. Despite its usage quite possibly being lower than it ever has been in the history of RU, Tangrowth's amazing Regenerator ability can make it quite difficult for Torterra's teammates to successfully wear it down. Even after a Rock Polish boost, some Choice Scarf users such as Manectric and Durant can still outspeed Torterra and severely dent or outright KO it. Defensively, Fire-types are extremely common in the tier and Pokemon such as Moltres and Emboar are always ready to pound away at Torterra or one of its teammates. While Torterra can KO or severely dent these Fire-types, it will often have to predict these Fire-types switching in due to them outspeeding Torterra. Status is also a major pain for Torterra, in particular being burns, since this severely limits Torterra's damage output as a defensive Pokemon. However, despite these downfalls, Torterra remains a solid choice for many teams due to its ability to successfully run both defensive and offensive sets.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although Torterra has high physical defense, a specially defensive set is usually the best way to go with Torterra. With this set, Torterra is able to check most Electric-types and stop their attempts at building momentum with Volt Switch, as well as retaining the ability to check some dangerous physical attackers such as Aggron and Kabutops. Stealth Rock is a great move for any defensive Pokemon, but it is especially useful coming from Torterra as it beats the most common Rapid Spin user in the tier, Kabutops, without many issues. Wood Hammer is a reliable STAB move Torterra can use to deal with bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Slowking and Poliwrath. This also serves to nail Levitate Pokemon, such as Uxie and Rotom. Earthquake is another good STAB option to smash Aggron while also keeping any Fire-type not named Moltres at bay. Synthesis is a great move as it provides reliable recovery so Torterra can continue to come in on powerful offensive threats and set up Stealth Rock again should it be removed by a spinner.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes special bulk while making sure Torterra can switch into Choice Band Aggron's Head Smash without suffering a 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage. Although the given moveset and EV spread is the best to use, there are a couple of things to consider. Leech Seed is an alternative method of healing for Torterra. While it makes it much harder for Torterra to stay healthy, the extra chip damage it provides can be useful for when a sweeper would otherwise fall just short of being able to push past its check. Toxic is useful if only to screw over Tangrowth. It's also nice to chip away at the likes of Moltres and Uxie. Roar can be a neat option if you're using Torterra with Spikes support. Both Toxic and Roar should be seriously considered should your team already have a Stealth Rock user. As a final note, one can use a physically defensive spread with 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with an Impish nature to take on Pokemon such as Aggron, Rhydon, and Golurk with much greater ease. However, this will make it very difficult for Torterra to handle the likes of Rotom-C and the given spread already allows Torterra to sufficiently handle Aggron in most situations.</p>

<p>Bulky Water-type Pokemon are generally good options to use with Torterra as they can take on many of the Fire-type Pokemon in the tier. Alomomola and Qwilfish are both good options. Alomomola can take on many of the tier's physical attackers while Qwilfish is a more reliable check to Escavalier and Durant. If you're more concerned about Moltres being a pain, Slowking is a better option as it can still take on resisted physical attacks while handling Moltres more reliably than Alomomola or Qwilfish ever could. As Torterra isn't just a sitting duck, it isn't a bad idea to run it on balanced teams either. Moltres has great defensive synergy with Torterra as it can take on most Electric- and Rock-types that can force Moltres out. Meanwhile, Moltres can use its powerful attacks to quickly break down the opposing team or even use a Choice Scarf set to pick and choose its spots while having a good fall-back option in Torterra. Offensive Water-types such as Omastar, Kabutops, and Samurott can find their lives much easier with Torterra being a great way to answer most Electric-types in the tier.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Torterra's trademark offensive set, and for good reason. The premise of this set is simple: grab a Rock Polish boost on a Pokemon that cannot hit Torterra for significant damage such as Aggron to make Torterra fast enough to outspeed the entire unboosted RU metagame, bar Accelgor, and watch as Torterra shreds through offensive and defensive teams alike with its blistering Speed and fantastic coverage. Earthquake will be Torterra's main attack, as it is still incredibly strong and lacks the recoil Wood Hammer has; however, Wood Hammer's extra power and Grass-type coverage allows it to crush certain Pokemon that Earthquake would be unable to dent, such as Uxie and Mesprit. Wood Hammer also crushes bulky Water-type Pokemon, most importantly Alomomola, thus making Torterra one of the very few physical sweepers that can get past Alomomola with little to no support. Stone Edge rounds off Torterra's coverage by allowing it to nail those pesky Flying-type Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake and resist Wood Hammer. Between these three attacks, Torterra has virtually flawless coverage, and in tandem with its blistering Speed after a Rock Polish, Torterra would appear to have the ability to tear through opposing teams in an instant.</p>

<p>However, things aren't quite so simple for Torterra. As much as it would enjoy the ability to simply Rock Polish up and sweep at any moment, this simply isn't feasible early- or mid-game just because the things that do beat Torterra will likely still be alive and kicking, ready to stop Torterra's sweep in an instant should it attempt it. Furthermore, even though Torterra is a very strong Pokemon offensively, RU is a metagame with numerous bulky Pokemon, and there are a large number of Pokemon that are capable of surviving an Earthquake or Wood Hammer from Torterra at full health. Fortunately, Torterra is not really just a one-trick pony; thanks to its bulk and typing, it can still act as a solid bulky attacker early- and mid-game. By using Torterra in this way, it can actually wear down many of its checks by itself early-game, giving it the opportunity to sweep late-game. For example, while Escavalier can take a hit from Torterra and KO it in return with Megahorn, it is actually 2HKOed by Earthquake; therefore, if you can get Torterra in earlier in the match and hit it with Earthquake as it comes in on a predicted Wood Hammer, you could have easily just opened the door for Torterra to sweep later in the match, should Escavalier have been the opponent's main answer to it. Keep in mind though that most of the time the opponent will carry more than one answer to Torterra simply due to the nature of its coverage and typing. Thus, during Team Preview, it is important to see what answers to Torterra the opponent has, and decide whether or not it is more advantageous to play Torterra as just a bulky attacker or your team's main sweeper.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Adamant nature is generally preferred for this set, as it gives Torterra a much-needed boost in power. With an Adamant nature, Leftovers are the recommended item, as they give Torterra a way to offset the recoil from Wood Hammer and give Torterra more longevity in general. However, Jolly is certainly a respectable option; for example, with a Jolly nature, Torterra is able to outspeed the likes of Accelgor after a Rock Polish, though this comes at the cost of a large amount of power. To circumvent this, you can opt to use a Life Orb in order to make up for the lost power, but unfortunately this will cause Torterra to faint very quickly, especially when coupled with the recoil from Wood Hammer. Still, the increased Speed and power from using a Jolly nature in tandem with Life Orb does make Torterra a much better sweeper, though at the cost of much of its early- to mid-game utility. Overgrow is the ability of choice on this set, as it allows Torterra, in a desperate situation, to unleash one last, devastating Wood Hammer against a slower opponent.</p>

<p>When it comes to sweeping, Torterra absolutely needs Tangrowth out of the picture. Moltres, Emboar, and Sigilyph are all solid options to remove it from play. Slowking is a solid pivot option as it can use Thunder Wave to slow down faster Choice Scarf users while also luring out Electric-type moves for Torterra to gain free access to the battlefield to set up. Although Typhlosion isn't exactly the best Choice Scarf user around, it can outspeed and OHKO Torterra even after it uses Rock Polish, so having a Slowking or Druddigon would be a good idea to ensure it can't inflict much damage on your team when it forces out Torterra. As Tangrowth is the best defensive counter to Rock Polish Torterra, Toxic Spikes aren't a bad idea in order to wear it down faster. Qwilfish is ideal for this role as it can handle Escavalier and Durant without a lot of problems.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Torterra can go fully defensive or fully offensive quite effectively, it can also perform as a reliable bulky attacker capable of taking strong attacks and returning the favor with its own strong moves. Stealth Rock is a great move on Torterra as it can keep the Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon that Torterra generally has issues with at bay. Wood Hammer is the primary choice for a STAB move as it deals with bulky Water-type Pokemon, and most importantly ensures Kabutops will have to sacrifice itself to spin away Stealth Rock. However, Earthquake is another solid STAB option. While it is incapable of dealing with Water-types as effectively, it does let Torterra better handle Aggron and it gets better neutral coverage with Torterra's coverage move on this set. Stone Edge gives Torterra solid coverage and ensures that Flying-types, such as Moltres, will always have something to think about before switching in. Synthesis rounds off the set as it allows Torterra to stay healthy and keep taking hits from serious threats such as Aggron and Rotom-C.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes Torterra's damage output and ensures it can outspeed minimum Speed Lanturn. The rest is put into HP for overall bulk. As many bulkier Pokemon such as Golurk also aim for the same Speed tier, it might be worth your while to move a few HP EVs over to Speed in order to ensure Torterra can outspeed and prevent them from doing anything before Torterra strikes. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge if the accuracy bugs you, but the loss in power is rarely worth it. Overgrow is the primary ability choice as it gives Wood Hammer a serious power boost for when you just need Torterra to blast the opposing team one final time. Shell Armor is a bit more niche, but an untimely critical hit can quickly spell the end for Torterra, and possibly cost you the game should Torterra be the last thing keeping something like Rotom-C or Aerodactyl from freely using their STAB moves to finish a match.</p>

<p>This Torterra is one of the most reliable offensive responses to Aggron in the entire tier, so Pokemon that loathe the presence of Aggron, such as Uxie, Spiritomb, and Swellow, are good options to use with Torterra. Swellow is especially notable due to Torterra's ability to destroy just about any Rock- or Steel-type in the tier, especially if it runs Earthquake. Bulky Water-type Pokemon are nice choices as they can come in on most Fire- and Ice-type moves aimed at Torterra while it is immune to the Electric-type moves they don't like. Slowking, Alomomola, and Poliwrath are all solid choices in this regard. Torterra really has nothing to stop Tangrowth from switching in at will, so teammates that can handle it are much appreciated. Moltres, Emboar, and Escavalier are all capable of handling Tangrowth with relative ease. Toxic Spikes support is another option and Qwilfish is a great option for this considering it can reliably take on Escavalier and Durant for Torterra.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Wood Hammer
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Bullet Seed / Sleep Talk
item: Choice Band
ability: Overgrow
nature: Adamant
evs: 44 HP / 252 Atk / 212 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Torterra is capable of using its offensive prowess to sweep with Rock Polish or utilize it alongside its good bulk, a Choice Band turns Torterra into a very potent wallbreaker. Torterra is capable of 2HKOing the vast majority of the RU tier, but as its STABs have many resistances and immunities, one must play with great prediction to get the absolute most out of this set. Wood Hammer is the primary STAB move as it lacks any immunities and is able to smash many of the bulky Water- and Ground-types in the tier, such as Slowking, Alomomola, and Golurk. Earthquake beats up the Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon expecting to come in on a resisted Wood Hammer, but due to the presence of Levitate users and Flying-type Pokemon, this can be an even riskier move to lock into. Stone Edge is there to crush the Flying-type Pokemon that can otherwise switch-in on Torterra's STAB moves and respond accordingly. With the offensive coverage it really needs in three moves, Torterra can use more of a niche utility move in the last slot. Bullet Seed might seem strange, but it does have the ability to hit through Substitutes, Focus Sashes, and Sturdy. Sleep Talk is never a terrible option in a metagame that is infested with sleep inducers, but one must keep in mind that Torterra can't deal with most of them as effectively as other Sleep Talk users such as Emboar, Escavalier, and Druddigon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes damage output while making sure Torterra will outspeed max Speed Adamant Aggron. As Torterra will rarely ever use the move it chooses in the last slot, there are some other options to look into. Toxic can cripple Tangrowth to help Torterra's teammates wear it down faster. Seed Bomb is a bit stronger than Bullet Seed on average, but it lacks the ability to hit through Substitutes. Superpower is there if you really need to deal with Ferroseed in short order, but Earthquake will usually be enough to handle it. A bulkier spread of 164 HP / 252 Atk / 92 Spe can be used if you want more bulk with Torterra, but being outsped by Aggron limits Torterra's ability to reliably beat it since this set lacks any kind of recovery.</p>

<p>Like any other Torterra set, you want something to deal with Tangrowth as it simply doesn't care about anything Torterra runs outside of the rare Toxic. Powerful Fire- and Bug-type Pokemon such as Moltres, Emboar, and Escavalier can quickly break down Tangrowth. Alternatively, Spikes support from Qwilfish or Omastar can also be used to wear down Tangrowth and limit the effect Regenerator has. Paralysis support from the likes of Uxie and Slowking can be useful to allow Torterra to have more of an impact against offensive teams. Having sturdy fall-back options for when you overpredict or simply don't predict the correct switch-in is a good idea due to the nature of Torterra's STABs. Aerodactyl has blazing fast Speed and can use its typing to check most Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon. Once Torterra has dented the opposing team enough, Life Orb Aerodactyl can easily clean up with its decent power and amazing Speed. Uxie, Mesprit, and Rotom-C are common Levitate Pokemon that can come in for free on Earthquake. Spiritomb fares well against the former two while Rotom-C can find it difficult to handle the likes of Druddigon, Roselia, and even your own Rotom-C. If you can't afford paralysis support, but still wish to fix the Speed issues, then you can use Trick Room. Slowking happens to be a reliable Trick Room setter and have solid synergy with Torterra. However, keep in mind that this will let Escavalier outspeed Torterra. Make sure to use a Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs and to move all Speed EVs to HP when going this route.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Torterra doesn't have a lot of noteworthy options remaining in its movepool that haven't already been discussed. Of these, Swords Dance is probably the most appealing. Although this doubles Torterra's already beefy Attack stat, it does nothing to fix its Speed issues, and this can prove very problematic in a tier full of faster Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon. Torterra gets dual screens, but you're better off using Uxie for this as it is much faster, has much better bulk, and can use either U-turn or Memento to get its teammates in safely. Crunch is the only noteworthy attacking option that hasn't been discussed as it can smack Exeggutor.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>If you haven't noticed a theme yet, Tangrowth is the best answer to Torterra hands down. It can switch into Torterra with relative impunity, threaten to put one of Torterra's teammates to sleep, and then just switch back out to regain any health it lost thanks to Regenerator. Outside of Tangrowth, Flying-types such as Moltres can come in on any STAB move, but a swift Stone Edge can ruin their day. Fire-types such as Typhlosion and Emboar also suffer a similar fate when it comes to trying to switch in, but their STAB Fire-type moves can make quick work of Torterra if they can get in safely. Weezing isn't very common, but it doesn't mind anything Torterra has to offer and it can simply use Will-O-Wisp to cripple any Torterra set. Cryogonal is a bit shaky as Wood Hammer and Stone Edge decimate it, but it is immune to Earthquake and can threaten an OHKO with Ice Beam. Cryogonal can also spin away the Stealth Rock that Torterra sets. Most Fire-types can take out Torterra, but they have a much harder time if Torterra gets a Rock Polish boost under its belt before they're able to deal with it. Some Choice Scarf users, such as Durant, Manectric, and Typhlosion, can outspeed Torterra even after a Rock Polish boost. In general, you're better off using Speed to beat Torterra, as many of RU's top physical walls, such as Rhydon, Alomomola, and Steelix, are hit really hard by Torterra's STAB moves, thus letting it muscle past them most of the time.</p>
