[Overview]

<p>What makes Floatzel so special is its amazing Speed stat, which allows it to set up, attack, or cripple an opponent before they have a chance to do anything. Swift Swim is a great, but unnecessary, ability, though Floatzel becomes the fastest Pokemon in the tier when it's raining. In addition to its decent offensive movepool, Floazel has access to some interesting support options: Taunt cripples an opponent that attempts to set up, Baton Pass can be used alongside Agility and Bulk Up, and Switcheroo can give a useless Choice item to a wall. Floatzel's type coverage is also pretty good with Water-, Dark-, Ice-, and Fighting-type moves, and it can take advantage of a decent Special Attack stat with Hidden Power and Ice Beam. Unfortunately, Floatzel is pretty frail without a Bulk Up boost, and its attacking stats aren't too impressive compared to other Pokemon in the tier, either. Nonetheless, Floatzel is a potent threat in RU, and it shouldn't be taken lightly.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Rain Dance
move 1: Waterfall 
move 2: Ice Beam

nature: Naive
evs: 196 Atk / 252 SpA / 60 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is designed to wipe out Floatzel's number one nemesis: Tangrowth. With Ice Beam, Floatzel can take on Dragon-, Grass-, and Flying-types, and it will always OHKO enemy Tangrowth. This set is outclassed by Omastar and Gorebyss as a whole, but Floatzel has higher Speed and only has two weaknesses, while Omastar has four. Waterfall provides reliable physical STAB, and it deals a lot of damage when the weather is rainy. Brick Break hits Steel-types, and Crunch can be used to hit Ghost-types super effectively--note that Waterfall will deal more damage to Ghost-types in the rain. Rain Dance speaks for itself, and Hidden Power Grass can OHKO Omastar and Quagsire. While this set lacks the raw power of other sweepers in the tier, Floatzel's surprise value and unpredictability make it effective.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs on this set are fairly specialized: the Speed EVs enable Floatzel to outrun Timid Rotom outside of rain, maximum Special Attack EVs are used to raise Floatzel's lower attacking stat, and the remaining EVs are placed in Attack, giving Waterfall and Brick Break more power. Surf can be used in the last slot to deal more damage to Sandslash, Steelix, and Pokemon with lower Special Defense, and it's surprisingly powerful in the rain. Taunt is another option to shut down walls such as Clefable, but it isn't great on an offensive set.</p>

<p>Support from entry hazards is helpful, as they make it easier to weaken and KO threatening Pokemon--not to mention they work great with Floatzel's ability to force switches. Ferroseed can set up Spikes and Stealth Rock, and it can also switch into Grass- and Electric-type moves aimed at Floatzel. Sandslash is another good choice, as it sports a useful Electric-type immunity and can support its teammates with Rapid Spin.</p>

<p>If you choose Hidden Power Grass in the last slot, it's recommended that you partner Floatzel with a teammate that can set up Rain Dance. Defensive Pokemon, such as Uxie, are great choices as they are difficult to KO, and therefore can set up rain multiple times. Furthermore, if you decide to use Rain Dance in the last slot, Water-types completely wall this set. Using a Grass- or Electric-type, such as Lilligant, Sceptile, or Galvantula, is recommended to power your way through opposing Water-types; in addition, they can switch into one or more of Floatzel's weaknesses. Alternatively, Clefable can take on most Grass- and Water-types, as the majority of them are special attackers.</p>

<p>Due to Floatzel's frailty, most priority moves will severely weaken it. A wall such as Uxie can switch into most common priority moves, and it doesn't have to fear Sucker Punch either, as it can cripple physical attackers with Thunder Wave or Yawn. Aggron is another decent choice, as it can switch into Extreme Speed, and takes a pittance from Sucker Punch. Ground-types also make good teammates, especially since Choice Scarf Rotom and Timid Galvantula are pretty common.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Waterfall 
move 2: Return / Ice Beam
move 3: Crunch
move 4: Switcheroo 
item: Choice Band
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to its high Speed and usable Attack stats, Floatzel is an ideal candidate for a Choice Band set. The idea is to switch into a weak or resisted move, then proceed with Switcheroo or an attacking move to cripple or deal huge damage to the opponent, respectively. Waterfall is used for reliable STAB, and it receives a helpful power boost in the rain. Return provides excellent neutral coverage alongside Waterfall, but Ice Beam will OHKO Tangrowth, Floatzel's biggest enemy. Crunch is mainly a filler, though it allows Floatzel to hit Water-types should it use Ice Beam in the second slot, and it deals more damage to the likes of Slowking and Uxie outside of rain. Switcheroo is the main reason to use Floatzel over Feraligatr, as it allows Floatzel to cripple a wall, such as Slowking, Uxie, or Crustle.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Floatzel can utilize both of its abilities on this set, as both of them have their own merits. Swift Swim can be used alongside a Rain Dance partner, making Floatzel one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, while Water Veil blocks any attempt to burn Floatzel. Water Veil works excellently alongside Switcheroo as it completely shuts down Spiritomb, one of Floatzel's biggest counters. It also beats common Scald users, such as Slowking.</p>

<p>Pokemon that can set up entry hazards are helpful, as they weaken the opponent into Floatzel's KO range. Ferroseed is an excellent choice, as it can switch into Floatzel's weaknesses, and has access to Spikes, Stealth Rock, Leech Seed, and Thunder Wave. Uxie is another good choice, as it can switch in easily thanks to its great defenses, and proceed with a combination of Stealth Rock, U-turn, and Thunder Wave. Scolipede can set up Toxic Spikes, which are helpful to cripple physical walls; however, be careful when using Toxic Spikes, as a Guts user may take advantage of them. As always, carry a spinblocker to keep these hazards on the field.</p>

<p>A way to break through physical walls is helpful. Absol is a good example; Superpower hits Aggron 4x super effectively, Night Slash and Sucker Punch will dent Slowking and Uxie, and the occasional Psycho Cut will decimate Throh.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Bulk Up / Agility
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Baton Pass
move 4: Waterfall 
item: Leftovers
ability: Water Veil
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 HP / 40 Def / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its massive Speed and access to Taunt, Floatzel makes an excellent Baton Pass user. What sets it apart from Scyther, however, is its higher Speed, and absence of a nasty weakness to Ice-type moves and Stealth Rock. Bulk Up and Agility are used to aid Floatzel's teammates in sweeping--Bulk Up raises its Attack and Defense, which is good for physical sweepers, while Agility is helpful for slow, powerful sweepers, such as Bouffalant and Entei. Taunt will stop any phazer that attempts to erase Floatzel's stat boosts, and it stops any opponent that attempts to set up alongside Floatzel. Waterfall is mainly a filler, but it gives Floatzel something to do should it be the last Pokemon on your team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>216 Speed EVs ensure Floatzel is fast enough to outrun base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Archeops. Maximum HP investment provides extra bulk, while the remaining EVs are placed in Defense. If you desire more power, the additional EVs can be placed in Attack, giving Waterfall more of a kick. Water Veil is the preferred ability, as a burned Floatzel will be drained of its health, and it won't survive long enough to pass its boosts. Swift Swim is usable, however, as it allows Floatzel to function on a Rain Dance team. Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall if you prefer the extra power, but its lower accuracy may be an issue.</p>

<p>Pokemon that can receive Floatzel's stat boosts are obvious choices for teammates. Aggron appreciates an Attack boost from Bulk Up, Sawsbuck and Bouffalant appreciate a Speed boost, and Gallade can take advantage of a Defense boost, giving it more opportunities to switch in. Tangrowth is a more obscure option, but it appreciates both Speed and Attack boosts, and it can switch into Floatzel's weaknesses. Finally, Floatzel can be used as part of a dedicated Baton Pass team--Mawile, Gorebyss, and Drifblim are all suitable teammates if you decide to go down that route.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Besides the moves already listed, Floatzel can take advantage of a few more moves. Pursuit can catch a fleeing Ghost- or Psychic-type on the switch, though due to the lack of STAB and its measly 40 Base Power, it won't be dealing a lot of damage. Scald is an alternative STAB option with a nifty 30% burn rate, though it's outclassed by Surf for the most part, and it's better left to defensive Pokemon, such as Lanturn. Focus Blast has a higher Base Power than Brick Break, and it hits physical walls harder. Me First is very gimmicky, though it can catch a Ghost- or Dragon-type off-guard, potentially KOing them with their own move. Quick Attack is another priority move, but Aqua Jet is superior in every way. Roar can be used to rack up entry hazard damage, though Floatzel is usually too frail to use it. Finally, Substitute can be used to block status moves, it can be passed to a teammate, and it can also help ease prediction.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Most Water- and Grass-types can take on Floatzel, but they need to watch out for Hidden Power Grass and Ice Beam, respectively. Ferroseed can set up entry hazards and cripple Floatzel with Thunder Wave, provided the latter doesn't carry Taunt. Tangrowth can defeat any set which lacks Ice Beam, Rotom-C can switch into Water-type moves and KO Floatzel with Volt Switch, and Ludicolo is only hit neutrally by Ice-, Water-, and Grass-type moves, KOing Floatzel back with its STAB moves. Omastar doesn't take a lot of damage from anything bar Hidden Power Grass, and it has enough power to KO Floatzel with its own Hidden Power Grass. Poliwrath can switch into Water-, Ice-, and Dark-type moves with ease, and proceed with Substitute and Focus Punch. Dusknoir, Slowking, and Uxie are bulky enough to survive a hit or two, but they must watch out for Taunt, and repeated hits from Crunch will wear them down as well. If all else fails, try and KO Floatzel with priority moves, as its defenses are pretty low.</p>
