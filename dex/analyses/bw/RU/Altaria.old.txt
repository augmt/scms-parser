[Overview]

<p>Dragon is a fantastic typing in RU, and Altaria offers a unique Flying typing to go along with it. This nice typing offers a Fighting resistance and, more importantly, a Ground and Spikes / Toxic Spikes immunity. The Stealth Rock weakness sucks, but the advantages that the Flying typing presents Altaria can make up for it at times. While Druddigon outclasses Altaria in most regards due to its amazing power and bulk, Altaria offers a lot of diversity. Its special attacking set is its main niche, sporting the strongest Draco Meteor in the tier alongside a wide movepool and a great Speed stat compared to the other Dragons in the tier. Natural Cure + Heal Bell is another fantastic niche Altaria holds in RU, and with its great defenses, it can utilize defensive sets very well. In the end, Altaria can certainly hold its own in RU, but you should always consider Druddigon before choosing Altaria, as its pure Dragon typing and super high Attack stat are better suited for most teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Base 70 Special Attack seems rather pathetic in a tier that boasts special attackers with offensive stats reaching 125. However, Altaria's unique STAB and access to Draco Meteor mean that it can still cleave through teams with a special attacking set. Dragon is only resisted by Steel-types, which are few and far between in RU, and any Steel-type that dares to confront Altaria will be quickly melted with a Fire Blast. Draco Meteor is Altaria's main weapon; with it, Altaria can 2HKO most of the metagame. Only the bulkiest special walls will be able to repeatedly switch into Altaria's Choice Specs or Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor. Unfortunately, the cost of such power is an unsavory Special Attack drop which can sometimes render Altaria as setup bait. Choice Specs sets can instead use Dragon Pulse as a more reliable STAB attack while Life Orb sets can Power Swap away the Special Attack drop onto unsuspecting opponents. Power Swap also gives Altaria a unique way to combat special boosters such as Calm Mind Mesprit or Uxie. After letting them boost up a few times, Altaria can turn your opponent's boosts against them, smacking them with a boosted Draco Meteor. In the last slot, Altaria can take advantage of its excellent bulk with a recovery move; Rest is used on Choice Specs sets to cure Altaria fully. Upon switching out, Natural Cure will heal Altaria of its sleep condition. Roost is a more useful option on the Life Orb set as it doesn't force Altaria to switch.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs maximize Altaria's rather low Special Attack stat while ensuring it can still outspeed Timid Omastar. The remaining EVs are placed in HP to take advantage of Altaria's excellent bulk. If you want Altaria to be faster, then maximizing Speed is also an option, but Altaria already outspeeds most walls and appreciates the bulk to help take on offensive Pokemon. As Altaria can do little to Pokemon such as Probopass and Aggron, Altaria can use Hidden Power Ground instead of Dragon Pulse. Hidden Power Ground also hits other Steel-types so it is a viable, although much weaker, alternative to Fire Blast. Despite Altaria's great coverage and power, it is still easily walled by special walls such as Clefable and Slowking. Therefore, a powerful wallbreaker, such as Aggron or Escavalier, can be used as an offensive partner. Both also resist Ice- and Dragon-type attacks directed at Altaria while Aggron also sponges Rock-type attacks. Druddigon is another great partner for Altaria as it can clean up weakened teams after Altaria has lured and destroyed Steel-types such as Steelix and Aggron. Rapid Spin support is also very useful as the Special Attack drop that comes with Draco Meteor will force Altaria to switch out often. Pokemon such as Kabutops and Cryogonal can use Rapid Spin while also covering Altaria's large Ice weakness.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Altaria's rare Dragon / Flying typing also gives it a defensive niche. It is one of the few Pokemon that can take on RU powerhouses such as Magmortar and Typhlosion, and its typing lets it take on common Water- and Fire-type attacks. Roost is Altaria's reliable recovery move and lets it continuously wall threats throughout the game, healing off residual damage from Stealth Rock and resisted attacks. Dragon Pulse is Altaria's only attack and prevents it from being useless when Taunted. Heal Bell is a rather rare move that Altaria can use to support its teammates, curing any status on your team. Lastly, Roar phazes away dangerous setup sweepers hoping to capitalize on Altaria's weak offensive prowess. It also stacks up more entry hazard damage on your opponents. However, Toxic is Altaria's best way of doing damage, and lets it Roost-stall the opposition.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is the standard for any specially defensive wall. Maximum investment in Special Defense and HP ensures that Altaria can take on many of the special attacking powerhouses in the RU tier. A physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD lets Altaria take on various physical attackers; however, Altaria's Defense stat isn't as impressive as it Special Defense stat. Leftovers provides consistent recovery and helps Altaria avoid certain 2HKOs. Natural Cure is an amazing ability for a wall as it practically eliminates the most common way to take down a wall, Toxic. Although Altaria can already run Heal Bell, it is extremely useful to just be able to switch out and cure any status on Altaria. Although Altaria gets Roar to take care of stat boosters, Altaria can also use Perish Song as a phazing move. It will force your opponent out after a few turns and is excellent when dealing with a last Pokemon on your opponent's team. Instead of Dragon Pulse, Altaria can use Dragon Claw as its sole attack; while it has less Base Power than Dragon Pulse, it is useful for taking down more specially defensive threats that Altaria walls such as Slowking.</p>

<p>As Altaria is a team supporter itself, it stands to reason that it doesn't need much help from its teammates. However, there are a few things one can do to help Altaria do its job. Rapid Spin support is great for Altaria as it hates having to lose 25% of its health from switching into Stealth Rock. Pokemon such as Kabutops and Cryogonal are great candidates, as both also resist the Ice-type attacks directed at Altaria. Physically defensive Steel-types, such as Steelix, form a powerful defensive core with Altaria, as they can take Dragon-type attacks and cover Altaria's weaker Defense. In return, Altaria sponges Fire- and Water-type attacks directed at Steelix and Aggron.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Like many of its fellow Dragon-types, Altaria can pull off an offensive Dragon Dance set. Although its attacks aren't nearly as powerful as that of the Dragon-types in upper tiers, the relative lack of Steel-types in RU means that Altaria will have little trouble slicing through your opponent's team after a few boosts. Dragon Dance increases both Altaria's Attack and Speed stats to respectable levels; after a couple of boosts, almost nothing in RU will be able to stomach Altaria's assaults. Outrage is Altaria's STAB move of choice, and lets it pummel its foe with an anger-fueled, 100% accurate, 120 Base Power STAB attack. Unfortunately, it locks Altaria in and forces it to become confused after a few turns, so it should be used with caution. Earthquake provides amazing coverage alongside Outrage, hitting Steel-types such as Steelix and Magneton hard. Lastly, Roost is used to take advantage of Altaria's great natural bulk while setting up. It also removes Stealth Rock and Life Orb damage that Altaria will no doubt accumulate throughout the game.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Life Orb, Adamant nature, and fully offensive EV spread makes the most of Altaria's offenses. However, Leftovers can be used instead as Altaria has excellent bulk which helps it set up. Like other sweepers, Altaria is fairly easy to play with, as it can easily set up Dragon Dances on most resisted moves, potentially obtaining two or more boosts. From then on, Altaria can outspeed almost every Pokemon in the tier and fire off its Dragon-type STAB attacks. As Outrage has the drawback of locking Altaria in and causing confusion, Dragon Claw is a more reliable, albeit weaker, option for Altaria. Natural Cure, although less useful for Altaria than it is on support variants, still helps Altaria significantly, ensuring that a stray Thunder Wave or burn from Scald doesn't cripple Altaria for the rest of the match. However, in order to activate Natural Cure, Altaria must switch out, which removes any boosts it might have obtained. Although Altaria can hit everything in the tier for at least neutral damage, it still struggles against defensive behemoths such as Tangrowth and Steelix. Therefore, Pokemon such as Magneton are excellent partners for Altaria, as Magneton traps and disposes of almost every Steel-type in the tier, paving the way for an Altaria sweep. As Altaria detests Stealth Rock, a Rapid Spin user such as Kabutops or Cryogonal makes a good teammate.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Altaria's Flying typing, great natural bulk, and the ability to straight up not care about status gives it a niche over Dragonair as a defensive Dragon Dance user. This set is super easy to set up when used on a team with Magneton support, as it ensures that Steel-types are out of the picture before sweeping the other team. This set also easily fits on stall-based teams as a win condition to sweep late-game, since it offers a ton of resistances, an immunity to Toxic Spikes, and great coverage in just Dragon Claw. Dragon Claw is used over Outrage so that Altaria can come in and tank, as it limits Altaria's susceptibility to being revenge killed since it can immediately switch out if need be. Plus, it takes a few boosts for Altaria to get very threatening anyway, so it can afford the drop in power. Safeguard or Heal Bell lets Altaria set up on Pokemon like Slowking, Qwilfish, and Amoonguss without worrying about status. Safeguard is preferred because it totally blocks paralysis and sleep, though Hell Bell helps the whole team and allows Altaria to switch into status (other than sleep) and heal it off. It should be noted that Safeguard does not prevent the confusion from Outrage as well should you choose to go with that.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>64 Speed EVs lets Altaria outpace positive-natured base 95s after a boost, and the specially defensive spread lowers the chance that Altaria is 2HKOed by Ice Beam from Slowking and Lanturn if it Roosts and then sets up. As stated before, Outrage can go over Dragon Claw, but the point of this set is to be able to sweep without anything getting in its way, so the confusion side effect is not wanted; an offensive Dragon Dance set makes better use of Outrage anyway. Magneton support is amazing for this set since it uses mono-Dragon coverage, and having Steel-types out of the way makes the sweep easier. Magneton can also leave a nice dent in Tangrowth, Alomomola, and other bulky Pokemon that can tank a couple Dragon Claws.</p>

<p>Altaria will never get so obscenely strong that it'll OHKO the opponent with Dragon Claw, even at +6. However, that isn't a problem for Altaria as it can simply out-tank a huge portion of the tier. While it won't OHKO many opponents, it easily 2HKOes most of the tier after a couple of boosts, and is rarely even 4HKOed in return by most defensive Pokemon. When beginning to set up, Safeguard should be used first to block status, followed by Dragon Dance. Use Roost when necessary, and begin the onslaught once Altaria outspeeds the entirety of the opponent's team. Be wary of bringing out Altaria too early though, as it can be revenge killed by most physical Rock-type moves, most notably Stone Edge from Choice Band Entei and Rock Blast from Crustle and Rhydon.</p>

<p>Teams that have a bit of a problem with Fighting-types should choose Altaria over Dragonair as a defensive Dragon Dance user. The Ground-type, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes immunities are also other perks that Altaria offers over other Dragon-types in RU. Rapid Spin support is needed for Altaria, and Kabutops is probably best to provide it, though Cryogonal works better on more defensive teams. Altaria absolutely demolishes Fire / Water / Grass cores, so teams that benefit from that will love Altaria. It provides a nice defensive backbone in the early- and mid-game, and a formidable sweeper in the late-game once Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon are out of the way.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>While Altaria's movepool is truly gigantic, most of what it's capable of doing in RU has been covered by the sets above. Fire Blast can be used on the physical sets to help with Escavalier, Ferroseed, and Tangrowth, though Earthquake, Outrage, or Dragon Claw is usually enough to break them down if it's brought in late-game. A Choice Band set is usable as it offers immediate power backed by a really nice Speed stat, but it's largely outclassed by Druddigon, which offers much more power, and Gabite, which is even faster and has STAB Earthquake to go along with it. Cotton Guard is a neat option on defensive sets, but defensive boosting sets are just begging to be ruined by critical hits and the moveslot is usually better relegated to something else. Finally, Cloud Nine makes Altaria a hard stop to nearly every weather-based team, but they're actually extremely rare in RU, and Altaria gets far more mileage out of Natural Cure.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Almost nothing in the tier can easily switch into a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor without taking some major damage, although Steel-types, particularly Escavalier, Steelix, and Aggron, are a good answer to Altaria, but they need to be extremely wary of Fire Blast and Earthquake, as well as the possible Magneton teammate. Slowking and other special walls like Clefable and Cryogonal are a great stop to the special attacking and support sets, though they're in trouble if they end up switching into the physical sets. Druddigon makes a good check since it can OHKO any Altaria set with Outrage, but Altaria is faster and will probably KO it first unless it's locked into something like Fire Blast. Cinccino is a good offensive check to Altaria as it really puts the hurt down with Rock Blast. Rhydon, Aerodactyl, Archeops, and Kabutops all easily OHKO with Stone Edge and can usually find a way to switch into Altaria between Fire Blast or a weak Dragon Pulse / Dragon Claw. Anything with Ice Beam or another Ice-type attack is an immediate check to Altaria, Cryogonal in particular being a full stop to the special attacking set even with Fire Blast. Stealth Rock is another huge damper to its otherwise fantastic natural bulk. Usually it comes down to what set Altaria is using as to how to play around it, but Altaria has a way around nearly every check or counter it could have, which makes it hard to immediately switch into. Also, once Altaria is at -2 from Draco Meteor or confused from Outrage, almost anything in the tier can use it as setup bait.</p>
