[Overview]

<p>When thinking of bulky Psychic-type Pokemon, Uxie does not often come to mind. It is overshadowed by Cresselia, who has a much higher base HP and similar defenses. However, Uxie is unique as it can learn both Imprison and Trick Room to completely stop opponents from setting up Trick Room. With an average base HP and superb defenses, Uxie is rather bulky and can tank a couple of hits before going down. If you're looking for a counter to Trick Room teams, look no further; this pixie does just that.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set utilizes Uxie to its full potential; it makes use of Uxie's access to the rare Imprison to shut down other Trick Room users. Additionally, Imprison prevents your opponents from using Protect, which is found on nearly every Pokemon in the metagame. Although Trick Room is mainly on the set for Imprison, it can also be used when facing faster Pokemon such as Garchomp and Zapdos. Psychic is Uxie's strongest STAB attack, which hits common Pokemon, such as Hitmontop and Toxicroak, for super effective damage. Helping Hand can be used instead to support Uxie's partner, but as Taunt will easily shut down Uxie if it does not run Psychic, this is not recommended. Finally, Protect is necessary for Uxie and the effects of Imprison to last as long as possible.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Sitrus Berry allows Uxie to heal a quarter of its health in a pinch. A Calm nature with 252 HP and Special Defense EVs allow Uxie to tank special attacks and prevents physical attackers such as Tyranitar from OHKOing it.</p>

<p>Uxie partners well with sweepers that can take advantage of its support to quickly KO opponents. For example, Garchomp has great synergy with Uxie, as it can dish out fast Earthquakes that will not affect Uxie. Tyranitar is a great partner as well, as Uxie has Psychic to take care of the Fighting-types that trouble it. Uxie can even set up Trick Room to patch up Tyranitar's low Speed. Metagross also works well with Uxie, taking advantage of Trick Room with its low Speed.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA with a Bold nature can also be run if you would prefer Uxie to better tank physical attacks. Although Leftovers does not heal as much health as Sitrus Berry does, it is still a decent item that heals a small amount of HP of every turn, and negates residual damage from sandstorm and hail. Mental Herb can be considered if you are afraid of Uxie being Taunted, while Lum Berry prevents Uxie from being afflicted with a status condition.</p>

<p>Uxie has access to several other support moves, such as Reflect, Light Screen, Magic Coat, Thunder Wave, Rain Dance, and Sunny Day. Reflect and Light Screen assist the rest of your team, but the bulkier Cresselia completely outclasses Uxie in setting them up. Magic Coat can turn your opponents' moves against them, bouncing back support moves such as Taunt and Spore. Thunder Wave can cripple faster threats and allow slower sweepers to come in and take them out. Rain Dance and Sunny Day can even be used to surprise your opponent and set up weather to assist your team.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Although Uxie is relatively bulky, it will still fall to super effective attacks. Tyranitar easily takes care of Uxie, as it is immune to Psychic and KOes Uxie with a powerful STAB Crunch. Scizor can steal Uxie's Sitrus Berry with Bug Bite and resists Psychic. Chandelure can use Imprison before Uxie can, then quickly take it down with Shadow Ball. Dark-type Pokemon in general give Uxie trouble, as they are immune to Psychic and can retaliate with a super effective STAB attack. Any Pokemon carrying Taunt can also severely limit Uxie's abilities.</p>
