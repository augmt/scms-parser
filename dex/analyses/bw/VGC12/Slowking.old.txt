[Overview]

<p>In the wake of a new metagame plagued with weather, Slowking emerges as the premier counter to such teams running rampant. With Trick Room and its atrocious Speed stat, Slowking can take advantage of the Speed boosts that many Pokemon gain from the weather to outrun most of its opponents. Furthermore, Slowking can often make use of the weather itself with its usable base 100 Special Attack stat and fantastic movepool. With its bulk and power, Slowking has the potential to make a huge splash in this metagame.</p>

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>Slowking's bulk allows it to set up Trick Room with relative ease, and its good Special Attack stat and powerful STAB attacks enable it to immediately start pounding its opponents into the ground. Trick Room allows Slowking to utilize its very low Speed to become one of the fastest Pokemon on the field. Scald is Slowking's main Water-type STAB as it is boosted by the rain and has the potential to cripple physical attackers. If using Surf, it is advised to have a partner that benefits from Water-type moves, such as Ludicolo or Toxicroak, or that at least resists them.</p>

<p>Psychic allows Slowking to take down Fighting-types such as Hariyama, Hitmontop, and Toxicroak, while also providing it with a strong secondary STAB move. To put this into perspective, Slowking's excellent bulk allows it to take a maximum of 62.9% from Adamant Toxicroak's Sucker Punch and 58.9% from the same move from Adamant Hitmontop, and KO in return with Psychic. Blizzard and Ice Beam are also options for the third moveslot; the former can be used on hail teams for a move that hits both opponents hard, while the latter gives Slowking an accurate Ice-type move in all other weather. Finally, Protect allows Slowking to guard itself against super effective attacks while its teammate takes out the threat. However, this leaves Slowking vulnerable to Steel-types such as Metagross, which are especially problematic to hail teams, so replacing Protect with Flamethrower might be a wiser option.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>With the ubiquity of priority Taunt users such as Whimsicott and Thundurus, it is no wonder that Mental Herb is the primary item option on this set, as it allows Slowking to set up Trick Room unhindered. However, Sitrus Berry can be used to extend Slowking's longevity in conjunction with Regenerator, which allows it to retreat from battle and switch back in when a future opportunity arises with an additional 33% health. This can enable Slowking to set up Trick Room once more or score one last hard hit before going down, and hence prove very useful.</p>

<p>252 HP EVs increase Slowking's longevity on the field, allowing it to to set up Trick Room with ease. Furthermore, with Regenerator healing 33% of Slowking's health each time it switches in, maximum investment in HP allows for greater recovery. 252 Special Attack EVs add more bite to Slowking's attacks, allowing it to take advantage of Trick Room. A Quiet nature, in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs, enables Slowking to outspeed a large proportion of the metagame under Trick Room, and further boosts its Special Attack.</p> 

<p>Slowking appreciates having teammates, Grass-types in particular, that can take advantage of Trick Room while still providing it with much-needed support. Ferrothorn has great defensive synergy synergy with Slowking; it resists all of Slowking's weaknesses, while Slowking can deal with the Fire- and Fighting-types that KO Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn can also make great use of Trick Room with its awful base 20 Speed and powerful STAB Power Whip. Abomasnow is another good choice as it allows Slowking to make use of an accurate Blizzard, and still outspeeds most opponents under Trick Room. Hippowdon is immune to Electric-type moves, and also scuppers the plans of most weather teams.</p>

[Other Options] 

<p>Slowking's massive movepool gives it a plethora of other options to consider. Fire Blast can be run if you prefer raw power over accuracy. Mirror Coat is a rather gimmicky option, but can be viable due to Slowking's bulk and its tendency to attract Electric- and Ghost-type attacks, most of which are specially based. Slack Off provides Slowking with a reliable method of recovery, but it is largely redundant thanks to Regenerator. Slowking can also run a support set with options such as Yawn, Thunder Wave, and Light Screen, but it is better off attacking. Finally, Slowking has other attacking options in Grass Knot, Shadow Ball, and Icy Wind, which can be used instead of Trick Room if your team already has a Trick Room user.</p> 

<p>If Item Clause prevents Slowking from using the listed items, it can run Lum Berry to take Spore from Parasect and Amoonguss, Leftovers for steady recovery, or Wacan Berry to weaken the Electric-type moves that will inevitably come its way.</p>

[Checks and Counters] 

<p>Your best option against Slowking is to hit it with Fake Out and go straight for the KO with a super effective move to stop it from setting up Trick Room. Electric-types such as Thundurus and Zapdos carry STAB Thunderbolt to faint Slowking; the former can also use Taunt to stop Trick Room. Ferrothorn also makes a great check, as it only fears the rare Fire-type move, outspeeds Slowking under Trick Room, and can OHKO with STAB Power Whip. Other Steel-type powerhouses, such as Scizor and Metagross, also fall in the same category as they only need to avoid Flamethrower and can dish out heavy damage, if not outright KO Slowking.</p>
