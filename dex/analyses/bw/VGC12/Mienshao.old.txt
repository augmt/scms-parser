[Overview]

<p>Mienshao might appear to be another run-of-the-mill Fighting-type Fake Out user, but upon closer inspection, it has a few key moves let it stand out from the crowd. Access to Wide Guard lets it offer team support, the ability Inner Focus grants it protection from faster Fake Out users such as Weavile, and its base 125 Attack gives it significant offensive potential. When using Mienshao, however, bear in mind that there are many other competent Fake Out users, so be sure to play to Mienshao's unique strengths.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Mienshao's quirky movepool allows it to play a surprisingly effective offensive-support hybrid role. Wide Guard and Fake Out are great together, and form the supportive core of Mienshao's moveset. Flying Gem in tandem with Acrobatics allows Mienshao to KO other Fighting-types with ease, save for Focus Sash users and max HP Intimidate Hitmontop, to whom it does a crippling 96% maximum. If you want Mienshao on the field a little longer, Focus Sash is appreciated. Mienshao unfortunately does not receive moves such as Close Combat, and thus has to rely on Low Kick for its main STAB move. While Low Kick hits most of its targets hard, Politoed and Ninetales are exceptions, so Drain Punch is an alternative if you need more assurance against the two. Keep in mind, however, that Drain Punch misses out on the OHKO on Terrakion and Abomasnow, as well as the guaranteed OHKO on Chople Berry Tyranitar.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If you want more power and consistency, Hi Jump Kick is the next best move Mienshao has to offer, OHKOing the aforementioned Chople Tyranitar 80% of the time and Ninetales and Politoed 100% of the time with minimal prior damage, which can be provided with Fake Out. Hi Jump Kick comes with a nasty drawback however; it chips off half of Mienshao's health if it misses or gets blocked by Protect.</p>

<p>Pokemon that can take advantage of protection from Rock Slide and other spread moves appreciate Mienshao's support; Pokemon that can ward off Psychic- and Ghost-types also make excellent teammates. Such Pokemon include Chandelure, Metagross, and Yanmega. Hail teams love Wide Guard support and a check to Fighting-type Acrobatics users, roles that Mienshao can perform admirably. Sun teams also enjoy Wide Guard, and the absence of damaging weather makes Focus Sash a viable alternative.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Mienshao doesn't have many more tricks up its sleeve, but there are certainly a few worth mentioning. If you want Mienshao to stick around longer than when using Wide Guard, Detect is a viable move. Knock Off and Feint are situational moves, but an Eviolite-less Dusclops or an Abomasnow that can't Protect itself makes for a good match-up. Mixed or purely special sets with Aura Sphere and Hidden Power Ice could be usable, hitting Dragon-types and Gliscor super effectively. U-turn can help get a teammate in safely while renewing your Fake Out, and can work well with Regenerator. Speaking of Regenerator, it also helps keep your Focus Sash operational; if you expect your opponent to forgo using Fake Out in fear of Inner Focus, it is the best ability to use. Mienshao gets anti-weather options in the form of Sunny Day and Rain Dance, but it is better off being paired with another Pokemon that needs Mienshao's support to set up the respective weather, such as Zapdos.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Mienshao despises bulkier Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Dusclops, as it cannot do enough damage to 2HKO either before getting crippled by Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp, or even flat out OHKOed by Psychic. Flying-types such as Tornadus and Crobat give Mienshao heartburn, but they can be hit hard by Rock Slide. Metagross can KO Mienshao with a combination of Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch, but will take a lot of damage from Low Kick. Anything that can outspeed Mienshao and packs a reasonably strong STAB or super effective move is instantly a threat. Examples of this are Blaziken after a Speed Boost, Chople Berry Terrakion, and Starmie. Trick Room gives Mienshao nightmares, so when running a Trick Room team, it's best to have a solid attacking lead such as Scrafty or Chandelure when going up against a Mienshao.</p>
