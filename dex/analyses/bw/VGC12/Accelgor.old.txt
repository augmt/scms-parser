[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Final Gambit provides Accelgor with a niche role on a team by outrunning and going kamikaze on bulky targets. This allows a team to have a quick answer to Pokemon such as Ferrothorn or Garchomp. Bug Buzz allows Accelgor to attack without sacrificing itself; with a Bug Gem boost, it OHKOes Latios and deals sizable amounts of damage to many other Pokemon. Encore allows Accelgor to disrupt the opponents. Because Accelgor is faster than many of the Pokemon in the metagame, it can make the opponent think twice about using Protect. Alternatively, Acid Spray can be used; it allows Accelgor to support special attackers by halving the opponent's Special Defense and breaking Focus Sashes. Lastly, Protect allows Accelgor to defend itself from the opponent's attacks and scout for priority attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Accelgor's EVs first go into maximizing its HP to improve the usefulness of Final Gambit. 36 Speed EVs allow Accelgor to hit 187 Speed, which lets it outrun Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Abomasnow, in addition to any Pokemon with base 115 Speed or less. The remainder is placed into Special Attack to strengthen Bug Buzz. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 108 SpA / 148 Spe can be used to allow Accelgor to outrun positive-natured base 130 Speed Pokemon, and positive-natured Choice Scarf base 70 Speed Pokemon. Unburden allows Accelgor to invest less in Speed and invest more in bulk or its Special Attack while still allowing it to take advantage of its huge Speed and outspeed plenty of the common threats.</p>

<p>When using Accelgor for Final Gambit, Fake Out partners, such as Hitmontop or Infernape, are effective as they can flinch one opponent while Accelgor uses Final Gambit on the other, or force a Protect that Accelgor can lock down with Encore. Users of Follow Me, Rage Powder, and Quick Guard, such as Togekiss, Amoonguss, and Terrakion, respectively, can also help in ensuring that Accelgor doesn't get sniped by priority moves before it can attack. Accelgor works well with Heatran, as it can take out major threats such as Chandelure and Scizor; in return, Accelgor can take out foes that threaten Heatran by using Final Gambit. If Accelgor is running Acid Spray, Pokemon such as Latios, Thundurus, and Choice Scarf Abomasnow become good partners, as very few Pokemon will be able to survive a special attack at -2 Special Defense. Lastly, other fast sweepers, such as Garchomp and Terrakion, are effective as they allow you to continue to place pressure on the opponent's team.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>As mentioned earlier, Hydration can be used. However, there are two issues: rain needs to be active, and it's only useful if Accelgor is afflicted with a status effect. Feint can be useful to provide a different way for Accelgor to punish those who Protect often, but it is illegal with Encore. Accelgor has a few other special attacks, such as Focus Blast, Giga Drain, and Hidden Power, making a special attacker set viable. If you plan to do this, it is suggested that Accelgor run a Modest nature with an EV spread of 20 HP / 252 SpA / 236 Spe and hold either a Life Orb or Focus Sash. Lastly, due to its high Speed, Accelgor can use Rain Dance to set up for a rain team.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Due to Final Gambit and Encore, Accelgor is a Pokemon that should be handled with caution. Ghost-type Pokemon such as Chandelure and Jellicent are unaffected by Final Gambit; they can either hit Accelgor back hard or set up Trick Room, both of which will put Accelgor in a tight spot. Pokemon with priority moves, such as Metagross and Scizor, can remove the danger of Final Gambit by striking Accelgor first. Lastly, users of Choice Scarf, such as Garchomp, Rotom-A, and Terrakion, can surprise Accelgor by outrunning the bug and crippling it.</p>
