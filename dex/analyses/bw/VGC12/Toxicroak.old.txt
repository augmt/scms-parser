[Overview]

<p>With poor defenses, above-average Attack, and mediocre Speed, some might wonder why Toxicroak should be considered at all on a competitive team. However, Toxicroak's Dry Skin ability allows it to recover some of its HP every turn rain is falling. In addition, Water-type attacks heal Toxicroak up to 25% of its original HP. Add Toxicroak's array of useful priority moves to this mix, and you have yourself one Pokemon that takes great advantage of rain.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With Fake Out, Toxicroak gives its partner time to set up a move such as Tailwind, or eliminate a dangerous threat to your team. Drain Punch gives Toxicroak a reliable STAB attack as well as additional healing, increasing its lifespan by several turns. Low Kick, however, generally has a higher damage output, although Blissey and Chansey are among the few notable exceptions to this rule. Sucker Punch gives Toxicroak a fantastic priority move, allowing it to pick off weakened foes or damage Choice-locked opponents before they can attack. If used in combination with Taunt, Sucker Punch forces Trick Room users such as Dusclops to attack; as most of them are weak to Dark-type moves, Toxicroak can smack them hard with a super effective Sucker Punch.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Focus Sash allows Toxicroak to stay alive for an additional, crucial turn. If one finds Toxicroak's attacking power lacking, a Life Orb can be used to boost its damage output, at the cost of reduced longevity. Toxicroak does not benefit from a Speed-boosting nature; instead, it should boost its Attack with an Adamant nature.</p>

<p>Dry Skin is the main draw of Toxicroak, so a teammate who can set rain up is naturally needed. Politoed is the best Pokemon for this, as Drizzle lets it summon eternal rain. Additionally, Politoed can use Surf to both deal damage and heal Toxicroak. Parasect is an ideal partner for Toxicroak as well, as it draws off Psychic-type attacks with Rage Powder and can hit Psychic-types super effectively with its STAB X-Scissor.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulky Attacker
move 1: Fake Out / Rain Dance
move 2: Drain Punch
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Substitute / Protect
item: Black Sludge / Focus Sash
ability: Dry Skin
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With this set, Toxicroak is able to stay on the field for an extended period of time, and act as a counter to opposing rain teams. Fake Out buys time to get in an auto-rain Pokemon such as Politoed, but if you want additional rain support, Rain Dance is a satisfactory alternative. While Low Kick might have been viable on the former set, Drain Punch is too good to pass up on this set, which revolves around recovery. As before, Sucker Punch gives Toxicroak a strong priority move with which to damage Ghost- and Psychic-types that give it trouble. From behind a Substitute, Toxicroak is difficult to stop, as it recovers HP from rain, Drain Punch, and Black Sludge, as well as teammates that utilize Surf. All these traits allow Toxicroak to wall opposing rain teams to no end, as well as take on some of its more dangerous counters, such as Cresselia.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Black Sludge allows Toxicroak to recover some of its health every turn, which works well in concert with Drain Punch and healing from Dry Skin. If for some reason this is found to be undesirable, a Focus Sash is a viable alternative, as the constant healing allows for multiple uses. 252 EVs are invested in both HP and Attack to power up Toxicroak's moves and increase the amount of damage it can take. Toxicroak has little to worry about in terms of Speed, however, and as such is able to run an Adamant nature with no worry.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Due to the trouble Toxicroak has with Flying-types, Ice Punch can serve as a viable option to hit them for super effective damage; it also gives coverage on Grass-types. However, be warned that Drain Punch and Ice Punch on the same moveset is illegal, so you'll be forced to use either Cross Chop or Brick Break instead. Poison Jab provides Toxicroak with a secondary STAB move, although it gives little additional coverage and leaves Toxicroak without a way to significantly damage Psychic-types. If one is looking for priority, a set of Fake Out, Vacuum Wave, Sucker Punch, and Bullet Punch will allow Toxicroak to go first almost always, but its damage output will likely leave much to be desired. One might look to Swords Dance or Nasty Plot to boost Toxicroak's stats, but the fast-paced VGC metagame leaves little time for stat-boosting moves.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>One of the main counters to Toxicroak is not a Pokemon, but a weather condition. Dry Skin actually depletes Toxicroak's health every turn that sun is in effect, while also increasing the amount of damage it takes from Fire-type assaults, meaning that sun teams give Toxicroak a lot of grief. Flying-type Pokemon such as Tornadus and Togekiss can push around Toxicroak lacking Ice Punch, hitting it hard with a super effective Flying-type move and taking little from its counterattacks. Additionally, Psychic-types are often hard counters to Toxicroak; Cresselia in particular can tank even a super effective Sucker Punch with ease and fire back a 4x super effective Psychic. Pokemon such as Garchomp both outspeed and OHKO Toxicroak with Earthquake, making its life difficult.</p>
