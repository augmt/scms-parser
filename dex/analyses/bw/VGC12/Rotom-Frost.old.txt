[Overview]

<p>Rotom-F is a good Pokemon both offensively and defensively, and should not be underestimated in VGC 2012. With a new secondary Ice typing to add to its Electric typing, Rotom-F has STAB on popular moves such as Blizzard and Thunderbolt, and is still able to take a hit. It should be considered on any hail team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rotom-F may not immediately stand out as an excellent sweeper, but with a decent base 105 Special Attack and enough Defense to take a Bullet Punch, it has great potential in the VGC 2012 metagame. Blizzard is Rotom-F's best STAB attack, as it hits both of the opposing Pokemon. It also does a huge amount of damage to Pokemon that don't resist it, especially when boosted by an Ice Gem. Thunderbolt is another powerful STAB move that can seriously hurt threats such as Kingdra and Politoed and possibly leave a Pokemon paralyzed. The third moveslot has two good options. Hidden Power Fire is useful for taking out popular Bug- and Grass-type Pokemon, such as Scizor and Abomasnow, while Thunder Wave allows Rotom-F to paralyze anything that is not immune to Electric-type moves, enabling it and its teammate to outspeed their opponents. A Choice set should obviously go for Hidden Power Fire, but a non-Choice user should decide between Hidden Power Fire and Thunder Wave based on personal preference. Protect is a staple VGC move; it allows Rotom-F's partner to take out threats to Rotom-F while protecting Rotom-F from damage, and it lets Rotom-F scout out potential moves its opponents could have. If Rotom-F is using a Choice item, however, you should use Trick instead. Tricking a Choice Scarf to a Trick Room starter or a support Pokemon, such as Cresselia, will probably force a switch and render them useless for the rest of the battle.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Ice Gem is the best option, as it would increase the power of Blizzard, allowing Rotom-F to sweep Pokemon from the beginning of the match, while maintaining its ability to switch moves. However, a Choice Scarf is a viable option as well. With base 86 Speed, Choice Scarf Rotom-F can be an excellent revenge killer, as it outruns Pokemon such as Tornadus and Thundurus. Rotom-F should be paired with an Abomasnow, as hail ensures a 100% accurate Blizzard while dealing residual damage. Rotom-F also works well with Tailwind inducers such as Tornadus. With Tailwind support, Rotom-F easily outspeeds all opposing Pokemon. A great offensive partner would be Garchomp, as it can Earthquake opposing Steel-types without damaging Rotom-F due to Levitate, and it also resists Fire-type attacks, particularly Heat Wave, which Rotom-F is weak to.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Choice Specs can be a very good alternative Choice item. A Choice Specs-boosted move can deal serious damage to just about everything; however, Choice Specs Rotom-F might be too slow to be very effective. Other good items are resist berries. A Chople or an Occa Berry makes Rotom-F harder to take down with Fighting- or Fire-type attacks, respectively, and can allow it to get an extra hit off. A dual screens set is possible, and it can be effective in VGC if you are able to get both screens up in time. Discharge could replace Thunderbolt if paired with a Ground-type, such as Garchomp.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Rotom-F unfortunately has multiple weaknesses to popular VGC Pokemon. STAB Flamethrower or Heat Wave from the likes of Chandelure and Volcarona, as well as Blaziken's Flare Blitz, can OHKO Rotom-F with ease. Both Rock Slide and Close Combat from Terrakion will OHKO it, and Mach Punch from Hitmontop, Breloom, or Conkeldurr will 2HKO it. A Scizor's Bullet Punch, however, only 3HKOes Rotom-F.</p>
