[Overview]

<p>Salamence is one of the more intimidating dragons usable in  VGC, and said intimidating quality is naturally one of the main reasons  to use it. Great attacking stats and a wide movepool allow it to be very  versatile, and its respectable 95 / 80 / 80 defenses give it decent  bulk. While its defenses may be undermined by weaknesses to Rock- and  Ice-type attacks, this is less of an issue thanks to Intimidate.  Similarly, while its base 100 Speed leaves it outsped by Garchomp and  Latios, Speed is not as important in VGC due to moves such as the  ever-so-common Trick Room and Tailwind twisting turn order around. These  are relatively trivial faults, and Intimidate as well as a strong,  versatile Dragon STAB is reason enough to seriously consider Salamence  on just about any team; just keep it away from Abomasnow and  company.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A specially inclined Salamence may seem weaker than a physically attacking Salamence, but in practice, it can be deadlier than its physical counterpart, mainly due to the way Outrage randomly picks its targets. Other specially attacking Dragon-types, such as Latios and Hydreigon, seem to overshadow Salamence. But this isn't the case: Salamence can be a superior team player with Intimidate. Moreover, it makes an excellent Hitmontop check, since it resists Mach Punch and is neutral to Sucker Punch, and can KO it with Hidden Power Flying.</p>

<p>A Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor  can leave massive craters in the opponent's HP bar, OHKOing anything  with equal or less bulk than max HP Gastrodon, Politoed, or standard  Zapdos, while leaving bulkier Pokemon such as Cresselia languishing with only half of their health. However, if the drop in Special Attack is too much to pay for such power, Dragon Pulse is a decent  alternative, though it needs a Dragon Gem boost to OHKO other  Dragon-types, such as Dragonite (without Multiscale) and support Latias.  While a Dragon Gem nets KOs that would otherwise be tantalizingly  close, one mustn't forget how common Ice-type moves are, and how deadly they can be to Salamence and its cold-blooded brethren. A Yache Berry may just be its saving grace against an unexpected Blizzard from the likes of Choice Scarf Abomasnow, or a Hidden Power Ice that you mistook for another type.</p>

<p>Heat Wave is an excellent coverage move, hitting two Pokemon at  once and complementing Salamence's STAB moves. However, Heat Wave can  become troublesome for your side as well, considering its lowly 75 Base Power and 90% accuracy, along with the possibility of activating your opponent's Pokemons' Flash Fire,  such as Chandelure or Heatran. Flamethrower solves both of these  problems, scoring 2HKOs and OHKOs on important Pokemon, such as Occa  Berry Metagross and Abomasnow. While it may be tempting to use Fire  Blast instead of Flamethrower, it is important to note that most targets  of Fire Blast would still be OHKOed or 2HKOed by Flamethrower, making Flamethrower the more reliable and better option. Hidden Power Flying is not only useful against Hitmontop, but also takes down other Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Scrafty. Hidden Power Flying also hits Volcarona hard,  and does more damage to Amoonguss than Flamethrower would. Tailwind is  an incredibly useful move; not only does it allow Salamence to get the  jump on faster Dragon-types and weather utilizers, but it allows its  teammates to do so as well. Choosing between it, the ever-useful  Protect, and Hidden Power Flying is akin to choosing between paths in a  fork in the road. All three options are entirely viable, and in  the end, it comes down to what your team needs: faster teammates,  better coverage against Fighting-types, or a healthier  Salamence.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs compensate for the required IVs for Hidden Power  Flying. If Salamence is not using Hidden Power Flying, it would be prudent  to change the spread to 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe since the main spread  would miss out on a point of HP and Special Attack with full IVs. An  alternative, more bulky spread of 144 HP / 248 SpA / 116 Spe (or 140 HP /  252 SpA / 116 Spe without Hidden Power Flying) is a better option for Salamence that opts to use Tailwind and/or a Yache Berry if you feel you don't need to Speed tie  with Pokemon such as Zapdos and Ninetales. Although a Modest nature  enables Salamence to do more damage to most Pokemon, a Timid nature  allows it to stay aloft against Pokemon such as Jolly Haxorus, Timid Hydreigon, unboosted Yanmega,  and other dangerous Pokemon that sit at 90 base Speed and commonly use a  positive Speed nature. Hydro Pump is perhaps the only other notable  special move in Salamence's repertoire outside of various Hidden Powers. Hydro Pump can be useful against Heatran and Tyranitar, does well in the rain, and provides good neutral coverage with Draco Meteor. However, Hydro Pump's iffy accuracy and forcing Salamence to lack a Fire- or Flying-type move can leave it or its teammates open to Ice- or Fighting-types.</p>

<p>Unlike some Dragons, Salamence is a great team player, and as a result can work well with many Pokemon, such as  Tyranitar, Volcarona, and Mamoswine. Although Tyranitar's sandstorm  undermines Salamence's defenses, Intimidate cushions Mach Punch and  similar moves while Tyranitar puts the rocks on Ice-types, all while  preventing them from using perfect accuracy Blizzards by stopping the  hail. Mamoswine is in a similar boat but instead targets other Dragons  with Ice Shard, enjoys Tailwind, and uses Earthquake without hitting Salamence. Rage Powder Volcarona is a great partner for luring away Ice Beams and takes advantage of  Intimidate and Tailwind, though the duo have little to protect  themselves from stray Rock Slides. It should go without saying that  Cresselia enjoys Intimidate to make her defenses nigh impenetrable, and  Cresselia can support her comrade with various supportive moves, such as  Icy Wind and Helping Hand. Hitmontop can shield Salamence from  Blizzards or simply bring the fight to the Ice-types with Close Combat  while forming a double-Intimidate combination, ensuring most physical  attackers won't do any major damage to them or their  teammates.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While this set may not capitalize on Salamence's great type  coverage, it makes up for it with the sheer utility of Intimidate and  Tailwind. Equipped with a Life Orb and Tailwind at its back, Dragon Claw  makes mencemeat (pun intended) out of Latios and Garchomp, Pokemon who  normally check Salamence by virtue of only their Speed. Salamence can  still OHKO either of them without a Life Orb, though its chances of  doing so to Garchomp drops to around 30%. Yache Berry doesn't simply  ruin your chances with Garchomp though; it protects Salamence from an  unexpected Ice Beam, Blizzard, or Hidden Power Ice, all of which are  notorious for dropping Dragon / Flying Pokemon in one hit. As your team  may still need Intimidate and Tailwind, keeping Salamence alive and well  is important, especially when a KOed Pokemon out of the gate is every  VGC player's nightmare.</p>

<p>Earthquake is a generic coverage and spread move, ensuring  Salamence isn't caught with its pants down against Pokemon such as  Heatran and Metagross. The third slot is flexible; Crunch lets Life Orb  Salamence 2HKO specially defensive Cresselia and Dusclops, though you'll  have to be on your toes as both of them can cripple Salamence with  Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, respectively. Alternatively, Salamence can  use Tailwind and Protect in the same set. If you do end up picking an  attacking move in the third slot, the fourth move will pose a dilemma.  In the end, however, it largely depends on what your team requiresâ€”a  healthy Salamence ready to Intimidate the opponent into submission, or  Tailwind support.<p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Salamence's Special Attack is good enough to use Fire Blast  effectively with a hindering nature, as the main targets of Fire Blast  are Abomasnow and Ferrothorn, two Pokemon that are otherwise huge  threats to Salamence. Besides those two, however, you won't find much  use for it, as Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Metagross hard enough  already. If you feel Salamence is too frail, use a spread of 140 HP /  252 Atk / 116 Spe; this spread allows Salamence to outspeed Mamoswine  and everything below a base Speed of 80, and gives Salamence room to  take a few Water-, Fighting-, or even Ice-type moves with Yache  Berry.</p>

<p>Fighting-types supporters, such as Hitmontop, Lucario, and  Conkeldurr, make great teammates for Salamence. Hitmontop and Conkeldurr  protect Salamence from dangerous Blizzards with Wide Guard, and if  you're pairing Salamence with Intimidate Hitmontop, your team will take  practically nothing from physical attacks bar those such as Metagross,  who can negate stat drops. Lucario can utilize Follow Me to draw in  Ice-type moves, which is especially useful if you're not using a Yache  Berry. Given its subpar Defense, Gallade appreciates Intimidate support,  and can reverse Trick Room should the situation arise. Chandelure can  also reverse Trick Room, appreciates Tailwind support, and can give hail  teams heartburn with its all-powerful Heat Wave. Cresselia is immune to  Earthquake, and with Intimidate support, it becomes nigh untouchable,  giving it plenty of time to fire off Helping Hand or any other support  move.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The main drawback to using a Choice item in VGC is that you have to switch out to change moves. However, when your Choice user has Intimidate, this problem is somewhat mitigated, as you're probably  switching in and out anyway to maximise its effect! Choice Scarf is the main  option due to the surprise factor, allowing Salamence to foil Latios's  and Garchomp's plans of taking it out before it can move. On the other  hand, Choice Specs supplies Salamence's Draco Meteor with enough power  to not only OHKO many common Pokemon, such as Zapdos, Rotom-W, and even  Haban Berry Kingdra, but also severely dent anything that doesn't resist  it or invest heavily in Special Defense.</p>

<p>If you absolutely loathe the Special Attack drops from Draco  Meteor, Dragon Pulse is an option, but the drop in power is very  apparent as Salamence can now only 2HKO all of the aforementioned  threats. Heat Wave is a fairly obvious spread move, as it compliments  Salamence's Dragon-type STAB. The 75 Base Power may be unappealing,  however, especially as it makes Choice Specs Salamence lose the OHKO on  Metagross, so Flamethrower is a suitable replacement. Hidden Power  Flying takes advantage of Salamence's resistance to Fighting-type moves,  allowing it 2HKO or OHKO bulkier Fighting-types, such as Hitmontop,  depending on which Choice item Salamence uses. Finally, Hydro Pump  douses Fire-types and erodes Rock-types, 2HKOing Tyranitar in a  sandstorm while it cannot OHKO Salamence in return because of  Intimidate.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread accommodates for the IV drop for Hidden Power  Flying. While using a Modest nature, however, you might find that there  isn't much of interest Salamence can outspeed. Given this, you can opt  to change Salamence's spread to 144 HP / 248 SpA / 116 Spe to outspeed  base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Mamoswine, moving the EVs to HP, going a  long way to extend Salamence's longevity.</p>

<p>Choice Salamence works well rain or shine, so it easily fits  into a variety of team archetypes. Sun teams don't particularly care for  another Rock-type weakness, but they do enjoy Intimidate and another  Heat Wave user, as well as the added bonus of being able to take care  of Tyranitar should it rear its ugly face. Rain teams also enjoy  Intimidate, but they particularly love a check to Shedinja and  Ferrothorn, two Pokemon they often lack reliable checks for. Again,  Lucario, Hitmontop, and Conkeldurr make great partners for Salamence,  protecting it from dangerous Blizzards or Ice Beams. The latter two can  also use Feint, which can ensure a kill on Latios and Garchomp should  they be extra cautious and Protect on Draco Meteor. Taunt and Safeguard  are also incredibly useful to keep Salamence from being paralyzed or its  Speed turned against in Trick Room. Cresselia is an excellent user of  Safeguard, and can use Helping Hand, Icy Wind, and Thunder Wave to  alleviate Choice Specs Salamence's Speed problems and power up Draco  Meteor to an awe-inspiring 210 Base Power. Terrakion makes short work of  a wide variety of Ice-types with Close Combat and Rock Slide, and  breathes more easily when it isn't as threatened by Mach  Punch.</p>

<p>Defensively speaking, Heatran, Bronzong, and Metagross make  great partners for Salamence to switch into, as they resist Ice- and  Rock-type attacks while Salamence is immune to Earthquake and resistant  to Fire-type attacks. In a similar vein, Water-types such as Suicune and  Rotom-W make good partners, though they resist only Ice-type  attacks.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Salamence's movepool is quite expansive, so there are quite a  few other options you can consider. Roost is useful for preserving  Salamence's health, though the main issue is finding a slot for it. Aqua  Tail is usable under rain, though it has mostly redundant coverage with  Earthquake and Dragon Claw; it only hits Air Balloon Heatran, Gliscor, and similar opponents. Thunder Fang is fairly weak, but if you hate  Water-types with a burning passion, it's worth considering. With proper  support, Dragon Dance is a great option to bypass both Salamence's Speed  and power issues in one turn of setup; however setup usually isn't  worth it due to the amount of support it needs, but it can be  devastating in the right circumstances. Rock Slide is always a great  move to deal consistent damage to the opponent, and perhaps more  importantly, flinch a Pokemon in the middle of a game-changing turn.  Stone Edge has the same coverage as Rock Slide, but as it hits only one  target, it can OHKO standard Thundurus, where it would be a 2HKO with  Rock Slide. If you want a powerful Dragon-type move with no recoil or  don't want to be locked into one move, Dragon Gem is a perfectly usable  item for a quick and deadly Draco Meteor or Dragon Claw. Moxie may be  tempting to use, given Salamence's massive Attack stat and access to a  powerful Earthquake, but using Moxie means you lose the utility of  Intimidate and Tailwind.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>In general, faster Pokemon that carry Hidden Power Ice or Ice  Beam make short work of Salamence if it's not holding a Yache Berry.  Starmie, Focus Sash Jolteon, Thundurus, and Choice Scarf Rotom-W are  great examples of this, and all of them can take a Dragon Claw or  Earthquake if worst comes to worst. Hail teams are Salamence's  kryptonite, though Salamence always has the option of using a Fire-type  move. Mamoswine can OHKO Salamence before it can move with priority Ice  Shard and residual hail or Fake Out damage. Weavile is well above  Salamence in terms of Speed, and can cut it down to size with Ice Punch.  Cresselia and Dusclops are both defensive standbys that provide a full  stop to most Salamence, and can cripple it with Thunder Wave,  Will-O-Wisp, Trick Room, or in Cresselia's case, simply KO it with Ice  Beam. Trick Room teams have no shortage of Pokemon that can deal with  Salamence, such as Rhyperior, Glaceon, Slowking, Slowbro, Druddigon,  Jellicent, and Gastrodon. Occa Berry Metagross can take anything  Salamence can throw at it rather nicely and hit back with Ice Punch or a  combination of Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch. Lastly, Latios and  Garchomp can check Salamence provided it doesn't have Tailwind or Choice  Scarf.</p>
