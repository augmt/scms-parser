[Overview]

<p>In single battles, Camerupt has a very hard time getting anywhere due to its low Speed and sub-par defenses. But due to the rising effectiveness of Trick Room in the VGC 2012 metagame, Camerupt has received a new lease on life. See those volcanoes on Camerupt's back? They serve a very clear purpose: Camerupt is the best Eruption user for Trick Room teams. Boasting a reasonable 105 base Base Special Attack and low Speed, this fiery camel should find a good spot on any Trick Room team, though it requires some support to be effective, seeing how it is, as mentioned, very slow and frail.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Camerupt's main move on this set is Eruption. Boasting a massive 150 Base Power not including STAB, Eruption OHKOes almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, and with the boost from Fire Gem, few threats will be able to soak it up. The other main STAB move is Earth Power; it lacks the raw power of Eruption but it can get rid of Heatran, Chandelure, and other Fire- or Rock-types in Camerupt's way. Hidden Power Ice allows Camerupt to counter Salamence, non-Yache Berry Garchomp, and Hydreigon. Heat Wave is also highly recommended as it is a nice backup STAB, however, in case Camerupt has already taken large damage. Protect needs no explanation; Camerupt is pretty frail and it needs a move to stick around while allowing its partner to take out a threat.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Solid Rock is the chosen ability because having a little extra resistance to Earthquakes is always appreciated, but note that almost any Water-type move will end Camerupt right there and then. The EV spread maximizes Camerupt's HP and Special Attack, giving it optimum bulk and firepower. Camerupt works better as a third or fourth choice than as a lead; without the absolutely necessary Trick Room, it's far too slow to ever use Eruption. Bread-and-butter Trick Room leads such as Cresselia, Musharna, and Bronzong can set up the said move, and are also bulky enough to help Camerupt when it switches in. Outside of the mentioned Pokemon, however, the best partner for Camerupt is probably Gastrodon. Gastrodon draws Water-type attacks such as Surf and Water Spout away from Camerupt, putting a major monkey wrench in the opponent's plans, and also makes Ground-type moves Camerupt's only weakness. Anything that can counter a rain team, such as Tyranitar or Hippowdon, also helps out tremendously. Camerupt works well in a sun team as its Eruption can become even more powerful, but this is difficult because it absolutely needs a Trick Room supporter.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A completely different EV spread can be effectively run with Camerupt, with 252 EVs in Attack instead of HP. This way, it can use Rock Slide and Explosion, two very effective moves. If you are afraid that Camerupt won't be able to shoot off its most powerful Eruption, Flamethrower or Fire Blast can either replace or complement it, though note that these moves provide greater accuracy, they lack the power and potential that Eruption carries. Focus Sash can also be used if you truly want to be sure about Camerupt's survival.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>When not paired with Gastrodon, Camerupt is soundly beaten by rain teams. In general, Water-types such as Gyarados and Kingdra make great checks to Camerupt, as they will only take neutral damage from Camerupt and can OHKO it with their STAB attacks. Aqua Jet users such as Azumarill also end Camerupt's reign abruptly. Tyranitar also gives Camerupt trouble, comfortably sponging Earth Power with its excellent special bulk and hitting it with a super effective Earthquake. Teams meant to specifically counter Trick Room also shut down Camerupt, as spamming Eruption becomes nearly impossible with its low Speed.</p>
