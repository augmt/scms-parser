[Overview]

<p>Hydreigon certainly looks like something that would tear you limb from limb, and one glance at that massive 125 Special Attack should leave no doubt in your mind that it is capable of doing so. Although its Draco Meteor is slightly weaker than Latios's and its Speed is lacking, Hydreigon boasts STAB Dark Pulse to eliminate dangerous support Pokemon such as Cresselia and the powerful Fire Blast, while Latios has to rely on non-STAB Shadow Ball and the significantly weaker Hidden Power Fire.</p>

<p>Even in light of its perks, however, Hydreigon is in constant danger of being dispatched by faster Pokemon that can take advantage of its Fighting- and Dragon-type weaknesses due to its awkward base 98 Speed, and it also runs the risk of being outclassed by older Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Latios. When using Hydreigon, it is important to use it for what its competitors cannot do.</p>

evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Oftentimes, Hydreigon's main role in a team is to hit hard off its Special Attack, and this set is its best bet for doing so. Dark Pulse is the move you're probably going to fire off most often, 2HKOing even max Special Defense Eviolite Dusclops 85% of the time when using a Timid nature, and 100% of the time when Modest. Draco Meteor is the main option due to its sheer power; while Dragon Pulse is an alternative if you don't like the Special Attack drop, the drop in power is very noticeable. Fire Blast is Hydreigon's best coverage move, allowing Hydreigon to perform admirably in sun. Under the sun, Fire Blast destroys even max Special Defense Bronzong and deals a minimum of 87% to 252 HP Occa Berry Metagross. Speaking of Fire Blast, if you don't like the 85% accuracy, you can always use Flamethrower. While it misses out on a little more power, Life Orb Flamethrower can still 2HKO Occa Metagross and max Special Defense Amoonguss. Protect is fairly self-explanatory as it keeps Hydreigon safe from Mach Punches, Draco Meteors, and Ice Shards.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are fairly straightforward, but if you're not concerned about opposing max Speed Hydreigon, you can use a spread of 12 HP / 252 SpA / 244 Spe which, along with a Timid nature, allows you to outpace Jolly Haxorus. Modest Hydreigon must run max Speed in order to outpace neutral-natured Haxorus, but if you're also not concerned with Haxorus, you can use a spread of 56 HP / 252 SpA / 200 Spe for both Timid and Modest in order to outpace base 90 Pokemon such as Lucario. Defensive items such as Haban Berry and Focus Sash are perfectly acceptable, but unless you invest heavily in your defenses, resist berries rarely do much good. For example, Life Orb or Dragon Gem Latios will KO Hydreigon right through its Haban Berry.</p>

<p>Due to its awkward Speed tier, Hydreigon loves paralysis support; Prankster Thunder Wave and Stun Spore from Thundurus and Whimsicott are especially good choices. Pokemon that are capable of taking on Fighting-types are also a huge help. Cresselia, a solid option, can provide Thunder Wave support as well. Tailwind support is also welcome, but most of the Pokemon that set it up share an Ice-type weakness with Hydreigon, so you may have to take a few measures to stop hail teams, such as Wide Guard Fighting-types or a reliable Fire-type, in addition to using Fire Blast.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hydreigon's special movepool doesn't extend very far beyond the listed options, but it does get Focus Blast, Earth Power, and Charge Beam. Focus Blast is great for dealing with Tyranitar, but that's really all you'd cover with it. Earth Power is unfortunately illegal with Dark Pulse, but it can still hit Steel-types and Tyranitar. Hydreigon can also use Charge Beam, but it is an unreliable and slow way of boosting. Hydreigon has a fairly large physical movepool which includes Acrobatics, Rock Slide, Earthquake, and Crunch, and a respectable base 105 Attack with which to abuse it. Unfortunately, it does not get Dragon Claw, and will have to use the unreliable Outrage or Dragon Rush for physical Dragon-type STAB. A mixed set consisting of Draco Meteor / Crunch / Fire Blast is also viable, but as with a purely physical option, isn't as destructive as the main set. Choice sets are very attractive, but they are generally outclassed by Latios, who can do the same thing with higher Speed and Special Attack, although it misses out on Fire Blast. Surf, while considerably weaker than Fire Blast due to the doubles power drop, can still be used to take advantage of a teammate's Water Absorb, Storm Drain, or Absorb Bulb, while dealing decent chunks of damage to the opposing Pokemon. Chople Berry is good against Pokemon such as Infernape and Terrakion, but Hydreigon needs all the power it can get.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Latios and Terrakion make Hydreigon stop in its tracks, as they are both faster and can OHKO it with powerful STAB attacks; the latter can even switch in on Dark Pulse and get an Attack boost. In the sand, Tyranitar can take Hydreigon's attacks fairly well and can strike back with Low Kick or Superpower. Opposing rain teams give Hydreigon trouble as the opponent is likely carrying more than one Pokemon with Ice Beam. Hail teams pose similar issues, though Abomasnow has to watch out for Flamethrower. Fast and powerful Bug-types such as Volcarona and Yanmega can threaten Hydreigon with STAB Bug Buzz, though Yanmega needs to be careful not to get hit by any of Hydreigon's moves because of its meager Special Defense.</p>
