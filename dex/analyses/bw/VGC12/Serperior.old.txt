[Overview]

<p>While its name may imply superiority over other Pokemon, Serperior is often seen as inferior to other Grass-types and supporting Pokemon in VGC 2012. Serperior's high base 113 Speed helps differentiate itself from most Grass-types, however it faces competition from Whimsicott, who has access to Prankster. Serperior lacks the offensive stats to actually deal decent damage, so it's often left to support its team members. Its defensive stats aren't worth writing home about either, as it's weak to Fire- and Ice-type attacks&mdash;which are commonly seen&mdash;and has a small movepool, making it relatively predictable. Despite its disadvantages, Serperior can still do a decent job at supporting its teammates thanks to its great base Speed, but is outclassed by many other Pokemon.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Serperior's high base Speed can allow it to function as a fast dual screen user. Light Screen and Reflect form the core of the set, while Giga Drain gives Serperior a way to recover HP and prevents it from becoming complete Taunt bait. Glare can paralyze opponents while being able to hit Ground-types. Taunt can prevent slower opponents, such as Cresselia, from setting up, and Protect allows Serperior to avoid damage for a turn.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are set to give Serperior both speed and bulk, while adding a little to its defenses. Using maximum Speed is almost pointless as it doesn't let Serperior outspeed anything in particular. 244 Speed EVs hits 181 Speed, which outspeeds max Speed Thundurus and Tornadus and everything below, which includes base 110 Speed Pokemon. The rest of the EVs are placed in defenses and Special Attack, as to not waste EVs. Mental Herb is the item of choice due to the prevalence of Taunt users. Light Clay may be used to prolong the effects of Light Screen and Reflect, but Mental Herb is usually preferred due to the fast nature of VGC battles. Leaf Storm may be used over Giga Drain if you want a strong attack and don't care about HP recovery; Leaf Blade can also be used with a Jolly nature if you'd rather hit on the physical side. The set pairs well with offensive partners, such as Latios and Terrakion, as they appreciate the boosts given by dual screens. Slower Pokemon such as Metagross and Chandelure also do well with paralysis support from Glare.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Serperior's movepool is rather limited, but still has a few viable options. Serperior is the fastest Gastro Acid user in the game, and while it may seem gimmicky on paper it could potentially shut down Pokemon that heavily rely on their abilities, such as Swift Swim abusers. Serperior can also make good use of Leech Seed as it has low HP, which works well on foes with high HP stats, such as Chansey. Safeguard can be used to block status, and Mean Look prevents opponents from switching, which could allow a safe switch in for a counter. Sunny Day is useful for cancelling out unfavorable weather such as sand or hail.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Serperior's defenses are less than outstanding, so any heavy hitter with a strong Fire-, Ice-, or Flying-type move can easily take out Serperior if it hasn't set up dual screens yet. Faster opponents such as Weavile can easily remove Serperior with Fake Out and a STAB Ice Punch. Steel-types such as Metagross and Scizor take very little from Serperior's attacks and can effectively wall it. Prankster users such as Whimsicott and Thundurus can use Taunt to render Serperior useless, unless it has Mental Herb; any Pokemon with Taunt could shut it down as well.</p>
