[Overview]

<p>Despite her unique typing and impressive base 110 Speed, Froslass's poor defensive abilities and reliance on hail restrict her potential in the VGC 2012 metagame. However, she is still an excellent fit for any hail team, with the ability to spam Blizzard while outspeeding most common Pokemon, including Garchomp and Zapdos. Although Froslass's stats are rather mediocre, they allow her to take a couple of hits while still dealing a great amount of damage. When utilized correctly, she is a perfect fit for any hail team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set allows Froslass to work on a hail team to her full potential. With access to STAB Blizzard, Froslass is able to dish out massive damage to common Pokemon weak to Ice-type attacks, such as Garchomp, Zapdos, Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, and Latios. Shadow Ball allows Froslass to hit Pokemon that resist Blizzard, such as Metagross, and Pokemon that are weak to Ghost-type attacks, such as Chandelure, Cresselia, and Jellicent. The third move is a toss-up between Taunt and Destiny Bond. Taunt allows Froslass to shut down defensively based Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Cresselia, but falls short if the opponent carries a Mental Herb. Destiny Bond is an interesting move that can be used in conjunction with Focus Sash, taking down massive threats in one shot. Finally, Protect is used to shield Froslass while letting her partner take down common threats.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Froslass's EVs are straightforward but effective. With a Timid nature and maximum investment in Speed, she can outrun anything with less than 110 base Speed while Speed tying with common Pokemon such as Latios. With a Focus Sash, Froslass is able to take hits from anything and dish out at least one powerful Blizzard before going down. It also prevents Froslass from being KOed by Latios's Draco Meteor before it can retaliate with Blizzard for an OHKO. However, with Tyranitar running rampant in the VGC 2012 metagame, it can often go to waste. An Ice Gem-boosted Blizzard is incredibly strong and allows Froslass to OHKO many threats, but leaves Froslass wide open to attacks. Snow Cloak should be used over Cursed Body, Froslass's Dream World ability, to make it harder for attacks to hit Froslass under the hail. Paired with a Focus Sash, Froslass can often be frustrating to take out.</p>

<p>Froslass should obviously be paired with Abomasnow to increase Blizzard's accuracy and take advantage of the hail; Blizzard's 70% accuracy is awfully unreliable and should be avoided outside of hail unless absolutely necessary. Froslass and Abomasnow can spam Blizzard repeatedly without having to worry about it missing.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Froslass also has access to many interesting and somewhat useful moves that can be used to catch your opponent off guard. Icy Wind is great for doing decent damage to Pokemon that are weak to it, as well as slowing down threats. Confuse Ray has an impressive 100% accuracy and can cause incredible frustration to your opponent. Ice Shard can be used to finish off Pokemon that have very little HP remaining. Other offensive moves that give Froslass coverage include Ice Beam, which enables her to attack reliably outside of hail, Psychic, and Thunderbolt. Some other interesting support moves Froslass has access to include Hail, Light Screen, Thunder Wave, and Trick.</p>

<p>Froslass can also be used with a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs. Choice Scarf allows Froslass to outspeed Latios and the genies and OHKO them with Blizzard, but leaves her very vulnerable to attacks. Because Froslass already has an impressive base 110 Speed, she can also use Choice Specs to dish out massive Blizzards turn after turn; however, it also leaves her wide open to attacks. Both Choice Scarf and Choice Specs can be used in conjunction with Trick to render Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Cresselia, and Amoonguss useless. BrightPowder and Snow Cloak make it incredibly hard to even touch Froslass, but a single super effective move will take her down.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Because Froslass has very mediocre defensive stats, she will often go down to any non-resisted attack in two or fewer hits. Common moves that hit for super effective damage, such as Tyranitar's Rock Slide and Crunch, Zapdos's Heat Wave, and Scizor's Bullet Punch, will easily OHKO if Froslass does not have a Focus Sash. Pokemon that are not damaged a lot by Blizzard or Shadow Ball, such as Heatran and Scizor, can easily wall Froslass and KO her. Pokemon such as Politoed, Tyranitar, and Ninetales all change the weather, tank hits from Froslass, and make it a lot more difficult to attack with Blizzard. Froslass also hates dealing with Sucker Punch, which restricts her abilities. Wide Guard completely shuts down Blizzard for one turn.</p>
