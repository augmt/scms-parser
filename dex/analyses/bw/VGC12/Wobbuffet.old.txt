[Overview]

<p>With only 8 moves, no access to Protect, and no way to attack an opponent directly, Wobbuffet is definitely a strange choice for VGC. Using Shadow Tag to cut off the opponent's ability to switch is Wobbuffet's primary function, providing an opportunity to use a few unconventional strategies.</p>

[SET]
name: Shadow Tag Support
move 1: Mirror Coat
move 2: Counter
move 3: Encore
move 4: Charm
item: Sitrus Berry
ability: Shadow Tag
nature: Calm / Bold
evs: 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>As mentioned before, Wobbuffet lacks options for moves. Counter and Mirror Coat are used to score a KO or two with some prediction. Encore is used to lock an opponent into a single move, while Charm is used to reduce an opponent's Attack. Because Wobbuffet's ability prevents the opponent from switching, both Encore and Charm are more potent than they would be otherwise.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Wobbuffet's EV spread provides a balanced amount of physical and special bulk. Even without HP investment, most strong attacks will still do more than enough damage to allow a lethal blow with Counter or Mirror Coat. Wobbuffet should run 0 IV in Speed and either a Relaxed or Sassy nature if it is on a Trick Room team. An alternate spread of 124 Def / 132 SpD / 252 Spe with a Timid nature can be used, allowing Wobbuffet to outrun uninvested base 70s and disrupt them with Encore. Wobbuffet holds a Sitrus Berry for extra longevity, but holding Leftovers or a type-resist Berry can work as well.</p>

<p>The most interesting strategy for Wobbuffet in VGC is Perish Trapping. If attempting this, Perish Song users, such as Politoed, Azumarill, and Jigglypuff, along with bulky Pokemon, such as Chansey, Bronzong, and Cresselia, make effective partners to Wobbuffet by setting up Perish Song allowing Wobbuffet to buy time until the perish count reduces to zero. Another interesting&mdash;although harder to pull off&mdash;strategy is to use Skill Swap on Wobbuffet. By using Pokemon, such as Chansey and Cresselia, to Skill Swap for Shadow Tag, it can make it much more difficult for the opponent to remove the ability from play to allow themselves to switch out. Other strategies for Shadow Tag include partnering Wobbuffet with Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Salamence and Hitmontop, to shred the Attack of any physical attackers present, or with Pokemon with Disable, such as Kingdra, Alakazam, and Jigglypuff, to shut down a Pokemon completely after they have been hit with Encore from Wobbuffet.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Safeguard can be used to block Status moves. Destiny Bond can be used to deter attacks on Wobbuffet when it is at low HP, but its usage is rather situational. Splash provides Wobbuffet a move with a massive amount of PP, making the opponent more likely to start using Struggle first, but isn't viable due to the timer. Tickle is a decent support move that can be used instead of Charm, but it is extremely difficult to obtain for use in an actual event. Mental Herb can be used to cure Wobbuffet from Taunt, which would prevent it from using its supporting moves, while Lum Berry can be used to counteract Spore or Thunder Wave. Lastly, don't use Wobbuffet's Dream World ability, Telepathy, as it defeats the purpose of running a Wobbuffet.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The inability to switch out means that it is critical to start thinking about how to counter Wobbuffet right from the Team Preview screen. Getting caught without a strong offensive presence on the field can leave you in a dangerous spot in about 3 turns. Because Wobbuffet cannot learn Protect, throwing high power STAB moves, such as Draco Meteor, Meteor Mash, and Hydro Pump, at it will shorten its stay on the field, and returns your ability to switch out. With their extremely high power, Heracross and Escavalier can OHKO Wobbuffet with a Bug Gem-boosted Megahorn. Otherwise, other Bug-, Dark-, and Ghost-types, such as Hydreigon, Chandelure, and Scizor are good at disposing Wobbuffet quickly.</p>
