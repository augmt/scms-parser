[Overview]

<p>Torterra faces stiff competition from other, bulkier Grass-types in the VGC 2012 metagame, such as Ferrothorn. However, with a respectable base 109 Attack, decent stats around the board, an immunity to one of the most common spread moves in the metagame in Discharge, along with the growing popularity of Pokemon it can handle, such as Gastrodon and Swampert, this turtle can really make the earth shake.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is meant to fully utilize one of Torterraâ€™s best perks: its base 109 Attack stat. The hardest decision when using Torterra is whether to run Wood Hammer or Seed Bomb. Wood Hammer is the more powerful option, but its recoil forces the use of a Life Orb, as it is illogical with a Focus Sash. However, if you don't like the recoil and want to use Focus Sash, Seed Bomb is your best option. Earthquake is obvious as it is a powerful STAB attack; Rock Slide is also mandatory as it hits the Flying-types that resist Torterra's STABs super effectively. Finally, as is the case with every other VGC Pokemon, Protect enables Torterra to scout attacks and keep itself safe for a turn. Wide Guard can also be considered because it blocks Heat Wave and Blizzard, two common moves in the metagame.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Brave nature is used in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs and 252 Attack EVs to minimize Torterra's Speed while maximizing its Attack, which lets it reach its highest potential as a Trick Room sweeper.</p>

<p>To fully utilize this set, Trick Room is an absolute must. Cresselia, Musharna, and Bronzong are amazing partners, as they are immune to Earthquake, and the former two can boost the power of Earthquake with Helping Hand. Other Trick Room users, such as Dusclops, Reuniclus, and Slowking, also make good teammates; however, they lack said Earthquake immunity. Pokemon that can set up sandstorm, namely Tyranitar and Hippowdon, also pair greatly with Torterra, who is immune to sandstorm recoil. Of the two, Tyranitar is the more recommended choice as their only common weakness is Bug, an attack type that is almost never seen in the VGC metagame. It is also worth mentioning again that Torterra is a great counter to Swampert, Gastrodon, and Rhyperior. Another effective partner to Torterra is a Rotom forme, as depending on its forme, it can eliminate threats to Torterra such as Tornadus, Thundurus, Scizor, and Fire-types. To add to the success of their pairing, Rotom-A is immune to the turtle's Earthquakes, and Torterra is immune to Discharge as well.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Crunch is a viable option that allows Torterra to better deal with Latios, Latias, and other Psychic-types. If one must use other items, Yache Berry, Grass Gem, or Ground Gem are the recommended secondary choices.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Hail teams are the bane of Torterra's existence, as Blizzard OHKOes all but Focus Sash Torterra. Even if it runs Rock Slide, Zapdos, Salamence, and Thundurus still check Torterra effectively, while Ludicolo and Politoed can end it quickly. Teams meant to counter Trick Room will render Torterra useless, as it is very slow and hence ineffective outside of Trick Room.</p>
