[Overview]

<p>As the slowest fully evolved weather inducer with a base Speed of 47, Hippowdon can typically be relied upon to set up its sandstorm, as well as function in Trick Room. While Hippowdon's support options are less useful in doubles play than in singles, the sand hippo takes physical hits like a boss thanks to its great physical bulk, and retaliates back with an above average base 112 Attack and powerful spread moves. Although Tyranitar is most often picked as the sandstorm inducer for a sand team, Hippowdon is still worth considering.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set utilizes Hippowdon's slow speed and strong attack to function as a bulky physical sweeper. Earthquake is Hippowdon's strongest STAB spread move, as well as its most reliable way of dealing damage. Ice Fang complements Earthquake nicely, hitting the Flying-types that are immune to Earthquake, as well as Latios. In addition, Ice Fang decimates Garchomp, which has high bulk to take Earthquake and has Sand Veil to abuse sandstorm. Crunch hits bulky Psychic-types for super effective damage and Levitate Bronzong for neutral damage. Protect is a staple for doubles, but Slack Off can be used to provide Hippowdon with recovery. Leftovers is recommended in conjunction with Slack Off in order to assist in stalling.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Sitrus Berry is the recommended item for Hippowdon due to the instant recovery it provides. However, if you already have Sitrus Berry on another Pokemon, Passho Berry is a useful alternative, allowing Hippowdon to take common Water-type attacks. However, a 252 HP / 0 SpD Hippowdon can survive even relatively strong STAB Scalds, such as from Politoed, Ludicolo, and Suicune without relying on Passho Berry.</p>

<p>252 HP EVs and 4 Def EVs give Hippowdon more bulk, buffering it against the likes of a Dragon Claw from Garchomp and a Close Combat from Terrakion. 252 Attack EVs along with a Brave nature allow Hippowdon to hit as hard as possible. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def can be used with a Relaxed nature, to increase Hippowdon's physical bulk, although its damage is decreased significantly. Another alternative spread is 252 HP / 36 Def / 220 SpD with a Relaxed nature; this enables Hippowdon to easily survive a max Special Attack Abomasnow's Grass Knot and Blizzard, allowing Hippowdon to survive and switch out, living to start the Sandstorm for another day. In addition, when armed with a Passho Berry, this Hippowdon can survive a rain boosted Hydro Pump from Kingdra.</p>

<p>Hippowdon appreciates Trick Room support due to its low base Speed. Therefore, partners such as Bronzong, Cresselia, and Musharna are great teammates because they not only can set up Trick Room, but are also immune to Earthquake thanks to their abilities. Furthermore, they have high bulk and access to Light Screen, which allows Hippowdon to take more special attacks. Cresselia and Musharna both have Helping Hand, increasing Hippowdon's damage output.</p>

<p>Zapdos can help Hippowdon by striking Water-types with its strong Electric-type moves and by OHKOing Abomasnow with a super effective Heat Wave. Conversely, Hippowdon can support Zapdos by threatening Rock-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar with Earthquake. Furthermore, Hippowdon and Zapdos can utilize the Discharge and Earthquake combo due to immunity to each other's STAB moves.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hippowdon does not have a great offensive movepool, and its great support movepool is admittedly more useful in singles than doubles. Rock Slide, Fire Fang, and Thunder Fang are options that can be used over Ice Fang and Crunch. As with Ice Fang, Rock Slide complements Earthquake well, together forming the QuakeSlide combo, which provides great neutral coverage barring Pokemon such as Breloom. Fire Fang is an option because a max Attack Hippowdon can OHKO a 252 HP / 0 Def Abomasnow with Fire Fang, while surviving Abomasnow's assaults. In addition, Fire Fang hits Steel-types super effectively, most notably Bronzong, which resists both Earthquake and Ice Fang. Thunder Fang alternatively gains super effective coverage on Water-types, most notably Gyarados, which can Intimidate and wall Hippowdon. Yawn can be used over Crunch to force switches, and is especially effective due to the lack of sleep clause. Roar or Whirlwind can be used in order to phase out Trick Room setters that threaten your team.</p>

<p>A specially defensive set consisting of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD Sassy nature can be used with a Sassy nature to help take on rain teams. With this EV spread, Hippowdon can survive a Rain boosted Surf without any recovery moves, and can survive two Surfs outside of rain from Kingdra. However, there is a small chance of being 2HKOed, so a Sitrus Berry or Passho Berry can be used to reliably survive. In addition, outside of rain, Hippowdon holding a Passho Berry can survive an assault of Hydro Pump followed by Surf.</p>

<p>Rindo Berry can be used to take Grass-type attacks, but Grass-type attacks are not common in VGC 2012. If you want to make absolutely sure that Hippowdon sets up Sandstorm, Iron Ball can be used. This will drop Hippowdonâ€™s Speed to a paltry 23, making it slower than all weather starters bar the virtually nonexistent Snover, along with most Trick Room sweepers.</p>

<p>Hippowdon's Dream World ability is Sand Force, which boosts its Ground-, Rock-, and Steel-type attacks by 30% in sandstorm. This will boost Hippowdon's Earthquake and Rock Slide, but another Pokemon will have to set up sandstorm for Hippowdon to abuse this ability. In addition, this removes Hippowdon's niche in the metagame as the slowest weather inducer. On the other hand, the lack of sandstorm may be a boon to some teams that need a physically bulky Pokemon but do not appreciate the introduction of the residual damage.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Powerful special attacks such as Hydro Pump and Grass Knot can take down Hippowdon. The majority of bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Gyarados, can shrug off Hippowdon's attacks and swiftly KO with their own STAB moves. In addition, burn hurts Hippowdon badly, depleting its health and limiting its damage output.</p>
