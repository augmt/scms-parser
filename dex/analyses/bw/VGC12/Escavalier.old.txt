[Overview]

<p>Escavalier's combination of bulky defenses, high Attack power, and low Speed make it an excellent Trick Room abuser. However, even with its massive Attack stat, Escavalier has a very small movepool, limiting its options for coverage moves. This doesn't mean Escavalier is without uses though; it actually fills a great niche in being able to OHKO one of the bulkiest Pokemon in the metagame: Cresselia. Escavalier also has a 4x weakness to Fire-type attacks, so Pokemon such as Volcarona and Chandelure can be problematic. However, this doesn't mean Escavalier isn't good at being an offensive Trick Room tank.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Megahorn is Escavalier's strongest move. An already strong attack boosted by STAB, it allows Escavalier to KO many threats, such as Ludicolo, Abomasnow, and Cresselia. Iron Head is Escavalier's second STAB to abuse. Even with terrible Steel typing, it still hits lots of common Pokemon hard with neutral or super effective coverage. Double-Edge gives Escavalier coverage to hit Pokemon such as Zapdos, and makes it easier to be put in Swarm range. Quick Guard is also an option, as it can protect teammates from annoying priority moves, such as Sucker Punch and Mach Punch. Protect is standard on any Pokemon being used in VGC, giving Escavalier the ability to stall and not collect damage for the turn, helping against serious threats to it such as Chandelure, Zapdos, and Volcarona, all of which can OHKO it with Fire-type moves.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Occa Berry can soften the blow of a single Fire-type move to help Escavalier last longer. Bug Gem can be used to let Megahorn hit amazingly hard against anything, especially if Swarm is in effect. Swarm is the best ability for Escavalier, as Shell Armor doesn't help all that much. A Brave nature optimizes Escavalier's Attack while decreasing its Speed for optimal Trick Room use. Maximum investment in HP helps Escavalier have all-around bulk to go with its nice 105 / 105 defensive stats, and full investment in Attack allows Escavalier to hit harder. Having a Speed IV of 0 ensures Escavalier will be as slow as possible for Trick Room use.</p>

<p>Pokemon that set up Trick Room are obviously great teammates, making Escavalier the fastest Pokemon on the field while Trick Room is active. Jellicent is a particularly good partner with great typing synergy and the ability to set Trick Room. Iron Ball Politoed is a good partner because it can set rain, making Fire-types less of a threat, and it can abuse Trick Room itself. Escavalier can use Quick Guard to stop Sucker Punch or other priority attacks from hurting Escavalier's partners. Rock Slide users, such as Terrakion and Rhyperior, can clear lots of the Pokemon that might threaten Escavalier, such as Zapdos and Chandelure.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Escavalier can use one of the vast majority of Normal-type moves it gets, such as Return and Headbutt, to deal neutral damage to those that don't resist Normal-type moves. Bug Gem used in tandem with the move X-Scissor can be used as a more reliable option over Megahorn, being able to hit just as hard and not miss as often, but only once. Knock Off can be used to get rid of the items on the opponent. Substitute is a cool move to use if Escavalier's given the opportunity to use it. With Escavalier's bulky defenses, Substitutes tend to be hard to break. Life Orb is a nice item for Escavalier to boost the power of its moves and hit harder.</p> 

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fire-types, such as Chandelure and Volcarona, run around Escavalier all day with resistances to both of its STABs and the ability to KO it with Heat Wave or Flamethrower. Steel-types, including Scizor and Excadrill, are hardly even damaged by both of Escavalier's STABs and can hit back for neutral damage with moves in their arsenal. Zapdos is by all means a counter to Escavalier, with its advantageous typing and access to Heat Wave. Pokemon that can cause burns generally mean trouble for Escavalier, as with a burn it's almost completely useless.</p>
