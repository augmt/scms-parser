[Overview]

<p>Pikachu: the hero of Pokemon, keeping the world safe from Team Rocket. Its base 90 Speed, as well as its other stats, all of which are below 55, aren't very appealing, as they make Pikachu very susceptible to being KOed by both priority moves and faster Pokemon, such as Garchomp. However, its signature item—Light Ball—gives Pikachu some much-needed attacking power, allowing it to nab some nifty KOs on weakened Pokemon. Even with the attacking power it receives, though, Pikachu still needs lots of team support to actually hurt the opposing team; therefore it enjoys team support from sleep inducers, Icy Wind spammers, and Tailwind users. Pikachu can wreck the opponent if played right, but make any mistake with it and you're done for.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Pikachu makes a subpar Fake Out user compared to others, but using Fake Out allows partners to use support moves such as Tailwind, Icy Wind, or Spore, making for an easier second turn. Thunderbolt is Pikachu's main STAB move, dealing plenty of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Thunder is a harder-hitting option to only be used on rain teams, as its horrid accuracy without rain isn't worth the extra power. Grass Knot is an excellent way for Pikachu to nail a wider variety of Pokemon for super effective damage, such as heavy Ground- and Rock-types; Rhyperior, Gastrodon, Tyranitar, and Terrakion are all noteworthy targets. Protect is useful for Pikachu; it allows it Pikachu to last longer in the battle, and lets teammates provide opportunities for Pikachu to shine and go on the offensive. However, Hidden Power Ice can give extra coverage, allowing Pikachu to hit Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus, and Dragonite extremely hard.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The purpose of the EVs is to allow Pikachu to hit as hard and fast as possible. Because of its poor defensive stats, using either a Rash or Naive nature instead of decreasing one of its offensive stats is recommended. A Naive nature is generally preferred, due to a need to outspeed threats such as neutral natured Landorus and Volcarona. Light Ball is Pikachu's item to use, giving it an excellent boost for its attacking stats. Lightningrod is the key ability and main reason why Pikachu can be so strong in this metagame, as it pairs well with Pokemon that can spam Discharge or priority Thunder Waves for instant boosts.</p>

<p>Support is absolutely a must for Pikachu if you wish for optimal results. Pokemon that can provide this support include sleep inducers, Icy Wind users, and Follow Me and Rage Powder users. Ideal Pokemon for this are Amoonguss, Cresselia, and Togekiss, all of which have different types of support. Togekiss can be especially useful for providing Tailwind; however, other users of Tailwind, such as Tornadus and Zapdos, can work just as well. Lightningrod not only gives Pikachu those much-needed boosts to its Special Attack, but also provides support to draw in deadly Electric-type attacks away from Pokemon that would otherwise take heavy damage, such as Gyarados and Jellicent.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Pikachu really doesn't have many other helpful options to use. Static can be used, possibly activating against opponents attempting to use Fake Out or other contact priority moves on it. Focus Sash can be another choice for an item, but losing its Light Ball would lead to a significant drop in attacking power. Support moves such as Rain Dance and Helping Hand can be used, but there are many other Pokemon that can pull off these support roles better. Substitute is a viable option over Protect, but Pikachu's Substitute takes little effort to break.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pikachu's paper-thin defenses make clear how easy it is to take care of it; nearly any strong STAB attack will OHKO Pikachu. Pikachu essentially fears anything that can outspeed it and hit it hard such as Garchomp and Infernape. Spread moves are also trouble for Pikachu, as they cannot be lured by Follow Me or Rage Powder users. If Pikachu lacks Hidden Power Ice, Pokemon that resist both Grass Knot and Thunderbolt, such as Haxorus and Latios, will take little damage and manage to retaliate and KO it. Relatively bulky Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Metagross also create issues for Pikachu, as they can easily tank one of Pikachu's attacks and KO it with one of their own STAB attacks.</p>
