[Overview]

<p>With well rounded stats and access to Intimidate, Arcanine can play both an offensive and a defensive role on a team. BW has been kind to Arcanine, providing it with Close Combat and Wild Charge, thus allowing it to have a respectable physical movepool. Although its typing provides Arcanine with a strong offense, its weaknesses to Rock- and Water-type moves can often leave it in a tight spot. Nevertheless, Arcanine is a Pokemon that can fit well on many teams, showing that this old dog still has a few tricks up its sleeve.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Flare Blitz is Arcanine's primary STAB move, dealing heavy damage to its foes. Close Combat provides good coverage in tandem with Flare Blitz, and allows Arcanine to strike hard against many Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves. Wild Charge can be used instead of Close Combat because it provides Arcanine with a better option against Water-type Pokemon. However, Wild Charge is weaker than Close Combat against most Pokemon. ExtremeSpeed provides Arcanine with a strong priority move. Because ExtremeSpeed has +2 Priority, it can allow Arcanine to pick off weakened Pokemon, even if they have Prankster as an ability. Protect rounds the moveset off, giving Arcanine a way to block incoming attacks for a turn.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs provided for the set maximize Arcanine's Speed and Attack, while holding a Life Orb further powers up Arcanine's offense. As Life Orb is a commonly used item for many Pokemon, Fire Gem or Fighting Gem can be good alternatives. The former makes Flare Blitz an incredibly powerful attack, allowing Arcanine to OHKO Ferrothorn through an Occa Berry regardless of its defensive EVs; the latter strengthens Close Combat, giving Arcanine a chance to KO Tyranitar through a Chople Berry.</p>

<p>An alternate EV spread of 196 HP / 252 Atk / 60 Spe gives Arcanine some extra survivability. 60 Speed EVs give Arcanine 123 Speed, allowing it to outspeed Modest Ludicolo outside of the rain. Crunch can be used as an alternative move over Close Combat or Wild Charge, allowing Arcanine to deal damage to Ghost-type Pokemon such as Chandelure and Jellicent.</p>

<p>Arcanine's Intimidate support reduces the threat of physical attackers, allowing more fragile sweepers such as Latios, Thundurus, and Choice Scarf Abomasnow to survive a wide variety of physical attacks. Aside from this, Arcanine pairs up well with other Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Hitmontop or Salamence, providing a double layer of attack drops to the opposing team. Gastrodon also makes a good partner for Arcanine. Intimidate allows Gastrodon to stay in play longer, as it prevents Arcanine from being targeted by Water-type moves. In turn, Arcanine can deal with Grass-type Pokemon that threaten Gastrodon with Flare Blitz.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Arcanine's other abilities, Flash Fire and Justified, can be used, though they aren't quite as useful as Intimidate. Flash Fire gives Arcanine immunity against Fire-type moves, thus allowing its team to better handle Fire-type Pokemon. Justified can allow Arcanine to boost its Attack when hit by Dark-type attacks and works well with an ally with Beat Up for a +4 Attack Boost. Arcanine's stats make it possible for it to utilize a Choice Scarf moveset, but it will often find that being locked into one move is undesirable. A White Herb can be given to Arcanine to allow it to be unfazed by an opponent's Intimidate or be used to counteract Close Combat's defense drops. Arcanine has a number of supportive options at its disposal, including Safeguard, Will-O-Wisp, and Helping Hand, which can allow it to play a support role. Utilizing a defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 100 Def / 156 SpD with a Careful nature allows Arcanine to withstand numerous attacks, including a Timid Latios's Dragon Gem-boosted Draco Meteor, while supporting the team with Helping Hand. Finally, it is possible to run a mixed set for Arcanine by utilizing Heat Wave on a moveset. Due to Arcanine's shallow special movepool, it's not recommended to try a full special attack moveset.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>As a Fire-type Pokemon, Arcanine's effectiveness is dampened by the presence of rain and Water-type Pokemon. While Wild Charge can help its case, a lot of the common Water-type Pokemon, such as Ludicolo, Kingdra and Gastrodon, have a secondary typing that is resistant or immune to Electric-type attacks. Aside from Water-type Pokemon, Dragon-type Pokemon, such as Latios and Garchomp, can take Arcanine on with relative ease, though Latios will need to watch out for ExtremeSpeed and the potential Crunch. Chandelure is immune to Arcanine's main offensive moves and only has to watch out for variants that run Crunch. Jellicent is in a similar position as Chandelure, though it isn't immune to Flare Blitz. It will also have to watch out for Wild Charge.</p>
