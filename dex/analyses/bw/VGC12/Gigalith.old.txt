[Overview]

<p>With a fantastic base 135 Attack stat, decent 85 / 130 / 70 defenses, and low base 25 Speed, Gigalith is an amazing Pokemon for Trick Room, one of the dominant strategies of the VGC metagame. Gigalith also has a great ability in Sturdy, acting as a free Focus Sash. However, Gigalith has a grand total of five weaknesses, three of them are some of the most used offensive types in VGC. Gigalith also has a shallow movepool, making it very predictable. Despite this, Gigalith is a Pokemon you should give serious consideration to when building a Trick Room team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is meant to emphasize Gigalith's best perk: its fantastic Attack stat. Rock Slide is a fantastic STAB, hitting both opponents, and it gets even more power with a Rock Gem. Earthquake is another great spread attack, hitting Steel-types such as Heatran super effectively. Explosion is for when Gigalith is done with its job, and it gets insanely powerful when boosted by a Normal Gem. Protect allows Gigalith to live an extra turn, and allows its partner to get rid of a threat or set up Trick Room.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>252 EVs are put in HP and Attack, and 4 in Defense, which are easily the best of Gigalith's stats. Sturdy is ideal to prolong Gigalith's role on the field to try and take out as many of the opponents Pokemon as possible. However, if Gigalith is being used on a sand abusing Trick Room team, Sand Force is a better ability to use. A Choice Band can possibly be used over Rock or Normal Gem, replacing Protect with Rock Blast, which hits through opponents who use Substitute, and beats one of the most common Trick Room counter: Imprison Chandelure.</p>

<p>Trick Room allies that are immune to Earthquake, such as Cresselia, Musharna, and Bronzong, pair up great with Gigalith. Ghost-type Trick Room partners, such as Dusclops and Jellicent, are also good to use, since they are immune to Gigalith's Explosion, and are almost guaranteed to set up Trick Room. Gastrodon is an effective partner, drawing Water-type attacks away from Gigalith except for Surf and Muddy Water, giving it one less thing to worry about. Pokemon that set up sand, namely Tyranitar and Hippowdon, form good synergy with Gigalith, seeing as it gets a Special Defense boost in the sand. However, when using any three of these Pokemon, they all share the same Grass-type weakness, both Gigalith and Tyranitar or Hippowdon share a Water-type weakness, and Gigalith and Tyranitar are extra-weak to Fighting, so one must watch out for this.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Unfortunately, Gigalith doesn't have much else to utilize outside of this set. Stone Edge is less accurate than Rock Slide, but is powerful enough to be considered over it, and Smack Down grounds Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate, allowing them to be hit by Earthquake. Gravity increases the accuracy of Rock Slide and an ally's moves, and also makes everyone on the field vulnerable to Earthquake. Curse makes Gigalith even more deadly in Trick Room, but setup moves are usually hard to utilize in the VGC metagame. Gigalith is capable of setting up Sandstorm in case the team lacks Tyranitar, and can be more successful at it than others due to Sturdy.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any Pokemon with a high Special Attack stat that can even hit Gigalith for neutral damage will cause it trouble, as outside of sand, Gigalith's Special Defense is lacking. Some of these Pokemon include Latios, Hydreigon, and others. Priority attacks such as Scizor's Bullet Punch and Azumarill's Aqua Jet give Gigalith trouble, hitting for super effective damage and instantly knocking it out once Sturdy is activated. Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Hitmontop and Gyarados, stop Gigalith from doing much damage, and if Trick Room isn't able to be set up due to Taunt or the Trick Room user is being KOd, Gigalith is just a sitting duck to all attacks. However, the opponent must still watch out for Explosion. Pokemon with Wide Guard such as Hitmontop stop all of Gigalith's attacks on the main set, severely crippling it, and a burn from Sableye's or Dusclops's Will-o-Wisp reduces Gigalith's Attack stat to near-useless levels. Ferrothorn is a fantastic counter, outpacing Gigalith in Trick Room, taking barely anything from its attacks, while hitting back hard with Power Whip. A great and easy way to get rid of Sturdy is Hail, and Abomasnow can easily finish the job with Giga Drain.</p>
