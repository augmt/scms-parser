[Overview]

<p>At first glance, Galvantula looks like a frail Bug-type. However, it gets two abilities that work well in VGC 2012. One of them is Unnerve, which makes the opponent's type resist Berries and status Berries useless; the other is Compoundeyes, which makes the accuracy of Thunder become a usable 91%. A great STAB combination of Bug and Electric lets Galvantula hit Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Latios with Bug Buzz, whereas other Electric-type Pokemon have to rely on Hidden Power Grass or Ice. However, that's just about all it gets; 70 / 60 / 60 defenses mean Galvantula is really frail, and base 97 Special Attack means its attacks aren't as powerful as one would think. To make matters worse, Galvantula's movepool is quite limited, necessitating the use of low Base Power moves, such as Energy Ball and Hidden Power, for coverage. While Galvantula can be a force to be reckoned with, don't expect it to take your opponents by storm.</p>

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>With its two STAB moves, Galvantula has nearly all the coverage it needs. Bug Buzz is great as it hits Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, Cresselia, and Tyranitar, as well as the Grass-type Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt, for super effective damage. Thunderbolt then hits Pokemon such as Politoed, Jellicent, and Gyarados for super effective damage. Hidden Power Ice hits Pokemon such as Gliscor and Landorus, which resist both its STABs, and as Unnerve takes care of their Yache Berries, Galvantula has a good chance to OHKO them. Protect is there to prevent unnecessary damage, and to let Galvantula avoid damage for a turn so its partner can take out a threat to it.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>A Timid nature allows Galvantula to Speed tie with the musketeer trio. Focus Sash lets Galvantula take a hit and attempt to KO back, which is especially useful against Tornadus, Latios, and Latias. Life Orb gives Galvantula a much needed power boost; however, it's incredibly frail, so a Focus Sash is usually the best item to use. Electric Gem also works well, giving Thunderbolt a chance to OHKO max specially defensive Politoed or Jellicent, as Unnerve nullifies their Wacan Berries. When using Unnerve, Thunderbolt must be used, as it will be much more accurate than Thunder.</p>

<p>The choice of ability is up to what the team needs to accomplish. Compoundeyes increases the accuracy of Thunder, and also allows Galvantula to hit Pokemon such as Sand Veil Garchomp more accurately. Unnerve enables Galvantula to beat the likes of Wacan Berry Gyarados and Politoed, as well as to possibly OHKO Yache Berry Garchomp and Landorus with Hidden Power Ice. It also provides team support, as Galvantula's allies can now beat Chople Berry Tyranitar and Rindo Berry Gastrodon.</p>

<p>Speaking of team support, Galvantula will appreciate a  teammate to take care of Terrakion. Cresselia works well, as it can give Helping Hand boosts, use Icy Wind or Thunder Wave to deal with the likes of Tornadus and Latios, and take care of Terrakion with Psychic. A Pokemon that can stop Trick Room, such as Imprison Chandelure, works well with Galvantula; Chandelure can also take Heat Wave from the opponent thanks to Flash Fire. However, note that both of these Pokemon are weak to Rock Slide. Finally, Galvantula really appreciates rain support, as it weakens Fire-type attacks, and also grants Galvantula an accurate Thunder even when using Unnerve.</p>

[Other Options] 

<p>Sadly, Galvantula has a shallow movepool, so there isn't much else it can pull off without it being outclassed. Electroweb and Thunder Wave allow Galvantula to support the rest of its team by lowering the foe's Speed stat; however, this is better done by a bulky Pokemon, such as Cresselia. Discharge could be utilized along with a Ground-type Pokemon to hit both targets, but Thunder has more power and the same paralysis rate, and can be used even if a Ground-type isn't on the field. Swarm can be used, however even if Galvantula can get low enough HP to collect the Swarm boost it doesn't provide any significant KOs.</p>

[Checks and Counters] 

<p>Terrakion 2HKOes Galvantula with Rock Slide (and OHKOes without Focus Sash). The same goes for Tyranitar, as it can take a Bug Buzz in sand and OHKO Galvantula with Rock Slide (even with Focus Sash, as the sand damage will finish the job). Zapdos and Volcarona can also take a Thunder, resist Bug Buzz, and OHKO with Heat Wave. Zapdos, however, must be wary of Hidden Power Ice. Trick Room is also a good way to deal with Galvantula, as its excellent Speed means it will probably be moving last. Additionally, Pokemon with Thunder Wave, such as Cresselia, can paralyze and cripple Galvantula. Lastly, Tornadus outspeeds Galvantula and can simply OHKO with Acrobatics. However, most faster Pokemon, such as Weavile and Latios, must be wary of Galvantula's coverage moves when switching in.</p>
