[Overview]

<p>While most Pokemon who possess the ability Swift Swim have higher Special Attack than Attack, Kabutops opposes this stereotype, possessing a higher Attack stat compared to its Special Attack stat. Thus, Kabutops is probably one of the best physical attackers who can take advantage of rain. Its Water and Rock typing gives Kabutops two fantastic offensive STABs, allowing it to be an effective attacker. Though frail by some standards and weak to common Fighting- and Grass-type moves, Kabutops is a force to be reckoned with that works well on any rain team. When the clouds open up and rain pours down, Kabutops is turned into a hard-hitting attacker with incredible Speed.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Waterfall provides a reliable STAB move, is boosted by rain, and has a chance to flinch, making it Kabutops's go-to move in almost any situation. Rock Slide takes advantage of Kabutops's other STAB, Rock, and hits the Pokemon who threaten Kabutops, such as Abomasnow and Zapdos, for super effective damage. Aqua Jet provides Kabutops a reliable STAB priority move, in the event that Kabutops is paralyzed or Trick Room is set up. While Kabutops's STABs give plenty of coverage, Low Kick may be used instead in order to hit weather setters, such as Tyranitar and Abomasnow, for super effective damage, as the loss of rain on the field is detrimental to Kabutops. Protect is always a useful move to have, shielding its user from damage for a turn and allowing Kabutops's partner to take out a threat gunning for it.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Due to Kabutops's frailty, Focus Sash is used so Kabutops can stomach any attack. In the event Focus Sash is unavailable due to Item Clause, a Life Orb may be used instead in order to boost Kabutops's attacks at the cost of some HP every attack. However, it may be the case that both of these items are already in use due to their usefulness; a Rock Gem can be utilized instead to provide one very powerful Rock Slide. Kabutops's ability, Swift Swim, doubles its Speed when rain is falling on the field, making it Kabutops's primary ability. An Adamant nature is used as Kabutops will outspeed virtually any pokemon in this metagame in rain; however, a Jolly nature may be used in order to outspeed opposing Kabutops.</p>

<p>Kabutops relies heavily on rain; thus a teammate who can set up rain is crucial to Kabutops's success. Politoed is probably Kabutops' best teammate in this regard; its ability Drizzle allows it to set up eternal rain by entering the field. Ludicolo is also a strong choice, possessing two abilities that take advantage of the rain; it can Fake Out threats to give Kabutops time to eliminate them, while Kabutops's Rock Slide destroys Flying-types who ruin Ludicolo's day. Cresselia makes for a good teammate, scaring off Fighting-types with its STAB Psychic, and providing support with  moves such as Helping Hand.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Superpower has a set Base Power of 120 unlike Low Kick, however, it also lowers both Kabutops's Attack and Defense stat upon use. X-Scissor can be used in order to hit Psychic-types especially hard, but otherwise grants no additional coverage. Swords Dance looks enticing, doubling Kabutops' Attack stat, but because battles are so short in this metagame, Kabutops is better off using each turn attacking. Aqua Tail has 10 more Base Power than Waterfall, though the lower accuracy and loss of a flinch chance makes this option unattractive. Kabutops could viably run Rain Dance to set rain up for itself, in the event Tyranitar or Abomasnow switches in to change the weather. Finally, Aerial Ace grants Kabutops the ability to hit Grass-types such as Breloom and Amoonguss for super effective damage.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Grass-types have an inherent advantage over Kabutops, resisting its main STAB and utilizing their own STAB moves to hit for 4x damage. Abomasnow not only slows Kabutops down by changing the weather, but threatens Kabutops with a super effective Grass Knot or Giga Drain. Zapdos can take a Rock Slide and retaliate with its own STAB Electric move of choice, which Kabutops is unable to handle. Strong Fighting-types such as Toxicroak and Hitmontop deal with Kabutops well, dishing out pain with their super effective STAB moves. Hitmontop is also able to use its ability, Intimidate, to lower Kabutops's Attack stat and weaken it until Kabutops switches out.</p>
