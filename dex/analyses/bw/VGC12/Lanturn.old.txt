[Overview]

<p>At first glance, Lanturn appears to be outclassed by Rotom-W, who is faster, stronger, and slightly bulkier than Lanturn; however, it has a few tricks up its sleeve that allow it to carve a niche for itself in the metagame. In particular, Lanturn has access to Blizzard and Surf, moves that Rotom-W can only dream of having. In addition, it has two good abilities in Water Absorb and Volt Absorb. These qualities make Lanturn a fantastic counter to both hail and rain teams, a nearly unique quality.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set combines all of Lanturn's best qualities to create a set that can defeat most rain and hail teams. Against the former, Lanturn walls all common rain sweepers bar Ludicolo, while against the latter, Lanturn resists Blizzard and is only threatened by Abomasnow. Thunder gains perfect accuracy in rain, and hits Politoed and rain sweepers, such as Kabutops and Kingdra, hard. It is also Lanturn's most powerful STAB attack. Surf sets Lanturn apart from Rotom-W, being an accurate STAB move that hits both opponents. However, be aware that Surf will hit Lanturn's partner as well, so either use Protect or partner Lanturn with a Pokemon that resists, is immune to, or benefits from Water-type moves. Blizzard is a move that hits both opponents, and also hits Pokemon found on hail teams hard. However, since most hail teams have Pokemon that resist Blizzard, such as Ice- or Water-types, Thunder Wave can be used instead to cripple sweepers on all teams. Protect is standard on many Pokemon in the metagame, as it can scout, avoid a partner's attack, and avoid damage from Fake Out.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs maximize Lanturn's Special Attack and HP. A Modest nature is used to give Lanturn more power, as its Special Attack is average at best. Water Absorb lets Lanturn wall rain teams, but Volt Absorb can be used if your team uses Discharge. Hydro Pump is an option over Surf if Lanturn's partner does not want to be taking damage, although Surf differentiates Lanturn from Rotom-W and is a more useful move overall.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, Lanturn needs Ludicolo and Abomasnow removed in order to do its job properly. Both of these Pokemon are weak to Bug-type moves, so Scizor is a fantastic partner for Lanturn. It can use its STAB Bug Bite to easily dispose of Grass-types, and also appreciates Lanturn's paralysis support. Speaking of paralysis, slow Pokemon greatly enjoy the Speed drops caused by it. Metagross is one example&mdash;it can even take out Abomasnow for Lanturn. An Abomasnow of your own can be helpful, as it allows Lanturn to use Blizzard reliably. It even resists Surf, allowing Lanturn to use the move more often.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Aside from the listed options, Lanturn has a few other things in its arsenal. Confuse Ray, when combined with Thunder Wave, has a very good chance of preventing an opponent from attacking. However, the opponent can simply switch or double target Lanturn's partner, as Lanturn does not pose much of an offensive presence. Scald can burn opponents and hits harder than Surf, which hits both opponents, but Hydro Pump is usually better. Volt Switch is a nifty move to scout the opponent's switches. Heal Bell can cure Lanturn's team of status, but Lanturn will be hard-pressed to find a turn to use it. Icy Wind slows down both foes, although Thunder Wave serves a similar purpose. Signal Beam hits Ludicolo and Abomasnow super effectively, while Hidden Power Fire hits Abomasnow even harder. Lastly, Shuca Berry or Air Balloon can be used to alleviate Lanturn's Ground-type weakness, but Rindo Berry is usually better due to Ground-type moves being rare on rain and hail teams.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Earthquake users will destroy Lanturn, unless it is carrying Shuca Berry or Air Balloon. Tyranitar and Ninetales change the weather from Lanturn's preferred rain or hail, and can put the hurt on it with Rock Slide or SolarBeam respectively. Grass-type moves, especially after Rindo Berry has been consumed, will do a large amount of damage to Lanturn. Ferrothorn completely walls Lanturn aside from a stray Hidden Power Fire, and can retaliate with a powerful Power Whip. Gastrodon also walls Lanturn, and can hit it super effectively with a STAB Earth Power. In general, Lanturn's mediocre stats make it fairly useless against teams that are neither rain nor hail.</p>
