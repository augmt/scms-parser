[Overview]

<p>You might be wondering why anyone in their right mind would use Flygon in a metagame where Garchomp, Latios, Latias, and Salamence roam freely. With the exact same typing as Garchomp, it would make even more sense that Flygon should never be used. However, being the only Dragon-type that resists common spread moves such as Earthquake, Rock Slide, Discharge, and Heat Wave gives it a niche among the other Dragon-types. Although Flygon is still somewhat doomed to inferiority, it is usable thanks to its decent base stats and unique moves.</p>

[SET]

move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Tailwind
move 4: Protect
item: Yache Berry
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is what gives Flygon a bit of originality. Dragon Claw and Earthquake as Flygon's two main STAB moves might leave much to be desired when Garchomp is an option in the tier with its much higher Attack, but Flygon can still make great use of them, hitting a wide range of threats pretty hard. However, Tailwind really gives Flygon an edge over Garchomp. With its base 100 Speed, Flygon is able to outspeed some of the most common threats and set up Tailwind to support its teammates. Unfortunately, its general frailty with base 80 HP and average defenses leaves Flygon easy to wear down. Protect is used to avoid damage for a turn, and can be used to scout for potentially dangerous moves.</p>

<p>Don't get your hopes up though; Flygon is, unfortunately, sorely outclassed in almost everything it does. There are various superior Dragon-type Pokemon in the tier: Salamence also has access to Tailwind, and has better offensive stats to compliment it. Garchomp hits harder and faster with the STAB moves it shares with Flygon, and is also much bulkier to tank more hits. If Garchomp and Salamence had a really unfortunate lovechild, it would be Flygon. With no new toys to play with this generation, Flygon really has gotten the short end of the stick when compared to other physical Dragon-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Flygon isn't all that bad though, as it does benefit from receiving some of the best features of both dominating physical Dragon-types. Levitate is really a blessing for Flygon, as it gives a niche for being immune to Earthquake, something Garchomp lacks. Additionally, it gains the edge over Salamence by resisting Discharge and Rock Slide.</p>

<p>Base 100 Attack isn't something to overlook either. Although it seems like it would be hitting everything for lots of damage, its attacking power falls short of OHKOs, even against common threats. With the reduction in power from spread moves hitting two or more Pokemon, Flygon's Earthquake is weakened even more to the point where most Pokemon can shrug it off with ease and hit back hard.</p>

<ul class="damage_calculation">
<li>Earthquake vs. 252/0 Ninetales 74.4% - 90%</li>
<li>Dragon Claw vs. 4/0 Latios 88.5% - 105.1%</li>
<li>Earthquake vs. 252/0 Metagross 46% - 55.6%</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the lack of heavy hitting, Flygon appreciates teammates that can hit much harder than it. Flygon's Tailwinds aid many hard hitting Pokemon, so all Flygon really has to do is finish the job by picking off the remains after its partners have razed the opposition. Flygon also enjoys Helping Hand support, which boosts its damage output to an acceptable level.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Flygon also has access to Feint, which can break through the opposing Pokemon's Protect and mess up your opponent's strategy. This requires some prediction and timing to pull off though, which can be risky, especially with Flygon. Outrage can be used instead of Dragon Claw, but because it hits a random opponent, it isn't always efficient. Flygon can be given a Choice Scarf and run a more offensive set, but it doesn't hit hard enough for this to be a great option either.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Almost any Ice-type can destroy Flygon decently. Weavile and Mamoswine both hit hard with their STAB Ice-type moves which are often boosted by Ice Gem, making them extremely dangerous, even when Flygon packs Yache Berry. Abomasnow also hits very hard with Blizzard and does not take much damage from any of Flygon's attacks. Flygon's frailty also makes it prone to being worn down by other attacks, including the common Surf, and even moves it resists.</p>
