[Overview] 

<p>Glaceon has always been an underrated Pokemon, mainly because of its poor HP, average Speed, and predictable movepool. However, with manageable defensive stats and a superb 130 Special Attack Stat, Glaceon is a force to be reckoned with. Even its ability, Snow Cloak, makes it difficult to hit Glaceon. When utilized properly, Glaceon can plow through unprepared teams. The raw power of Blizzard is incredible, especially in a metagame where some of the most common Pokemon are weak to Ice. Overall, Glaceon is an excellent addition to any VGC team that abuses Hail.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Glaceon suffers from having a limited movepool; however, it can cause massive damage with the moves it does have. Blizzard is Glaceon's main move; with such raw power, it can easily take out common Pokemon such as Garchomp, Zapdos, Latios, Tornadus, and Thundurus. However, many other Pokemon resist Glaceon's Blizzard, such as Chandelure, Metagross, and Scizor. The rest of Glaceon's movepool is to target these specific Pokemon. Shadow Ball is used to hit Ghost types that resist Blizzard, such as Chandelure and Jellicent. Fake Tears and Hidden Power Ground should be considered, depending on the rest of your team. Fake Tears may seem like a poor suggestion, but in a 1 vs 1 stall war against Pokemon such as Cresselia and Suicune—who can constantly heal damage by using Rest, it gives a significant advantage. It can also be used to get some surprise KOs with its partner; lower an opponent's Special Defense with Fake Tears, and OHKO it with a strong special attack. Hidden Power Ground is an alternative in order to gain more coverage—with Hidden Power Ground, Glaceon can hit Pokemon that otherwise wall it, such as Heatran and Metagross. Protect is a given on Glaceon in order for it to survive as long as possible.</p>

<p>Glaceon runs max HP and 248 Special Attack EVs to give it both stability and strength. Should Glaceon run Hidden Power Ground, 248 and 252 Special Attack EVs serve the same purpose, so the remaining EVs can be placed into Special Defense. Glaceon's bulk allows it to take Heat Wave and Rock Slide andhas enough firepower to KO Pokemon back. For example, Adamant 4/0 Garchomp with Yache Berry is always OHKOed by Blizzard after hail damage. Iron Ball is used in order to outspeed Pokemon under Trick Room that would normally be slower than Glaceon. Snow Cloak makes it much harder for moves with 90 accuracy to hit, and helps Glaceon survive longer.</p>

<p>In order to spam Blizzard, it must be used in hail for maximum effect, due to its otherwise-shaky accuracy. Therefore, it is best paired with Abomasnow who can easily set up hail. However, you must be wary as both Glaceon and Abomasnow share weaknesses to Fire-, Rock-, and Fighting-type attacks. In order to utilize Glaceon, it must be sent out when you have the weather under control. Should your opponent have a weather-changing Pokemon, such as Politoed, Tyranitar, or Ninetales, you must prioritize to KO them first. Glaceon also wants to be put on a team that can easily set up Trick Room for it to sweep. Bulky Pokemon that can easily set up Trick Room include Jellicent, Reuniclus, and Cofagrigius. Be sure to utilize the 4 turns of Trick Room efficiently, because Glaceon cannot survive more than 2 or 3 attacks.</p>

<p>Similar to the Trick Room set, Glaceon aims to spam Blizzard to maximize its damage output. Utilizing a Choice Scarf, Glaceon can outrun more threats, such as Garchomp and Zapdos, and its mediocre Speed isn't such a problem. Its other moves are very situational, and should only be used if Blizzard runs out of PP, or a specific threat needs to be removed. Shadow Ball is used to help against any Ghost-types, Hidden Power Ground has the ability to hit Steel-types that otherwise wall Glaceon, and Signal Beam can be used against Ludicolo.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Maximum Speed and 248 Special Attack EVs ensure Glaceon is as fast as possible, while dishing out a heap of damage. Because it runs Hidden Power Ground, there is no difference between 248 and 252 Special Attack EVs. The remaining EVs can be placed into HP, giving it an extra point. Blizzard is the only move it should be using, but the other moves might come in handy in specific situations.</p>

<p>Glaceon works very well alongside Infernape and Terrakion—Infernape can take out Pokemon that are resistant to Blizzard, and it can deal with Pokemon that give hail teams trouble, such as Tyranitar. Infernape and Glaceon also provide incredible coverage, and Infernape easily KOes Pokemon that give Glaceon trouble, such as Scizor, Tyranitar, and Heatran. Along with Fake Out support, it allows Glaceon to dish out constant Blizzard, while protecting it from dangerous attacks. Terrakion plays a similar role to Infernape; with a higher Attack stat, it can hit Rock- and Fire-types, such as Chandelure, Volcarona, and Tyranitar.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Although Glaceon has incredible power, it is very straightforward and predictable because of its limited movepool; however, when used correctly, it can easily destroy teams that do not have a counter. Ice Beam can be considered if you want a STAB attack when hail is not up. Although Glaceon is not a physical attacker, Ice Shard can be used to finish off weakened Pokemon. If your team is Tyranitar weak, Hidden Power Fighting may be considered for a 2HKO. Ice Body, Glaceon's Dream World ability, is an alternative for those who prefer healing, though Snow Cloak is superior in most cases, as Glaceon prefers the evasion boost. Focus Sash and Ice Gem are other items that can be used. Focus Sash allows Glaceon to survive a super effective attack, such as Overheat, and Ice Gem allows Glaceon to fire off one very destructive Blizzard.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Generally, Fire-types, such as Chandelure and Infernape, cause problems for Glaceon. Steel-types that resist Blizzard, such as Metagross, Heatran, and Scizor are also a nuisance. Tyranitar, Politoed, and Ninetales can all change the weather and reduce Blizzard's accuracy, making Glaceon much less effective. Himontop can smack Glaceon with its STAB moves, and support its teammates with Wide Guard, which shuts down Blizzard for a turn.</p>
