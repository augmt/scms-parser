[Overview]

<p>Though it faces stiff competition from all the Water-type Pokemon in VGC 2012, Suicune fills the role of a bulky team supporter well. Thanks to its great defenses, decent Speed and Special Attack, and pure Water typing with only two weaknesses, Suicune is rather difficult to KO. Combined with Suicune's wide arsenal of moves, which include Tailwind and Icy Wind, Suicune's value is easily apparent. However, like all Pokemon, Suicune has its flaws. Its average Special Attack makes it easy to wall, and the popularity of Pokemon such as Zapdos limit its success. Nevertheless, Suicune's great bulk and supportive capabilities make it a fine Pokemon to consider on any team.</p>

[SET]
name: Tailwind
move 1: Tailwind
move 2: Scald / Hydro Pump
move 3: Ice Beam 
move 4: Protect / Calm Mind 
item: Wacan Berry / Life Orb / Sitrus Berry
nature: Modest
evs: 116 HP / 252 SpA / 140 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With above-average bulk and a great typing, Suicune can use a Tailwind set to great effect. After Tailwind is set up, Suicune has no problem outpacing faster Pokemon such as Terrakion and Infernape. The choice of Water-type STAB is down to personal preference: Scald gives Suicune a 100% accurate move with a decent burn rate, while a Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump can OHKO Tyranitar in neutral weather, though its accuracy is shaky and its PP is low. Ice Beam lets Suicune hit Pokemon such as Garchomp, Dragonite, and Latios for super effective damage, and also dents Zapdos and Thundurus. Calm Mind is a nice option that allows Suicune to use its great bulk to its advantage, making it even harder to KO. Protect is also a viable option, shielding Suicune from damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The item choice depends on what Suicune needs to accomplish most. With a Wacan Berry, Zapdos's Thunder will never KO Suicune, enabling it to set up Tailwind or hit Zapdos with Ice Beam. Life Orb is also a viable option as the power boost lets Suicune hit harder; with a Life Orb equipped, Ice Beam can 2HKO 140/0 Zapdos. Sitrus Berry, once activated, restores a nice amount of health, and can provide a Suicune a crucial extra turn in the fight. In Tailwind, the above EV spread allows Suicune to outpace Modest Ludicolo in the rain, as well as Choice Scarf Terrakion. Maximum Special Attack enables Suicune to hold its own offensively once Tailwind is set up; the remaining EVs are placed in HP to increase Suicune's survivability.</p>

<p>Terrakion and Tyranitar make good teammates, as they deal heavy damage to Zapdos and most other Electric-types that threaten to 2HKO Suicune. Abomasnow can cancel opposing weather by summoning hail via Snow Warning, and can dispatch Thundurus and Zapdos with a STAB Blizzard.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Scald / Hydro Pump
move 3: Icy Wind 
move 4: Rest
item: Chesto Berry
nature: Bold 
evs: 252 HP / 140 Def / 116 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Suicune's superb bulk and excellent defensive typing makes it one of the few viable Pokemon in VGC 2012 that can use a ChestoRest set. It is also one of the better Calm Mind users because of its good bulk, decent Speed and Special Attack stats, and great offensive STAB. This set aims to set up a few Calm Mind boosts, support the team by utilizing Icy Wind, and using Rest to recover any damage taken. The choice of Water-type STAB is, again, a personal preference. Scald grants consistent damage and a decent chance to burn the opponent, but Hydro Pump can rip through teams after Suicune gets enough Calm Mind boosts. Only a critical hit can bring Suicune down if it has the opportunity to set up.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread given allows Suicune to outpace 252+ Thundurus after an Icy Wind, while also maximizing its massive bulk. Sleep Talk can be used over Icy Wind to let Suicune continue attacking while asleep, but Rest + Chesto Berry is usually sufficient. In addition, note that mono-attacking Suicune is vulnerable to Storm Drain and Water Absorb users, so a Grass-type Pokemon such as Ludicolo or Amoonguss works well in checking these Pokemon. Finally, Pressure helps Suicune by stalling out low PP moves, such as Draco Meteor.</p>

<p>Hitmontop is an excellent partner, as Intimidate and Fake Out help Suicune set up Calm Minds. A Rage Powder or Follow Me partner is also very viable because it gives Suicune more turns to set up as well. With Zapdos and Thundurus being extremely common, Pokemon such as Abomasnow and Tyranitar also make great partners, as they can dispatch these threats. Pokemon such as Garchomp and Rotom who can outpace most Pokemon after an Icy Wind from Suicune can opt to go with bulkier spreads, as Icy Wind reduces the need for them to invest as much in Speed. Finally, Pokemon with Psych Up can take advantage of all the Calm Mind boosts Suicune accumulates, letting them hit extremely hard in addition to making them ridiculously bulky.</p>

[SET]
name: Crowncune
move 1: Sheer Cold
move 2: Rest
move 3: Sleep Talk
move 4: Scald 
item: Leftovers / Wacan Berry
nature: Relaxed 
evs: 252 HP / 196 Def / 60 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>At first glance, this looks like a gimmicky set; however, it is really effective when played correctly. The tremendous bulk of this set complements Suicune's excellent defensive typing, making it one of the few viable users of OHKO moves. With Rest and Sleep Talk, Suicune becomes incredibly hard to take down, as it has enough bulk to shrug off damage, in addition to plenty of chances to get lucky with Sheer Cold. Pokemon Suicune cannot normally deal with, such as Ludicolo, Ferrothorn, and Chansey, now have a 30% chance to be OHKOed. Scald rounds off the set, dealing consistent damage and possessing a good burn chance.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread gives good overall bulk; specifically, Suicune only takes about 40% from a Jolly Terrakion's Close Combat, and has a chance to survive the 2HKO from 252+ Zapdos's Discharge after Leftovers.</p>

<p>As with the previous set, Terrakion and Tyranitar make good teammates, as they can deal heavy damage to Zapdos and Thundurus, both of whom threaten to 2HKO Suicune.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Sheer Cold Suicune is an event from the fourth generation games, and it is therefore hard to obtain one with flawless IVs. For this reason, Icy Wind or Ice Beam is a decent alternative, as it retains coverage against Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Suicune doesn't get many viable options that have not been listed. ExtremeSpeed can be useful for picking off weakened Pokemon, but this is very situational, and Suicune can't afford to waste a moveslot. With maximum HP investment, Mirror Coat can KO Pokemon such as Zapdos and Thundurus. However, it is very unreliable, as Suicune needs to be attacked on the special side for it to work. If you're running hail, Blizzard gives Suicune a powerful spread move that complements its Water typing, but with all the other weather changers in VGC 2012, it's best to use the more reliable Ice Beam. Quash is an interesting move, but Suicune's average Speed means that it isn't the best user of this strategy. Roar can phaze out Pokemon trying to boost or set up Trick Room, but the former are uncommon in doubles. Finally, Reflect is a great support move.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>As Suicune is very versatile and bulky, one must be careful when trying to counter it. There are a few Pokemon that easily check it: bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Abomasnow, Ludicolo, and Ferrothorn can take any attack Suicune can use, and hit it hard with their Grass STAB or use Leech Seed to pressure Suicune into switching out. As with most other Water Absorb and Storm Drain Pokemon, Gastrodon is immune to Scald, and has no problem sponging an Icy Wind. However, note that most of these Pokemon can't harm Suicune once it starts to set up Calm Mind boosts. Zapdos, Blissey and Chansey can take any attack Suicune can use and proceed to use Toxic, making Suicune easier to KO. However, the Crowncune and Calm Mind variants can both use Rest to remove Toxic, and then use Sheer Cold or set up, respectively. Pokemon such as Sableye can use priority Taunt, preventing Suicune from using Calm Mind or any of its supporting moves.</p>

<p>Offensively, Thundurus, and other Electric-type Pokemon all threaten to 2HKO Suicune. Ninetales is a thorn in Suicune's side, as Drought activates Chlorophyll, enabling Pokemon such as Venusaur and Sawsbuck to outpace and can 2HKO Suicune; sunlight also weakens Suicune's Water STAB.  Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Rotom-W and Metagross, can use Trick to give Suicune a Choice Scarf, which renders it almost useless for the remainder of the battle.</p>
