[Overview]

<p>Ludicolo has always been a staple on any rain team because of its unique typing and wide variety of moves. Upon first inspection, Ludicolo's stats seem average. Its defenses are sub-par and its Special Attack is just a meager base 90. However, Ludicolo's ordinary Speed turns lightning-fast in the rain because of Swift Swim, allowing it to outspeed almost everything in the VGC 2012 metagame. This dancing duck is certainly an excellent addition to any rain team.</p>

move 2: Hydro Pump / Surf / Scald

move 4: Ice Beam / Protect
item: Absorb Bulb / Life Orb
ability: Swift Swim
nature: Modest
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is fairly straightforward but also incredibly effective. Fake Out allows Ludicolo to put pressure on the opponent and assists its partner. When holding an Absorb Bulb, Fake Out Ludicolo works especially well with a partner that knows Surf, as this immediately boosts Ludicolo's Special Attack. Hydro Pump, Surf, and Scald are all strong offensive options that have different uses. A rain boosted Hydro Pump does a massive amount of damage, OHKOing almost everything that does not resist it. However, if you dislike Hydro Pump's risky accuracy, Scald is a weaker alternative. Surf pairs well with Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Parasect, benefitting your team while dealing large amounts of damage to both of your opponent's Pokemon. Giga Drain is its most reliable Grass-type STAB attack, and also deals massive damage to Rotom-W and Gastrodon. Ice Beam hits Dragon-type Pokemon that otherwise wall Ludicolo for super effective damage. However, Protect may be used to allow Ludicolo to survive as long as possible.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Absorb Bulb takes advantage of Ludicolo's resistance to Water-type moves, and gives it the boost it needs to OHKO several common Pokemon such as Zapdos and Metagross. However, Life Orb can also be used as an alternative as it does not need to be set up. The EV spread given lets Ludicolo outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Terrakion and Jolly Choice Scarf Garchomp in rain. However, an alternative spread of 172 HP / 252 SpA / 84 Spe can be used for more bulk, while maintaining the ability to outspeed all base 130 Pokemon.</p>

<p>As this Ludicolo is designed for use on a rain team, it works best alongside other Pokemon that perform well in rain. For example, it partners very well with Politoed; Politoed sets up rain for Ludicolo, and can activate Ludicolo's Absorb Bulb with Surf. Other Pokemon Ludicolo works well with include Toxicroak, Kingdra, and Thundurus. Toxicroak takes care of Tyranitar and Abomasnow, both of whom give Ludicolo trouble when rain is not up. Kingdra can also use Surf to activate Ludicolo's Absorb Bulb and dish out huge amounts of damage with Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse. Thundurus takes care of Ludicolo's weakness to Flying-types, easily KOing threats such as Tornadus.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulky
move 1: Leech Seed
move 2: Substitute / Icy Wind
move 3: Giga Drain
move 4: Protect
item: Leftovers / Sitrus Berry
ability: Rain Dish
nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Ludicolo aims to annoy your opponent by Leech Seeding everything while setting up Substitutes. With Leech Seed, Rain Dish, and Leftovers, Ludicolo heals a great amount of HP every turn. Leech Seed is made even better in doubles by the fact that Ludicolo can use it on both of the enemy Pokemon. Icy Wind deals super effective damage to Grass-type Pokemon that are immune to Leech Seed, and slows down threats for Ludicolo's partner as well. However, Substitute allows Ludicolo to stall while healing every turn, which can result in a win with the time limit in effect. Giga Drain enables Ludicolo to recover even more HP, while Protect is crucial in allowing Ludicolo to survive for as long as possible while gaining health every turn.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Leftovers allows Ludicolo to heal a consistent 1/16 of its HP every turn, but Sitrus Berry heals 1/4 in one sitting. Rain Dish lets Ludicolo regain more health every turn, but Swift Swim can also be considered in order to make Ludicolo's Substitute go before virtually anything else. If your opponent does not have any way to take care of Ludicolo, such as hitting it with super effective moves, it can easily stall their team out. However, the timer pushes you to essentially a 15 turn clock, meaning you must use Ludicolo well to pull out a victory because of time.</p>

<p>Although Ludicolo is generally designed for a rain team, this specific variant can actually be used to counter one as well. It takes advantage of the rain and is able to hit just about everything with Giga Drain, while Leech Seed, Leftovers, and Rain Dish make it almost impossible to KO without a super effective hit. It can also work well with other bulky Pokemon, such as Cresselia, which can hit opposing threats with Icy Wind, making them slower than Ludicolo. Last but not least, Ludicolo also fits perfectly into a rain team, offering a bulkier alternative rather than an offensive set.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Grass Knot is often more powerful than Giga Drain, but one key target, Rotom-W, gets hit by Grass Knot for 20 Base Power, so it essentially walls Ludicolo if Ludicolo's only Grass-type move is Grass Knot. Politoed is also only hit for 60 Base Power compared to Giga Drain's 75. Water Gem can be used to boost Ludicolo's more powerful STAB moves, and Ice Gem can be used to surprise Dragon-type Pokemon, OHKOing them even with a Yache Berry.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>When rain is up and Ludicolo has either an Absorb Bulb boost or a Life Orb, it can surprisingly OHKO almost anything that does not resist its attacks. The biggest problem for Ludicolo is if there is no rain, because its Speed will be cut and it can easily be KOed before getting a chance to strike back. Similarly, Ludicolo also suffers greatly should it get paralyzed. As Ludicolo has a major weakness to Flying-type moves, common users of said attacks, such as Scizor, Tornadus, and Crobat, will all be able to OHKO it, provided they are not KOed first. Latios and Latias can also cause Ludicolo problems if it does not run Ice Beam, as they resist both of its STAB attacks. In general, Ludicolo is not a very bulky Pokemon and its poor defenses do not allow it to take hits very well, so powerful STAB attacks such as Thunder, Close Combat, and Draco Meteor can easily KO it. </p>
