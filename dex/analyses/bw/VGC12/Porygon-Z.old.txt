[Overview]

<p>Porygon-Z might actually seem outclassed this generation by its previous evolution, Porygon2, because of the introduction of Eviolite. However, Porygon-Z provides a niche that Porygon2 cannot. This niche is Porygon-Z's high Special Attack for strong offensive capabilities. Although Porygon-Z lacks the bulk to stay around for a while, it can hit like a truck with its massive base 135 Special Attack. Because players often underestimate Porygon-Z, it is a great choice if you are looking to catch the opponent off-guard and punch holes in their team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set capitalizes on Porygon-Z's great Special Attack. With this moveset, Porygon-Z hits nearly everything in VGC'12 for huge damage, with only a few notable exceptions such as Ferrothorn and other Steel-types. Normal Gem- and Adaptability-boosted Hyper Beam hits even the bulkiest of foes for incredible damage. Tri Attack is another option, if Hyper Beam's recharge turn is unappealing, although Porygon-Z will then miss out on a large number of OHKOs. Dark Pulse is a great move for Porygon-Z, as it gives coverage not only on the common Psychic-types such as Cresselia, but also on the Ghost-types such as Chandelure that switch in to absorb Porygon-Z's Normal-type attack. Ice Beam hits common Flying-type Pokemon such as Thundurus and Zapdos super effectively. Protect is an important move, as it gives Porygon-Z a turn to avoid damage either from your own spread move such as Earthquake, Discharge, or Surf, or from the opposing Pokemon.</p>

<p>This set uses Porygon-Z's offensive capabilities to the max. All the moves deal hefty damage to the opposition, and this can make it a dangerous playing field for your opponent. However, Porygon-Z often falls short of OHKOs, which means it can be revenge killed without much difficulty.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Download can work on this set as well, potentially giving Porygon-Z a boost in its Special Attack, which can be crucial to the match. Although it is less reliable, it can be interesting to try out and watch how it wreaks havoc on the best of the special walls. </p>

<p>Porygon-Z isn't the fastest either, so it definitely appreciates Tailwind support. Good partners for setting that up are Togekiss and Tornadus, which can beat Fighting-type Pokemon that threaten Porygon-Z as well as set up Tailwind extremely well. In addition, Pokemon with Helping Hand are very useful to Porygon-Z. Dusclops and Togekiss are both notable users of the move, among other Pokemon. Porygon-Z's bulk is also lacking, so users of Reflect and Light Screen are appreciated, most notably Cresselia.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Hyper Beam / Tri Attack
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Hidden Power Fire
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Adaptability 
nature: Timid / Modest
evs: 12 HP / 248 SpA / 248 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set makes Porygon-Z quite threatening. Putting a Choice Scarf on it will give it the edge in Speed against many threats. With Choice Scarf bringing Porygon-Z up to a 234 Speed stat, it is guaranteed to launch a powerful Hyper Beam off at nearly any foe. Dark Pulse allows Porygon-Z to hit common Trick Room Ghost-types such as Dusclops and Chandelure. Ice Beam hits Flying-types and Dragon-types that threaten Porygon-Z, and Hidden Power Fire is for the Steel-types that the set misses out on.</p>

<p>Choice Scarf makes up for Porygon-Z's slightly lacking Speed; however, being locked into one move is dangerous. Steel-types can take advantage of Porygon-Z's uselessness when it is locked into Ice Beam, and Pokemon such as Terrakion with Justified can take advantage of choice-locked Dark Pulse. Although the Speed boost is nice, it requires some good prediction and playing to be used to its full potential. Hyper Beam is necessary in order to OHKO Latios and Yache Berry Garchomp.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Adaptability is crucial for this set, because the boost for Hyper Beam is very important. With its high power offense, a Choice Scarf gives Porygon-Z just what it needs; a reliable boost in Speed. Helping Hand support is still always welcome, because with the lack of Normal Gem Porygon-Z's Hyper Beam still falls short of KOing many Pokemon. Porygon-Z also appreciates Light Screen and Reflect; however, it is less necessary as this Porygon-Z won't be sticking around for very long. Choice Scarf Porygon-Z outspeeds even positive-natured base 130 Pokemon, which can catch opponents off-guard.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Porygon-Z can also make use of Thunderbolt to hit Flying-types, although it misses out on super effective coverage against Zapdos and Thundurus. Another move option is Shadow Ball, which not only has similar coverage to Dark Pulse but also has a chance for a Special Defense drop. Porygon-Z can also make use of Magic Coat to prevent moves such as Spore or Thunder Wave from hitting it, although this requires some prediction and isn't always recommended. Analytic is another option and can be used with a slower Porygon-Z set with no Speed investment in order to utilize its 30% boost; however, due to its lack of bulk, Porygon-Z wants to be one of the first to attack and hit hard, so Analytic may not be the best option. Hidden Power Fire can also be of use for hitting Steel-types that ordinarily wall Porygon-Z. Choice Specs Hidden Power Fire will OHKO specially defensive Ferrothorn, which can make it quite useful. Hidden Power Water can also be used for hitting Terrakion if Porygon-Z is being used on a rain team.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Porygon-Z has a few counters and many checks. Steel-types are able to counter it fairly well, such as Ferrothorn and Metagross. Other specially bulky Pokemon also do a fairly good job, as they can set up on Porygon-Z while it only does small bits of damage to them. Most of its checks are simply Pokemon that live its hits and are able to hit hard back, which aren't too uncommon in the VGC 2012 metagame.</p>
