[Overview] 

<p>Many people don't even consider Beheeyem for their team, as other Pokemon, such as Chandelure, Jellicent, and Cresselia, can do its job better. However, Beheeyem has a niche in the metagame due to Ally Switch. Moreover, its low HP and Defense stats mean it won't be taking as many hits as some other Pokemon. Don't be put off by these disadvantages, though, as Beheeyem has low Speed and high Special Attack, making it an exceptional Trick Room setter and supporter.</p>

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>This set takes advantage of Beheeyem's low Speed with Trick Room. Because Beheeyem is a Psychic-type, Psychic or Psyshock is a strong, reliable, STAB attack. With STAB Psychic and 52 EVs in Special Attack, there is a slight chance you can OHKO most Hitmontop. Ally Switch is what makes this set unique, allowing Beheeyem to switch places with your second Pokemon. It can potentially help partners weak to Fighting-type attacks, as no spread Fighting-type move currently exists. Beheeyem should always run Ally Switch, as otherwise Cresselia and other bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types completely outclass it. For the last slot, you can choose Shadow Ball to hit Chandelure, Cresselia, and other Psychic-types or Protect to salvage an extra turn. Mental Herb makes sure Trick Room is up unless the opponent uses Imprison or has a Sitrus Berry to let it live a little longer. Because Beheeyem has low HP, a 252 EV investment HP is necessary to withstand at least some attacks. Some EVs in Special Attack are vital to boost its powerful STAB attacks and KO Fighting-types, while 204 Special Defense further increases Beheeyem's ability to take hits. Telepathy is by far the best ability to use with it.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>252 HP and 204 Special Defense EVs allow Beheeyem to take a Shadow Ball from Reuniclus or Chandelure, set up Trick Room, and strike back. 52 Special Attack EVs allow it to have as much power as possible while also retaining its bulk. Mental Herb is very helpful due to the fact many Pokemon carry Taunt; however, Sitrus Berry allows Beheeyem to survive longer. Telepathy is one of the best aspects of this Pokemon, allowing it to avoid taking damage from the very common Surf, Earthquake, and Explosion when used from its partners. Because of this, Beheeyem can avoid wasting a turn Protecting during an Earthquake from an allied Rhyperior or Metagross and attack instead. Normal types, such as Snorlax, are great partners, as they take minimal damage from a Shadow Ball or Crunch, respectively.</p>

<p>Scrafty pairs up great with Beheeyem; with Ally Switch, it can take Ghost- or Dark-type attacks and Beheeyem can take Fighting-Type attacks. Fake Out support makes it relatively easy to set up Trick Room. Also, with STAB Drain Punch and STAB Crunch, Scrafty can deal with Pokemon that are threats to Beheeyem, such as Chandelure. Hitmontop also has great synergy with Beheeyem; it has all of the same features of Scrafty except Dark-type STAB while also having access to Sucker Punch. Amoonguss and other Rage Powder or Follow Me users, such as Togekiss, can make it relatively easy to set up Trick Room.</p>

[Other Options] 

<p>With a Modest nature, you can outspeed other set-up users and use Imprison while still being slow enough to function under Trick Room. Thunderbolt is a great move that can take down common Flying- and Water-types. Simple Beam is risky and gimmicky, but is another option. Disable is also good to stop Bug Buzzes from Volcarona and other super effective moves. Another option is Energy Ball, which is a great move against Gastrodon. Hidden Power Fighting will allow you to hit Tyranitar hard. If you use Analytic over Telepathy, you will get a power boost by 30% if Beheeyem moves last in battle.</p>

[Checks and Counters] 

<p>Scrafty can tear apart Beheeyem, as it is slow and strong under Trick Room, has STAB Crunch, and is immune to Psychic-type moves. Volcarona can OHKO it with Bug Buzz after a Quiver Dance. Tyranitar is also another threat, as it has access to STAB Crunch. Chandelure and Scizor can also tear apart Beheeyem with Shadow Ball and Bug Bite, respectively. Metagross doesn't care about Beheeyem's attacks too much, as it is relatively slow, bulky, and can crush it with a repeated Meteor Mash.</p>
