[Overview]

<p>With Sturdy now acting as a permanent Focus Sash, Aron becomes an interesting option for performing a FEAR strategy. While it may not have as many support options as Whimsicott or Smeargle have, its immunity to Sandstorm and freedom to choose its own held item differentiate Aron from the other Level 1 Pokemon that Endeavor for success.</p>

[SET]
name: Level 1 Sturdy
move 1: Endeavor
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Sleep Talk
move 4: Protect
item: Berry Juice
ability: Sturdy

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Endeavor strikes at opponents, leaving them at an inch of their health and at the mercy of weaker attacks, such as Bullet Punch or Rock Slide. Toxic gives Aron something to use against Ghost-types, or targets struck by Endeavor. Sleep Talk allows Aron to continue to act if put to sleep, although admittedly it is not very reliable. Protect is vital, as the presence of Aron pressures the opponent to throw attacks towards it. Protect also stops Fake Out from ruining Aron's usefulness.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As Aron is at Level 1, its Nature, EVs and IVs are largely irrelevant. Its HP is always 12, and its Speed can be either 4, 5, or 6. If, for some reason, it's really important that Aron can outrun a paralyzed Ferrothorn or other Aron, then 36 Speed EVs with a neutral Speed nature will allow Aron to have 6 Speed. Aron's held item, Berry Juice, recovers 20 HP when Aron is below half health, essentially requiring 3 hits to KO Aron. Because Aron will not go down to a double-targeting from the opponent, it can be surprisingly effective even outside of Trick Room. Alternatively, a Shell Bell can be used over Berry Juice, allowing Aron to replenish its HP to full whenever it hits an opponent with Endeavor. This can make Aron extremely tough to take out under the influence of Trick Room.</p>

<p>Aron dislikes Hail, so having a teammate that can change the weather is appreciated. Tyranitar and Hippowdon in particular are useful, as Sandstorm can finish off those hit with Endeavor. However, it will take two turns for a Pokemon hit with Endeavor to faint unless they have at least 192 HP. Pokemon with priority moves are useful alongside Aron, as they can pick off crippled targets. Feint users are especially useful as they can strike through an opponent's Protect to finish them off. Pokemon such as Metagross or Hitmontop are helpful priority users, but some Pokemon that are lesser known for priority attacks, such as Togekiss, Gallade, and Infernape, can work well too. Supportive Pokemon that have Follow Me or Fake Out can help Aron last longer to try to land more Endeavors on the opponent. Lastly, Trick Room allows Aron to move first, turning it into a major threat.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Due to Aron being at level 1, its options are limited to non-damaging attacks. Sandstorm is a good way for Aron to counter Hail. Screech and Metal Sound can be used to weaken an opposing Pokemon's defenses, allowing a partner to deal more damage. Lastly, Swagger can be used to try to disrupt the opponent.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>There are many ways to deal with a Level 1 Aron. Abomasnow can summon up Hail, damaging Aron through residual damage and rendering Sturdy worthless. Ghost-type Pokemon are immune to Endeavor, but should still watch out for Toxic, Metal Sound, or Screech. Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs can mess up Aron, but it would require Ferrothorn to be hit with Endeavor first. Multi-hit moves such as Rock Blast or Icicle Spear can KO Aron. Lastly, Pokemon with Mold Breaker ignore Sturdy and OHKO Aron with any attack.</p>
