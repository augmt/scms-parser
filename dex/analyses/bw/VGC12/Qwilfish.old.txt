[Overview]

<p>With plenty of swift swimming fish in the sea, Qwilfish doesn't do too much to stand out above the waves. While it has a relatively unique Water / Poison typing, it is weighed down by a shallow movepool and mediocre base stats. Qwilfish is the only Swift Swim Pokemon able to use Explosion, but due to the changes to Explosion in BW, it isn't nearly as potent as it once was. However, if you need a Swift Swim Pokemon that can handle Ludicolo and Abomasnow, you might want to give Qwilfish a try.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Waterfall and Poison Jab are Qwilfish's main STAB moves. Waterfall hits hard in the rain and can potentially flinch the opposing Pokemon. Poison Jab provides decent coverage with Waterfall, OHKOing Ludicolo or Abomasnow, provided they don't hold a Focus Sash. Explosion, though nerfed, can still deal considerable damage to the opponent and acts as a last ditch effort when faced with a poor match up. Lastly, Protect rounds the moveset off, allowing Qwilfish to block and scout oncoming attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs max out Qwilfish's Speed and Attack in order to hit as hard and fast as possible. Although holding a Life Orb is preferred, holding a damage-boosting Gem, a Focus Sash, or a Choice Band is also viable.</p>

<p>Qwilfish is quite reliant on the rain, which naturally makes Politoed its most important ally, providing rain with Drizzle. Manual weather users, such as Thundurus, can also help set up Qwilfish for sweeping. To take greater advantage of the rain, Swift Swim Pokemon, such as Ludicolo and Kingdra, or Dragon-type Pokemon, such as Latios and Hydreigon, make effective partners. The former can keep up offensive pressure against the opponent, while the latter are able to switch in on attacks super effective on Qwilfish. Pokemon with Lightningrod, such as Manectric and Seaking, can also work with Qwilfish, redirecting away harmful Electric-type moves.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Qwilfish's Dream World ability is Intimidate. While it is a good support ability, the loss of Swift Swim can be crippling. Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall, but the added power is often not worth giving up accuracy and the chance to flinch the opponent for Qwilfish. Thunder Wave and Taunt allow Qwilfish to play a bit of a support role on a team, paralyzing opponents or stopping moves such as Trick Room. Acid Spray is another intersting option, allowing Qwilfish to set an opponent up to be taken out by special attacks. Aqua Jet provides Qwilfish with a priority option, though it should be the fastest on the field if it is raining anyway. Lastly, Destiny Bond can be used over Explosion as a situational way to KO an opponent.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Removing the rain or setting up Trick Room will quickly put Qwilfish out of its element, making it easy pickings for just about any special sweeper. Otherwise, Pokemon such as Jellicent, Empoleon, Gastrodon, and Toxicroak can easily shrug off Qwilfish's STAB moves, though the latter two need to watch out for Explosion.</p>
