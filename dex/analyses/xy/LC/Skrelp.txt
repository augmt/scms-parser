Overview
########

Skrelp's STAB moves have good coverage and are resisted by few Pokemon, making it a great offensive Pokemon. Its decent bulk and typing, which gives it nine resistances, allow it to survive many hits with ease. Also, its ability Adaptability lets it hit harder. However, Skrelp is weak to common types, such as Ground and Electric; it also has a low Speed stat and a small movepool. Furthermore, its only form of recovery is the unreliable Rest, making it reliant on Wish support.

Special Attacker
#########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Sludge Wave / Sludge Bomb
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Psychic
move 4: Scald
ability: Adaptability
item: Eviolite
evs: 36 HP / 116 Def / 200 SpA / 116 SpD / 40 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Sludge Wave is the main STAB move, as it is very powerful and boosted by Adaptability. Sludge Bomb is also a viable alternative to Sludge Wave; however, while Sludge Bomb has a higher chance to inflict poison, it is often not worth using, because it cannot hit Chespin and might poison a Pokemon that would be crippled more by a burn. Hydro Pump, the most powerful STAB move on the set, is also boosted by Adaptability. Hidden Power Fire allows Skrelp to heavily damage Steel-types, which are immune to Poison-type moves; it is primarily used to KO Ferroseed, which resists both of Skrelp's STAB moves. Having Hidden Power Psychic allows Skrelp to OHKO Croagunk, which would otherwise counter Skrelp; it also hits other Skrelp for super effective damage. Scald is another 100% accurate STAB move, can be used when Hydro Pump's accuracy is not reliable, and has a 30% chance to burn the foe.

Set Details
========

The EV spread maximizes Skrelp's damage output while hitting Eviolite numbers. Adaptability boosts the power of Skrelp's STAB moves, and a Modest nature increases Skrelp's Special Attack. The Speed EVs allow Skrelp to outspeed Pokemon such as Spritzee and Hippopotas.

Usage Tips
========

Skrelp can easily switch into moves that it resists, thanks to its bulk. Scald should be used early-game to burn and wear down Skrelp's checks. Ferroseed and Croagunk should be hit on the switch, as they are not always OHKOed by any of Skrelp's moves.

Team Options
========

Sticky Web support lets Skrelp outspeed and KO Pokemon that would usually be faster than it. Hazard support can be useful to allow Skrelp to attain KOes more easily. Skrelp has good synergy with Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo and Timburr, as it can easily KO Fairy- and Poison-types, which are troublesome for them. Skrelp works well with Drilbur too, as Drilbur is immune to Electric-type moves, which Skrelp is weak to, can set Stealth Rock up, and can easily KO Croagunk, Skrelp's main counter. Pokemon that can deal with Abra, such as Stunky and Pawniard, are also good partners to Skrelp. Pokemon that are immune to Ground-type moves, such as Archen and Vullaby, and Pokemon that resist or are immune to Electric-type moves, such as Drilbur and Pumpkaboo, also make for good partners. Support Pokemon such as Spritzee, which has access to Wish and Aromatherapy, are also useful to allow Skrelp to stay healthy.

RestTalk
########
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Scald
move 4: Sludge Wave / Sludge Bomb
ability: Adaptability
item: Eviolite
evs: 116 HP / 196 Def / 36 SpA / 116 SpD / 36 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Rest is Skrelp's only form of recovery; it cures it of status and fully restores its health. Sleep Talk allows Skrelp to attack while asleep. Scald is boosted by Adaptability and has a high chance to burn the foe. Though Sludge Bomb can be used in place of it, Sludge Wave is used, as it has a lower chance of poisoning a foe that would be crippled more by a burn and is able to hit Chespin.

Set Details
========

Adaptability boosts the power of Skrelp's STAB moves. The HP and defensive investment in conjunction with Eviolite allow Skrelp to take many hits with ease. The Speed EVs increase Skrelp's Speed stat by one, allowing it to outspeed Spritzee and Hippopotas, and a Bold nature allows it to take physical moves better.

Usage Tips
========

Skrelp can be used as a status absorber thanks to Rest. It is a good mixed wall and can deal with Fighting- and Fairy-types, common Pokemon in LC, thanks to Adaptability.

Team Option
========

Thanks to its ability to KO Fairy-types with ease, Skrelp is a great partner to Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo and Timburr. Drilbur makes for a good partner thanks to its immunity to Electric-type moves and ability to set up Stealth Rock, as well as its ability to KO Croagunk, Skrelp's main counter. Pokemon that can easily take on Abra, such as Stunky and Pawniard, also make for good partners to Skrelp. Pokemon that are immune to Ground-type moves, such as Archen and Vullaby, are good partners; in particular, Vullaby is immune to two of Skrelp's weaknesses, Psychic and Ground, while Skrelp resists two of Vullaby's weaknesses, Fairy and Ice. Pokemon that resist or are immune to Electric-type moves, such as Drilbur and Pumpkaboo, are also good partners.

Other Options
########

Life Orb can be used on the offensive set for more power, but causes Skrelp to take recoil damage. Choice Specs can also be used on the offensive set for more power without recoil, but at the cost of being Choice-locked into one move. Toxic Spikes can also be used on the RestTalk set, as it is quite unexpected and allows Skrelp to provide support for its teammates. Thunderbolt can also be used to hit opposing Skrelp, Frillish, and Tentacool, which otherwise wall Skrelp, for super effective damage. A physical set with Waterfall, Gunk Shot, and Play Rough can also be considered.

Checks and Counters
########

**Ground-types**: Ground-types such as Diglett and Drilbur can easily KO Skrelp; Diglett can trap it, but it can be forced out by the threat of a Water-type STAB move.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Chinchou, Magnemite and Elekid threaten Skrelp with their Electric-type STAB moves, though the RestTalk set has enough bulk to survive their hits.

**Psychic-types**: Psychic-types such as Abra and Gothita can damage Skrelp with any of their STAB moves, and Gothita can trap it, though Skrelp's powerful STAB moves might prove to be problematic.

**Special Walls**: Pokemon with a high Special Defense stat, such as Munchlax and Mantyne, can take Skrelp's hits with much ease.

**Pokemon that resist Skrelp's STAB moves**: As long as Skrelp doesn't carry Hidden Power Fire, Ferroseed counters it. Croagunk also counters Skrelp, though Hidden Power Psychic is problematic for it. Skrelp checks itself, as it is resistant to its STAB moves, though it fears Hidden Power Psychic. Bulky Water-types can survive hits from Skrelp with much ease; examples include Frillish, which is immune to Water-type moves thanks to Water Absorb, and Tentacool, which, thanks to its typing, resists both of Skrelp's STAB moves.
