Overview
########

Skrelp is a rather overlooked Pokemon, as it is not very impressive in any one role. However, it has many very appealing advantages over other Pokemon. First, it has an amazing stat distribution, with nice bulk of 50 / 60 / 60 and 60 / 60 offenses, very fit for a tank. Skrelp's STAB moves have surprisingly good coverage, only being resisted by Ferroseed, Tentacruel, Skrelp itself, and Frillish. Skrelp also has a nice set of resistances, with resistances to Fighting-, Water-, Fairy-, and Fire-type moves. These resistances allow Skrelp to wall some very powerful Pokemon like Ponyta and Mienfoo. Finally, Skrelp only has three weaknesses, which is very good for a wall. Skrelp receives competition from Chinchou and Staryu as a bulky Water-type. Skrelp's movepool is also not very impressive. Furthermore, Skrelp's Speed stat is very low, meaning it will almost always be hit first. Skrelp's only form of recovery is RestTalk, which is quite unreliable. Skrelp's abilities don't help it much either, particularly since its best ability, Adaptability, is unreleased. Despite all these flaws, Skrelp is still a good wall.

RestTalk
########
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Scald
move 4: Sludge Bomb
ability: Poison Point
item: Eviolite
evs: 80 HP / 196 Def / 116 SpA / 116 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

The combination of Rest and Sleep Talk gives Skrelp a reliable form of recovery, which allows it to stay healthy throughout the match and deal damage. Scald hits decently hard and has the nice chance to burn, effectively crippling all physical attackers bar Timburr. Sludge Bomb has surprisingly effective synergy with Scald, and is the more powerful STAB. It also hits the Grass-types that Scald does not hit effectively.

Set Details
========

As Adaptability is still unreleased, and as this moveset doesn't have any moves that take advantage of Poison Touch, Poison Point is the ability of choice. The given defensive EVs and nature with Eviolite give Skrelp very respectable bulk that lets it take many hits easily. 116 Special Attack EVs give Skrelp 14 Special Attack, letting it deal decent damage with its STAB moves.

Usage Tips
========

Skrelp is a very good mixed wall, as it can take hits from attackers such as Fletchling, Porygon, non-Earthquake Tirtouga, and other common offensive Pokemon. RestTalk also makes Skrelp a very good status absorber, as it can get rid of it status by using Rest. With the Special Attack EVs, Skrelp also can hit things that aren't dedicated walls or resists pretty hard. Thanks to its Poison typing, it is a very effective wall against Fairy- and Fighting-type Pokemon, which is very useful.


Team Options
========

Vullaby is a good teammate for Skrelp, as it is immune to Psychic- and Ground-type moves, and can Defog away entry hazards, while Skrelp takes Fairy- and Ice-types; Skrelp also can handle special attackers, as well as burning physical attackers. However, you must be wary of Chinchou and other Electric-types. Lickitung is another good partner for Skrelp because it takes most Psychic- and Electric-type moves with its amazing bulk, while Skrelp can take physical Fighting-type attacks for Lickitung. If Skrelp can’t get a Rest off, Lickitung can pass it a Wish, which can be helpful.

Tank
########
name: Tank
move 1: Scald
move 2: Sludge Bomb
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Hidden Power Fire
ability: Poison Point
item: Eviolite
evs: 36 HP / 116 Def / 200 SpA / 116 SpD / 40 Spe
ivs: 2 Atk / 30 SpA / 30 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Scald is the Water-type STAB move of choice, as Skrelp and its teammates really enjoy the extra chip damage and the chance that opponent will get burned. Sludge Bomb is Skrelp's Poison-type STAB move and is more powerful than Scald. It hits quite hard and has amazing type synergy with Scald. Thunderbolt hits a majority of the Pokemon that resist Skrelp’s STAB moves super effectively, such as Tentacool, Frillish, and other Skrelp. Hidden Power Fire hits Ferroseed, the only Pokemon that resists Skrelp’s other moves, extremely hard.

Set Details
========

The Special Attack EVs together with a Modest nature and 30 Special Attack IVs give Skrelp 16 Special Attack, letting it hit very hard. The HP, Defense, and Special Defense EVs give Skrelp respectable 22 / 21 / 21 bulk with Eviolite, letting it beat many Pokemon 1v1 with its STAB moves and bulk. The remaining 40 EVs raise Speed by a point, to 10. The given IVs let Skrelp access Hidden Power Fire, while minimizing Attack to limit Foul Play and confusion damage.


Usage Tips
========

This Skrelp is a more offensive Skrelp and should be used as a pivot, coming in on things that it beats, dealing a decent amount of damage, and switching out when in a sticky situation. The best way to use Skrelp is to switch in, relying on its good bulk, and then neuter the opposing team with burns and hard hitting attacks. As Skrelp doesn't have recovery and it needs to take hits, Wish support is very helpful. With its amazing bulk and good Special Attack, Skrelp can often beat many Pokemon singlehandedly.

Team Options
========

Again, Vullaby is a good partner for Skrelp, Knocking Off Eviolites so that Skrelp can hit harder, while Skrelp can burn things so that Vullaby can better take hits. Wish passers are good partners in general for tank Skrelp, as it loves the recovery. Spritzee can physically tank along with Skrelp, while Lickitung can Knock Off items and wall things on the special side. They also benefit from Skrelp's support, as Skrelp resists both Spritzee’s Steel- and Poison-type weaknesses and Lickitung’s Fighting-type weakness.

Other Options
########

A Life Orb set can hit very hard, however, even with good coverage, Life Orb Skrelp will get worn down very easily due to its low Speed. A specially defensive spread could work, but it is outclassed by Tentacool and Chinchou. A physical set could work off Skrelp’s fine Attack stat and take advantage of Poison Touch, but as Skrelp’s only decent physical moves are Waterfall, Play Rough, and Return, it is inferior to its Special set. Hydro Pump hits much harder than Scald, but the burn chance is missed, as without it, Skrelp cannot effectively neuter physical attackers. Skrelp also gets access to other cool moves such as Toxic Spikes and Haze, which have good utility, but Skrelp can only run two other moves along with its STAB attacks, and having to use Rest + Sleep Talk for recovery or Thunderbolt + Hidden Power Fire for coverage mean that there is no space for either of the moves.


Checks & Counters
########

**Super Effective Attacks**: The best way to beat Skrelp, like most Pokemon, is to hit it with a super effective attack. Ground-types, such as Drilbur and Diglett, can easily take down Skrelp, but they cannot switch into Scald. Psychic-types such as Abra can easily take down Skrelp as well, but unless they're bulky, they will take a lot of damage from Sludge Bomb.

**Ferroseed**: Ferroseed is one of the best counters to Skrelp, as it is only hit hard by Hidden Power Fire, so it can easily set up hazards against Skrelp lacking this move.

**Bulky Water-types**: Chinchou and Tentacool can take multiple hits from Skrelp. Chinchou beats Skrelp with Thunderbolt, while Tentacool wins with Giga Drain, unless Skrelp runs Thunderbolt.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types in general easily beat Skrelp, especially Magnemite, who can come out of the scuffle unscathed thanks to Berry Juice.
