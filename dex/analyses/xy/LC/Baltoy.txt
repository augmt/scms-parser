Overview
########

Baltoy finds its niche in being the only Rapid Spin user that is resistant to Stealth Rock and is immune to Spikes. This sets it apart from other Rapid Spin users, as it can come in on Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin it away while not being too worn down by it. Baltoy also has access to Stealth Rock. With Eviolite, Baltoy has reasonable bulk, and backed by its unique resistances, it has the ability to wall various threats such as Trubbish. However, Baltoy is outclassed by almost entirely everything, including Drilbur, Sandshrew, Hippopotas, and Staryu. Because of the prominence of Knock Off, Baltoy's Psychic typing is very detrimental to its role as a bulky Pokemon. Baltoy's common weaknesses are easily exploited as well, with many top-tier threats having powerful STAB moves to heavily damage, if not KO Baltoy with. A drawback to Baltoy itself is its case of huge four-moveslot syndrome; it can't fit everything it needs to in one set. It also is extremely weak, usually leaving it setup fodder. Baltoy's few useful niches should be taken advantage of when using it; otherwise you're better off running Drilbur.

Rapid Spin
########
name: Rapid Spin
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Psychic / Recycle
ability: Levitate
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 36 HP / 36 Atk / 236 Def / 196 SpD
nature: Relaxed

Moves
========

Rapid Spin removes entry hazards from your side of the field. Stealth Rock damages Pokemon when they switch in, and also works very well with Rapid Spin. Earthquake and Psychic aren't very powerful, but they do allow Baltoy to harm foes in some way. Recycle should only be used with Berry Juice, providing reliable recovery. Ice Beam can be used over Psychic for coverage, though it is very weak.

Set Details
========

The allocated Defense and Special Defense EVs allow Baltoy to hit 16 in both stats, hitting Eviolite numbers. The rest of the EVs are dumped into HP and Attack to boost them a bit. A Relaxed is used to ensure the power of Baltoy's moves is not affected, and Baltoy doesn't mind the Speed drop. Eviolite is the preferred item, keeping great bulk and being more long-lasting than Berry Juice, although Berry Juice is useful for instant recovery. The exception to this is when running Recycle, which allows Baltoy to reuse Berry Juice. Levitate is a unique niche that Baltoy has over Drilbur, giving it an immunity to Ground-type attacks, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web which Drilbur lacks.

Usage Tips
========

Baltoy is quite simple to use; its primary goal is to set Stealth Rock or remove hazards with Rapid Spin. Baltoy is immune to Spikes and resists Stealth Rock, which is another niche. Do not lead with Baltoy, as even though it has Stealth Rock, it has quite a bad matchup often and is best used when it is brought in on something it can wall. Baltoy is really passive and tends to lure in setup sweepers, so be sure to have a Pokemon that is able to phaze or utilize Taunt. Knock Off is Baltoy's bane, removing its source of bulk and often leaving it low on health, so always be sure to keep it away from any potential Knock Off user. Prediction is helpful; for instance, using Psychic on a Gastly switch-in can remove it and will allow Baltoy to use Rapid Spin without being spinblocked by Gastly.

Team Options
========

Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull have good synergy with Baltoy, resisting Dark- and Bug-type moves. Dark-types such as Scraggy and Pawniard also have good synergy with Baltoy thanks to Baltoy's resistance to Fighting-type moves. U-turn troubles Baltoy, making Steel-types like Ferroseed good partners. In particular, Ferroseed is useful because it can freely set Spikes without having to worry about your own Defog removing it. Cleric support is useful to remove Toxic; Chinchou has nearly flawless synergy with Baltoy and access to Heal Bell as well.

Other Options
########

Running Trick alongside a Choice item is effective because Baltoy can hit 14 Speed and catch many opponents off guard. Trick Room is a neat move that Baltoy can utilize to support its teammates. Baltoy also has access to dual screens, which work well in tandem with Trick Room. Magic Coat is intriguing thanks to its ability to reflect Taunt and opposing entry hazards. Calm Mind could be used on a more offensively oriented set, but Baltoy is far too weak to utilize it effectively. In a similar vein, Cosmic Power is an option but is, once again, too gimmicky for use. Dazzling Gleam can catch Scraggy switch-ins off guard but lacks use outside of this. Some other coverage options include Grass Knot and Shadow Ball. Explosion is a neat way to lure in Defog users and explode to ensure that Stealth Rock stays up. Finally, Gravity could be used for a non-blockable Earthquake, but is also gimmicky, uses up a precious moveslot, and removes Baltoy's Ground immunity.

Checks & Counters
########

**Knock Off**: Knock Off removes Baltoy's Eviolite, which boosts its bulk.

**Super effective moves**: Baltoy has a total of five weaknesses; two common Pokemon that threaten it are Chinchou and Pawniard, which can pressure it with their super effective STAB moves.

**Flying-types**: Flying-types are immune to Earthquake and shrug off Psychic, although some frailer Flying-types must watch out for Ice Beam.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types block Baltoy from using Rapid Spin, though Gastly must watch out for Psychic.
