Overview
########

Hoppip's unique typing combination in Little Cup, which gives it an interesting STAB combination and a number of useful resistances, is backed by an excellent movepool for disrupting, attacking, and supporting. Furthermore, its ability Infiltrator means that not even Substitute can block Hoppip's Sleep Powder, turning Hoppip into a potent offensive and supportive threat. Despite its lack of outstanding stats, which creates the potential for it to be walled once Sleep Clause is activated, as well as its few minor, easily patched-up weaknesses, Hoppip fulfills a specific and desirable role on a multitude of teams.

Moves
========

Sleep Powder is able to put one foe out of commission entirely; thanks to Hoppip's ability, Infiltrator, not even Substitute will be enough to prevent this. Acrobatics becomes a powerful STAB move once Berry Juice is activated and annihilates a good portion of the Grass-types that may attempt to switch in to absorb Sleep Powder. Bullet Seed is another viable choice, dealing heavy damage to frailer foes due to how damage rolls work at level 5. Substitute gives Hoppip a reliable means to activate Berry Juice and thus pairs well with Acrobatics; it's also generally useful for scouting attacks and switch-ins. U-turn allows Hoppip to scout the opposing team and provide momentum for its own team after crippling the opposition with Sleep Powder in a similar manner to Compound Eyes Yanma before it was banned. Hoppip's powerful STAB moves and ability to bypass Reflect make it a potent attacker, so Swords Dance is a good option for Hoppip to sweep even more easily. However, Aromatherapy allows Hoppip to further support its own team, as well as remove its own paralysis or burn.

Set Details
========

This set aims to take advantage of Hoppip's unique strengths to allow it to support its team and damage the opposing team in a single set. The given EVs maximize Hoppip's Attack and Speed stats for as much sweeping potential as possible, with the remainder of the EVs dumped in HP so that Hoppip is able to switch into Stealth Rock eight times instead of seven. Berry Juice extends Hoppip's lifespan and, after it has been used, allows Hoppip to take advantage of a fully powered Acrobatics. Infiltrator is useful for allowing Hoppip to get around Substitute and Reflect. A Jolly nature is preferred to most notably outspeed bulky variants of Archen and Chinchou, but an Adamant nature can be used for more overall power.

Usage Tips
========

Berry Juice allows Hoppip to switch into weaker attacks and fire off powerful Acrobatics. Use Substitute to activate Berry Juice if a fully powered Acrobatics is needed. It can also be used when Hoppip initially comes in so that you can decide whether to follow up on the switch-in with Sleep Powder or another attack. Hoppip can take advantage of a sleeping foe to set up a Substitute or a Swords Dance, or U-turn out to a teammate that can appropriately deal with the switch-in.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can deal with sleep absorbers are appreciated. For example, Roost Archen beats Vullaby, and defensive Mienfoo beats RestTalk Munchlax. As with most offensive Pokemon, Hoppip appreciates having entry hazards on the opposing side to obtain key KOs. Sticky Web support allows Hoppip to outspeed a larger portion of the metagame and sweep more easily. Hoppip is fantastic at removing potent threats such as Mienfoo, Tyrogue, and Sunkern with its STAB attacks, so teammates weak to these Pokemon will benefit from Hoppip's presence. Fighting-types such as Timburr are appreciated, as they can check Ice-types such as Snorunt.

Other Options
########

A Choice Scarf set can function as a decent pivot thanks to Hoppip's typing, access to U-Turn, and fast Sleep Powder, but Hoppip greatly appreciates its ability to switch moves and take advantage of Acrobatics. Stun Spore is a useful support option to cripple faster Pokemon once Sleep Clause has been activated. Memento gives a teammate an easier time setting up at the cost of Hoppip fainting. Sun support grants Hoppip the opportunity to effectively take advantage of Chlorophyll. A specially offensive Chlorophyll set is possible, but Hoppip's physical set has a similar damage output without requiring as much support. Hoppip can run an Eviolite set with Synthesis and a boosting move, but this may take a while to set up. Encore discourages opponents from setting up on Hoppip once Sleep Powder is used. A combination of Substitute and Leech Seed can be used thanks to Hoppip's access to powerful Flying-type STAB attacks, but Leech Seed is generally a gimmicky strategy in LC.

Checks & Counters
########

**Sleep Powder Absorbers**: Pokemon that are immune to Sleep Powder and can withstand Hoppip's STAB attacks, such as Hoothoot, Elekid, and Vullaby, are able to come in on anything Hoppip offers and force it out; certain dedicated sleep absorbers, such as RestTalk variants of Munchlax and Snubbull, are able to do the same. Early Bird Doduo and Houndour are able to come in on Sleep Powder or Bullet Seed, but they will take heavy damage from a fully powered Acrobatics.

**Status**: Burns and paralysis cripple Hoppip if it does not run Aromatherapy, or force it to waste a turn curing itself if it does. Fast Taunt users can prevent Hoppip from using a large portion of its moves.

**Pokemon with Good Stats**: Once Sleep Clause has been activated, most Pokemon with decent offensive and defensive stats that are not weak to Hoppip's STAB attacks are able to beat it.
