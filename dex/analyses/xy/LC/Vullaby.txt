Overview
########
Vullaby has newfound viability this generation, thanks to its access to Defog and its Dark / Flying typing, giving it a plethora of resistances. It sports excellent 70 / 75 / 65 defenses, a recovery move in Roost, and Knock Off to support its team. Vullaby can check Fighting-types with its STAB Flying-type attacks, or it can run offensive sets to take advantage of its excellent coverage, although it must invest heavily in offenses before it can deal respectable damage, typically making it setup bait. Vullaby dislikes any sort of residual damage, which is a problem because it is weak to Stealth Rock, while also being weak to Fairy-type moves, Archen, and Chinchou.


Defog
########
name: Defog
move 1: Defog
move 2: Roost
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Brave Bird / U-turn
ability: Overcoat
item: Eviolite
evs: 116 HP / 236 Def / 76 SpD / 36 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Defog allows Vullaby to remove entry hazards, reducing pressure on its teammates. Roost gives Vullaby recovery and goes fantastically well with Vullaby's excellent bulk. Knock Off can deter setup and support its teammates, although it deals pitiful damage without investment or asuper effective hit. Brave Bird is another STAB option that lets Vullaby deal damage to Fighting-types, although the recoil will cut into Vullaby's longevity. U-turn can be used over Brave Bird to maintain momentum on VoltTurn teams. Heat Wave can be used to deter Pawniard from switching in on Defog, given that it is a 2HKO. Air Slash is an option instead of Brave Bird if you don't like the recoil, but Brave Bird generally hits harder.

Set Details
========

The HP EVs hit a Stealth Rock number to minimize residual damage, while the rest are put into both defenses to hit Eviolite numbers and enhance Vullaby's bulk. The leftover EVs are put in Speed to outspeed uninvested base 53-62 Speed Pokemon, such as Fletchling. A Relaxed nature should be chosen if Vullaby is running Air Slash or Heat Wave, and any EVs in Speed should be moved to Attack or Special Attack. Eviolite gives enhanced bulk, since Vullaby already has recovery.

Usage Tips
========
The main idea of this set is to use Defog as needed and check various Pokemon including Croagunk, Foongus, and Drilbur. Avoid using Defog if there is a Pawniard on the opposing team. This set fits best on balance and stall teams or wherever an offensive presence isn't completely necessary. Overcoat lets Vullaby switch into powder moves, so don't neglect the opportunity switch in and get a free Defog or Knock Off.

Team Options
========

Sturdy users and Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock, such as Tirtouga, Onix, Larvesta, and Ponyta appreciate Vullaby's hazard removal. Chinchou has near perfect synergy with Vullaby, resisting Ice- and Electric-type attacks and helping against certain Rock-types. Vullaby can switch in on Ground-types for Chinchou and take out Grass-types and Croagunk. Mienfoo also appreciates the removal of Grass-types and Crogunk, and it can beat Pawniard and Sturdy users that threaten Vullaby; however, the two share a weakness to Fairy-types.


Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Air Slash
move 4: Hidden Power Fighting / Heat Wave
ability: Weak Armor
item: Eviolite
evs : 116 HP / 240 SpA / 120 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
Use Nasty Plot when Vullaby's main checks and counters have been weakened or removed. Dark Pulse is the obligatory STAB move and hits Pokemon such as Archen, Chinchou, and Drilbur. Air Slash is the secondary STAB move and hits Fighting-types and other Pokemon that resist Dark Pulse. Dark Pulse and Air Slash have a useful flinch chance as well, which can help in a pinch. Hidden Power Fighting and Heat Wave serve the purpose of hitting Pawniard. Hidden Power Fighting hits bulky Normal-types like Porygon and Lickitung whereas Heat Wave hits Ferroseed harder.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Vullaby's Special Attack and give Vullaby 14 Speed, letting it outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after Weak Armor activates. The leftover EVs are thrown into HP to give Vullaby even better bulk. Eviolite is chosen to give Vullaby better survivability so that it can set up much more easily, even though this set lacks recovery. Weak Armor is chosen so Vullaby can get +1 Speed against physical attackers. This is key to Vullaby's ability to sweep.

Usage Tips
========

This set fits best on bird spam teams and offensive teams in general. Vullaby should be saved for a mid- to late-game sweep to break down the opposing team or clean up after something else.
Only set up on physical attackers like Timburr, Mienfoo that lack Taunt, Croagunk, Trubbish, Ponyta, and Pawniard. You can set up on Archen, but offensive sets will win and Vullaby can't switch in directly on any other set. In general, Vullaby's natural bulk will aid it immensely in setting up against offensive threats.

Team Options
========

Flying-types, including Fletchling, Archen, and Doduo, are the top partners for Vullaby since it can set up on and defeat several Flying-type checks. Pawniard is another helpful teammate that can weaken Spritzee and bulky Normal-types for an easier sweep. Slow pivots like Mienfoo and Chinchou help Vullaby get into battle safer so it doesn't have to take a hit with -1 Defense while it sets up.


Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Roost
move 4: Hidden Power Fighting / U-turn
ability: Overcoat
item: Eviolite
evs: 116 HP / 156 Atk / 80 SpA / 120 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Brave Bird is a powerful STAB move with great offensive coverage. Knock Off is a STAB move that can cripple Flying-type checks and other bulky switch-ins. Roost grants Vullaby longevity and can alleviate hazard damage. Hidden Power Fighting is used to lure and beat Pawniard for Fletchling, possibly paving the way for a lategame sweep. If Diglett is a teammate, U-turn is preferred over Hidden Power Fighting to allow for easier trapping and conservation of momentum.

Set Details
========

The given EVs grant Vullaby enough power and Speed to outrun 60 Speed neutral Chinchou and 2HKO the Berry Juice variant with Knock Off. Eviolite is chosen to enhance Vullaby's bulk and is the best item option considering Vullaby has Roost. Overcoat is the best ability choice and lets Vullaby switch into powder moves, though they can be somewhat rare.

Usage Tips
========

This set isn't as bulky as the first set, so try to avoid stronger neutral attacks. It is meant for bird spam teams as a means of weakening Fletchling checks, so offensive teams work best. The idea is to consistently use Knock Off and Brave Bird and heal with Roost as necessary.

Team Options
========

This set is designed for bird spam teams, so Fletchling is the number one partner. Diglett can be run alongside Vullaby to beat Pawniard. This set doesn't have Defog, so entry hazard removers, such as Archen or Drilbur, are appreciated, especially considering Fletchling is commonly run in tandem.


Other Options
########

Toxic stall is an option given that Vullaby has reliable recovery and excellent bulk. Whirlwind can be used to deter stat boosters from setting up. Taunt is an option to block hazards and recovery, but Vullaby doesn't usually have room for it or the Speed to run it.


Checks & Counters
########

**Rock-types**: Rock-types, Tirtouga and Dwebble in particular, can hit Vullaby super effectively with Stone Edge and Rock Blast, respectively. Dwebble also has access to hazards. Archen and Solid Rock Tirtouga can also just switch back in to reset Stealth Rock after Defog.

**Pawniard**: Pawniard can switch in on Vullaby's Defog and activate Defiant, allowing Pawniard to 2HKO Vullaby with Iron Head or hamper it with Knock Off.

**Spritzee**: Spritzee and other Fairy-types can take Vullaby's moves with ease and KO with their STAB attacks.

**Bulky Normal-types**: Munchlax, Porygon, and Lickitung all easily wall Vullaby's Nasty Plot set. They can paralyze it as well with Thunder Wave or Body Slam, cutting Vullaby's sweep short. However, Vullaby can hit Porygon super effectively with Hidden Power Fighting.

**Passive-damage**: Passive damage, such as entry hazards, burn, and Toxic really wears down Vullaby.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types, namely Chinchou and Magnemite, can switch in and threaten to KO with their STAB attacks and can tank Vullaby's Flying-type STAB. Both must be wary of Knock Off and a boosted Dark Pulse, however.

**Knock Off**: If Vullaby gets hit by Knock Off, the number of things it can wall drops drastically. This is why it is imperative to always be wary of Knock Off, especially if Vullaby is needed to wall something dangerous.
