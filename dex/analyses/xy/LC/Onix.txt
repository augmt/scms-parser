Overview
########

Onix is a niche Pokemon thanks to its unique stats and ability. Due to its Speed, it functions differently from Geodude, as it can Taunt and KO faster Pokemon. This is important when dealing with users of Sticky Web and Shell Smash. Compared to Archen and other Stealth Rock users, Sturdy gives Onix the ability to reliably check a large number of Pokemon, even ones that use super effective moves, such as Magnemite.

Moves
========

Earthquake is Onix's main STAB attack. Rock Blast is a very useful secondary STAB attack to deal with opposing Sturdy Pokemon as well as Substitute users such as Torchic. Stealth Rock is one of the main reasons to use Onix. Thanks to its high Defense and Sturdy ability, Onix usually has time to both set up Stealth Rock and damage or Taunt an opponent's setup Pokemon. Taunt makes Onix the perfect counter to Shell Smashers and RestTalkers, and also prevents setup by Dwebble and status moves such as Will-O-Wisp from Vulpix. Roar can force out the Pokemon that Onix isn't fast enough to Taunt or strong enough to KO.

Set Details
========

The EVs are standard; maximum Speed is to outpace most middling Pokemon such as Dwebble or Tirtouga. Attack is maxed and 76 HP EVs bring Onix to 21 HP, allowing it to recover a full 20 HP from Berry Juice after Sturdy activates. Note that at this Speed, Onix still Speed ties with Timid Surskit.

Usage Tips
========

Onix has two major ways of influencing a game. If there is a Pokemon that the team needs it to counter, such as Fletchling, it can be kept alive and sent in whenever Fletchling makes an appearance. Alternatively, Onix functions as an exceptional lead due to its ability to beat or damage many Pokemon one-on-one, including common setup leads like Spinark and Dwebble, while still getting Stealth Rock up.

Team Options
========

Onix works on just about any team in need of a reliable Stealth Rock user. It also has a fast Taunt, so it's quite useful for other Pokemon that rely on Sturdy and Focus Sash, such as Magnemite or Diglett. Onix gets forced out quite easily by Mienfoo after Stealth Rock is set up, so a switch-in such as Trubbish works nicely with it. Trubbish also deals with Grass-types quite well.

Other Options
########

A Curse + Dragon Tail set is an option, but it's outclassed immensely by many other Pokemon. Heavy Slam can be used to hit Fairy-types, while Toxic can wear down bulky switch-ins such as Mienfoo. An offensive set with Rock Polish is a possibility, but Onix lacks the power to be threatening enough after a Speed boost. Stone Edge can be used instead of Rock Blast to hit specific Pokemon such as Archen without triggering Berry Juice, but is less accurate and doesn't bypass Sturdy and Focus Sash. Explosion can be used in a last-ditch effort to KO a Rapid Spin or Defog user, but again, its utility is hampered by Onix's low Attack stat.


Checks & Counters
########

**Multi-Hit Moves**: Onix has the most trouble with certain setup sweepers, such as Shellder, that can outpace it or have multi-hit moves. Though Taunt prevents Shellder from setting up, it is a major threat to Onix because it can bypass Sturdy with Icicle Spear.

**Bulky Fighting-types**: Onix has a very low Attack stat, so any bulky Fighting-type can switch into Earthquake and recover any lost HP with Drain Punch.

**Bulky Grass-types**: Similar to Fighting-types, Grass-types can break Onix easily while healing themselves of any Earthquake or Rock Blast damage with Giga Drain.

**Drilbur**: Drilbur is very good at countering Onix due its access to Rapid Spin and Mold Breaker allowing it to KO through Sturdy.
