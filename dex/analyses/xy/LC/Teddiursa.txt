Overview
########

Teddiursa is blessed with a massive offensive movepool and a great ability in Quick Feet, which increases Teddiursa's Speed while it is inflicted with status. Because of Quick Feet, Toxic Orb allows Teddiursa to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. In addition to great Speed, Teddiursa has a high Attack stat which enables it to hit very hard, especially with Facade. Although Teddiursa reaches an impressive 21 Speed after Toxic Orb's activation, it is still outsped by many Choice Scarf users, and a lack of priority means that it is susceptible to priority attacks itself. Its defenses are mediocre as well; this is further compounded by the fact that Teddiursa's health will be whittled away by Toxic damage. It is also weak to Fighting-type moves and cannot boost its defenses with Eviolite, as it must hold Toxic Orb in order to be effective.

Quick Feet
########
name: Quick Feet
move 1: Facade
move 2: Close Combat
move 3: Crunch
move 4: Protect / Swords Dance
ability: Quick Feet
item: Toxic Orb
evs: 36 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpD / 196 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Coming off Teddiursa's high Attack, Facade is a powerful STAB move after Teddiursa is poisoned. Close Combat usually 2HKOes Ferroseed and punishes other Steel-types, such as Pawniard and Magnemite. Crunch lets Teddiursa nail Gastly and other Ghost-types while providing excellent coverage with Facade. Protect is for activating Toxic Orb safely and stopping Fake Out. However, if Teddiursa is able to be brought in safely, Swords Dance is a useful alternative, as at +2, Teddiursa is able to muscle past even the bulkiest opponents.

Set Details
========

196 Attack EVs are necessary in order for Teddiursa's attacks to hit as hard as possible, while 196 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Teddiursa to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame at 21 Speed after Toxic Orb's activation. The remaining EVs are placed in HP, Defense, and Special Defense to increase Teddiursa's bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Bring Teddiursa in on a free switch through a revenge kill or from a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. Teddiursa usually cannot afford to take hits when poisoned. Avoid keeping Teddiursa in for too long as Toxic damage will rack up and Teddiursa lacks recovery. Teddiursa functions best as a late-game cleaner after its bulkier opponents have been worn down by entry hazards and residual damage.

Team Options
========

Teddiursa appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Dwebble, Archen, and Ferroseed. However, Teddiursa also cannot afford to take damage from entry hazards, so an offensive Rapid Spin user such as Staryu or Drilbur makes a good teammate. Knock Off users such as Pawniard, Tirtouga, Mienfoo, and Timburr remove important walls' items so that Teddiursa can break through them more easily. Trubbish checks Fighting-type threats, particularly Timburr, and can lay Spikes quite easily, while a late-game sweeper such as Life Orb Abra can finish off weakened teams or punch holes in things for Teddiursa to finish off. Slow pivots such as Vullaby and Chinchou can provide a safe switch for Teddiursa.

Other Options
########

Teddiursa can run a Belly Drum set, but it's inferior to other Belly Drum users such as Zigzagoon and Magby. Teddiursa has one of the largest physical movepools out there, with access to Earthquake, Rock Slide, Seed Bomb, Gunk Shot, Fire Punch, Ice Punch, and Thunder Punch. These moves can be used situationally to counter defensive threats weak to them.

Checks & Counters
########

**Timburr**: Timburr can come in on Teddiursa after Toxic damage wears it down a little and KO it with Mach Punch.

**Choice Scarf users**: Scraggy, Drilbur and Pawniard are common Choice Scarf users that outspeed Teddiursa and hit it very hard with their STAB moves.

**Priority moves**: Fletchling, Bunnelby, Carvanha, and Timburr can all finish Teddiursa off when it is weakened.

**Physical walls**: Bulky walls, particularly those with recovery such as Spritzee, Vullaby, and Hippopotas, are able to stall for Toxic damage and weaken Teddiursa to a point where it can be finished off. However, they can be overpowered if Teddiursa uses Swords Dance.
