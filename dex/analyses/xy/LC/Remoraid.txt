Overview
########

Remoraid is quite threatening due to its excellent STAB moves, Water Spout and Hydro Pump, and a vast coverage movepool. Its workable offensive stats and Speed coupled with its excellent capabilities with Choice items make it a viable offensive threat. However, Remoraid's poor defenses make it very easy to eliminate and its lack of priority moves renders it useless versus faster opponents.

Moves
========

Water Spout is Remoraid's most threatening move, as it is the most powerful move in the game when Remoraid is at full health. Hydro Pump provides Remoraid with a secondary Water-type STAB option that is almost as powerful as Water Spout in case its HP is lowered significantly. Fire Blast is a fantastic coverage move, allowing Remoraid to hit Steel- and Grass-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Bullet Seed, bolstered by Remoraid's base 65 Attack stat, provides Remoraid with a means to hit Chinchou rather hard. Ice Beam can be used instead of Bullet Seed in order to hit Lileep and Flying-types for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

The EVs give Remoraid boosts to both its offensive stats and Speed, allowing it to outspeed and OHKO or 2HKO a large number of Pokemon in Little Cup. Hustle boosts the power of Bullet Seed, allowing Remoraid to nab some important KOs on opposing Water-type Pokemon, such as Chinchou. A Naive nature increases Remoraid's Speed even further while coming at no real cost to Remoraid, as it generally can't survive powerful attacks regardless; it is selected over Hasty due to the fact that most priority attacks are physical.

Usage Tips
========

Remoraid's best strategy is simply to spam Water Spout, hitting everything that doesn't resist Water for big damage. Be sure to avoid opponents with priority moves, as these will severely lower Water Spout's damage output. Remoraid performs most effectively if switched in when the foe doesn't attack, so a VoltTurn strategy is very effective; this allows its HP to remain at full and its Water Spout to be quite potent.

Team Options
========

Bulkier Pokemon aid Remoraid by taking hits that would otherwise severely damage it; its weaknesses, Electric and Grass, can be covered by a variety of Pokemon, such as Magnemite and Foongus. Entry hazard support from the likes of Drilbur and Onix is appreciated, as it assists Remoraid in KOing some of the bulkier Pokemon in the metagame. Likewise, entry hazard removers, such as Vullaby and Drilbur, are extremely helpful in keeping Remoraid at full health. VoltTurn users, especially slow ones, allow Remoraid to switch in without taking a hit. Knock Off support from Pokemon such as Pawniard is extremely beneficial, as it softens up opposing walls, which makes it easier for Remoraid to break through them.

Other Options
########

A Life Orb set can be utilized, as it allows Remoraid to vary its attacks, a feat unattainable when locked into a move by a Choice item. Scald is a more reliable Water-type STAB move with a useful added burn chance. Rock Blast provides Remoraid with a means of hitting Mantyke, which can otherwise tank all of Remoraid's attacks with ease. Thunder Wave is a good move to cripple enemies on a non-Choice item set, but Remoraid lacks the bulk to effectively spread paralysis. Scope Lens, coupled with the use of Focus Energy, gives Remoraid a 100% chance to land a critical hit, which will be boosted by Sniper. If it can survive at full HP for one turn, it can then launch a 2.25x Water Spout, which OHKOes most of the metagame. However, Scope Lens leaves Remoraid easily revenge killed, and this set has difficulty finding opportunity to set up. Hidden Power Grass can be used in lieu of another coverage move to hit Water-types with lower Special Defense, but a Hustle-boosted Bullet Seed usually does the job just fine. A purely physical Choice set can also work, but it can't make use of Remoraid's best move, Water Spout.

Checks & Counters
########

**Revenge Killers**: Other Choice Scarf users can outspeed and kill Remoraid before it gets a chance to land Water Spout. Fletchling and Pawniard both can either KO Remoraid or severely weaken its Water Spout with their respective strong priority attacks, Acrobatics and Sucker Punch.

**Paralysis**: Remoraid finds itself utterly helpless after being paralyzed, as many attackers will outspeed and OHKO it.

**Special Walls**: Remoraid has difficulty breaking through special walls, such as Munchlax and Mantyke, as they can shrug off any hit that Remoraid throws at them.

**Bulky Grass-types**: Foongus and Pumpkaboo can take a Fire Blast and KO Remoraid with Giga Drain and Bullet Seed, respectively.
