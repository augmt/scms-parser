Overview
########

With base 105 Special Attack, Solosis ties with Abra for the highest Special Attack stat in Little Cup. Solosis also has great abilities in Magic Guard, which it can use to avoid passive damage; and Regenerator, which allows it to recover some of its health. Sadly, Solosis has average bulk and is weak to Knock Off, which hinders its durability. Solosis is also outclassed by Abra outside of Trick Room teams, as Solosis needs Trick Room to function well.

Moves
========

Trick Room allows Solosis to "outspeed" almost everything for four turns. Psychic is the STAB move of choice and is used to deal solid damage. Shadow Ball offers coverage against Ghost-types, such as Gastly, as well as opposing Psychic-types such as Abra. Hidden Power Fighting can OHKO Pawniard and hit some other Dark-type Pokemon. It also hits Steel-type Pokemon such as Magnemite.

Set Details
========

The spread's purpose is to maximize Special Attack, putting Solosis at 22 Special Attack. The rest of the EVs go into bulk, allowing a healthy Solosis to survive one Shadow Ball from Gastly or one Sucker Punch from Pawniard when its holding Eviolite. 1 Attack IV is used so that Solosis's Hidden Power type is Fighting, while also minimizing damage from Foul Play and confusion. 0 Speed IVs ensure that Solosis is slower than the opponent, which is crucial for it to function effectively under Trick Room. Regenerator allows Solosis to regain some of its health in order to prolong its longevity. Magic Guard can be used to avoid all passive damage.

Usage Tips
========

After Solosis has set up Trick Room, it can either start denting the opponent's team or switch out to regain some health if its ability is Regenerator. Solosis should not get hit by Knock Off, which will take away its Eviolite-granted bulk. It's also recommended that Solosis doesn't get hit by super effective attacks until it's ready to sweep, so that Regenerator can restore most of the health loss and Solosis can switch back in and set up Trick Room more often. If Solosis is using Regenerator as its ability, it can be used as a bulky pivot early- or mid-game to set up Trick Room for its teammates while it recovers its health when switching out. If Solosis is using Magic Guard as its ability, it can be used to take status, such as burn and poison, without the fear of being worn down. Solosis can also use Life Orb as its item when it has Magic Guard as its ability, as Magic Guard prevents Life Orb recoil.

Team Options
========

Mienfoo and Timburr can use Knock Off to remove Eviolite from opposing Pokemon and take down Pawniard and Porygon, which are common switch-ins to Solosis. Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull can KO Vullaby, which is able to take all of Solosis's attacks. Steel-types usually give Solosis a hard time, which makes Magnemite, which can trap and KO them, a great partner. Slow sweepers such as Azurill, Bunnelby, Cubone, and Trapinch benefit from Solosis's wallbreaking capabilities and ability to set up Trick Room.

Other Options
########

Life Orb can be used in conjunction with Magic Guard to hit even harder, although Solosis won't be able to take attacks very well without Eviolite. Overcoat may be used so that Solosis can switch into Foongus's Spore and threaten it, but this is rarely necessary. Substitute may replace Shadow Ball so that Solosis can avoid Pawniard's Sucker Punch and KO it with Hidden Power Fighting. Thunder can replace Shadow Ball or Hidden Power Fighting in order to hit Vullaby and other Flying-types, although its lack of accuracy makes it unreliable. Solosis can use Recover over Shadow Ball to have a more reliable form of recovery than Regenerator, but Solosis doesn't have the time to recover its health while Trick Room is active, and Regenerator is usually sufficient recovery. Thunder Wave can replace Trick Room so that Solosis can cripple, outspeed, and possibly KO its checks.

Checks & Counters
########

**Stunky**: Stunky is immune to Psychic, resists Shadow Ball, and is neutral to Hidden Power Fighting. Stunky can trap Solosis with Pursuit or KO it with Sucker Punch.

**Knock Off**: Knock Off removes Solosis's Eviolite and thus its bulk, and after that, most attacks will be able to finish Solosis off.

**Pawniard**: Pawniard can KO Solosis with Sucker Punch 81.3% of the time after Stealth Rock damage, unless Solosis is carrying Substitute.

**Vullaby**: Vullaby can take any of Solosis's attacks except Thunder, then use Roost to recover any health lost and KO Solosis with Knock Off.

**Bulky Normal-types**: Bulky Normal-types such as Porygon and Lickitung, are able to take Hidden Power Fighting and Psychic and regain their health with Recover and Wish, respectively. Munchlax is able to Pursuit trap Solosis without taking too much damage from Hidden Power Fighting.

**Protect**: Protect stalls out Trick Room turns, which is very disadvantageous for Solosis.

**Fake Out**: Fake Out also stalls out Trick Room turns and wears Solosis down as well.
