Overview
########

At first glance, Fletchling looks very unimpressive. Its stats are quite mediocre, its typing is lackluster defensively, and its physical options are limited. However, Fletchling's ability Gale Wings gives priority to all Flying-type moves, which means it has access to priority Acrobatics, the strongest priority move in Little Cup if it is not holding an item, as well as priority healing with Roost. Gale Wings Acrobatics makes Fletchling a deadly sweeper and a fearsome revenge killer that is able to KO most of the Fighting-type Pokemon in the tier. While it is sometimes walled by Rock- and Steel-types, Fletchling has options such as Hidden Power Grass and Overheat to deal with them, and it only requires a small amount of support to sweep through teams. However, its bulk is poor, especially as it chooses not to run an item in most instances, so anything that can take an Acrobatics will usually KO it in return. Fletchling is also vulnerable to status, particularly burn and paralysis, so it must be used carefully or it will be unable to sweep effectively.

Physical Sweeper
########
name: Physical Sweeper (Fletch Kills)
move 1: Acrobatics
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Roost
ability: Gale Wings
evs: 156 HP / 196 Atk / 92 Def / 52 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Acrobatics is Fletchling's strongest attack and is the attack it will use to sweep. It breaks through Fighting- and Grass-type opponents and will do a hefty chunk to anything that doesn't resist it. It hits with priority too, making Fletchling difficult to revenge kill. After a single boost from Swords Dance, Fletchling is able to sweep teams with ease, once Rock-, Electric-, and Steel-types are out of the way. U-turn lets Fletchling scout opponents as well as gain offensive momentum by scaring off things Acrobatics can KO. Roost is a means of healing that is good at getting Fletchling out of tough spots, as it has priority and removes Fletchling's Flying-type for the turn.

Set Details
========

Gale Wings is the best ability Fletchling can use. It gives priority to Acrobatics and Roost, granting Fletchling the ability to sweep teams and heal itself from a bad position. Fletchling prefers to run no item for Acrobatics to hit with 110 Base Power immediately. It can choose to run Berry Juice, but Roost eliminates the need for it. Fletchling's mediocre Attack stat means it must run 196 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature for Acrobatics to be powerful enough to sweep. The remaining EVs are put into bulk so that Fletchling can take some hits and even act as a Knock Off absorber for non-STAB Knock Off. The 156 HP EVs ensure Fletchling recovers 11 HP from Roost.

Usage Tips
========

Fletchling is a potent late-game sweeper that can sweep teams once its counters are taken out. It's also a fantastic revenge killer, with priority Acrobatics being able to cut opposing sweeps short. Fletchling can scare away some opponents and force switches, so it can set up a Swords Dance and start sweeping or use U-turn and switch out to a better matchup. Fletchling is still frail, however, and must not be used carelessly or you might lose it before it gets a chance to sweep.

Team Options
========

Fletching is walled by Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-type Pokemon and cannot sweep if they're around. Therefore, a Ground-type partner such as Diglett or Drilbur is very helpful. Diglett can trap and pick off threats such as Pawniard, Magnemite, and Chinchou as well as set up Stealth Rock, making it easier for Fletchling to sweep. Drilbur is also able to deal with the aforementioned treats and set up Stealth Rock, with a higher Attack stat, but it lacks the ability to trap opponents. Knock Off users such as Mienfoo and Pawniard are also valuable partners to Fletchling, as they can use Knock Off to cripple its would-be checks and counters, which Fletchling always appreciates. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Chinchou, Magnemite, or Mienfoo can form a VoltTurn core with Fletchling and give it a easy time coming in and threatening opponents.

Mixed Attacker
########
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Acrobatics
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Roost
move 4: Overheat / Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Fighting
ability: Gale Wings
evs: 156 HP / 200 Atk / 92 Def / 40 SpA / 20 Spe
nature: Naughty

Moves
========

Fletchling relies on Acrobatics to sweep, as it is Fletchling's strongest attack, capable of doing a large chunk of damage to anything that does not resist it. It also hits with priority, making Fletchling difficult to stop. U-turn lets Fletchling escape from a tough spot and is also useful for scouting or gaining a better matchup. Roost lets Fletchling heal with priority and remove its Flying typing for the turn. Overheat is an option that nails Magnemite and Pawniard and KOes them after Stealth Rock damage. Hidden Power Grass will punish Tirtouga and other Rock-types, while Hidden Power Fighting can manage both Steel- and Rock-types but is much less powerful than Overheat and probably won't net the same KOs.

Set Details
========

Gale Wings gives priority to all of Fletchling's Flying-type moves, which turns it into a deadly sweeper or revenge killer. Priority Acrobatics can tear through teams, while priority Roost can get Fletchling out of a tight spot. Fletchling likes to run no item so Acrobatics hits hard immediately, and it needs to run 196 Attack EVs with a Naughty nature in order to have a high enough Attack stat to sweep. The other reason for using a Naughty nature is so Fletchling can run just 40 Special Attack EVs in order to OHKO Magnemite with Overheat and offensive Tirtouga with Hidden Power Grass, both after Stealth Rock damage. The remaining EVs should be invested into HP and Defense in order to give Fletchling better bulk.

Usage Tips
========

This set is designed to lure in Pokemon that would normally counter Fletchling. If your opponent is likely to switch in something to wall Fletchling that it can hit, such as Pawniard or Magnemite, then go for the appropriate coverage move. However, if Fletchling is missing the right coverage, then go for U-turn and force a more favorable matchup. Acrobatics should be used to tear through teams once threats and counters are removed, and Roost can save you from losing Fletchling prematurely. Even with Roost, Fletchling is still frail, especially on the special side, so avoid reckless play and be sure to keep it free from status, which will surely cripple Fletchling and prevent it from sweeping effectively.

Team Options
========

Most of the Pokemon Fletchling is designed to lure in have the ability Sturdy, so prior damage from entry hazards is a must in order to KO certain threats, particularly Magnemite and Tirtouga. Partners such as Diglett and Drilbur are excellent at this, as they not only can set up Stealth Rock but can also pick off Fletchling's counters with Earthquake. Diglett also has the ability to trap threats and ensure that they are dealt with. Pawniard can also set up Stealth Rock and discourage Defog. It has access to Knock Off as well, weakening some opponents that are normally too bulky for Fletchling to get past by removing their Eviolite. Mienfoo, Chinchou, or Magnemite can form a VoltTurn core with Fletchling and give it a clear shot at sweeping. Mienfoo can also help out with Knock Off, while Chinchou and Magnemite can deal with some of the physically bulkier opponents Fletchling might struggle with.

Other Options
########

Fletchling has a small movepool, so its options are limited; however, Tailwind is a useful option for team support, as Fletchling can use it before it is KOed and speed up its slower teammates for four turns. It also has access to Return as a powerful STAB option, but this doesn't hit anything significant that Acrobatics doesn't aside from Chinchou. Steel Wing can be used to hit Archen, but it's only a 2HKO at best, and Fletchling will be outsped if it uses it. Natural Gift can be used with an Apicot Berry for a 100 Base Power Ground-type attack that can nail threats such as Magnemite, Pawniard, and Tirtouga without hindering the power of Acrobatics. Fletchling can choose to use Berry Juice, but it holds back the power of Acrobatics and is redundant with Roost. Flame Charge is also redundant, as Fletchling doesn't gain an advantage with a Speed increase.

Checks & Counters
########

**Archen**: OHKOes with Stone Edge and OHKOes 75% of the time when Defeatist is active. Fletchling can only threaten Archen if it has Steel Wing, but it is outsped anyway.

**Tirtouga**: Tirtouga has an easy time setting up on sets not carrying Hidden Power Grass and nails Fletchling with Rock Slide or Stone Edge.

**Magnemite**: If Magnemite's Sturdy is still intact, then it can take an Overheat and heal back to full health with Berry Juice before taking Fletchling out with Volt Switch or Thunderbolt.

**Chinchou**: Fletchling only 3HKOes Chinchou at best with Hidden Power Grass, and Chinchou KOes it in return with its STAB Electric-type moves.

**Rock-types**: Dwebble and Onix can take anything Fletchling can throw at them thanks to Sturdy and KO it with Rock Blast.

**Status Inducers**: Fletchling hates being paralyzed or burned, and status inducers, such as Slowpoke, that can take an Acrobatics and cripple Fletchling with Thunder Wave in return thus make good checks.
