Overview
########

Anorith's huge Attack stat is what jumps out at first glance. Its ability to both spin and set entry hazards sets it apart from other spinners. Anorith occupies an excellent Speed tier, with its 18 Speed allowing it to outspeed Drilbur and Taunt Mienfoo. It can even sweep with a Swords Dance set late-game, although hazard control should be Anorith's main goal. However, Anorith is very frail, even with Eviolite, meaning that it often cannot switch in safely to Rapid Spin away entry hazards. It is also weak to those entry hazards, specifically Stealth Rock, severely limiting its usefulness. Anorith's Attack stat is also wasted due to its shallow movepool, which leaves it unable to harm Fighting-types.

Support
#######
name: Support
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Rapid Spin
move 3: Rock Blast
move 4: Knock Off / X-Scissor
ability: Battle Armor
item: Berry Juice / Eviolite
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

With Anorith's 18 Speed, it can set up Stealth Rock extremely early in the game, Speed tying with the most prominent Taunt user, Mienfoo. Rapid Spin allows Anorith to get rid of opposing hazards without relying on Defog. Rock Blast is useful in that it allows Anorith to break through Substitutes and Focus Sash, while being more accurate than Stone Edge. This allows Anorith to be an anti-lead to Sticky Web teams. Knock Off cripples defensive threats and slower offensive threats by removing their item, often paving the way for other teammates to sweep. X-Scissor is a great alternate STAB move if Knock Off is not needed.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed are a must because of Anorith's frailty, huge Attack stat, and reliance on its 18 Speed to be truly effective. The remainder EVs are put into Defense to increase it by one point. Berry Juice is the best item for Anorith, as it promotes longevity allowing Anorith to switch in on Stealth Rock and spin them away throughout the match. However, Eviolite can be used on more offensive teams, as Anorith would only need to spin Stealth Rock away once if at all.

Usage Tips
========

Anorith has the fastest Stealth Rock in the tier, letting it set entry hazards before most opponents can KO it, and this should be utilized to the greatest extent. Since Anorith reaches 18 Speed, it can be used as an emergency revenge killer if needed. Knock Off should be used after entry hazards are set to help out Anorith's teammates. Anorith should be kept away from 19 Speed Pokemon, such as Abra, as they can usually KO it before Anorith can do anything.

Team Options
========

Combining Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin onto one Pokemon frees up a team slot. Offensive sweepers love Anorith's ability to clear hazards for them, set up hazards to weaken the opponent, and get rid of Eviolite. Anorith lures out Pawniard, so Fighting-types make good partners to take advantage of that. Scraggy and Timburr can take advantage of the hazards and Anorith's tendency to lure in Pawniard to set up a Dragon Dance or a Bulk Up. Chinchou can switch into Water- and Steel-type moves easily, while Anorith can remove Lileep with X-Scissor also threaten common walls with Knock Off. Ferroseed resists all of Anorith's weaknesse, while providing Spikes to complement Anorith's Stealth Rock.

Life Orb Swords Dance
#######
name: Life Orb Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: X-Scissor
move 3: Rock Blast
move 4: Aerial Ace / Knock Off
ability: Battle Armor
item: Life Orb
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

After a Swords Dance, factoring in Life Orb, Anorith reaches an impressive 49 Attack. This is massive in Little Cup and can easily devastate teams. X-Scissor is a reliable STAB move, destroying Pokemon such as Slowpoke and Lileep. Rock Blast is used to break through Focus Sash and Sturdy, as well as Substitute. Aerial Ace is the preferred fourth move, as it allows Anorith to hit Fighting-types with a super effective attack, often OHKOing late-game. However, Knock Off can be used in its place if Anorith is used alongside another sweeper, as not many threats like taking massive damage from a +2 attack and also losing their item.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed are necessary because of Anorith's frailty, huge Attack stat, and reliance on Speed to be effective. The remaining EVs increase its Defense by one point. An Adamant nature is not effective at all, as Anorith's biggest niche is its high base Speed, and not hitting 18 Speed really hurts. A Life Orb gives Anorith the power it needs to secure key OHKOs, such as on Pawniard and Mienfoo.

Usage Tips
========

This is a glass cannon of a set and should be used on a revenge kill, or after a Memento. Since Anorith reaches 18 Speed, it is not often outsped, meaning it can usually sweep late-game. With Rock Blast, Anorith is a decent answer to Pokemon such as Fletchling and Dwebble, breaking Dwebble's Sturdy + Berry Juice combination and hitting Fletchling with a super effective 2x move. Priority really hurts Anorith, so be careful around Pokemon such as Pawniard and Timburr.

Team Options
========

Removing hazards is a must for this set, as Anorith is weak to both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Staryu is excellent due to its Water typing and reliable recovery, although Drilbur can be used with great success as well. Anorith only has a maximum of 18 Speed, so 19 Speed Pokemon such as Staryu can be big threats. Accordingly, Pokemon that can switch in and beat Staryu, such as Foongus or Chinchou, are a must.

Other Options
########

Anorith has a small movepool, so its options are limited. Brick Break can be used to OHKO Pawniard without needing a Swords Dance boost and a Life Orb, and it also hits Ferroseed harder than X-Scissor. However, it usually cannot find a slot for it. Anorith can run a Rock Polish set but it cannot use it effectively due to it being walled by almost every Fighting-type. Swift Swim can be used, but once again Anorith is walled by most Fighting-types, not to mention it can't take rain-boosted Aqua Jets among other priority attacks. Speaking of Aqua Jet, Anorith can use it as a priority attack. However, it is very weak outside of rain, and with rain up, Anorith will usually have +2 Speed due to Swift Swim anyway.

Checks & Counters
########

**Faster Pokemon**: Anorith is extremely frail, so Pokemon that are faster than it can usually eliminate it. Abra and Staryu both naturally outspeed and threaten Anorith.

**Choice Scarf users**: Choice Scarf users are even more dangerous than Pokemon that are naturally faster than Anorith, as you usually don't know whether a Pokemon is holding a Choice Scarf or not. This uncertainty can usually end a Swords Dance sweep.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy resist both of Anorith's STAB moves and do not care about Knock Off. Timburr and Scraggy can also set up on Anorith.
