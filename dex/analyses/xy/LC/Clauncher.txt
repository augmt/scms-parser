Overview
########

Clauncher has solid bulk across the board that works well alongside U-turn, making for a bulky Water-type pivot. Although Clauncher has low Speed, it also has STAB priority in Aqua Jet, something that not many other Water-types are able to boast. However, Clauncher still struggles immensely to stand out in a tier packed with other Water-types, including Chinchou, Tirtouga, and Omanyte. Chinchou is Clauncher's greatest competition, as it fills the role of a bulky Water-type pivot arguably better than Clauncher does. Mega Launcher seems neat, but Clauncher lacks the moves its evolution has, most notably Aura Sphere and Dark Pulse. Though Clauncher has Aqua Jet, it's not very powerful and Clauncher's low Speed can still be easily exploited. Furthermore, Clauncher's offenses are quite lacking, and its lower Special Defense stat makes it easier for foes to prey upon both of its weaknesses.

Pivot
########
name: Pivot
move 1: Scald / Water Pulse
move 2: Aqua Jet
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: U-turn
ability: Mega Launcher
item: Eviolite
evs: 92 Atk / 180 Def / 132 SpA / 92 SpD
nature: Relaxed

Moves
========

Scald is a useful move because it punishes switch-ins with its high burn chance backed by decent power. Alternatively, Water Pulse receives a boost from Mega Launcher, which amplifies its power to the same strength as Surf, and has an added chance of confusion. Aqua Jet is a decent STAB priority move with the ability to pick off weakened foes and somewhat mitigate Clauncher's low Speed. Ice Beam hits frailer Grass-types and is able to OHKO Fletchling after Stealth Rock. Sludge Bomb is an option to hit Grass-types and Fairy-types, most notably Cottonee, as well, but the coverage against Flying-types that Ice Beam provides is much more useful to Clauncher. U-turn allows Clauncher to pivot out of its counters; it's not used primarily for its power or coverage.

Set Details
========

With the given EV spread and Eviolite, Clauncher's bulk is boosted to a solid spread of 21 / 24 / 21. This bulk can only be achieved with Eviolite; thus, Berry Juice is not advised. A Relaxed nature lowers Clauncher's Speed to ensure that its U-turn to pivot into foes is slower and thus almost always a safe move. 100 Defense EVs and 172 Special Defense EVs alongside a Sassy nature could be used to let Clauncher take on special attackers, but Clauncher should focus on taking on physical attacks because its weaknesses are primarily special. 132 Special Attack EVs give Clauncher a two-point boost to its Special Attack, making its attacks stronger.

Usage Tips
========

Clauncher should be used as a pivot to come in, take hits, and then use U-turn to switch into a counter to the opposing Pokemon. U-turn should be played smartly, as a well-timed U-turn can easily get Clauncher out of a risky situation; this is most effective when used on predicted switches. Scald should be your main attack, as thanks to its high chance to burn it dissuades physical attackers. Because Clauncher lacks reliable recovery and is susceptible to all forms of entry hazards, be careful about switching Clauncher in and out too much because it will get worn down very quickly.

Team Options
========

Removing entry hazards is crucial to Clauncher's success; Drilbur, Staryu, Archen, and Vullaby are able to do so effectively. This is because Clauncher switches a lot and will thus get worn down extremely quickly if entry hazards are up. Forming a VoltTurn core with Clauncher is a good idea because as a Water-type, it naturally fits into these cores. Larvesta and Mienfoo also have U-turn, while Magnemite has Volt Switch. Chinchou stands out as a partner because it fits well in a VoltTurn core and provides Heal Bell support, along with having decent synergy with Clauncher. Cleric support from the likes of Spritzee and Lickitung is appreciated because Clauncher lacks reliable recovery and is worn down quickly by status, entry hazards, and just generally switching into attacks. Partners that can take on Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon for Clauncher, such as Foongus and Magnemite, are helpful. Frailer sweepers, such as Abra and Gastly, appreciate Clauncher's ability to stomach hits for them and pivot into them with a slow U-turn.

Other Options
########

Clauncher has access to coverage moves ranging from Rock Slide and Flash Cannon to various Hidden Powers, all of which have their uses. Generally, though, it's often best to stick to the coverage on the listed set because it achieves the maximum coverage possible. However, Hidden Power Fire is of notable mention because it can blast past Ferroseed. Hidden Power Grass is also an option to hit Chinchou, but Chinchou usually avoids the 2HKO, making it not worthwhile. While it might seem odd, running Hidden Power Psychic is viable to hit Croagunk. Solely physical or solely special sets could be used, but Clauncher is mainly outclassed by Carvanha, Tirtouga, and Corphish as a physical attacker and by Chinchou, Staryu, Clamperl, and Omanyte as a special attacker. Sludge Wave muscles past Chespin, but Ice Beam hits it regardless and Poison-type moves have poor coverage. Mixed sets with more investment in Speed EVs or a Choice Scarf equipped are options but once again, Clauncher is outclassed by Omanyte and other Water-types in these roles: Clauncher's edge as a pivot lies in its bulk, which it must forfeit if it invests in Speed.

Checks & Counters
########

**Strong Special Attackers**: Special attacks from the likes of Abra and Gastly take advantage of Clauncher's low Special Defense. However, both of these Pokemon must watch out for Aqua Jet and dislike switching directly into Clauncher. It's also important to note that because Clauncher has access to U-turn, it can usually pivot out of its counters.

**Electric-types**: Chinchou can beat Clauncher quite easily because of its Electric-type STAB moves and ability to take all of Clauncher's attacks. The only move it has to worry about is the very uncommon Hidden Power Grass, but even that is stomached by bulkier sets. Magnemite is also a counter because it easily KOes Clauncher with its Electric-type attacks and doesn't mind Clauncher's attacks much.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types resist Clauncher's STAB moves and can KO it in return with their own STAB attacks: Foongus shrugs off Ice Beam and keeps itself healthy via Regenerator, while Ferroseed punishes U-turn with Iron Barbs.

**Residual Damage**: Clauncher is very prone to being worn down by entry hazards, status, and various attacks because of its lack of recovery. Clauncher is susceptible to all entry hazards and statuses as well, so it really has to be careful.

**Bulkier Pokemon**: Bulkier Pokemon, often carrying Eviolite, are able to stomach Clauncher's hits quite easily. These Pokemon include Porygon and Spritzee, which can comfortably take all of Clauncher's attacks and recover health via Recover and Wish, respectively. Croagunk shrugs off all of Clauncher's attacks and recovers health when switching into its Water-type STAB moves thanks to Dry Skin. However, not all of these Pokemon can actually do a lot to Clauncher in return other than take advantage of its lack of recovery to slowly wear it down, and Clauncher can just use U-turn to pivot out.
