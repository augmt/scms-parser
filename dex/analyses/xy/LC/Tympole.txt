Overview
########

While Tympole has interesting coverage options and is faster than other Swift Swim users, it is generally weak and quite frail, which makes it outclassed by other Swift Swim users such as Omanyte and Mantyke. Tympole's frailty means that it is easily revenge killed by Fletchling, Pawniard, and other priority users. Other Swift Swim users also have dual typings, which grants them an extra STAB option as well as more opportunities to set up or switch in.

Rain Sweeper
########
Name: Rain Sweeper
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Sludge Bomb
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Rain Dance
ability: Swift Swim
item: Life Orb
evs: 36 HP / 116 Def / 196 SpA / 36 SpD / 84 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Hydro Pump hits hard, especially under rain, though Scald can be used if you're concerned about Hydro Pump missing. Sludge Bomb hits Grass- and Fairy-types that Hydro Pump misses, such as Snover, Cottonee, and Spritzee, harder than Hydro Pump and has a 30% chance to poison the target. Earth Power allows Tympole to get around Pokemon that rain teams generally struggle with, such as Chinchou, Croagunk, and Pawniard; however, only Berry Juice Chinchou is OHKOed. Rain Dance can be used to support the team or let Tympole sweep on its own.


Set Details
========

A Modest nature maximizes Tympole's Special Attack while hitting 28 Speed in rain and 14 Speed outside of rain. EV The remaining EVs are put into bulk to help against priority attacks. Life Orb maximizes power and Swift Swim gives Tympole great Speed in the rain.


Usage Tips
========

Bring Tympole in early-game to set up rain and weaken the threats to your other rain sweepers. After their checks are gone, rain sweepers such as Omanyte and Mantyke have a chance to sweep.

Team Options
========

Damp Rock Voltorb can serve as a suicide rain setter, letting Tympole come in and sweep for 7 turns. Fighting-types, such as Pancham, Mienfoo, Timburr, and Croagunk, can pick off Munchlax, Ferroseed, and Lileep and cripple walls such as Slowpoke via Knock Off. Pancham also supports Tympole through the use of Parting Shot. Riolu and Purrloin have access priority Rain Dance, which can be useful in a pinch. Other Swift Swim sweepers such as Omanyte, Mantyke, and Horsea can form an offensive core with Tympole; Omanyte specifically can lure in Lileep and hit it with an Ice Beam. Tympole can lure in Chinchou and hit it with Earth Power in order to clear up a sweep for Mantyke and other Swift Swim sweepers. Grass-types such as Cottonee, Pumpkaboo, Foongus, Chespin, and Ferroseed cover Tympole's weaknesses. Ferroseed and Chespin provide great typing synergy with Tympole and can set up Spikes to weaken targets, such as Berry Juice Chinchou, so Tympole can KO them more easily. Foongus has access to Rain Dance and Regenerator, allowing it to consistently set up rain throughout the match while still acting as a decent pivot with Damp Rock.

Other Options
########

Scald has better accuracy than Hydro Pump and a chance to burn on the switch, but Tympole misses out on many important KOs. Substitute and 3 attacks can be used to get around Sucker Punch, but Tympole needs the coverage and ability to set up rain by itself, which acts as a safety net in order for Tympole to maintain a sweep, should it need to. Sludge Wave can be used over Sludge Bomb for more power and the ability to hit Chespin, which would otherwise wall Tympole, but the extra power is negligible, making Sludge Bomb the better option. Hidden Power Grass and Hidden Power Electric both hit other Water-types, with Hidden Power Electric providing better coverage, but these options are generally too weak to KO important targets such as Staryu and Slowpoke. Berry Juice and Eviolite increase Tympole's longevity and bulk, respectively, while Damp Rock extends the number of rain turns; however, the power drop from not having Life Orb is very noticeable.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Lileep, Chespin, and Foongus are all good answers to Tympole as they resist its STAB moves and don't take much damage from Sludge Bomb. Chespin has the bonus of even being immune to Sludge Bomb. Snover changes the weather from rain to hail, which halts Tympole's sweep. Snover can't safely switch into Tympole, however, as it is weak to Sludge Bomb.

**Bulky Normal-types**: Bulky Normal-types such as Porygon, Munchlax, and Lickitung are all good answers to Tympole due to their sheer bulk, which allows them to survive Tympole's Hydro Pump even while under rain.

**Paralysis**: Paralysis stops Tympole's sweep by quartering Tympole's Speed.

**Priority Users**: Pawniard, Croagunk, and Fletchling can easily revenge kill Tympole because they bypass Swift Swim and hit Tympole before it can strike them.

**Bulky Water-types**: Water-types such as Staryu, Slowpoke, Chinchou, and Skrelp all resist Tympole's STAB moves, but Chinchou and Skrelp fear Earth Power. The other two don't take much damage from either of Tympole's coverage moves, allowing them to eliminate Tympole or stall out rain turns with Recover.
