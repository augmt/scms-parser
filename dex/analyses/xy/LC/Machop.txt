Overview
########

Machop has retained its place as the only Pokemon that can carry both No Guard and Dynamic Punch, a notoriously deadly combination. Not only does Dynamic Punch benefit a lot from No Guard, but other moves, such as Rock Slide, benefit from the perfect accuracy too. Machop also has access to a lot of good coverage moves such as Knock Off and Poison Jab, and it has solid bulk and a decent HP stat in addition to a strong Attack stat. However, it sees less usage than some other Fighting-types, because besides its No Guard + Dynamic punch combination, it is outclassed in almost every way.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Dynamic Punch
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Poison Jab
item: Choice Scarf
ability: No Guard
nature: Jolly
evs: 36 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe


Moves
========

Because of No Guard, all moves hit with 100% accuracy. As such, Dynamic Punch, which otherwise has 50% accuracy, will hit every time. Dynamic Punch is Machop's best STAB move, as it has a massive Base Power as well as a 100% chance to confuse the opposing Pokemon. Knock Off allows Machop to take on Ghost-type Pokemon, while also allowing it to remove other Pokemon's items, leaving them more vulnerable to attack. Rock Slide can do a lot of damage to Flying-types, Pokemon that can present a serious threat to Machop. Poison Jab finishes off Machop's coverage, giving it the ability to defeat Fairy-types more easily. It's important to note that these moves are specifically intended for this coverage. Dynamic Punch will reliably deal the most neutral damage to any Pokemon and should be frequently taken advantage of.

Set Details
========

Choice Scarf is an absolutely necessary item, as in conjunction with a Jolly nature, it brings Machop to 21 Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. The EV spread maximizes Attack and Speed, with a small amount going into increasing bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Machop must be played carefully. Switch it out when a dangerous Psychic- or Flying-type, such as Abra or Fletchling, comes in, even when it is weak to the move Machop is locked into. Predicting switches and responding using appropriate coverage moves really comes in handy, and you should obviously select the most powerful coverage move for any given situation. Knock Off is the best move to use early-game, because it gets rid of the opponent's item and leaves them weakened. Dynamic Punch is extremely powerful, but it only has a 8 PP. Lastly, avoid switching Machop into most attacks. If it's a resisted attack, that's preferable to a strong neutral hit or a super effective hit, but Machop should mostly switch in after an ally has fainted.

Team Options
========

For Machop to be a significant threat, it requires a good deal of support, especially Pokemon that it can switch out to. Any bulky Steel-types, such as Magnemite and Ferroseed, resist Machop's weaknesses to Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks and can therefore switch into them. Magnemite also resists Flying-type attacks, another threat to Machop. Slow U-turn and Volt Switch users, such as Vullaby and Magnemite, respectively, give Machop a safe switch in. A Dark-type like Pawniard can come in handy when it comes to Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon, especially if it has Pursuit to trap them.

Other Options
########

A Choice Band set can deal more damage to opponents, but it prevents Machop from being as fast as it is with a Choice Scarf. It could, however, be useful on a Sticky Web team, where Machop doesn't need stellar Speed to be a threat. Its Flying-type weakness would persist, though, as Flying-types aren't affected by Sticky Web. Most other sets and moves Machop that has access to are better used by other Fighting-types.


Checks & Counters
########

**Physical Tanks**: Machop deals negligible damage to bulky Pokemon, especially Pokemon that resist Dynamic Punch. Some of these Pokemon include Koffing, Larvesta, Slowpoke, and Spritzee.

**Status Moves**: Burn and paralysis inhibit Machop. If it's burned, it will have a difficult time punching its way through any Pokemon. Paralysis impedes Machop, keeping it from outspeeding the Pokemon that it needs to fight.

**Faster Attackers**: With a Choice Scarf, Machop is fast. However, other Choice Scarf Pokemon are faster. These quick attackers take advantage of their superior Speed to take Machop down. Pokemon with priority moves, particularly Acrobatics Fletchling, can be an even bigger threat.

**Ghost-types**: Having a Choice Scarf locks Machop into one move. If a Ghost-type switches into a Dynamic Punch, Machop will be forced to switch out.
