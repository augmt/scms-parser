Overview
########

Geodude is a solid SturdyJuice Stealth Rock lead, with powerful STAB attacks, a base 100 Defense, and a base 80 Attack. It has poor Speed, but it is able to bypass this with Sucker Punch. However, Geodude fulfills a role that many other Pokemon do. Drilbur can also set Stealth Rock, and can remove them as well and is faster and more powerful. Geodude, however, has a Rock / Ground typing, which allows it to have two different viable STAB attacks. Geodude also faces competition from Onix and Bonsly. Geodude has Counter, Sucker Punch, and more power than Onix, but doesn't have as much Speed and doesn't get Taunt. Because of its typing, Geodude gets STAB Earthquake over Bonsly, but also is weaker to Water-, Grass-, and Ice-type attacks.

Moves
========

Stealth Rock deals damage to Pokemon switching in, so it is helpful for breaking Sturdy and Focus Sash on some Pokemon and assuring important OHKOes or 2HKOes against other Pokemon. Sucker Punch can get the surprise priority hit on a lot of Pokemon, but Counter can be used to take out opposing Pokemon, especially Fighting-types, that try to take out Geodude in one hit. Earthquake is a powerful Ground-type STAB move that helps Geodude get around Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon. Rock Blast is a powerful STAB move that hits Flying-types such as Fletchling extremely hard. It also hits multiple times, allowing it to bypass Substitutes, Sturdy, and Focus Sash.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment allows Geodude to be as big a threat as possible, with max Defense increasing survivability. These HP EVs bring Geodude to 21 HP, so Berry Juice will always reset Sturdy. Sturdy and Berry Juice work together to allow Geodude to survive at least two hits, with the exception of abnormal situations such as Mold Breaker.

Usage Tips
========

Stealth Rock should almost always be used first, as the earlier entry hazards are set up the more effect they can have. However, if the opponent clearly intends to overpower Geodude physically, Counter can score you a free KO. Geodude is also really helpful mid-game, as it can tank several hits. For example, Geodude can take Fletchling's Acrobatics and attack back with a super effective Rock Blast.

Team Options
========

Fletchling and other sweepers enjoy entry hazard support, as it breaks Sturdy on certain Pokemon and easily turns 2HKOs into OHKOs. Foongus and other bulky Grass-types that can switch into Water- and Grass-type attacks help to keep Geodude alive and functional. Geodude doesn't appreciate entry hazards that break Sturdy, but it also doesn't like its own entry hazards being removed. As such, a Rapid Spin user, such as Drilbur or Staryu, helps to keep your side of the field clear while still keeping Geodude's hazards intact. Mold Breaker Drilbur is also useful for taking out opposing SturdyJuice leads. Geodude also appreciates Ghost-types to block Rapid Spin and Pawniard to discourage the use of Defog.

Other Options
########

Geodude has access to the elemental punches, which allow it to get around certain Pokemon. It also gets Explosion, which can be used on a suicide lead set. This is unwise to run, as Explosion often won't deal a lot of damage and the moveslot required would be much better used doing something else. Geodude has access to Rock Polish, which gives it the potential to sweep teams, although it's heavily outclassed as a sweeper by more offensive Pokemon, such as Tirtouga and Drilbur. Also, Stone Edge and Rock Slide are two powerful Rock-type STAB moves with their own merits the Geodude can use.

Checks & Counters
########

**Water- and Grass-type Attacks**: Both Water- and Grass-type Pokemon take neutral damage from Stealth Rock and hit Geodude with 4x super effective attacks that can easily OHKO, assuming that Sturdy has been broken.

**Fighting-types**: Most Fighting-types carry Knock Off and some super effective move, namely Drain Punch or High Jump Kick, allowing them to easily take Geodude out in two turns.

**Utility**: Fake Out and Knock Off make survival for Geodude a serious problem, as they break Sturdy and remove Berry Juice, respectively. Taunt and Encore stop Geodude from functioning properly, hindering how well it can support a team. Defog and Rapid Spin remove Geodude's Stealth Rock, effectively ruining its use.

**Mold Breaker**: An Earthquake from Drilbur or Cranidos bypasses Sturdy and OHKOes Geodude, often preventing it from even getting up Stealth Rock.
