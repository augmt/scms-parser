Overview
########

Froakie's niche lies in its ability, Protean, which changes Froakie's type to match that of the move it is using. While this in itself may not seem interesting, it also provides Froakie with a STAB boost on every single attack it uses. Coupled with a usable base 62 Special Attack stat and Life Orb, Froakie hits fairly hard. To take advantage of this, Froakie has a wide array of both physical and special attacks that let it hit most targets for fairly good damage. Froakie's good Speed stat lets it hit 17 Speed, allowing it to outspeed a good portion of the metagame. However, Froakie's poor defenses force it to rely on OHKOing foes before taking any damage, which makes it very susceptible to priority, namely Fletchling's Acrobatics. Furthermore, Froakie's Speed stat, while good, still leaves it outsped by common threats such as Diglett and Gastly.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ground
ability: Protean
item: Life Orb
evs: 72 Atk / 36 Def / 184 SpA / 188 Spe
ivs: 0 HP / 30 SpA or 0 HP / 30 SpA / 30 SpD
nature: Naive

Moves
========

Hydro Pump is Froakie's most powerful attack and hits most foes for respectable damage. Ice Beam provides much-needed coverage against Grass- and Flying-types, such as Cottonee and Vullaby, respectively. The third slot is dedicated to whatever coverage move is needed. Hidden Power Grass is an option against opposing Water-types. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Magnemite, which would otherwise OHKO Froakie. Both options hit Chinchou, but Hidden Power Ground is generally better because using it changes Froakie into a Ground-type, giving it an immunity to Volt Switch. U-turn is used to provide momentum and to scout.

Set Details
========

The Special Attack and Speed EVs maximize Froakie's special damage output and let it hit its maximum possible Speed. A Naive nature boosts Froakie's Speed even further, while 68 Attack EVs slightly boost U-turn's power. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to let Froakie take physical priority attacks better. The IVs are chosen for the Hidden Powers; for example, an IV spread of 0 HP / 30 SpA lets Froakie have Hidden Power Grass, while a spread of 0 HP / 30 SpA / 30 SpD lets Froakie have Hidden Power Ground. Protean is the given ability to give Froakie STAB on all of its attacks.

Usage Tips
========

Froakie should function as a cleaner that can pick off most weakened foes, as if it attempts to KO a foe at full health and fails, it risks being KOed in return. Froakie also should come in via either a slow U-turn or Volt Switch or after a teammate has fainted, as Froakie cannot take any sort of hit. Froakie should also pick up momentum with U-turn when needed. Lastly, Ice Beam should be the most used attack, as it has perfect accuracy, unlike Hydro Pump.

Team Options
========

Slower Pokemon that have access to Volt Switch or U-turn make for great partners, as they can bring Froakie in safely without risking it being hit; Pokemon such as Chinchou and slow Mienfoo do this job well. Entry hazard setters, such as Ferroseed and Dwebble, are almost a must for Froakie, as they help it score more KOs. Defog support from the likes of Vullaby is also good, as Froakie will be worn down between Life Orb and switching out with U-turn. Priority sponges are also good, as Froakie's defenses are very low and priority moves will likely KO it. Larvesta resists Mach Punch and can potentially burn the attacker with Flame Body. Mienfoo is a good partner for absorbing Sucker Punch, while Archen and Chinchou can take Fletchling's Acrobatics.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Grass
ability: Protean
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 28 HP / 72 Atk / 36 Def / 184 SpA / 188 Spe
nature: Rash / Naive

Moves
=======

Hydro Pump is Froakie's strongest attack and is the most effective move for hitting neutral targets. Ice Beam hits Grass- and Flying-types, such as Foongus and Vullaby, respectively. Hidden Power Ground is generally better than Hidden Power Grass, as it allows Froakie to hit slower threats such as Magnemite and Pawniard, as well as hit Chinchou fairly hard. Hidden Power Grass is Froakie's best attack against most opposing Water-types and can deal a lot of damage to unboosted Shell Smash users such as Tirtouga and Omanyte. U-turn is great for picking up momentum.

Set Details
========

The Special Attack and Speed EVs maximize Froakie's special damage output and let it hit its maximum possible Speed. A Rash nature ensures that Froakie hits 16 Special Attack, allowing it to hit as hard as possible. Alternatively, a Naive nature gives Froakie an extra point in Speed over Special Attack, allowing it to outspeed opposing Choice Scarf users its Speed tier. 68 Attack EVs power up U-turn slightly, and the remaining EVs in Defense and HP allow Froakie to take physical priority attacks better. Protean is the chosen ability, as it is one of the only reasons Froakie has a niche and provides STAB on all of its attacks.

Usage Tips
========

Choice Scarf Froakie can function very well as a revenge killer against threats that have already set up, namely +2 Adamant Tirtouga, and slower Choice Scarf users such as Chinchou and Mienfoo. Early-game, Froakie functions best as a momentum grabber with U-turn, while mid- to late-game, it functions best as a revenge killer. Froakie, at all times during the match, is a great momentum grabber due to the switches it forces, which grants it late-game utility outside of revenge killing.

Team Options
========

Because Froakie will often find itself grabbing momentum with U-turn, teammates that can form fast VoltTurn cores with it, such as Elekid and Chinchou, are appreciated. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Dwebble and Ferroseed also makes it easier for Froakie to score more KOs, as it aims to deal damage late-game while not taking much itself. Teammates that can take priority attacks are also very good, as such attacks can easily KO Froakie; Larvesta resists Mach Punch and can form a momentum core with Froakie, Mienfoo can take a Sucker Punch, and Archen, Chinchou, and Pawniard resist Fletchling's Acrobatics.

Mixed Attacker
########
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Acrobatics
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Substitute / U-turn
move 4: Hidden Power Grass
ability: Protean
item: Berry Juice
evs: 28 HP / 152 Atk / 28 Def / 104 SpA / 188 Spe
nature: Naive

Moves
========

Acrobatics doubles in power after Berry Juice has been consumed or lost and allows Froakie to hit Grass- and Fighting-types for a lot of damage. Hydro Pump is Froakie's obligatory STAB attack and hits most neutral targets for a large amount of damage. Substitute is an option to shield Froakie from attacks, given that Froakie can set it up while a foe switches out; alternatively, U-turn is a choice for players who would rather have the utility of gaining momentum. Hidden Power Grass provides coverage against Pokemon such as Chinchou. Despite it being weak, Quick Attack is also an option to pick off weakened foes.

Set Details
========

The Speed EVs and a Naive nature maximize Froakie's Speed. The Attack and Special Attack EVs provide Froakie with decent mixed offenses, and the rest of the EVs allow Froakie to take priority attacks a bit better. Protean provides STAB on all of Froakie's attacks. Berry Juice allows Froakie regain its health, and once it has done so, it also powers up Acrobatics. No item at all is an option to have immediate power with Acrobatics and should be used when Froakie runs U-turn.

Usage Tips
========

Due to the amount of switches Froakie forces, Substitute is best used on a switch. However, if the foe doesn't switch, Froakie can stall with Substitute, activate Berry Juice, and retaliate with a STAB-boosted Acrobatics. Froakie should also be aware of Protean's mechanics; for instance, using Substitute will make Froakie weak to Fighting-type attacks, such as priority Mach Punch.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Dwebble or Ferroseed is absolutely vital on this set, as Froakie has no way of backing up its power, unlike the Life Orb set. Priority sponges, such as Larvesta or Spritzee, are great partners, as they absorb Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, and the former can even use its ability, Flame Body, to burn foes and halve their Attack stat upon contact. Pokemon such as Mienfoo can absorb Sucker Punch, while Archen and Pawniard can absorb Fletchling's Acrobatics. Trubbish and Koffing are also good partners, as they can set up Toxic Spikes and absorb most physical attacks.

Other Options
########

While Froakie doesn't have many other notable options, it has some that can be used to a good extent. Toxic is a move that stands out, as it allows Froakie to cripple walls, such as Spritzee. Froakie has a wide physical movepool that include Rock Slide and Waterfall, but these moves have significantly lower Base Power than any special move Froakie uses and because of this, these moves are generally outclassed. Froakie has access to the combination of Toxic Spikes and Taunt, which lets it force out opposing leads and get a free layer of Toxic Spikes. However, Froakie will miss out on coverage, and its frailness makes it even riskier to use these moves.

Checks & Counters
########

**Faster Pokemon**: Most faster threats, such as Ponyta and Taillow, can easily outspeed Froakie and hit it hard.

**Heavy Hitters**: Froakie has pathetic defenses, and almost any decently powered attack will KO it.

**Priority Users**: Because Froakie is frail and lacks access to priority moves outside of Quick Attack, it struggles against opposing priority users. Froakie is particularly prone after it has just used Ice Beam, as it can be easily revenge killed by Timburr and Croagunk with their super effective priority moves, namely Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave. Fletchling can't switch into Froakie's attacks, but it can easily revenge kill Froakie as long as it's not behind a Substitute.

**Tentacool**: Tentacool can tank anything Froakie throws at it, including Hidden Power Ground and 110 Base Power Acrobatics, and heal up with Berry Juice. It can then retaliate with Scald, which will OHKO Froakie if it has just used Hidden Power Ground.

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Pokemon with high Special Defense stats, namely Munchlax and Lickitung, can tank any special hit that Froakie has to offer and easily retaliate. Both Munchlax and Lickilicky also take pitiful damage from physical attacks.
