Overview
########

Kabuto is the only Pokemon in LC that has access to Rapid Spin and is resistant to Flying-type moves; it also stands out as an incredible Fletchling counter that also beats Diglett with ease. Kabuto's STAB moves also allow it to beat common entry hazard control Pokemon, such as Archen and Drilbur. Aqua Jet is another useful tool to beat Drilbur most of the time. However, Kabuto's Rock / Water typing is both a blessing and a curse; while it's the only Pokemon with Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin, and Knock Off that is not weak to Water-type attacks, it has nasty weaknesses to Electric-, Ground-, Fighting-, and Grass-type moves. Also, despite its great physical bulk, its special bulk is very low, making it easy for special attackers to take it out. The Defog buff makes Rapid Spin less viable in the metagame, but Kabuto can still maintain great control over entry hazards without sacrificing power.

Moves
========
Rapid Spin allows Kabuto to get rid of entry hazards without relying on Defog, so you can always remove entry hazards without clearing away your own. As Kabuto doesn't have access to Stone Edge, Rock Slide is its main Rock-type STAB attack, being both decently powerful and accurate. Aqua Jet is a must-have priority attack that helps to beat Drilbur and Archen. Aqua Jet also helps to finish with anything that switches into Kabuto's Rock Slide while having no risk of an incoming attack, unless the opposing Pokemon is faster and has priority. Waterfall is an option for a secondary STAB move, hitting Rock- and Ground-types such as Archen and Drilbur quite hard. Thanks to Kabuto's good physical bulk, it can also be a viable Stealth Rock setter. Knock Off can also be used in the last slot to cripple defensive threats and hit Ghost-types a bit harder, making Pumpkaboo struggle when trying to spinblock Kabuto.

Set Details
========
The Attack EVs and nature maximize Kabuto's Attack so that it can hit as hard as possible. The rest of the EVs are placed in HP and Defense to give Kabuto enough bulk to survive hits such as Drilbur's Earthquake and then 2HKO back with Aqua Jet. While Kabuto with maximum Speed EVs reaches 16 Speed, it is outclassed by Drilbur as a fast spinner. Eviolite boosts Kabuto's physical bulk and helps to increase Kabuto's low Special Defense a bit, making it the preferred item. Battle Armor is the only ability that Kabuto can make any use of. However, if Kabuto is being used on a rain team, it can use Swift Swim instead with either 76 Speed EVs or a Jolly nature to outspeed Choice Scarf Pawniard in the rain.

Usage Tips
========
Kabuto can be used as a lead, but remember to check the opposing team and see if it has a potential Taunt user before you lead with Kabuto. Common Taunt users include Mienfoo, Onix, and Cottonee. When running Knock Off, if the opponent has a Ghost-type and there are entry hazards on your side of the field, try to use Knock Off so the opposing Ghost-type gets seriously hurt on the switch-in. Try to switch into many of Kabuto's resistances, such as those to Fire-, Flying-, and Normal-type attacks.

Team Options
========
Flying-types such as Fletchling have good defensive synergy with Kabuto and can remove Grass- and Fighting-types for it. Kabuto also pairs extremely well with other Grass-types such as Cottonee, which resist everything Kabuto is weak to; in return, Kabuto resists Fire- and Poison-type moves for Cottonee. If Kabuto is using Stealth Rock, spinblockers are extremely useful for keeping Stealth Rock during the whole game, while Pawniard can punish Defog. Pokemon weak to entry hazards such as Larvesta and Ponyta appreciate Kabuto's ability to remove hazards.

Other Options
########
Kabuto doesn't have many viable options. Kabuto can run a suicide lead set with Focus Sash and Weak Armor focusing on Speed. However, Dwebble is much more effective as a suicide lead, and Kabuto won't be able to use Rapid Spin as often as the Eviolite set. Kabuto has a decent special movepool, but a poor Special Attack stat makes its special moves nothing more than poor coverage options. Kabuto can run a Berry Juice + Thief set fairly effectively, but Knock Off is usually better for removing items. An offensive set with Rain Dance and Swift Swim is a possibility, but Tirtouga and Omanyte are much better than Kabuto as sweepers. Hidden Power Fire is an option to KO Ferroseed, which otherwise completely walls Kabuto. Hone Claws is Kabuto's only boosting move, and while it also allows Rock Slide to be more accurate, it's usually hard to fit onto Kabuto's set.


Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy can take Kabuto's attacks very well, while Croagunk completely walls Kabuto. They can all easily set up on Kabuto as well. Mienfoo can even Taunt Kabuto and prevent it from setting up Stealth Rock.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types, especially Pumpkaboo, can take any of Kabuto's attacks bar Knock Off fairly well and immediately threaten to KO Kabuto.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Cottonee, Foongus, Lileep, and Ferroseed are very irritating for Kabuto. Cottonee can come in and force Kabuto out if it has Giga Drain, and Foongus can use either Giga Drain to OHKO Kabuto or Spore to make Kabuto dead weight. Lileep is immune to Waterfall and Aqua Jet thanks to Storm Drain, and Ferroseed completely walls Kabuto.

**Status**: Status, especially burn, greatly hurts Kabuto and prevents it from doing its job effectively.

**Electric-types**: Chinchou can take all of Kabuto's moves and 2HKO with its own STAB Electric-type moves. Magnemite can switch into Rock Slide and Aqua Jet and OHKO Kabuto with Thunderbolt.
