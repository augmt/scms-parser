Overview
########

Capable of both sweeping and supporting the team, Tirtouga is a strong and versatile Pokemon in Little Cup. With the reintroduction of Berry Juice into the Little Cup metagame, Tirtouga's Shell Smash + Sturdy set has drastically improved, allowing it to set up on almost every offensive Pokemon in the tier. A combination of good Defense and Solid Rock grants it a solid niche in defensive utility as well. However, Tirtouga's low Special Defense and hindering defensive typing keeps it in check. Nevertheless, once Tirtouga gains momentum, there is little stopping this terrific turtle.

Shell Smash
########
name: Shell Smash
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Aqua Jet / Earthquake
item: Berry Juice
ability: Sturdy
evs: 212 Atk / 92 Def / 180 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Shell Smash is the main move of the set, allowing Tirtouga to outspeed most of the tier and boost its offenses to scary levels after just one use. Waterfall is Tirtouga's most reliable STAB attack, KOing most non-resisting Pokemon at +2. Stone Edge grants it dual STAB, offering a higher powered attack with qualms only in accuracy. Aqua Jet can be used to beat priority users, such as Pawniard and Carvanha, as well as Choice Scarf Pokemon that outspeed Tirtouga even at +2. However, Earthquake is an option for additional coverage, allowing Tirtouga to hit threats such as Croagunk that would otherwise wall the set.

Set Details
========

Berry Juice and Sturdy let Tirtouga survive two attacks from any Pokemon, allowing it to easily set up and sweep. An Adamant nature works best since Tirtouga already outspeeds most of the tier. A bulkier spread of 4 HP / 212 Atk / 12 Def / 76 SpD / 180 Spe with an Adamant nature, Eviolite, and Solid Rock instead of Sturdy is also viable because it lets Tirtouga set up safely even if Sturdy is broken. Lastly, Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge if accuracy is more important than power.

Usage Tips
========

Tirtouga can start off as a lead so Sturdy is guaranteed to activate. But, an opposing team with full health usually can KO it before satisfactory damage is done. Tirtouga performs best sweeping late-game, when all of the enemy Pokemon have enough damage for it to nab the KOs. In order for this to happen, Tirtouga needs entry hazards off the field for Sturdy to remain intact. With Sturdy, Tirtouga can switch into any Pokemon with only attacking moves, activate Berry Juice, and set up Shell Smash for the sweep. If Sturdy is broken early-game, use the opponent's weaker attacks and entry hazards to Tirtouga's advantage and switch in at the right moment in order to activate Berry Juice.

Team Options
========

Since Tirtouga needs Sturdy intact to sweep, Pokemon such as Rapid Spin Drilbur and Defog Vullaby are good partners to keep entry hazards off the field. Defensive cores benefit Tirtouga because it can't switch in until it is ready to sweep. Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Foonguss synergize well with Tirtouga because they cover its weaknesses and spread status, making it easier for Tirtouga to switch in and set up. Lastly, Trubbish and Spritzee are good partners because they handle Fighting-types that threaten this set.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Scald
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Knock Off / Aqua Jet
item: Eviolite
ability: Solid Rock
evs: 84 HP / 252 Def / 12 SpA / 156 SpD
nature: Sassy

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is the most important move on the set as it grants constant residual damage to the opposing team. Scald is the STAB of choice because of its reliable burn chance, and Stone Edge is Tirtouga's strongest STAB option, doing decent damage to most of the tier. Since most of the Pokemon in Little Cup rely on their items, Knock Off is a great option in the last moveslot to cripple these Pokemon. However, Aqua Jet allows Tirtouga to pick off damaged opponents later in the game.

Set Details
========

Solid Rock and Eviolite allow Tirtouga to take some weaker super effective attacks such as Volt Switch from Chinchou and Drain Punch from popular Fighting-types, such as Timburr and Mienfoo. A Relaxed nature is optimal because Tirtouga is using both physical and special attacks, and it doesn't use its Speed much anyway.

Usage Tips
========

Setting up Stealth Rock early-game is Tirtouga's most important job. After that it works best as a pivot, using whichever attack is appropriate at the moment. If Tirtouga is using Aqua Jet, it is a good idea to save it for late-game to pick off damaged threats.

Team Options
========

Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Foongus can wall and status the Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon that threaten Tirtouga. Fletchling and Spritzee are also great partners because they can eliminate the Fighting-types that threaten Tirtouga.

Other Options
########

Tirtouga can use Hydro Pump on an offensive set, but Waterfall will do the same amount of damage and has better accuracy. A Choice Band or Life Orb set would work decently so Tirtouga can reliably use both coverage moves and priority in one set. Lastly, Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall for higher power at the cost of accuracy.

Checks & Counters
########

**Super Effective Coverage**: Any Grass-, Fighting-, Ground-, or Electric-type attack can usually damage the Shell Smash set severely. With offensive investment, moves of these types can break through the Stealth Rock set, especially if aimed at Tirtouga's weaker Special Defense. Bullet Seed users such as Ferroseed and Remoraid can break through Sturdy as well. Pokemon with both Mold Breaker and a super effective move such as Drilbur and Pancham can also stop Tirtouga from setting up. Bulky Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo can endure a hit even at +2 and take out Tirtouga with Drain Punch.

**Entry Hazards**: Stealth Rock and Spikes break Sturdy, allowing most Pokemon to KO Tirtouga before it can set up. Toxic Spikes and Sticky Web also severely limit Tirtouga's sweeping and walling abilities.

**Utility**: Taunt users prevent Tirtouga from using Shell Smash and Stealth Rock, the two main focuses of its sets. Status inducers such as Will-O-Wisp Pumpkaboo, Thunder Wave Ferroseed, and Spore Foongus also prevent Tirtouga from performing its job. Knock Off users can remove Tirtouga's Berry Juice or Eviolite, further shortening its longevity.
