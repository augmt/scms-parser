Overview
########

Once again, Tentacool finds a niche in the LC metagame thanks to its typing and movepool. In addition to the wonderful resistances that Water/Poison typing has always brought, the introduction of Fairy-types has given Tentacool a new niche by allowing it to check threats such as Calm Mind Spritzee. Solid special bulk coupled with decent Speed for a defensively oriented Pokemon make it a good special pivot. With an excellent supportive movepool, which includes gems such as Knock Off and Rapid Spin, Tentacool can cause quite a headache for the opposing team, and the unbanning of Berry Juice gives Tentacool a chance to bypass the issue of lacking recovery. However, its pathetic physical bulk leaves Tentacool as a shaky check to physical Fire- and Fighting-types such as Ponyta and Mienfoo, and once its Berry Juice has been used up, Tentacool is very prone to being worn down. These traits in conjunction with Tentacool's weaknesses to common Electric-, Ground-, and Psychic-type attacks leave much to be desired from the jellyfish.

Moves
========

Access to notable moves such as Rapid Spin and Knock Off gives Tentacool the opportunity to function as an acceptable defensive support Pokemon. Being able to use the coveted Rapid Spin is one of Tentacool's big draws, as removing entry hazards from your side of the field while retaining entry hazards on the opponent's is quite useful. Sludge Bomb and Scald act as reliable STAB moves for Tentacool, and each carries a bonus chance to status the enemy with poison or burn, respectively. Knock Off hits much of the item-reliant LC metagame hard thanks to its Base Power being buffed to 65 this generation. However, Toxic Spikes is another rare move that Tentacool can boast access to, and it can be used in the last slot instead if deemed necessary.

Set Details
========

Tentacool is best used by taking advantage of its phenomenal special bulk, and the EVs and nature are designed to do so. The remaining EVs should be put in defense in an effort to make Tentacool an overall better wall and Speed to boost Tentacool to a respectable 14 Speed. A Bold nature with a physically defensive spread can be used instead, but Tentacool will still have trouble taking powerful physical hits due to its naturally low Defense. Berry Juice is the preferred item because otherwise Tentacool lacks any form of recovery whatsoever, which is not ideal for a defensive Pokemon. Liquid Ooze is the recommended ability because it can help turn the tables on Pokemon that use draining moves such as Leech Seed or Giga Drain in certain situations.

Usage Tips
========

Despite its numerous resistances, Tentacool's lack of consistent recovery and physical bulk means that it should be switched in with caution. With that being said, Tentacool is best saved for mid-game when you want to change the tide of the battle by getting rid of entry hazards or knocking off an opponent's item. Despite Tentacool's low base Special Attack, Sludge Bomb's high Base Power allows Tentacool to actually deal a fair bit of damage, so with Tentacool's acceptable coverage and decent Speed, it can attempt to weaken slower teams.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can take advantage of a clear field, such as Ponyta and Fletchling, are primary candidates for teammates. Larvesta in particular decimates Psychic-types with U-turn while Tentacool resists Larvesta's Water weakness. Good physical tanks work well by making up for Tentacool's weaker Defense. Slowpoke can take on the Fire-types and Fighting-types that Tentacool couldn't hope to wall. To further increase Tentacool's longevity, Wish support is also appreciated, especially from the likes of Spritzee, as Tentacool can switch in on the Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-type moves aimed at it. Chinchou is able to keep Tentacool free of status with Heal Bell and absorb the Electric-type attacks aimed at Tentacool. Tentacool synergizes well with other Knock Off users by forcing a large portion of the enemy team to forgo their items.

Other Options
########

Acid Spray allows Tentacool to threaten switch-ins more easily after forcing a switch and helps Tentacool pose as a moderate offensive threat. Ice Beam could be used to hit Foongus and Flying-types harder, as well as Ground-types if Scald isn't a safe move to use, but Tentacool's STABs are usually enough. Giga Drain is an option for an attacking move that lets Tentacool recover some HP, but most Pokemon don't take much damage from it, so Sludge Bomb is usually the better option. Sludge Wave is interchangeable with Sludge Bomb depending on whether 5 base power or a 20% poison chance is considered more valuable. Tentacool has reasonable Speed and access to Swords Dance, but physical sweeping should usually be left to faster and stronger Pokemon. As for items, Berry Juice is optimal, but an Eviolite set can be used with Wish support if the added bulk is particularly important.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ferroseed**: Ferroseed is immune to Sludge Bomb, resists Scald, and can hit back hard with Bullet Seed.

**Electric-types**: Bulky Electric-types such as Chinchou and Magnemite can switch in and wreak havoc with their Electric STAB.

**Slowpoke**: Slowpoke is bulky enough to take anything Tentacool can throw at it while healing off the damage with Slack Off and Regenerator, and can KO Tentacool with its Psychic STAB.

**Croagunk**: Dry Skin Croagunk is immune to Scald and resists Sludge Bomb, allowing it to wear Tentacool down with Knock Off or set up boosts.

**Fast Ground-types**: Although they won't appreciate taking a Scald, fast Ground-types such as Drilbur and Diglett, once they manage to get in, will be able to severely damage Tentacool with Earthquake.
