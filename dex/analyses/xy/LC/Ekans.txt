Overview
########

Although it is outclassed defensively by most other Poison-type Pokemon, Ekans has an expansive and rather unique movepool, which includes the rare Coil and Glare, as well as a larger offensive presence after boosts. Its typing grants it nice resistances to Fighting-, Fairy-, and Poison-type moves and Shed Skin is a fantastic counter to common status ailments. However, without a Coil boost, Ekans has disappointing stats and a mediocre offensive presence which can make it easy to play around.

Coil Sweeper
########
name: Coil Sweeper
move 1: Coil
move 2: Gunk Shot
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Sucker Punch / Glare
ability: Intimidate / Shed Skin
item: Berry Juice / Eviolite
evs: 156 HP / 84 Def / 244 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Besides Snivy, Ekans is the only Pokemon in Little Cup that can use Coil, which boosts its Attack, Defense, and accuracy in one turn. Gunk Shot's accuracy was buffed this generation, which puts it at 100% accuracy after one Coil boost. Earthquake smacks Steel-types such as Pawniard and Magnemite, which would otherwise wall Ekans's STAB moves with their Poison-type immunities. Sucker Punch hits Gastly and Psychic-types hard, but common moves such as Substitute and Will-O-Wisp can circumvent this. As such, Bite can be used instead. Glare can also be used in the last slot to cripple faster threats, hitting Ground-, Electric-, and Grass-types with 100% accuracy.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread grants Ekans 22/12/16 bulk, which is further boosted by Eviolite. Intimidate can force switches and Shed Skin removes bothersome status ailments such as paralysis and burn. Berry Juice is used to sustain Ekans's longevity, as it will be switching in and out throughout the match to make good use of Intimidate. Eviolite can be used instead for the added defenses and ability to contend against Pawniard, a common Ekans switch-in. A Careful nature is preferred to increase Ekans's special bulk, as Coil only affects Ekans's Defense stat.

Usage Tips
========

Ekans can easily switch into a Fighting-type move and Intimidate the foe, then proceed to use Coil as the opposing Pokemon switches out or attempts to hit Ekans. An attacking move can also be used to nail a switch-in for solid damage, so make sure you are selecting your move accordingly.

Team Options
========

Ekans's ability to take out Fairy-types is a valuable asset to the plethora of Fighting-types in the tier, such as Mienfoo and Scraggy. Water-types such as Staryu and Slowpoke can defeat Ground-types, which can cause some problems for Ekans and prevent it from boosting with Coil. Wish support from Pokemon such as Lickitung and Spritzee is very beneficial, and Ekans can take Fighting- and Poison-type moves aimed at these Wish passers, respectively.

Other Options
########

A utility set is mostly outclassed by Pokemon such as Cottonee, but is usable due to Ekans's access to unique moves in Glare, Disable, and Haze. By nature of its Poison typing, Ekans has access to a perfectly accurate Toxic; however, the paralysis from Glare is generally more useful.

Checks & Counters
########

**Abra**: Abra can set up a Substitute on a predicted Sucker Punch and subsequently decimate Ekans with its powerful Psychic.

**Archen**: Archen resists Gunk Shot, is immune to Earthquake, and can usually shrug off a Sucker Punch. It can also hit it back with Earthquake and heal up with Roost and/or Berry Juice.

**Ground-types**: Ground-types like Drilbur and Diglett are able to take Ekans out with STAB Ground-type attacks, and the latter traps it as well. However, they tend to be prone to Intimidate.

**Physical Walls**: Hippopotas and Foongus easily shrug off most hits thrown at them.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types are immune to Ekans's STAB moves, but are usually hit hard by Earthquake. However, Levitate Bronzor and Ferroseed are quite problematic.

**Phazing**: Phazing, while uncommon, can be used by the likes of Munchlax and Hippopotas to make all Ekans's efforts go to waste.
