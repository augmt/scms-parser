Overview
#######

Thanks to its massive base 135 HP and its great base 85 Special Defense, Munchlax has no trouble shrugging off most special attacks. Combine this with Thick Fat, and Munchlax is one of the hardest stops to Fire- and Ice-type Pokemon in the metagame. Munchlax also has a good base 85 Attack stat, allowing it to hit hard with moves such as Body Slam, Fire Punch, and Earthquake. However, base 40 Defense is quite low, and a horrid base 5 Speed means Munchlax will almost always be moving last. Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy are omnipresent in Little Cup and can easily prey on Munchlax. Finally, Munchlax faces serious competition from Porygon as a Normal-type tank, as Porygon has better mixed bulk, access to Recover, and a wider movepool.

Berry Juice
##########
name: Physically Offensive Tank
move 1: Body Slam / Return
move 2: Fire Punch
move 3: Curse / Earthquake / Toxic
move 4: Recycle
ability: Thick Fat
item: Berry Juice
nature: Adamant / Impish
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 SpD

Moves
======

Body Slam is a great STAB attack that allows Munchlax to do a good amount of damage to foes while also having a chance to paralyze them. Return is a more powerful STAB option, although it doesn't have the chance to paralyze. Fire Punch hits Steel-types that would otherwise wall Munchlax, such as Ferroseed and Bronzor. It's also Munchlax's best way of hitting Ghost-types with Levitate, like Gastly. Curse boosts Munchlax's Attack and Defense while lowering its practically useless Speed, which can help in KOing potential counters. Earthquake hits Rock-types such as Tirtouga and Onix, while also hitting Steel-types such as Magnemite for more damage than Fire Punch. Toxic can also be used to wear down Pokemon that would otherwise wall Munchlax. Finally, Recycle gives Munchlax a way to recover HP, allowing it to avoid getting worn down itself.

Set Details
=========

Thick Fat is the best ability Munchlax can run, as it allows it to effectively counter Pokemon such as Larvesta and Ponyta despite its low Defense stat. 236 Attack EVs make Munchlax as strong as possible, and 236 Special Defense EVs help add to Munchlax's already massive special bulk. An Adamant nature increases Munchlax's power, though an Impish nature can be used to give Munchlax more physical bulk. Another possibility is running a spread of 156 Atk / 116 Def / 236 SpD with an Adamant nature, giving Munchlax better defensive bulk and the power of an Adamant nature. Finally, Berry Juice is the item of choice, as when used in tandem with Recycle, it gives Munchlax a reliable form of recovery.

Usage Tips
=========

Munchlax is a great switch-in to most special attackers due to its great special bulk. Body Slam is Munchlax's main STAB move, and as such, it should be used liberally unless the opponent has a Ghost-type. Using Curse lets Munchlax threaten prospective Fighting-type switch-ins, as it can absorb a Drain Punch and still KO back after a boost or two. Munchlax hates most status effects, especially Toxic and sleep, and therefore should be kept away from them.

Team Options
===========

Munchlax appreciates teammates like Trubbish that can reliably switch into Fighting-types to cover its weaknesses to physical Fighting-types. Pawniard is a major threat, as it can Knock Off Munchlax's item and then set up a Swords Dance. Mienfoo is a great counter to Pawniard, and as such makes a good teammate. Fletchling loves having Munchlax as a partner because Munchlax can beat Magnemite and Chinchou, which are among Fletchling's best checks. Munchlax is also vulnerable to Ghost-types that can easily burn it, so Choice Scarf Pawniard is a good partner, as it can KO these threats. Finally, Munchlax hates status, making Aromatherapy or Heal Bell users such as Spritzee helpful teammates.

RestTalk
#########
name: RestTalk
move 1: Body Slam / Return
move 2: Fire Punch / Curse / Whirlwind
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
ability: Thick Fat
item: Eviolite
nature: Adamant / Impish
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 SpD

Moves
======

Body Slam is the main STAB move for this set, as it's decently powerful and has the chance to paralyze the enemy. Return is a more powerful option, but it lacks the chance to paralyze. Fire Punch is Munchlax's main way to hit Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Bronzor; it also hits Ghost-types with Levitate, such as Gastly. Curse can be used to help boost Munchlax's Attack and Defense while lowering its useless Speed stat, allowing it to KO some of its counters more easily. Note, however, that using Curse instead of Fire Punch leaves Munchlax vulnerable to almost all Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-type Pokemon. Whirlwind is also an option for the second slot; with it, Munchlax can phaze away boosting sweepers and counters while also being able to rack up possible entry hazard damage. Finally, Rest allows Munchlax to heal itself up to full health, and Sleep Talk makes sure Munchlax isn't a complete sitting duck while sleeping.

Set Details
=========

With Thick Fat, Munchlax can actually counter Pokemon such as Ponyta and Larvesta despite its middling physical bulk, making it the best ability Munchlax can run. 236 Attack EVs help to power Munchlax up as much as possible, while 236 Special Defense EVs improve Munchlax's already great special bulk. An Adamant nature is preferred to further add to Munchlax's power, though an Impish nature can be used if additional physical bulk is desired. An alternate spread of 156 Atk / 116 Def / 236 SpD with an Adamant nature can be used to give Munchlax more physical bulk while also giving it the power that an Adamant nature provides. Finally, Eviolite is used to further boost Munchlax's great bulk.

Usage Tips
=========

Munchlax makes a great switch-in to most special attackers due to its great special bulk. Body Slam should be thrown around liberally unless your opponent has a Ghost-type. With Curse, Munchlax can even threaten prospective Fighting-type switch-ins, as after a Curse it can survive a Drain Punch and KO back. Finally, while RestTalk Munchlax can absorb status well, it must rely on Sleep Talk to do anything for two turns after using Rest.

Team Options
===========

Pokemon that can reliably switch into Fighting-types, such as Trubbish, make excellent partners to cover Munchlax's weakness. Mienfoo is valuable as a check to Pawniard, which otherwise can Knock Off Munchlax's item and set up with Swords Dance. Fletchling appreciates Munchlax's ability to deal with Magnemite and Chinchou. Lastly, Munchlax is quite vulnerable to Ghost-type Pokemon, making Choice Scarf Pawniard a good partner, as it can Pursuit trap Ghost-types.

Other Options
##########

Pursuit is a very notable option, as it can trap Gastly that lack Will-O-Wisp. Outrage is a powerful option that can hit Ghost-types, but invites almost every Steel-type in the tier to come in and wall Munchlax. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types while not losing power from burns, but Munchlax's low Special Attack stat makes it quite useless. Sunny Day and Rain Dance can be used on sun and rain teams, as Munchlax is a durable user of the moves. Belly Drum is usable with Munchlax's good bulk, but its Speed is so low that it's usually a waste of time. When used properly, Trick Room can help remedy the Speed problem and let Munchlax net a few KOs. However, with the substantial support needed to pull this off, it usually isn't worth the effort.

Checks & Counters
#############

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, Scraggy, and Croagunk can all do massive damage to Munchlax with their STAB attacks.

**Rock-types**: Rock-types such as Onix and Tirtouga can take Body Slam, Return, or Fire Punch with ease. However, they must be wary of Earthquake.

**Ghost-types**: Depending on Munchlax's moveset, Ghost-types can have an easy time setting up on Munchlax. They can also burn the Berry Juice set with Will-O-Wisp. Still, they must be careful of Pursuit.

**Steel-types**: Depending on the moveset Munchlax runs, Steel-types can have an easy time walling and setting up on Munchlax. Some of these Pokemon include Pawniard, Ferroseed, and Aron. Pawniard can also Knock Off Munchlax's Berry Juice or Eviolite, making it even more threatening. However, these Pokemon must watch out for Fire Punch and Earthquake.
