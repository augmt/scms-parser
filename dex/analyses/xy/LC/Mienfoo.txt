Overview
########

Once at the top of the tier, Mienfoo remains an excellent bulky offensive pivot in this metagame. It can support the team through the newly buffed Knock Off and remain healthy throughout the match with the nigh-exclusive combination of U-turn and Regenerator. It has the ability check prevalent Pokemon such as Tirtouga, Carvanha, and Pawniard, beating them using its powerful Fighting-type STAB, while also boasting decent Eviolite-boosted bulk and excellent survivability thanks to Regenerator. However, its typing leaves it walled by Fairy- and Ghost-types and also beaten out by common Flying-types. It also despises status, with burn lowering its damage output and delivering chip damage and paralysis eliminating its Speed advantage. It receives competition from Timburr as a bulky pivot, but Mienfoo has better longevity because of U-turn and Regenerator.

Bulky Attacker
########
name: Bulky Attacker
move 1: Drain Punch / High Jump Kick
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Fake Out / Taunt
ability: Regenerator
item: Eviolite
evs: 196 Def / 36 SpD / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Drain Punch is the key move on the set, letting Mienfoo KO several notable threats in the metagame, such as Pawniard and Tirtouga. Knock Off is an amazing move, taking items from opponents and hitting Ghost- and Psychic-type threats like Slowpoke for solid damage. U-turn preserves momentum, lets Mienfoo get out of a bad situation, and activates Regenerator. Fake Out helps Mienfoo do chip damage and can be used to break Sturdy. However, only use Fake Out when the chip damage is necessary, as the move is predictable and can offer free switch-ins to your opponent. Taunt prevents setup, keeps opponents from crippling Mienfoo with status, blocks recovery, and is especially useful with Mienfoo's decent Speed. High Jump Kick is an option for greater attacking power, but losing Drain Punch reduces Mienfoo's longevity.

Set Details
========

In this set, Speed is maximized and bulk is optimized, enhancing Mienfoo's ability to deal with Pawniard. Without the Speed investment, standard Pawniard outspeeds and KOes with a +2 Iron Head, even if Mienfoo has maximum bulk. If you aren't particularly concerned about Pawniard, a spread of 156 HP / 116 Def / 196 SpD with an Impish nature maximizes bulk, but if Mienfoo is running Taunt, this is not advised. Eviolite is chosen to enhance Mienfoo's bulk and Regenerator provides extra healing.

Usage Tips
========

This set is geared towards bulky offense and balanced teams, either as glue or part of a VoltTurn core. It should be used as a pivot, tanking resisted hits and hitting something with Knock Off, KOing with Drain Punch if necessary, and switching out with U-turn. If your opponent has something faster that threatens Mienfoo, such as Abra, it should not use U-turn, but should instead switch out manually. This set excels early- to mid-game, where it can target key threats and either cripple or eliminate them.

Team Options
========

Mienfoo works well as part of a VoltTurn core. Chinchou can beat Flying-types while also helping with Slowpoke. Magnemite can do this as well, but but it trades bulk for the ability to beat the Fairy-types that wall Mienfoo. Vullaby and Larvesta can beat Foongus and Croagunk and also have U-turn. A Regenerator core can be formed alongside Slowpoke and Foongus, creating a highly durable trio that can spread status and Knock Off items to weaken foes, softening the opposing team for a late-game sweep. Foongus beats Spritzee, Slowpoke beats Fletchling, and Mienfoo beats bulky special walls that block the other two. Other Fighting-types, as well as Dwebble and Tirtouga, appreciate Mienfoo's ability to use Knock Off on walls such as Slowpoke and Spritzee.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: High Jump Kick
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Drain Punch
move 4: U-turn
ability: Regenerator
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 236 Atk / 36 SpD / 236 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

High Jump Kick is Mienfoo's STAB move here as well as its primary revenge killing move. Don't spam it if your opponent still has a Ghost-type, as you run the risk of Mienfoo losing half of its health. Knock Off goes well with a Choice Scarf set, as it can surprise Pokemon that would normally be faster than Mienfoo and helps clear out Ghost-types. Drain Punch should be used when you don't want to risk a High Jump Kick miss and need to revenge kill something. U-turn should be used on predicted switches, and is particularly helpful because it activates Regenerator. Stone Edge is also an option for hitting Larvesta, giving it utility over Drain Punch.

Set Details
========

The EVs are standard for an offensive Pokemon, maximizing Attack and Speed, and an Adamant nature is chosen as with a Choice Scarf, Mienfoo still hits 24 Speed. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Defense for extra special bulk, though moving them to HP or Defense is fine now that there is no need to survive Misdreavus's Dazzling Gleam. Choice Scarf helps Mienfoo to revenge kill and clean, and Regenerator is the best of Mienfoo's abilities.

Usage Tips
========

This set should spam Knock Off and U-turn early game, using Mienfoo's STAB to revenge kill when needed. High Jump Kick is powerful enough to clean up late-game once all Pokemon that resist or are immune to it have been removed. This set fits best on an fast offensive team, where the utility given by the Eviolite set is not needed.

Team Options
========

This set works best on a VoltTurn team, and appreciates partners such as Magnemite, Chinchou, and Archen, which can help to beat Flying-types. Larvesta and Vullaby are also appreciated, as they can beat threats such as Foongus and Croagunk. Pursuit Pawniard is a really good teammate, easily removing Ghost-types and so allowing Mienfoo to clean up late-game. Late-game sweepers, such as Tirtouga, appreciate Mienfoo's Knock Off support.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: High Jump Kick
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Fake Out / Stone Edge / Poison Jab
ability: Regenerator
item: Life Orb
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

High Jump Kick is the primary move and wallbreaking tool on this set. Knock Off punishes Ghost-types and can help to wallbreak and weaken Mienfoo's checks and counters. U-turn preserves momentum and activates Regenerator to help mitigate Life Orb recoil. Fake Out provides general priority and chip damage. Mienfoo can use it if your team is especially weak to Sturdy Pokemon such as Dwebble or Tirtouga, although this is better done by the bulky attacker set. If you do include Fake Out, make sure not to give your opponents free switch-in opportunities, and although the chip damage is nice, the Life Orb recoil can add up. Stone Edge can be used to hit Larvesta, which otherwise walls Mienfoo and can burn it with Flame Body. It also hits Ponyta on the switch without risking a burn, but should only be done when it is in KO range. Poison Jab gives Mienfoo the ability to 2HKO Spritzee if it has already lost its item to Knock Off.

Set Details
========

The EV spread is standard for an offensive Pokemon, with full investment in Attack and Speed to maximize damage output and offensive potential. Life Orb is the key item of the set, emphasizing Mienfoo's wallbreaking capabilities, and its recoil can be mitigated through Regenerator.

Usage Tips
========

This set is best off used as a hit-and-run attacker on bulky offense or offensive teams that need a longer-lasting wallbreaker and don't require the bulk of the main set. It is a little tougher to play with as it can't really take hits and is hard to switch in due to its frailty. This set isn't nearly as reliable against Pawniard, as it is beaten by a combination of Knock Off and Sucker Punch if it's at +2, and Iron Head flat out OHKOes Mienfoo on the switch. Nonetheless, the power of this set is immense, and the strength the Knock Off + U-turn is further amplified by Life Orb. Mienfoo can even manage to KO a full-health Slowpoke with this combination. This set works well early- to mid-game to weaken your opponent's team by smashing opposing Pokemon with High Jump Kick and Knock Off.

Team Options
========

This set works best on VoltTurn teams thanks to the greater ease of switching in. It appreciates teammates such as Larvesta and Vullaby, which can beat Croagunk and Foongus for it. Checks for Flying-types, such as Chinchou and Archen, are also appreciated. Late-game sweepers such as Scraggy and Tirtouga also appreciate the wallbreaking and Knock Off support.


Other Options
########

Mienfoo has a few other options that it can utilize. A SubPass set with Life Orb or Eviolite can be used on Baton Pass teams. It can use a Reckless set with High Jump Kick for even more power, but Regenerator is usually more advantageous. Force Palm is a unique option; its paralysis chance is the same as Scald's burn rate, and it can paralyze threats such as Ponyta.


Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types, most namely Spritzee, resist most of Mienfoo's common moves and usually have the bulk to take them. They can KO Mienfoo with their STAB moves or simply use it as setup bait.

**Poison-types**: Poison-types resist Mienfoo's STAB, and some are bulky enough to take most other hits. Foongus can constantly check Mienfoo thanks to Regenerator and can cripple it with Stun Spore. Koffing can burn it, Grimer has Sticky Hold, and Tentacool can switch in on Drain Punch to hurt it with Liquid Ooze.

**Slowpoke**: Slowpoke has the bulk to take most of Mienfoo's attacks, although it won't like U-turn or Knock Off, and is KOed by the combination from the Life Orb set.

**Flame Body Users**: Flame Body users have a chance to burn Mienfoo, effectively neutering its offensive prowess and hampering its survivability. Larvesta resists Mienfoo's STAB and can threaten to KO with Flare Blitz. Ponyta outspeeds Mienfoo and also threatens a KO with Flare Blitz.

**Flying-types**: Fletchling and other offensive Flying-types can take Mienfoo out with their Flying-type STAB moves, and most are faster than it. Fletchling can completely bypass Mienfoo's Speed with priority Acrobatics, but it cannot KO if it still holds an item. However, most Flying-types have trouble switching in, as a lot of them are neutral to Fighting-type moves.

**Abra**: Abra outspeeds Mienfoo and can OHKO it with Psychic, but has trouble switching in.
