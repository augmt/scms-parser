Overview
########

Rufflet has a high base 83 Attack stat which is boosted even further by Hustle, letting it hit very hard with its physical attacks. It's no slouch defensively, either, thanks to its 70 / 50 / 50 defenses and access to reliable recovery in Roost. Furthermore, its access to Superpower lets it hit Steel- and Rock-types hard, something most Flying-types struggle with. While Rufflet does boast incredible power with Hustle, the ability's downside is 80% accuracy on its physical moves, which can be frustrating, especially if you're trying to gain momentum with U-turn. In addition, Rufflet faces competition from Fletchling, Archen, and Doduo as an offensive Flying-type, and Vullaby as a defensive Flying-type, but it's able to effectively stand out from the flock thanks to its large raw power, bulk, and access to good coverage moves.

Bulk Up
########
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Aerial Ace
move 3: Superpower / Return
move 4: Roost / Substitute
ability: Hustle
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 116 HP / 12 Atk / 116 Def / 196 SpD / 36 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Bulk Up boosts Rufflet's Attack and Defense, making it quite the tank after a boost. Aerial Ace is an ideal STAB move, as it retains perfect accuracy with Hustle, unlike Rufflet's other physical moves. Superpower provides coverage against Steel-types such as Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Magnemite. Return can be used as a powerful STAB attack, hitting very hard with Hustle and Bulk Up boosts. However, it doesn't provide very good coverage alongside Aerial Ace, unlike Superpower. Roost gives Rufflet reliable recovery, allowing it to heal off damage it may take from Stealth Rock or while it sets up. Substitute allows Rufflet to avoid status, which could otherwise cripple it and hamper its sweeping ability.

Set Details
========

This EV spread gives Rufflet good overall bulk and hits Eviolite numbers, giving it more setup opportunities. Hustle gives Rufflet 1.5x Attack at the cost of some accuracy, though Aerial Ace has perfect accuracy. The choice between Eviolite and Berry Juice depends on the move in the fourth slot. If using Roost, Eviolite should be used for the added bulk. If Substitute is used, Berry Juice is preferred so Rufflet has a form of recovery while it sets up. An alternate EV spread of 36 HP / 12 Atk / 36 Def / 196 SpD / 196 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used, trading some bulk for Speed and allowing it to outspeed would-be checks such as Chinchou.

Usage Tips
========

Rufflet should set up Bulk Up on Pokemon that can't 2HKO it, such as Spritzee, bulky Fighting-types, and various other walls. If running Substitute, set up Substitute on suspected status inducers like Ferroseed and use Bulk Up behind the Substitute. Once Rufflet obtains a boost or two, start attacking the foe with Rufflet's powerful Hustle-boosted attacks, healing off damage as needed. If Rufflet's checks are still healthy, be sure to keep Rufflet as healthy as possible with Roost or cleric support should it get forced out.

Team Options
========

Diglett is a great partner, as it can trap and remove Electric-, Steel-, and Rock-types, all of which threaten Rufflet. This is especially important if Rufflet isn't running Superpower. Cleric support from Pokemon such as Spritzee and Chinchou can rid Rufflet of status. Spritzee can also provide Rufflet with Wish support, and Chinchou provides a safe switch-in to Electric-types. Magnemite makes for a good partner, as it resists all of Rufflet's weaknesses, while Rufflet is immune to Ground attacks and can take on bulky Fighting-types for Magnemite. Because Rufflet is weak to Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin or Defog support helps ensure Rufflet enters the battle at full health and has more opportunities to set up with Bulk Up. Archen and Vullaby can be used for Defog support, while Drilbur and Staryu can be used for Rapid Spin support.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Return
move 2: Aerial Ace
move 3: Superpower
move 4: U-turn
ability: Hustle
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 36 Def / 196 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Return is a powerful STAB move, hitting anything that doesn't resist it very hard. Aerial Ace is the weaker STAB move, but has perfect accuracy and hits Fighting- and Grass-types super effectively. Superpower provides great coverage against the Steel- and Rock-types that resist Rufflet's STAB combination. U-turn allows Rufflet to dent a potential counter and switch out into a teammate and is useful for scouting in general.

Set Details
========

With a Jolly nature and Choice Scarf, Rufflet hits 24 Speed, enough to outpace the entire unboosted metagame and several boosted threats, such as +1 Scraggy. The 1.5x Attack boost from Hustle along with 252 EVs in Attack lets Rufflet hit very hard. The leftover EVs give Rufflet a point in Defense so it can tank priority moves better. An alternate EV spread of 36 HP / 252 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpD / 116 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used to increase Rufflet's damage output and bulk at the cost of some Speed. Rufflet hits 21 Speed with this spread, which is still enough to outpace the entire unboosted metagame. Do keep in mind that this spread can only switch into Stealth Rock three times, as opposed to the main spread, which can switch in four times.

Usage Tips
========

Rufflet can be used as needed for revenge killing, scouting, and potentially a late-game sweep if its checks and counters are removed. While Superpower is indeed useful for hitting Rock- and Steel-types, it has the nasty side effect of leaving Rufflet with -1 Attack and Defense afterward, which loses a lot of momentum for your team and can render Rufflet setup bait. If your opponent has a Ghost-type, such as Gastly, locking Rufflet into Superpower is not a good idea. When in doubt, especially early-game, use U-turn. Hustle coupled with Rufflet's high Attack means that its U-turns do a good chunk of damage.

Team Options
========

Rufflet is weak to Stealth Rock and will be doing a good bit of switching in and out, so Rapid Spin or Defog support is appreciated. Archen and Vullaby are good Defog users, while Drilbur and Staryu are good Rapid Spin users. Knock Off support from the likes of Pawniard or Mienfoo allows Rufflet a better shot at sweeping late-game. Hazard setters such as Onix or Dwebble can ensure Rufflet gets certain KOs, such as the OHKO on Mienfoo. Diglett is a very useful partner, removing Electric-, Steel-, and Rock-types, all of which threaten Rufflet. This gives Rufflet a much better shot at sweeping late-game. Drilbur also has good offensive synergy with Rufflet, threatening Electric-, Steel-, and Rock-types with Earthquake. With a Choice Scarf and U-turn, Rufflet works well in a VoltTurn team, so it can pair with Volt Switch users such as Chinchou and Magnemite or other U-turn users such as Mienfoo. Rufflet can also be paired up with other birds such as Fletchling and Doduo to form a Flying-type, or "birdspam," core. They'll can wear down each other's checks through sheer offensive pressure, allowing one of them to eventually sweep.

Other Options
########

Rufflet can run a support set, but is outclassed by the bulkier Vullaby. Rock Slide and Steel Wing are coverage options that can be used to hit Archen, but are usually not worth the moveslot. Hone Claws could be used over Bulk Up if you really hate missing due to Hustle, but the Defense boosts are usually too good to pass up, and Rufflet's access to Aerial Ace somewhat mitigates its accuracy issue. As the only user of Sky Drop in LC, Rufflet can be a surprisingly effective staller with Sky Drop and Toxic Spikes support. Tailwind can be used to boost the Speed of Rufflet and its teammates, but Rufflet doesn't really have the available moveslots to be using it. Sheer Force can be used over Hustle if 80% accuracy really troubles you, but it's inferior to Hustle as the boost is smaller and only applies to specific moves.

Checks & Counters
########

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Chinchou, Elekid, and Magnemite all threaten Rufflet with their STAB moves, although they'll need to be cautious switching into Rufflet's Hustle-boosted attacks.

**Rock-types**: Rock-types such as Tirtouga, Onix, and Archen in can come in on Rufflet Choice-locked into Return or Aerial Ace and threaten Rufflet back with their STAB moves, or use it as setup bait. Archen in particular is only hit neutrally by Superpower, only fearing the rare Rock Slide or Steel Wing.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Pawniard can come in on Rufflet Choice-locked into Return or Aerial Ace. Ferroseed can use this opportunity to set entry hazards, while Pawniard can set up Swords Dance or simply attack.

**Status**: Rufflet is heavily crippled by any sort of status, be it sleep, paralysis, or burn.

**Priority Users**: Choice Scarf Rufflet is a lot less bulky than Bulk Up Rufflet, and is therefore more susceptible to priority, particularly after a Defense drop from Superpower.

**Phazers**: Bulky Roar or Whirlwind users such as Hippopotas can phaze out Bulk Up variants, preventing Rufflet from obtaining too many boosts.
