Overview
########
- Unique typing and abilities. 
- Only bulky Ghost-type with Recover. 
- Decent SpA. 
- Knock Off is rampant and makes Frillish's job quite limited. 

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Scald / Surf 
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Recover
move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Toxic 
ability: Cursed Body / Water Absorb
item: Eviolite
evs: 236 HP / 116 Def / 76 SpA / 76 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========
- Scald is Frillish's main STAB attack and is useful for checking Pokemon such as Mienfoo while also nailing Fire-types who may be switching into a predicted Will-O-Wisp. 
- Shadow Ball is a good coverage move, hitting Meditite hard and Slowpoke super effectively. 
- Recover is an obvious move as it gives Frillish longevity. 
- Will-O-Wisp is a very useful status for Frillish as it still allows it to beat Pokemon such as Mienfoo who cannot break Frillish even with Knock Off. 
- Toxic and Surf can be used as well, though it does not have the Attack-reducing effect. 

Set Details
========
- EVs maximize bulk with even numbers for Eviolite. The rest are invested in SpA. 
- Cursed Body and Water Absorb come down to personal preference. Water Absorb works best if there is no other Water-type resist on the team, but otherwise Cursed Body is generally more useful. 

Usage Tips
========
- Frillish is best used as a check for certain Fighting-, Fire-, and Normal-types.
- It is usually best to use Frillish as a check, since it has trouble switching in on predicted attacks, but has no trouble forcing Pokemon out. 

Team Options
========

- Frillish can barely dent Pokemon such as Chinchou on the switch, so any Pokemon immune to Volt Switch would make a good teammate for Frillish. 
- While Frillish can absorb most Fighting-type attacks, it cannot effectively take Knock Off. With this in mind, Pokemon such as Trubbish or itemless Fletchling work well with Frillish. 

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Water Spout
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Energy Ball / Surf 
move 4: Trick 
ability: Cursed Body / Water Absorb
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 76 HP / 236 SpA / 196 Spe 
nature: Timid

Moves
========
- Water Spout is Frillish's highest damage attack. 
- Shadow Ball is a good coverage move, hitting Slowpoke super effectively. 
- Energy Ball hits Chinchou and Tirtouga hard.
- Since Shadow Ball hits those Pokemon neutrally, Surf can be used as a backup Water-type move.
- Trick lets Frillish severely dampen the usefulness of special walls. 

Set Details
========
- EVs maximize Speed to reach 14, while the rest are put in SpA to maximized damage. There are 76 EVs leftover that can be put into HP. 
- Water Absorb and Cursed Body both have their merits and come down to personal preference. 

Usage Tips
========
- This Frillish set is best used as an early-game revenge killer before Stealth Rock is down to weaken Water Spout. 
- If hazards are removed late game, it can sweep a weakened team with Water Spout. 

Team Options
========

- Frillish can barely dent Pokemon such as Chinchou on the switch, even with Energy Ball, so any Pokemon  immune to Volt Switch would make a good teammate for Frillish. 
- While Frillish can absorb most Fighting-type attacks, it cannot effectively  take Knock Off. With this in mind, Pokemon such as Trubbish or itemless Fletchling work well with Frillish. 
- Anything that removes hazards reliably works well with Frillish, since it needs its full HP to deal maximum damage with Water Spout. 

Other Options
#########
- Choice Specs can be used, but it lacks the Speed to be used effectively. 
- Trick Room can be set up effectively by Frillish. 

Counters
#########
**Chinchou**:  Chinchou is bulky enough to not care too much about Shadow Ball or Energy Ball and can use any Electric-type attack to deal major damage to Frillish.

**Timburr**: Timburr cannot be neutralized buy Will-O-Wisp and can deal damage back with Knock Off.
