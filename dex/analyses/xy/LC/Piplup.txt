Piplup is one of only a handful of Pokemon in Little Cup with access to both Stealth Rock and Defog, meaning it can remove your opponent's entry hazards while setting up its own. Piplup's Water typing means it isn't weak to Stealth Rock, so it can switch in more easily than other Defoggers, especially along with its good defenses. Piplup is no slouch offensively either, as its good Special Attack stat along with a decent STAB move in Scald means it can beat common Stealth Rock users such as Drilbur and Archen. However, it has less offensive presence than these two and access to less special attacking options, which means it can sometimes become setup bait for Pokemon that are specially bulky or resist Piplup's moves. Piplup is also outclassed in other roles by Chinchou, so it can be quite predictable.

name: Stealth Rock + Defog
move 1: Stealth Rock

move 3: Scald
move 4: Ice Beam
ability: Torrent
item: Eviolite
evs: 92 HP / 252 Def / 148 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Stealth Rock and Defog are moves that allow Piplup to employ entry hazard control. Piplup's Stealth Rock will wear down opposing Pokemon and break the Sturdy of Pokemon such as Tirtouga and Magnemite, allowing its teammates to push past foes more easily. Defog removes all entry hazards, allowing Piplup's teammates to avoid taking residual damage. Piplup's STAB Scald has a chance to burn foes, meaning it will be able to set up or remove entry hazards more easily. Ice Beam hits foes such as Fletchling and Foongus, and has good coverage with Scald; however, it fails to 2HKO most Grass-type Pokemon.

Set Details
========

A Bold nature and the EVs listed maximize Piplup's bulk and allow it to reach Eviolite numbers, letting it both withstand hits and take on most entry hazard setters. Torrent is the only ability legal with Defog, boosting Piplup's Water-type attacks when it's below one-third of its maximum health. Although it's situational, the boost in power is useful.

Usage Tips
========

Piplup is bulky enough to be switched directly in on attacks, but its lack of recovery means you should not do so unless removing or setting entry hazards is necessary; thus, Piplup should be brought in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch wherever possible.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock really appreciate having Piplup as a teammate. Fletchling, Archen, Taillow, Larvesta, Ponyta, and Sturdy users such as Magnemite and Tirtouga benefit greatly from an absence of entry hazards on the field. Piplup can't push past bulky Grass-types such as Foongus, Pumpkaboo, and Ferroseed, so it will need support from teammates such as Ponyta, Larvesta, and Fletchling in order to beat them. Incidentally, all of these Pokemon are weak to Stealth Rock and appreciate Piplup removing them through Defog. Piplup can also take care of the Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon that threaten these teammates, while they can switch into the Grass-type moves that threaten Piplup. Chinchou also makes for a good teammate; while both it and Piplup are weak to Grass-type attacks, Chinchou can come into Electric-type attacks from Magnemite and opposing Chinchou. A cleric such as Spritzee or Lickitung can pass some hefty Wishes to Piplup, enabling it to perform its role much more effectively.

Other Options
########

Piplup can use Hydro Pump over Scald; however, Hydro Pump's inability to inflict a burn and lower accuracy make it a less viable choice than Scald. Piplup can also use Brick Break in order to take on Pawniard and Magnemite, and it's also able to use Signal Beam in order to take on Carvanha; however, neither of these options hit much aside from the Pokemon listed. Toxic and Yawn are options to spread status and force switches, but Piplup is better off trying to spread burns with Scald. Defiant isn't legal with Defog, but Piplup has a decent Attack stat and a number of reasonably strong physical options, meaning it can switch in on a Defog or Sticky Web and hit fairly hard; however, Tirtouga and Corphish outclass it as a Water-type physical attacker.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Grass-types**: Even after taking damage from Stealth Rock, Cottonee, Ferroseed, Pumpkaboo, and Foongus can all comfortably tank an Ice Beam and severely cripple Piplup with a super effective STAB attack.

**Taunt Users**: Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Purrloin, and Cottonee are all capable of preventing Piplup from setting up Stealth Rock or using Defog with Taunt.

**Electric-types**: Chinchou can tank any of Piplup's attacks and hit back with a powerful Electric-type attack. Magnemite can also nail Piplup with an Electric-type attack, though it will have trouble switching in.

**Residual Damage**: Piplup is highly susceptible to residual damage, as entry hazards and damage from attacks can wear it down quickly.
