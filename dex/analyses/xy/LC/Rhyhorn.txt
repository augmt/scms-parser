Overview
########

Rhyhorn sports good Attack, Defense, and HP. It has great STAB moves and a good movepool to back them up. Rhyhorn also is a complete stop to Fletchling and Zigzagoon, which are both big threats in the metagame. However, Rhyhorn has a bad defensive typing, giving it a 4x weakness to Water- and Grass-type attacks. Rhyhorn also has terrible Special Defense and Speed, and has no recovery outside of the unreliable Rest.

move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Rock Blast

nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Stealth Rock provides great utility and slowly wears down the opponent. Stealth Rock is an ideal move for Rhyhorn because of its enormous physical bulk and the large amount of opportunities Rhyhorn gets to set it up. Earthquake is a primary STAB move that hits most of the tier relatively hard. Rock Blast is the secondary STAB move, and it is used over Stone Edge and Rock Slide because it breaks through Substitute, which is rather common. Megahorn can hit Lileep and Slowpoke, while Drilbur and Hippopotas are hit super effectively by Aqua Tail.

Set Details
========

The EVs, factoring in Eviolite, increase the chance of surviving an Earthquake from Life Orb Drilbur and Life Orb Bunnelby. An Eviolite boosts Rhyhorn's defenses, making its Defense stat extremely high, and also boosts its mediocre Special Defense. Life Orb is an alternate item, but it wears Rhyhorn down and makes it more susceptible to attacks. An Adamant nature helps to maximize Attack. Any ability works, as Rhyhorn can not make use of any them as it lacks recoil moves and doesn't use special attacks.

Usage Tips
========

Rhyhorn forces a lot of switches due to its great defenses and its ability to wall certain Pokemon, so predicting when to use certain attacks or Stealth Rock on a switch is something you should keep an eye out for. Although Rhyhorn's defensive typing isn't great, Rhyhorn can function as a pivot into Choice-locked Pokemon or Pokemon that can't do much to it.

Team Options
========

Chinchou takes most Water-type attacks well for Rhyhorn. Ghost-types such as Gastly can spinblock and switch into Fighting-type moves which threaten Rhyhorn. Foongus resists Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-type moves which can potentially OHKO Rhydon, while Rhyhorn can cover Fire- and Flying-type attacks that threaten Foongus, making it a good partner for a defensive core. Fletchling threatens opposing Grass-types which threaten Rhyhorn.

Other Options
########

Rhyhorn has a bunch of other options at its disposal. Stone Edge can be used over Rock Blast for a higher damage output most of the time, but Stone Edge can't break through Substitute, and the chance to miss is significantly higher. Superpower hits very hard, but lowers Attack and Defense, the two stats Rhyhorn relies on. A more defensive set with Stealth Rock is viable, but is outclassed by Lileep. Rhyhorn has access to the elemental fangs, but they are very weak as they aren't boosted by STAB. Curse is an option to give Rhyhorn better tank-like abilities, but Rhyhorn fails to find the time to set up. Rhyhorn can tank most neutral physical hits well, so Counter is an option to gain some satisfying KOs. Roar works well with Stealth Rock, and slowly wears down the opponent. Rock Polish can be used to let Rhyhorn outspeed most threats, but is outclassed in almost every way by Shell Smash users, which can also hold an Eviolite or Berry Juice.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Grass-types**: Bulky Grass-types OHKO Rhyhorn with their STAB moves and they resist Rhyhorn's Ground-type STAB move, while Rhyhorn cannot do much back.

**Water-types**: Water-types such as Omanyte and Tirtouga easily OHKO Rhydon.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types, namely Scraggy, can hit non-Eviolite Rhyhorn hard; they also resist Rhyhorn's Rock-type STAB moves.

**Drilbur**: Although Drilbur is 2HKOed on the switch, it can threaten to 2HKO non-Eviolite Rhyhorn with Earthquake and spin away Stealth Rock.

**Physical Walls**: Physical walls can usually avoid the 2HKO from Rhyhorn and gradually wear it down.
