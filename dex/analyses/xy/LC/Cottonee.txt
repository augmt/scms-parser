Overview
########

Cottonee has a fantastic Grass / Fairy typing which allows it to beat Pokemon such as Timburr and Mienfoo. It has excellent support options in Memento, Encore, Taunt and Leech Seed and can pivot in and out quite effectively. Unfortunately, Cottonee suffers from a Flying weakness, making it an easy target for Fletchling, and its reliance on support moves makes it susceptible to Taunt. It also cannot touch certain Pokemon at all, such as Foongus. However, Cottonee's ability to check the variety of Fighting-types in LC and provide great support for sweeping allies makes it a valuable member of any Little Cup team.

Utility
########
name: Utility
move 1: Encore
move 2: Memento / Knock Off
move 3: Taunt / Knock Off
move 4: Stun Spore / Memento / Dazzling Gleam / Giga Drain
ability: Prankster
item: Eviolite
evs: 116 HP / 196 Def / 196 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Encore allows Cottonee to force out Pokemon such as Shell Smash Tirtouga or to lock Pokemon such as Mienfoo into Fake Out. This, combined with Memento, can often lead to an ally sweeping the opponent's team. Memento helps Cottonee support its teammates to the fullest extent and can be used as a last resort with Prankster. Knock Off is a great support move, getting rid of an enemy's item. Taunt can be used to stop setup sweepers or leads that attempt to set entry hazards, and Stun Spore can be used to spread paralysis throughout the opponent's team. Dazzling Gleam is a good STAB option that can deal damage to Cottonee's common switch-ins, such as Fletchling. Giga Drain is an option that supplies Cottonee with reliable recovery, hitting opposing Water-type Pokemon that Cottonee usually attempts to check.

Set Details
========

The EV spread hits Eviolite numbers and allows Cottonee to be as bulky as possible. A Bold nature does not inhibit Cottonee's Knock Off, as the move should not be viewed as a way to deal damage, but as a support option. Prankster allows Cottonee to function to its fullest potential as a support Pokemon, granting its non-attacking moves +1 priority.

Usage Tips
========

Cottonee should be used as a pivot, switching in on resisted attacks such as Drilbur's Earthquake. When Cottonee is close to fainting, Memento is the best option, as it allows sweepers to set up with ease. Cottonee can lock threatening Pokemon such as Gastly or Pawniard into non-attacking moves like Substitute or Swords Dance, guaranteeing Cottonee a free turn, and more if the opponent doesn't switch.

Team Options
========

Cottonee is most effective when paired with devastating setup sweepers. Pawniard makes an excellent partner, switching into Fletchling and applying strong offensive pressure to the foe. Vullaby is a great addition to Cottonee's team, as Cottonee is walled entirely by Foongus, which has little means of dealing with Vullaby. Pokemon such as Scraggy, Zigzagoon, and Fletchling all work wonders in setting up and wrecking unprepared teams. Cottonee functions the best on hyper offense teams, where it can provide support for Pokemon that can set up versus a variety of playstyles. Pokemon that can switch into Flying-, Fire-, and Poison-type attacks, such as Chinchou and Archen, are most appreciated as partners.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Dazzling Gleam / Giga Drain
move 2: Encore
move 3: Hidden Power Fighting / Giga Drain
move 4: Memento / Taunt
ability: Prankster
item: Eviolite
evs: 36 HP / 40 Def / 144 SpA / 40 SpD / 232 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Dazzling Gleam is a great STAB option and is Cottonee's main means of hitting Fighting- and Dark-types. Giga Drain is also a good STAB move that can provide Cottonee with some much-needed recovery; it also lets Cottonee be a solid switch-in to Chinchou and Tirtouga. Encore is Cottonee's greatest asset, as the added Speed of this set allows Cottonee to switch into most setup sweepers and lock them into their boosting moves, nullifying any chance they had at sweeping. Hidden Power Fighting only has one real use, that being to hit Pawniard, which otherwise resists both of Cottonee's STAB moves and can hit it super effectively with Iron Head or cripple it with Knock Off. Memento can be used as a last resort to provide an opportunity for a teammate to switch in and either boost or hit something hard. It can also be a handy bluff in tandem with Hidden Power Fighting, luring in Pawniard and hitting it quite hard. Taunt is good for preventing opposing Pokemon from setting entry hazards, crippling Cottonee with status or blocking an incoming Taunt.

Set Details
========

The EVs allow Cottonee to still retain some bulk, while focusing mostly on Speed in order to outspeed and use Encore on Fletchling as it attempts to set up as well as Speed tie with potent 17 Speed Pokemon, such as Mienfoo and Drilbur. A Timid nature allows Cottonee to hit 17 Speed and still retain an offensive presence. Eviolite is the premier item for bulkier Pokemon.

Usage Tips
========

Fast Cottonee's main use is switching into a predicted set up move or resisted move and proceeding to Encore, effectively shutting down the opposing Pokemon (e.g. Encoring Fletchling's Swords Dance). Cottonee can also be a potent late-game threat, when its 17 Speed can be utilized efficiently to pick off weakened threats and clean up.

Team Options
========

Due to the lack of bulk on this set compared to others, Cottonee truly appreciates teammates that can take Fire-, Flying-, Poison-, and Ice-type attacks. Cottonee's Encore is useful throughout the match, so having a source of entry hazard removal can be beneficial to ensure Cottonee's longevity.

SubSeed
########
name: SubSeed
move 1: Encore
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Substitute / Protect
move 4: Protect / Stun Spore / Taunt / Memento
ability: Prankster
item: Eviolite / Leftovers
evs: 116 HP / 196 Def / 196 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Due to Cottonee's Prankster ability, Encore is a fantastic move choice, as it allows Cottonee to set up a Substitute and begin stalling with Leech Seed. Leech Seed allows it to gain health while also whittling down any opposing non-Grass-type Pokemon. It can also be pseudo-recovery for other teammates that may switch in. Substitute allows Cottonee to be as annoying as possible and functions nicely with two turns of Leech Seed recovery making up for one Substitute. This effectively enables Cottonee to set up Substitute 7-8 times if the enemy is constantly breaking through them. Protect can be used instead, as it doesn't whittle Cottonee's health down; however, using Protect makes Cottonee more vulnerable to continued attacks, and Protect cannot reliably knock down the foe's health every turn due to its chance to fail if used in succession. Stun Spore can be used to spread paralysis throughout the opponent's team, but the nerf to powder moves has resulted in better options for this moveslot. Taunt can be used to stop setup sweepers or leads from setting entry hazards. Memento can be used as a last resort move, dealing a final blow to the opponent's active Pokemon, allowing ample time for a capable sweeper to boost.

Set Details
========

The EV spread hits Eviolite numbers and allows Cottonee to have excellent bulk. Leftovers is a gimmicky option compared to Eviolite but provides Cottonee with constant recovery, allowing for more Substitutes than normal. Berry Juice can be used instead and functions nicely with Substitute. Prankster allows Cottonee to function superbly as a support Pokemon, granting all of its non-attacking moves +1 priority.

Usage Tips
========

Cottonee should be used mainly to annoy the opponent and can be viewed as a wallbreaker of sorts. It can gradually wear down an opponent's team with Leech Seed, allowing for an ally to sweep later. Cottonee should Encore a setup or resisted move and proceed to set up a Substitute and Leech Seed. If Fletchling is present on an opponent's team, it is best to eliminate it first before attempting to Leech Seed stall. The same applies to opposing Grass-types and Pokemon with abilities that make them immune to Grass-type attacks (e.g. Sap Sipper).

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can switch into Fletchling are the most ideal partners; Pokemon such as Archen, Chinchou, and Tirtouga are all prime examples. A Pokemon that can eliminate Grass-types is also quite handy. Fletchling and Vullaby work nicely thanks to their priority Acrobatics and immunity to powder-based moves by way of Overcoat, respectively. Pokemon that can capitalize on gradually weakened teams, such as Moxie Scraggy, are great as well, as the sweeper will not only appreciate the wear-and-tear of the opponent's team, but also enjoy the pseudo-recovery from Leech Seed.

Other Options
########

Although Stun Spore is usually the better status option, Toxic allows for some more stall-oriented options. Switcheroo can be used with Choice items or a Flame Orb to dismantle an opponent's team in a pinch. Thanks to its Prankster ability, Cottonee is a reliable setter of Sunny Day, allowing ally Pokemon such as Bellsprout to sweep. It also allows Cottonee to retain some form of offensive presence with options such as Solar Beam and Hidden Power Fire. Tailwind can be used similarly to Memento, allowing teammates to possibly sweep. Cotton Guard is an option so as to further increase Cottonee's Defense stat. Cotton Spore slows down the enemy, but Stun Spore can usually fulfill this duty more effectively. Tickle, Confide, and Fake Tears lower the foe's offensive and defensive stats, which can lead to some shenanigans when utilized in tandem with potent sweepers. Nature Power is essentially a priority Tri Attack thanks to Prankster, which can help to finish up weakened threats, notably Fletchling. An offensive Life Orb set can be fun, but Cottonee is too weak to effectively utilize a purely offensive set. Choice Specs can be used successfully in tandem with a few different moves; it can cripple an opposing wall via Switcheroo or allow Cottonee to fire off potent Nature Powers thanks to the added priority from Prankster.

Checks and Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Foongus, Ferroseed, and Snover can all come in undisturbed and hit Cottonee with a super effective move. They are immune to Cottonee's Stun Spore and Leech Seed, and all three threaten Cottonee with their respective STAB moves.

**Poison-types**: Grimer, Trubbish, and Foongus can all OHKO Cottonee with their super effective STAB moves, and usually do not mind anything Cottonee can do to them.

**Steel-types**: Pokemon such as Pawniard and Magnemite can almost always beat Cottonee one-on-one. Magnemite is immune to Stun Spore and hits hard with Flash Cannon; however, it needs to watch out for Knock Off. Pawniard is a huge threat due to its ability, Defiant, which actually boosts its Attack stat when it is hit with Memento, effectively neutralizing any support Cottonee attempts to provide its team when fainting itself.

**Flying-types**: Fletchling can come in on any move, and usually doesn't mind a Stun Spore, as it outspeeds everything notable with priority Acrobatics. Vullaby is immune to all of Cottonee's powder-related moves thanks to Overcoat and takes very little from an uninvested Dazzling Gleam.

**Fire-types**: Fire-types resist both of Cottonee's STAB moves and can heavily damage it in return with their own STAB moves, but they still don't appreciate a Stun Spore.

**Utility Counters**: Any Pokemon that can use Taunt or Encore to shut down Cottonee is a big threat and can prevent Cottonee from being able to both support its team and cripple the opponent's team.

**Natu**: Natu can completely nullify most of Cottonee's crucial status moves with Magic Bounce.

**Abra**: Abra is immune to any passive damage and can hit extremely hard with Psychic; however, it still needs to watch out for Knock Off when switching in.
