Overview
########
Tyrunt's unique Rock / Dragon typing makes it an interesting choice in Little Cup. It has the right tools and stats to prove an annoyance to the opposing team or as a dangerous sweeper with access to Dragon Dance. Tyrunt is one of the only Pokemon to have the ability Strong Jaw, which boosts all bite-based attacks by 1.5x, the equivalent of a STAB boost. Tyrunt can use this ability well with its access to all the bite-based moves. Tyrunt also counters one of Little Cup's most dangerous Pokemon, Fletchling. Sadly, common types such as Ground, Fighting, and Fairy pose a major hindrance to Tyrunt. Also, Tyrunt faces competition as a Stealth Rock setter from Archen and defensive Tirtouga, while Shell Smash users outclass it as a sweeper. But, despite these negative traits, Tyrunt's great movepool and typing allow it to be a threat when given the right support.

Stealth Rock
########
name: Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Dragon Tail
move 3: Stone Edge / Rock Slide
move 4: Fire Fang / Brick Break
ability: Strong Jaw
item: Berry Juice / Eviolite
evs: 52 HP / 124 Atk / 220 Def / 76 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
Tyrunt's great typing and bulk make it a good choice as a Stealth Rock setter. Dragon Tail is a STAB move used to punish switch-ins; it works especially well with Stealth Rock to get chip damage on whatever Pokemon is sent in. Stone Edge is Tyrunt's strongest and most reliable STAB move; alternatively, Rock Slide could be used for more accuracy. The last move could be either Fire Fang or Brick Break, both moves that can provide coverage against Steel-types. Fire Fang OHKOes Ferroseed and is boosted by Strong Jaw, while Brick Break OHKOes Pawniard if Tyrunt is not outsped and hit by a super effective Iron Head first.


Set Details
========
The EVs are used to keep Tyrunt's Attack high while maintaining good bulk, specifically allowing it to tank Brave Bird and Acrobatics from Flying-types. If a wish passer is used on the same team as Tyrunt, it is highly recommended to use Eviolite and a spread of 52 HP / 204 Atk / 140 Def / 76 SpD.


Usage Tips
========
Tyrunt has very high physical bulk, so it should be used to wall Normal- or Flying-types and take that opportunity to set up Stealth Rock or use Dragon Tail if it's already up. Tyrunt lacks any form of reliable recovery, so either Berry Juice or a teammate that can pass Wish is needed to provide longevity.


Team Options
========
Spritzee is the obvious partner for Tyrunt, as it can switch into Fighting-type attacks, keep Tyrunt alive with Wish, and eliminate status, which allows Tyrunt to better take advantage of Eviolite. Tyrunt also tanks Poison-type attacks aimed at Spritzee; However, They both need to be wary of Steel-types. Magnemite, Ferroseed, and Tentacool can tank the Steel- and Fairy-type attacks aimed at Tyrunt while Tyrunt can absorb Fire-type attacks for the former two and Electric-type attacks for the latter. Pumpkaboo is immune to Fighting and resists Ground while also spinblocking to keep Stealth Rock up against Drilbur and Staryu. Lastly, Trubbish can take on Fighting- and Fairy-types and up Spikes or Toxic Spikes to build up on Dragon Tail damage. In addition, Tentacool can also set up Toxic Spikes.

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Dragon Claw
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Fire Fang / Brick Break
ability: Strong Jaw
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 52 HP / 124 Atk / 76 SpD / 212 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
Tyrunt's access to Dragon Dance combined with 14 Speed lets it outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after a Dragon Dance. Dragon Claw is Tyrunt's main STAB attack, as it provides the best neutral coverage. Stone Edge is Tyrunt's strongest attack, but its accuracy leaves it as a secondary choice. Fire Fang hits nearly as hard as Dragon Claw with Strong Jaw and nails all Grass- and Steel-types except Pawniard harder than any other move. Alternatively, Brick Break is also an option over Fire Fang because it notably OHKOes Pawniard.

Set Details
========
The EVs give Tyrunt 14 Speed and high Attack while still maintaining good bulk. The choice between Berry Juice and Eviolite comes down to personal preference. Eviolite lets Tyrunt survive strong attacks such as Spritzee's Moonblast, while Berry Juice works better when trying to survive attacks such as Mach Punch or Acrobatics.

Usage Tips
========
Tyrunt's high physical bulk will give it opportunities to set up against Normal- or Flying-types. It is recommended to not set-up until Tyrunt's counters and checks have been hit by Knock Off or weakened, as then the extra power from Dragon Dance will allow for a sweep.

Team Options
========
Gothita and Wynaut are nice choices for eliminating Fighting-types, and in Wynaut's case, turning Pokemon into setup bait with Encore. Croagunk and Timburr can be useful for luring in or eliminating Spritzee by hitting it with STAB super effective Sludge Bomb or using Knock Off. Entry hazard setters such as Drilbur or Trubbish will help Tyrunt achieve some more KOs.


Other Options
########
Tyrunt can pull off a Rest + Sleep Talk set for more durability and longevity, but it suffers from bad STAB coverage. Curse and Dragon Tail prevent Tyrunt from being setup bait to some Pokemon while forcing out and preventing its checks from coming in safely. Choice Scarf turns Tyrunt into a good revenge killer, but it does not have access to Outrage, so its cleaning ability is sub par. Aerial Ace gives the Dragon Dance set a means of hitting Fighting-types harder. Ice Fang allows Tyrunt to heavily damage Ground-types. Lastly, Earthquake can hit Croagunk and Chinchou for a lot of damage while still hitting Steel-types for super effective damage.


Checks & Counters
########
**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types such as Spiritzee and Snubbull both threaten Tyrunt with their super effective STAB moves, while boasting an immunity to Tyrunt's Dragon STAB moves.

**Ground-types**: Ground-types such as Hippopotas and Drilbur deal a hefty chunk to Tyrunt with their super effective STAB moves and possess the bulk to be able to come in and threaten the Dragon Dance set. Drilbur also can spin away Stealth Rock.

**Fighting-types**: The multitude of strong Fighting-types such as Timburr, Mienfoo, Croagunk, and Scraggy all give Tyrunt major trouble. They can easily shut down the Dragon Dance set, recover any damage taken with Drain Punch, or Knock Off its Berry Juice from the Stealth Rock set.

**Steel-types**: Magnemite with Sturdy and Berry Juice can switch in on anything without taking any prior Stealth Rock damage, and threaten with Flash Cannon. Pawniard threatens the Stealth Rock set without Brick Break, and Scarf Pawniard outspeeds +1 tyrunt.

**Ice-types**: Ice-types such as Amaura or Snover can't switch into most of Tyrunt's attacks but they can both threaten to OHKO or deal a lot of damage to with their Ice-type STAB moves.
