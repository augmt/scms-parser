Overview
########

Dratini, at first glance, seems average. With the introduction of Fairies, Dratini has taken a major blow, and when this is combined with its low bulk, things aren't much in its favor. Dratini's lower Speed tier also stops it from being very threatening without boosts. However, Dratini has access to two amazing moves: Dragon Dance and Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed's power boosted by Dragon Dance makes Dratini very threatening. Dratini also boasts a good STAB move in Outrage, which 2HKOes anything that doesn't resist it when Dratini is at +1. Because of these traits, Dratini remains a good Pokemon in the Little Cup metagame.

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Extreme Speed
move 4: Iron Tail / Fire Blast
ability: Shed Skin
item: Life Orb
evs: 244 Atk / 36 SpD / 196 Spe
ivs: 0 HP
nature: Adamant / Naughty

Moves
========

Dragon Dance boosts both Dratini's Attack and Speed stats, allowing it to sweep. Outrage is an extremely powerful STAB move that hits Pokemon that don't resist it hard when Dratini is at +1. Extreme Speed works well with Dragon Dance, as at 80 Base Power, it hits most weakened Pokemon very hard when Dratini is boosted. Iron Tail hits Fairy-type Pokemon very hard, but due to its low accuracy, Fire Blast should be used to hit Steel-type Pokemon instead.

Set Details
========

The Attack EVs with a boosting nature maximize Dratini's Attack, allowing it to hit as hard as possible after a Dragon Dance. A Naughty nature should be used if Fire Blast is chosen. The Speed EVs allow Dratini to hit 21 Speed after a Dragon Dance and outspeed the majority of the metagame. A Life Orb boosts Dratini's damage output at the cost of some HP each hit. 0 HP IVs reduce Life Orb recoil to 1 HP point per hit. Shed Skin allows Dratini to shrug off burns and paralysis.

Usage Tips
========

Dratini doesn't have much coverage, so getting rid of all of Dratini's checks and counters is preferred, as it makes Dratini's sweeping much easier. That being said, Dratini is best used late-game. Dratini can also punch holes in the opponent's team so that another sweeper can come in and attempt to sweep. Fairy-types are a complete stop to Dratini if it is locked into Outrage, so it's ideal to clear them out before setting up. Lastly, Fake Out users can easily KO a weakened Dratini as Fake Out always moves before Extreme Speed, so sometimes it is better to switch out rather than allow Dratini to be KOed.

Team Options
========

Dratini is pretty frail, so dual screens support from Bronzor or Encore support from Cottonee is ideal to make setting up Dragon Dance easier. Wynaut easily traps and gets rid of Dratini's checks, also allowing Dratini to set up easier. Cottonee has priority Encore and Memento, which usually forces the opponent to switch out, giving Dratini a free turn to use Dragon Dance. Magnemite traps Steel-types and can hit Fairies with Flash Cannon. Entry hazards setters such as Dwebble and Ferroseed can provide hazard support to allow Dratini to net more KOs. Timburr can also clear out Steel-types if they are a problem.

Mixed Attacker
########
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Extreme Speed
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Iron Tail
ability: Shed Skin
item: Life Orb
evs: 164 Atk / 196 SpA / 116 Spe
ivs: 0 HP
nature: Rash

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is an insanely powerful STAB move that hits like a nuke in combination with a Life Orb. Extreme Speed finishes off weakened Pokemon. Fire Blast hits Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Foongus fairly hard. Iron Tail is used to hit Fairy-types, most notably Spritzee.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Special Attack while also boosting Attack. The Speed EVs are to hit 13 Speed, allowing Dratini to outspeed most walls. A Rash nature boosts Special Attack while not hindering the power of Extreme Speed. A Life Orb boosts the power of Dratini's moves at the cost of some HP. 0 HP IVs minimize Life Orb recoil. Shed Skin gets rid of paralysis and burns.

Usage Tips
========

This set aims to wallbreak, not sweep. Draco Meteor should be the main move used, as it hits most threats very hard. Steel- and Fairy-type switch-ins should be predicted and punished with the appropriate coverage move. Extreme Speed can also allow Dratini to function as a revenge killer.

Team Options
========

Entry hazards support from Dwebble or Ferroseed is greatly appreciated as it helps score many notable KOs, including the 2HKO on Chinchou with Draco Meteor and Extreme Speed. Dratini can also clean out threats on the opposing teams to make the job easier for sweepers such as Tirtouga, Shellder, Scraggy, and Pawniard. Magnemite resists Fairy- and Ice-type attacks and can Volt Switch Dratini in. Mienfoo scares Ice-types and can lure in Fairies, which Dratini can hit hard with Iron Tail.

Other Options
########

A parashuffler set with Thunder Wave and Dragon Tail can work, but Dratini lacks sufficient bulk to use it. Dratini can work with its special movepool, but it lacks the stats to use a fully special set and it relies too much on Extreme Speed. A RestTalk set using Marvel Scale or a Rest set using Shed Skin with Dragon Dance and Outrage can work. Waterfall provides little extra coverage, but it can be used to hit Drilbur. A Choice Band can be used, but Dratini relies too much on its versatility.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Fairies such as Spritzee can easily beat Dratini, but are threatened by Iron Tail.

**Steel-types**: Steel-type Pokemon such as Pawniard don't take much damage from Dratini's STAB moves or Extremespeed, but they must be wary of Fire Blast. Pawniard in particular is able to bypass Fire Blast with Sucker Punch, although it usually fails to OHKO Dratini without prior damage.

**Sturdy**: Sturdy stops Dratini from OHKOing opponents, and most Pokemon with Sturdy can take advantage of Dratini's frail defenses and KO it.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Choice Scarf users such as Gastly can outspeed Dratini and hit it hard with a STAB attack.

**Fake Out**: Fake Out can pick off a weakened Dratini as Fake Out has higher priority than Extreme Speed.
