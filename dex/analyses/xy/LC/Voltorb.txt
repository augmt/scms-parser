Overview
########

Voltorb is a unique Pokemon, though it is really only useful for its high Speed. It has quite a shallow movepool, but has enough moves to work well in several roles, but the only role in which it truly shines is as a Taunt user. Whenever you see Voltorb, which is not exceedingly often, it will likely run Taunt. Voltorb is quite frail. However, it shouldn't need to take many hits because it can revenge kill almost the entire metagame, thanks to its workable Special Attack which lets it run offensive sets as well as support sets, though these are less viable because Elekid outclasses Voltorb in every aspect but Speed. It can be devastating with a Life Orb (or even a Choice Specs). Voltorb's three abilities are all very interesting and varied. All in all, Voltorb can be a potent status user or an attacker that pulls its weight, but prospective users should be wary of its flaws.

Lead
########
name: Lead
move 1: Rain Dance
move 2: Thunder
move 3: Volt Switch
move 4: Taunt / Thunder Wave
ability: Static / Aftermath
item: Damp Rock / Eviolite
evs: 36 HP / 36 Def / 236 SpA / 196 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Rain Dance ensures weather due to Voltorb's extremely high Speed. It also makes Thunder, Voltorb's best attack, 100% accurate. Thunder is deadly under rain. However, it's too unreliable to be used without rain, so be sure to have Rain Dance up before you use the move. Volt Switch is an effective switching move, especially when coupled with STAB. It is useful in many situations and can to ensure Voltorb's survival in tight spots. Taunt is a good choice to counter the opponent's lead and status Pokemon, and can also stop boosting sweepers in their tracks. It is especially useful against entry hazard users such as Dwebble, as well as being Voltorb's only real niche over Elekid. However, it's next to useless against anything else and Thunder Wave can be used instead.

Set Details
========

Static is a useful ability in any situation, and offers a decent paralysis chance and that can cripple enemies. Aftermath can be equally useful by damaging defensive checks to Voltorb that manage to knock it out. Item-wise, a Damp Rock is almost mandatory for anything running Rain Dance. Eviolite should be used to bolster Voltorb's pitiful defenses in lieu of rain. The latter item prevents many OHKOs, notably from Choice Scarf users such as Pawniard and Mienfoo. The given EV spread allows Voltorb to deal significant damage, and, with a Timid nature, to outspeed almost the entire metagame.

Usage Tips
========

This set is useful as a support lead and can deal serious damage to boot. Use the Rain Dance variant on rain teams as a Rain Dance user and a rain sweeper. The Eviolite variant is an excellent status lead on any team. Voltorb's tremendous Speed allows it to revenge kill quite a few Pokemon, as well as to outspeed and KO some other common leads.

Team Options
========

This set can't run Hidden Power Ice, so an Ice- or Grass-type is welcome to deal with Ground-types. Grass also resists Electric, so a Fire- or Flying-type helps as well. Even a Bug-type might be helpful, and might also be used to counter the many Psychic-type special walls that check this set. Of course, anything with an ability boosted by rain also benefits from this set.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Volt Switch
move 4: Hidden Power Ice
ability: Static / Aftermath
item: Life Orb
evs: 36 HP / 36 Def / 236 SpA / 196 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Taunt is one of Voltorb's niches and is always an extremely useful move in LC. It's also the only thing offensive Voltorb has on Elekid. Of course, Taunt is difficult almost pointless to use with a Choice item, so Charge Beam must be used if you use the Choice Specs to provide an attacking boosting move. However, Taunt absolutely must be used on non-Choice item sets. Thunderbolt is Voltorb's only reliable high Base Power STAB special attack, and is Voltorb's main means of sweeping. It will deal a sizable chunk of damage to many Pokemon with a Life Orb, and even more with Choice Specs. Hidden Power Ice is Voltorb's source of coverage on the two types that resist Electric: Ground and Grass. It's moderately powerful with the boosting items that can be used with this set.

Set Details
========

Again, Static is a powerful ability which can provide Voltorb with the capability to spread paralysis even with only offensive moves. Aftermath can be quite nice as well, making a revenge kill by a teammate much more likely. Life Orb is a useful item which increases Voltorb's damage output, yet Choice Specs provides a much bigger boost at the cost of versatility. Generally, Life Orb is preferable. The same EV spread as used on the first set is advised here, and is equally useful because it allows Voltorb to outspeed and OHKO or 2HKO most of the metagame. Timid allows Voltorb to hit 20 Speed and outrun almost every other unboosted Pokemon.

Usage Tips
========

Voltorb is an effective attacker and one of very few decent Electric-types in LC. It can be used as a special attacker on any team needing some Electric-type coverage. The Choice Specs variant of this set can be used as a powerful pivot, and with the right switching, pairs well with a different Life Orb user such as Abra. Feel free to attach a Choice Scarf to this set as well, as it allows Voltorb to outspeed the entirety of LC, even other Choice Scarf users.

Team Options
========

Some defensive allies, like such as Tirtouga and Koffing, are helpful to this set. Voltorb's pitiful defenses need some backup. Attackers to counter Rock- and Steel-types are also welcome, because this set can't handle those very well. For the Choice Specs set, something with U-turn to build a VoltTurn core is useful. As mentioned previously, Abra is also very useful.

Other Options
########

Voltorb could try to run Hidden Powers besides Ice to get coverage on Steel-types, but Hidden Power Ice is generally superior. Charge Beam is a nice way for Voltorb to increase its Special Attack, and can do significant damage after a few boosts. A set built around the use of the move would be interesting and unexpected, but might be difficult to pull off. Sucker Punch is an acceptable answer to Choice Scarf users that might outspeed Voltorb.

Many different items can be used effectively with Voltorb, notably Air Balloon and Assault Vest. Voltorb can also run Thief effectively due to its high base Speed. A set featuring Substitute and Berry Juice can be very effective. Light Screen is always a useful option for a lead that can learn it, and Voltorb appreciates the boost to Special Defense.

Checks &amp; Counters
########

**Choice Scarf Users**: With its high Speed and low defenses, Voltorb badly wants to outspeed its opponents, but many foes are faster when they equip a Choice Scarf. Voltorb could carry Protect to scout for this. Voltorb must be especially wary of Ground-type Choice Scarf users.

**Special Walls**: Voltorb can't handle anything that can stomach an attack from it. This includes Chinchou and anything else that resists Ice-type attacks and is neutral to Electric-type attacks. Lileep is also a powerful check to Voltorb.

**Ground-types**: Voltorb's only true counters besides Chinchou are Ground-types. Voltorb has such a hard time dealing with them, especially on the lead set, that it's generally a good idea to support Voltorb with Shellder or another strong Ice-, Water-, or Grass-type to assist it. Once those are eliminated, Voltorb has almost no hope against Ground-types. Its Hidden Power Ice can provide only fleeting coverage.
