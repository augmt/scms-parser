Overview
########

Cyndaquil can be a very potent wallbreaker under the right conditions, but unfortunately, these are hard to meet because of its poor bulk and reliance on maintaining Eruption's high Base Power. It's almost a necessity to clear entry hazards for using Cyndaquil, and any priority moves or faster Choice Scarf users may also severely hinder it. Other Fire-types such as Vulpix are generally better options, and Cyndaquil should thus be used only when its very specific niche is desired.

Moves
========

Eruption is Cyndaquil's most powerful move and the main appeal to using Cyndaquil. However, its power is diminished by any damage taken by Cyndaquil, especially from entry hazards and priority moves. Extrasensory is a coverage move specifically for hitting Skrelp, Croagunk, and Tentacool. Hidden Power Ground and Grass both hit Chinchou and Rock-types super effectively; Hidden Power Ground also hits opposing Fire-types and the rare Tyrunt, while Hidden Power Grass hits Water-types and many Rock-types that are 4x weak to Grass. Fire Blast is an alternative STAB move for when Cyndaquil (and Eruption) has been weakened.

Set Details
========

Choice Scarf lets Cyndaquil outspeed all unboosted Pokemon and some opposing Choice Scarf users. Blaze allows a severely weakened Cyndaquil to do much more damage. Flash Fire can allow Cyndaquil to come in freely on a Fire move to receive a boost, but Cyndaquil often loses to opposing Fire-types anyway. The EVs are aimed to maximize Cyndaquil's offensive stats. The HP EVs allow Cyndaquil to switch into Stealth Rock four times without fainting, and the extra EVs are placed in Defense to better tank priority moves. A Timid nature lets Cyndaquil outspeed other Choice Scarf users such as Bunnelby or Pawniard, but the extra Speed isn't always needed. Using a Modest nature to hit as hard as possible is a viable alternative.

Usage Tips
========

When Cyndaquil is at 15 HP (71%) or lower, Fire Blast has a higher Base Power than Eruption. Also note that a Blaze-boosted Fire Blast hits harder than Eruption at full health. If using Flash Fire, switch into predicted Fire moves when Cyndaquil will be able to KO the foe with a Flash Fire boost. If the opposing Pokemon has a priority move or is a faster Choice Scarf user, it may be risky to use Eruption and have its Base Power weakened before attacking. Try to avoid taking any damage at all, as it's very important to keep Eruption's Base Power high.

Team Options
========

Defog or Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Archen and Vullaby is absolutely essential to preserve Eruption's high Base Power. Drilbur is a particularly good Rapid Spin user because of its ability to threaten opposing Fire-types and Rock-types; it also has a favorable matchup against Chinchou, while Cyndaquil handles Grass-types in return. Vulpix's Drought can allow Cyndaquil to hit much harder and OHKO many more Pokemon. Slow pivots such as Mienfoo or Chinchou allow Cyndaquil to come into battle without taking any damage.

Other Options
########

Hidden Power Electric can be used to hit Mantyke and Archen. On a non-Choice Scarf set, Flame Charge can be used to sweep, but Cyndaquil lacks the bulk and power to do this. Lava Plume could be used as an alternate STAB move for its 100% accuracy and ability to burn foes. Will-O-Wisp can also be used to burn Cyndaquil's checks such as Munchlax, Hippopotas, and Archen. Choice Specs can be used for additional power but fails to be effective against faster Pokemon.

Checks & Counters
########

**Priority Users**: Cyndaquil's poor bulk means that priority users such as Fletchling and Bunnelby will be able to KO it after very little prior damage. Even if they do not KO it, Eruption will be rendered useless.

**Water-types**: Able to come in on any move barring Hidden Power Grass, Water-types immediately force Cynadaquil out. Mantyke has an enormous Special Defense stat and isn't weak to Hidden Power Grass or Ground, making it one of Cyndaquil's best checks. Other Water-types such as Corphish and Tirtouga have access to Aqua Jet to easily OHKO Cyndaquil.

**Rock-types**: Rock types don't appreciate taking a Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Ground from Cyndaquil, but can otherwise easily come in and threaten it out. Many of them are able to set up Stealth Rock to limit Cyndaquil's future use. Archen is especially problematic because it is not weak to the Hidden Powers that Cyndaquil normally uses.

**Passive Damage**: Taking any sort of damage, whether it be from entry hazards, poison, or weather, reduces Eruption's power and limits Cyndaquil's damage output.
