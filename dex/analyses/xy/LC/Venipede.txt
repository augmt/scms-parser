Overview
########

Venipede has access to Speed Boost, which allows it to quickly outspeed the opposition and set up entry hazards. It has a pretty good defensive typing and 4x resistances to Fighting and Grass. Pin Missile, with a little bit of luck, can hit multiple times to break Focus Sashes. Venipede faces competition from other hazard setters such as Dwebble and Pineco, but has a niche in Speed Boost and Endeavor; however, it is not very bulky, it has a poor offensive presence, and doesn't learn Baton Pass.

Entry Hazard Setter
########
name: Entry Hazard Setter
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Toxic Spikes
move 3: Protect
move 4: Endeavor / Pin Missile
ability: Speed Boost
item: Eviolite / Focus Sash
evs: 236 Atk / 44 Def / 220 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Speed Boost helps Venipede lay down at least a few layers of Spikes and Toxic Spikes, the latter of which is a rare, unexpected entry hazard in LC. Toxic Spikes's presence also helps boost the effectiveness of other Pokemon using Venoshock or Hex, and chip damage helps sweeping teammates. Protect confers free Speed boosts and protection against Fake Out. Endeavor can be used toward the end of Venipede's life, such as when Focus Sash activates, to weaken the foe so that it can be KOed easily, especially with Pin Missile. STAB Pin Missile does a fair amount of damage, breaking possible Focus Sashes.

Set Details
========

A Jolly nature and max Speed EVs allow Venipede to outspeed most Pokemon without needing to Protect, and max Attack EVs maximize the effectiveness of Pin Missile. The remaining EVs go into Defense for extra bulk, though they could be left out to get Venipede's HP down to 1 quicker for maximum power Endeavor; if you do this, you might as well lower the IVs to 0 as well.

Usage Tips
========

Venipede is only really good for setting up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and although it's tempting to lead with it, most leads can stop Venipede, so if the foe has a counter such as Dwebble, save Venipede for mid- or late-game. Protect should be used to stop Fake Out and to gain enough Speed to outspeed the foe. Venipede can stack entry hazards effectively against walls that often fail to deal enough damage to 3HKO it. Pokemon such as Spritzee, Snubbull, Foongus, and non-Bulk Up Timburr are examples of Pokemon Venipede can switch into. It's ideal to save Venipede until all Defoggers and Spinners are gone before entry hazard stacking.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate general chip damage, such as Zigzagoon, or any other setup sweeper, such as Fletchling or Timburr, make good teammates. Venipede's primary role is neutered by Rapid Spinners and Defoggers such as Staryu and Drilbur, so spinblockers and Defiant users such as Pumpkaboo and Pawniard, respectively, make great teammates. Gastly is a more offensive option instead of Pumpkaboo for a spinblocker. Although it is frail, Gastly benefits greatly from the presence of entry hazards, as it can fire off a 130 Base Power STAB Venoshock if the target is poisoned, which Venipede can ensure by setting up Toxic Spikes. More stall-oriented Pokemon such as Spritzee, Lickitung, and Hippopotas make good teammates because of the switches they force, so the entry hazard damage will add up while they can recover off stray damage.

Other Options
########

STAB Poison Jab OHKOes or heavily damages most Fairy-types, such as Cottonee, which can encore Venipede into a move, and Spritzee, which is potentially 2HKOed. Infestation can trap foes if they are of little threat and are without U-turn or Volt Switch, allowing easy setup, but the bulkier Shelmet does this a little more consistently. Venipede could run an offensive Life Orb set with Pin Missile / Protect / Pursuit / Poison Jab. A set with a 236 Atk / 44 Def / 220 Spe spread could be used with Focus Sash as well.

Checks & Counters
########

**Entry Hazard Removers**: Entry hazard removing Pokemon such as Drilbur, Staryu, and Vullaby eliminate Venipede's entry hazards with Rapid Spin or Defog and threaten it out with their respective attacks.

**Flying-types**: Flying-types such as Archen and Vullaby can Defog away Venipede's entry hazards and have Flying-type STAB moves to counter Venipede. They are also immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes.

**Setup Sweepers**: Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Pawniard and Fletchling can easily set up on Venipede due to its weak Attack stat.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types can take Venipede's attacks with ease, while Ghost-types such as Gastly can use the opportunity to set up a Substitute or boost in preparation of a sweep.
