Disruptive Pivot
########
name: Disruptive Pivot
move 1: Encore
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Swagger / Thunder Wave
move 4: Foul Play / Knock Off 
ability: Prankster
item: Eviolite 
evs: 188 HP / 60 Def / 228 Spe 
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

- Encore disrupts support Pokemon as well as setup sweepers, locking them into an undesirable move
- U-turn is great for grabbing momentum 
- Swagger and Foul Play is a rage-inducing combination that is very powerful with a little luck; Purrloin gets STAB on Foul Play as well
- STAB Knock Off is great also for crippling switch-ins after Encore is used, and also deals considerable damage
- Thunder Wave is an ideal option for quickly putting setup sweepers out of commission and making them easy to take out by teammates
- Play Rough is a new attacking option this generation that allows Purrloin to hit Fighting-types for super effective damage on the switch-in

Set Details
========

- Eviolite is the ideal item to use here because Purrloin's pitiful bulk likely won't allow it to take many hits to be able to recover health back from Berry Juice
- 228 Speed EVs and Jolly nature give Purrloin a respectable Speed stat of 17, which outspeeds an important group of Pokemon, including Pawniard and Meditite
- The remaining EVs give Purrloin the highest bulk possible with Eviolite, and since LC is largely more physically inclined than special, they are put into physical bulk

Usage Tips
========

- Encore can lock the opponent into a setup or support move
- U-turn is great to use after Encoring the foe into something undesirable; if they switch out,  you can U-turn out to a comfortable check, and if they stay in, you can bring in a setup sweeper or supporter of your own and get at least one free turn
- Swagger and Foul Play are very destructive but the lack factor does present a risk
- Thunder Wave can be used to make a last-ditch attempt to slow down a problematic enemy before going down
- Purrloin should always beware of Fighting- and Fairy-types
- Knock Off smacks Natu hard if it tries to come in to deflect Purrloin's status moves
- Play Rough is only for predicted switch-ins to Fighting-types and should never be used against them head on when they have a turn to hit back, unless their health is low enough for an outspeed + KO

Team Options
========

- Slow VoltTurn users like Magnemite and Larvesta make good teammates that can VoltTurn out and bring Purrloin if they used a setup or support move, setting Purrloin up to Encore them, U-turn out on their switch, cripple the foe with a status move, or remove their item with Knock Off
- Poison-types like Croagunk, Foongus, and Trubbish (especially, due to its Sticky Hold) are ideal partners that can easily take on the Fighting- and Fairy-types that Purrloin has problems with
- Spritzee is an ideal partner that has little to fear from the Fighting-types that threaten Purrloin and can chase them away for a free turn
- Any strategy that appreciates paralysis support and momentum would be glad to include Purrloin as long as it's not played carelessly

Other Options
########

- Fake Out for chip damage and for gauging the opponent's Eviolite or lack thereof
- Copycat works with Prankster to use whatever move was last used, but with priority, this can turn the tide of battle in many scenarios
- Taunt is a viable option for anything with Prankster and can shut down support Pokemon
- Play Rough is a new move Purrloin gets and it can hit the Fighting- and Dark-types that resist its STAB for super effective damage
- Gunk Shot is surprisingly available to Purrloin and can hit Fairy-types for hard super-effective damage
- Sunny Day and Rain Dance with the corresponding weather rock can make Purrloin into a reliable weather setter that always gets the weather up thanks to Prankster
- Sucker Punch can be used to take down faster foes if they are at low health and can also be used to surprise attackers that are weak to it, such as Abra and Gastly
- Pursuit is an option for getting a good chunk of damage on a foe that is switching out to avoid being locked into Encore


Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Spritzee resists every attack in the set and is immune to Encore, and can one-shot Purrloin easily with Moonblast, while Cottonee can Taunt Purrloin to block its status moves, and hit it hard with Dazzling Gleam, while also resisting Purrloin's STAB

**Fighting-types**: Basically every Fighting-type in LC can take down Purrloin in one simple hit; they also wall every attack in the set

**Own Tempo Lickitung**: It can reap the Attack boost from Swagger without suffering confusion status, and Foul Play can only 3HKO Impish Eviolite Lickitung if it has +2 Attack, while it can hit back super hard with +2 STAB Return and no confusion

**Numel**: It is immune to both Swagger's confusion effect (it still gets the Attack boost) and Thunder Wave, making it impossible for Purrloin to status it

**Attackers in General**: Anything with decent attacking power that manages to hit Purrloin even just neutrally will probably 2HKO it, as its bulk is quite pitiful, you'd just have to fight through the paralysis and confusion and other things to be able to hit it
