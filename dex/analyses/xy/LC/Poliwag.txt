Overview
########
Poliwag was blessed with an amazing Speed stat, outspeeding most of the unboosted metagame. It's one of two Pokemon in the LC metagame that has access to both Hypnosis and Belly Drum, allowing it to put a Pokemon to sleep and then Belly Drum to boost its Attack dramatically. Unfortunately, Poliwag's defenses are not that great, and there are better Belly Drum users out there, specifically Zigzagoon.

Belly Drum
########
name: Belly Drum
move 1: Belly Drum
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Hypnosis / Encore
move 4: Return / Thief
ability: Water Absorb
item: Berry Juice
evs: 116 HP / 196 Atk / 196 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
Poliwag needs to have Belly Drum as a move, otherwise it is useless. Belly Drum allows Poliwag to boost its Attack to +6. Waterfall is Poliwag's main attacking move because after a Belly Drum, very few Pokemon can take a non resisted +6 Waterfall. Hypnosis is useful for creating an opportunity to get off Belly Drum, as Poliwag outspeeds the majority of the metagame. Encore can be used on Fake Out users or Water-type moves that Poliwag is immune to, creating another opportunity to set up. Return or Thief can be used as the last move. Return hits hard and provides good coverage alongside Waterfall, but the likes of Frillish and Ferroseed can easily stop it. Thief allows Poliwag to steal the opposing Pokemon's items after Poliwag loses its Berry Juice when using Belly Drum and also allows Poliwag to hit Frillish.

Set Details
========
This set is simple to use. Poliwag puts opposing Pokemon to sleep with Hypnosis, then uses Belly Drum to reach a massive Attack stat. Then, it sweeps with Waterfall and either Thief or Return. Water Absorb provides Poliwag with an immunity to Water-type attacks, giving it a few chances to switch in. Berry Juice allows Poliwag to restore HP after using Belly Drum.

Team Options
========
Poliwag loves Sticky Web support, as it allows Poliwag to outspeed its common checks, such as Elekid and Choice Scarf Chinchou. Stealth Rock support is helpful for combating Magnemite and other Sturdy + Berry Juice users who can survive a hit. As for Pokemon that support Poliwag, Magnemite can help take out Poliwag's counters such as Ferroseed and Frillish.

Other Options
########
Poliwag has access to Swift Swim, allowing it to run a Rain Dance sweeper set, but rain teams are subpar in Little Cup. Poliwag can also use Wake-Up Slap as the fourth move to hit Ferroseed, but this wakes it up from sleep in the process. Protect can also be used to help against Pokemon who are attempting to whittle down Poliwag's HP by using Fake Out and then switching. Substitute can also be used to help prevent status moves, such as Thunder Wave from Porygon, from hindering Poliwag.

Checks & Counters
########
**Lileep**: Lileep can only be 2HKOed by Wake-Up Slap while taking all the other hits.

**Chinchou**: Chinchou can cause problems, as it can KO Poliwag with an Electric-type move, resists Waterfall, and if running a RestTalk set, it does not mind Hypnosis.

**Ferroseed**: Ferroseed resists Waterfall and Return, but has a slim chance of being 2HKOed by Thief.

**Frillish**: Frillish is immune to both Waterfall and Return. It only fears Thief from Poliwag.

**Croagunk**: Croagunk is immune to Waterfall and is only 2HKOed by Return while Sludge Bomb + Vacuum Wave KOes Poliwag.

**Carvanha**: Carvanha outspeeds after a Protect and KOes with Crunch.

**Elekid**: Elekid outspeeds Poliwag and can KO it with an Electric-type move.

**Fletchling**: Fletchling has a good chance to OHKO with Acrobatics.

**Timburr**: Timburr is only 2HkOed by Waterfall while KOing back with Drain Punch.

**Fake Out + Switching**: Aipom, Mienfoo, and Meowth can switch into Poliwag after a kill and chip away damage with Fake Out.
