Overview
########

For the most part, Grimer's role as a Sticky Hold user is done better by Trubbish, which has access to Recycle, allowing it to recover its Berry Juice, although Grimer has more of an offensive presence and a bit more bulk. Grimer also boasts access to the elemental punches, something Trubbish lacks. If you need a niche check to Spritzee and Pawniard, Grimer may have some use to you.


Bulky Attacker
########
name: Bulky Attacker
move 1: Gunk Shot
move 2: Fire Punch
move 3: Shadow Sneak
move 4: Thief / Pain Split
ability: Sticky Hold
item: Berry Juice
evs: 36 HP / 196 Atk / 196 Def / 36 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Gunk Shot is Grimer's most powerful attack, severely damaging anything that doesn't resist it. Fire Punch has very good coverage alongside Gunk Shot, mainly targeting Steel-types such as Pawniard, Magnemite, and Ferroseed. Shadow Sneak is helpful for bypassing Grimer's terrible Speed and makes picking off Pokemon such as Gastly easier. Thief can be used in the last moveslot to take a foe's item after Grimer's Berry Juice has been used. Pain Split can be used for the semi-reliable recovery it provides. Keep in mind, however, that Thief's coverage is nearly identical to that of Shadow Sneak.

Set Details
========

The given EVs and nature guarantee that Grimer can beat most Pawniard variants one-on-one, as it can never be 2HKOed by Pawniard's Knock Off and can always 2HKO with Fire Punch. An Adamant nature is also useful for the higher chance to OHKO Spritzee after Stealth Rock damage. Berry Juice is for recovery and greatly increases Grimer's longevity. Also, if Thief is used, Grimer can steal the foe's item after using its own Berry Juice.

Usage Tips
========

Grimer is best used as a check to Knock Off-spamming Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Pawniard, and Croagunk. However, Grimer cannot reliably check all forms of Pawniard, as Fire Punch does not always 2HKO Eviolite variants, therefore sometimes making it setup bait for Swords Dance Pawniard. Also, because Grimer is easily worn down due to its lack of recovery, try to use it sparingly.

Team Options
========

Lickitung makes a good partner for Grimer, as it can spread paralysis, which Grimer appreciates, and provides Wish support to help Grimer stick around for a bit longer. Lickitung can also check specially offensive Pokemon, mainly Psychic- and Ghost-types through its bulk and typing. In turn, Grimer can switch in on Fighting-type attacks aimed at Lickitung. Grimer appreciates Dark- and Flying-types such as Pawniard and Vullaby to switch in on Psychic- and Ground-type attacks, respectively. Finally, because Grimer often has a tough time taking on Ghost- and Psychic-types, Pursuit support from Pokemon such as Pawniard is appreciated.


Other Options
########

Grimer has a decent physical movepool that includes access to all of the elemental punches, though Fire Punch is generally the best choice. Ice Punch can be useful in hitting Archen and Ground-types harder, but Grimer has no business staying in on them anyway. Grimer can also employ Infestation to trap opponents and give another teammate an easy switch in. Finally, a mono-attack set with Rest, Sleep Talk, Curse, and Poison Jab can be used, but it is too easily walled by Steel-types. Memento can be used to cripple an opponent and help a sweeper such as Pawniard set up. Finally, Toxic can be used to wear down walls more quickly.

Checks and Counters
########
**Ground-types**: Ground-types such as Drilbur and Hippopotas resist Gunk Shot and can hit back with a super effective STAB Earthquake.

**Rock-types**: Rock-types such as Tirtouga, Archen, Omanyte, and Onix resist Gunk Shot, have good defenses, and can attack back with their STAB moves or a Ground-type coverage move.

**Faster Psychic-types**: Faster Psychic-types, especially Abra, can KO Grimer with their powerful STAB moves. Gothita is unique in that it can trap Grimer thanks to Shadow Tag and KO with a STAB move.

**Bulky Pokemon**: Bulky Pokemon such as Vullaby, Slowpoke, Shellos, and RestTalk Chinchou can take Grimer's attacks and heal off the damage taken.
