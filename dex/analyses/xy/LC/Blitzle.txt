Overview
########

Blitzle is a fast Pokemon in LC, reaching 18 Speed when fully invested. Blitzle's ability Motor Drive can boost its Speed while granting it an immunity to Electric. Its other two abilities, Lightning Rod and Sap Sipper, also grant Blitzle immunities, making Blitzle a nice support Pokemon for teams that have problems with Grass- or Electric-types. Blitzle also boasts nice Attack and Special Attack stats alongside a diverse movepool, allowing it to have an offensive presence, albeit an only adequate one. However, Blitzle's frailty and only slightly above-average damage output leave it outclassed by most other Electric-types.

Moves
========
Wild Charge is Blitzle's best STAB move and has nice Base Power; its only downside is that it whittles Blitzle down very quickly due to both its recoil and Life Orb's. Volt Switch is a STAB move that helps keep up offensive momentum. Flame Charge is a coverage move, albeit a weak one, that boosts Blitzle's Speed by one stage. However, Flame Charge typically does abysmal damage to Eviolite-holders, so its primary purpose is to weaken or finish off Pokemon that are not holding an Eviolite. The final moveslot is dedicated to a Normal-type move, with each serving a very different purpose from the other. Double-Edge is a hard-hitting move that can be very taxing on Blitzle due to its recoil, whereas Quick Attack is a moderately weak priority attack that is used primarily to finish off weakened foes. Both of these moves are situational and easily interchangeable, as they will typically not be favored over another move.

Set Details
========

196 EVs maximize Blitzle's Attack, increasing its potency as a physical attacker. 228 Speed EVs and a Naive nature put Blitzle at 18 Speed, the maximum it can reach, without hindering either offensive stat. The remaining EVs are split between Blitzle's defenses and Special Attack, increasing each by one point. 0 HP IVs minimize the recoil Blitzle takes from Life Orb, increasing Blitzle's longevity. Life Orb boosts the power of all of Blitzle's attacks without locking it into a move. Sap Sipper is the ability of choice, as it makes Blitzle immune to Grass, an otherwise neutral type, while boosting Blitzle's Attack if it is hit by a Grass-type move. Alternatively, Motor Drive can be used to prevent foes from freely spamming Volt Switch at the expense of forcing Blitzle to have to face opposing Electric-types one-on-one.

Usage Tips
========

Be certain to use Blitzle conservatively, as it is easily whittled down. It should not be sent in against any strong Pokemon as it will be hit hard due to its subpar defenses. The best times to directly switch Blitzle in are when Blitzle has a safe switch from a teammate's pivoting move such as U-turn or Volt Switch, or when the opposing Pokemon is guaranteed to use an Electric- or Grass-type move so that Blitzle can gain the corresponding boost.

Team Options
========

As Blitzle has no method of increasing its damage output outside of Life Orb, it is best to have an entry hazards user. Dwebble and Ferroseed both work for this role, as they are competent Pokemon capable of laying down Spikes or Stealth Rock. Flying-types are great partners for Blitzle, as they can avoid Ground-type attacks that could devastate Blitzle, as well as deal with bulky Grass-types that do not take much from Flame Charge, such as Foongus and Pumpkaboo. In return, Blitzle can easily eat up or avoid any form of Electric-type attack directed at Flying-types. Fletchling is a powerful Flying-type physical attacker that greatly appreciates having Blitzle to eat up Electric-type attacks. A cleric that can effectively remove annoying status, especially burns, from Blitzle is also a teammate to consider, to keep it in decent enough shape so that it can do work. Such a Pokemon is Spritzee, which has respectable bulk and access to both Wish and Aromatherapy, allowing it to keep Blitzle healthy. As Blitzle is walled by most Ground-type Pokemon and Chinchou, having a Grass-type that can dispose of them, such as Pumpkaboo or Foonguss, is much appreciated by Blitzle. Finally, having a potent Knock Off user that can aid in wearing down opposing walls is greatly beneficial to Blitzle, which often cannot heavily damage Eviolite users. Archen and Corphish both appreciate and assist Blitzle, taking advantage of Blitzle's immunities while still fulfilling the role of Knocking Off foes' items.

Other Options
########

Blitzle suffers from a diverse movepool that lacks strong attacks, though it can play around by paralyzing foes via Thunder Wave, Pursuit trapping unsuspecting Psychic-types like Abra, and using Bounce to its advantage to make it a counter to Grass-types. However, Flame Charge outclasses Bounce, as Bounce is easily played around, whereas Flame Charge is able to hit immediately and raise Blitzle's Speed. A special set using Thunderbolt, Hidden Power, and Charge Beam can be used but is outclassed by Elekid even more so than a physical variant, as Blitzle lacks a wide enough movepool to harm most of the tier. It is also limited severely by the fact that it requires a Lightning Rod boost to put dents in most walls. An Agility set could skyrocket Blitzle's Speed, though it would lack the power that Blitzle loves having at its disposal; the Flame Charge boost is typically enough for Blitzle, rendering such a set nearly obsolete.

Checks & Counters
########

**Chinchou**: Chinchou resists most of the moves in Blitzle's repertoire and can dispose of the frail Blitzle relatively easily. Chinchou's access to Volt Absorb makes it even more pesky for Blitzle, which cannot touch it with STAB moves.

**Knock Off**: Blitzle is essentially rendered useless once it loses its Life Orb, as it is no longer able to hit hard enough to leave dents in the opposing team. Choice Scarf Pawniard can remove Blitzle's Life Orb, survive a Flame Charge due to the weakened damage output, and proceed to switch out.

**Ground-types**: Blitzle has basically no method of badly harming Ground-types, as they are immune to Electric and it cannot deal much damage to them with its other attacking moves. While Blitzle cannot harm Ground-types, they can easily retaliate with their STAB moves, heavily damaging Blitzle if not OHKOing it.

**Bulky Attackers**: Any Pokemon that can eat up one of Blitzle's attacks is, more often than not, able to retaliate hard, hitting Blitzle for massive amounts of damage. Drilbur is an example of this, as it is immune to Blitzle's STAB moves and not hit hard by the rest of its movepool; thus, Drilbur can easily eat up a hit and proceed to OHKO Blitzle with Earthquake.

**Revenge Killers**: Pokemon such as Focus Sash Abra and Choice Scarf Pawniard can easily come in after Blitzle has taken a hit or two and proceed to finish it off with great ease; Abra can survive any hit from Blitzle and finish it off with its powerful moves, while Pawniard utilizes its tremendous Attack and Choice Scarf to obliterate unboosted Blitzle. The same applies to any Choice Scarf user capable of dealing good damage.
