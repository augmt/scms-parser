Overview
########

Skiddo is the only Pokemon in Little Cup with access to both Milk Drink and Horn Leech. Its decent bulk and offensive stats allow it to run a Bulk Up set rather effectively. Although Chespin can also run Bulk Up, Skiddo's access to Horn Leech, higher Special Defense, and Milk Drink allow it to perform better as a Grass-type Bulk Up user. However, Skiddo has difficulty dealing with many top-tier threats, especially Fletchling, without any Bulk Up boosts, and its pure Grass typing leaves it with few resistances and some common weaknesses. Even though it has a small movepool and a mediocre Speed stat, Skiddo can still power through teams once it gains enough boosts.

Bulk Up
########
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Horn Leech
move 3: Rock Slide / Return
move 4: Brick Break / Bulldoze / Milk Drink
ability: Sap Sipper
item: Eviolite
evs: 76 Atk / 52 Def / 140 SpD / 180 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Bulk Up is used to boost Skiddo's Attack and Defense. Horn Leech is Skiddo's main STAB move and provides Skiddo with reliable recovery. Rock Slide allows Skiddo to hit Flying-types for super effective damage, and Return is a great move for neutral coverage. Brick Break hits Steel-types, notably Pawniard, which can otherwise take any of Skiddo's other moves, super effectively. Bulldoze is a unique coverage move, hitting Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-types; however, be wary of Pawniard, which can gain an Attack boost via Defiant after its Speed is dropped by Bulldoze. Milk Drink is a great recovery move that can be used if Horn Leech doesn't suffice; it also allows Skiddo to recover health when Horn Leech would be ineffective.

Set Details
========

180 Speed EVs allow Skiddo to reach 14 Speed, allowing Skiddo to outspeed the standard bulky Larvesta and OHKO it with a +1 Rock Slide. The Defense EVs hit an Eviolite number, and the Special Defense EVs allow SKiddo to avoid the 2HKO from physically defensive Chinchou's Ice Beam. The remaining EVs are put into Attack to boost Skiddo's damage output. A spread of 236 Atk / 52 Def / 220 SpD could be used to boost more easily, especially in tandem with Milk Drink.

Usage Tips
========

It's usually best to save Skiddo until Pokemon that resist Grass-type moves have been removed or weakened, as it can then recover health with Horn Leech. Skiddo can also set up on opposing walls, such as Spritzee, and can quickly heal off Moonblast damage with Horn Leech or Milk Drink. Skiddo can check physically defensive Chinchou, but an invested Ice Beam can 2HKO Skiddo, so switching in can be challenging. Also, Skiddo doesn't appreciate being burned.

Team Options
========

Chinchou can beat many of the Flying- and Fire-types that threaten Skiddo, and in return, Skiddo can take Grass- and Ground-type moves for Chinchou. Flying- and Fire-types can deal with Bug- and Grass-types that trouble Skiddo, and they appreciate Skiddo's ability to force out Chinchou. Ground-types such as Drilbur can deal with Poison-types such as Trubbish, which can otherwise set up on Skiddo, and appreciate Skiddo's capability to deal with Water-types. Although it is weak to Fire-type moves, Magnemite can handle Flying-types with ease and is immune to Poison-type attacks. Tentacool shares great synergy with Skiddo, as it can take Fire-, Bug-, and Poison-type attacks, while Skiddo can take the Ground-type attacks aimed at Tentacool. Rock-types also pair well with Skiddo, as they can handle Flying-types such as Fletchling, which can otherwise hit Skiddo with a super effective STAB move or proceed to boost.

Other Options
########

Payback can be used to hit Ghost-types; however, the two major Ghost-types, Drifloon and Gastly, have little trouble dealing with Skiddo, as they both can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp; furthermore, Gastly can hit it with a super effective STAB Sludge Bomb and Drifloon can hit it with a super effective STAB Acrobatics. Leaf Blade is more powerful than Horn Leech and can be used if one is running Milk Drink. Wild Charge allows Skiddo to hit Flying-types, but it overlaps coverage with Skiddo's Grass-type STAB attacks. A special set is feasible, but Skiddo lacks a good special movepool, only having access to Grass-, Normal-, and Water-type special attacks. A fully offensive set can also be utilized; however, Skiddo lacks the Speed and Attack stats to effectively pressure the opponent.

Checks &amp; Counters
########

**Flying-types**: Doduo and Fletchling can outspeed and deal massive damage to Skiddo with Brave Bird and Acrobatics, respectively.

**Bug-types**: Dwebble and Larvesta can beat Skiddo with their Bug-type STAB attacks and, in Larvesta's case, Fire-type STAB attacks; however, neither enjoy being hit by a Rock Slide on the switch, especially Larvesta, which is easily KOed.

**Fire-types**: Ponyta and Growlithe can easily switch into Skiddo's Grass-type attacks, but they must be wary of Rock Slide and Bulldoze.

**Poison-types**: Foongus resists Skiddo's STAB attacks, is hit neutrally by all of its coverage moves, and can easily deal with it. Trubbish and Koffing do not fear Horn Leech or Rock Slide; however, Trubbish doesn't enjoy taking a boosted Bulldoze.

**Grass-types**: Skiddo has trouble dealing with Grass-types, as it has to rely on weaker coverage moves to hit them. Phantump and Pumpkaboo can prove to be very troublesome, as they can burn Skiddo, crippling and effectively walling it. Cottonee can easily switch into Skiddo and Encore Bulk Up, rendering Skiddo rather useless.

**Steel-types**: Ferroseed fears nothing from Skiddo. Even a super effective Brick Break does little damage to it, and it can cripple Skiddo with Thunder Wave or just set up hazards on it.

**Bulk Up Users**: Bulk Up Skiddo loses to opposing Bulk Up sweepers, such as Timburr, which are able to outlast and out-damage Skiddo.
