Overview
########

Bulbasaur returns for another round of LC as one of the strongest sun sweepers in the metagame alongside Bellsprout and Oddish. However, it stands out from these two, as it is the fastest Chlorophyll sweeper in LC and has more bulk than Bellsprout. It also has access to Growth, giving it an edge over Oddish. However, despite being bulkier than other Chlorophyll sweepers, its bulk is still relatively low, making it difficult to switch it in. Generation VI brought with it changes in weather, leaving Bulbasaur a drastically limited amount of time in which it can sweep. However, it still has the bulk and power to pull off incredible feats and tear through enemy teams.


Life Orb Sun Sweeper
########
name: Life Orb Sun Sweeper
move 1: Sludge Bomb
move 2: Solar Beam / Giga Drain
move 3: Sleep Powder
move 4: Hidden Power Fire
ability: Chlorophyll
item: Life Orb
evs: 240 SpA / 240 Spe
ivs: 0 HP
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Sludge Bomb is a powerful STAB move with a 30% chance to poison the enemy, which helps to get through Fairy- and Grass-type Pokemon. Solar Beam is an incredible STAB move, as it takes only one turn to charge in the sun and hits Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types super effectively. Giga Drain can be used over Solar Beam, as it doesn't rely on the sun to charge up. A sun-boosted Hidden Power Fire helps Bulbasaur get around Steel-types that would otherwise wall it, as well as just providing it with all-around coverage. Even after all this, there still are Pokemon that Bulbasaur has a hard time tearing through. Sleep Powder allows Bulbasaur to cripple these Pokemon, so that it can have a couple turns to defeat them.

Set Details
========

Maximizing Speed and Special Attack EVs allows Bulbasaur to be as big a threat as possible. The IV changes account for Hidden Power Fire and minimize recoil damage dealt by Life Orb. A Life Orb helps Bulbasaur deal significantly more damage. With a Modest nature, Bulbasaur Speed ties with Timid Bellsprout. However, Bulbasaur does end up being more powerful than Bellsprout.

Usage Tips
========

Bulbasaur is fairly simple to use. Switch into Vulpix to set up the sun, then wait for the optimal opportunity for Bulbasaur to come in. Bulbasaur's decent special bulk allows it to switch in on special attacks better than physical attacks, so take that into account when preparing to switch. Water-type moves are the best to switch into, because in the sun they deal little damage to Bulbasaur. Once in battle, use Bulbasaur's strongest moves against the Pokemon that it's matched against. If you know that can't OHKO the opponent or that Bulbasaur can't survive one of that Pokemon's attacks, cripple it with Sleep Powder.

Team Options
========

Vulpix is an obvious choice for a partner, as Drought lets it automatically set up sun upon switching in. If Vulpix has a Heat Rock, that's even better, as it means that the sun will last longer and Bulbasaur will benefit more from Chlorophyll. Bulbasaur pairs well with other Chlorophyll sweepers, as they also benefit from the sun and can break through walls, allowing Bulbasaur to clean up late-game. Flying-types, especially Fletchling, are a huge threat to Bulbasaur, so Pokemon like Chinchou and Archen are extremely useful. Bulbasaur has trouble safely switching in, so Pokemon that can provide a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Chinchou, are extremely useful.

Eviolite Growth
########
name: Eviolite Growth
move 1: Growth
move 2: Sleep Powder
move 3: Giga Drain
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Sludge Bomb
ability: Chlorophyll
item: Eviolite
evs: 240 SpA / 240 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Growth boosts Bulbasaur's Special Attack two stages, bringing it up to 32 Special Attack, making Bulbasaur an extremely dangerous sweeper in the sun. Sleep Powder gives Bulbasaur a chance to use Growth as well as provide a means to get through bulkier Pokemon. Giga Drain allows Bulbasaur to continue to be a threat out of the sun, as Growth will still have left it with +2 Special Attack. Hidden Power Fire helps Bulbasaur get past Steel- and Grass-types, while Sludge Bomb hits Grass-types harder but is walled by Steel Pokemon.

Set Details
========

This EV spread maximizes Speed and Special Attack while taking into account the IVs lost because of Hidden Power Fire. A Timid nature hits 15 Speed, allowing Bulbasaur to outspeed or Speed tie with all Choice Scarf threats when in the sun. This nature also allows it to outspeed opposing sun sweepers, such as Bellsprout. Eviolite gives Bulbasaur more opportunities to switch in and set up Growth and can allow the sweep to continue outside the sun.

Usage Tips
========

Because of Eviolite, Bulbasaur doesn't have as much of a problem switching in with this set. However, it's still beneficial to try to switch into a neutral or resisted hit so as to take as little damage as possible. Sleep Powder should be saved for a Pokemon that Bulbasaur can't easily take down. Once the opposing Pokemon is asleep, use Growth as the enemy either switches that Pokemon out or wastes the turn staying in. From there, Bulbasaur should attempt to punch as many holes in the enemy team as it can. Because only one Pokemon can be asleep at a time, avoid putting Pokemon to sleep that could have been OHKOed instead. Try to remove opposing Fire-type Pokemon before setting up sun. Fire-types tend to be able to wall Chlorophyll sweepers.

Team Options
========

Vulpix is the best choice for a teammate, as it automatically starts sun upon switching in. Heat Rock on Vulpix is nice, as it gives Bulbasaur more time to set up and sweep. This set has trouble with Fire-types such as Ponyta and Vulpix, so Pokemon that counter them are appreciated. Archen or Diglett are both useful for this function. Stealth Rock also minimizes the effect that they have on Bulbasaur's sweep. Archen is especially useful, as it also takes care of Fletchling and other Flying-type Pokemon. Chinchou can stop Fire-types and Flying-types well.

Other Options
########

A defensive set with Synthesis, Leech Seed, Sleep Powder, and a STAB move, like Sludge Bomb or Giga Drain, would be threatening, but it is easily walled by Grass- or Steel-types. A Choice Scarf set can be used out of the sun, but it lacks power and is inferior to most other Pokemon that commonly run Choice Scarf.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Vulpix is a solid good counter to Bulbasaur, taking little damage from Solar Beam or Hidden Power Fire. Even Sludge Bomb deals little damage. However, Sleep Powder can provide Bulbasaur with an opportunity to whittle Vulpix's health down. Other Fire-types, such as Larvesta, Ponyta, and Growlithe, are also good walls to Bulbasaur, especially when one of their allies has been put to sleep.

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Specially defensive Vullaby with Overcoat takes little damage from any attacks and can't be put to sleep. It can also hit hard with Brave Bird. RestTalk Munchlax is barely affected Bulbasaur's attacks as well as Sleep Powder. Koffing can take any hit from Bulbasaur after Sleep Powder has been used and can OHKO with Fire Blast.

**Opposing Weather**: Snover can switch in on Sleep Powder, removing the sun and replacing it with hail. If it has a Choice Scarf, it can also deal a good amount of damage back to Bulbasaur. Hippopotas only fears being hit by Giga Drain, but also changes the weather to sandstorm, stopping Bulbasaur's sun sweep.

**Fletchling**: With a priority Acrobatics, Fletchling can easily revenge kill any Chlorophyll sweeper set that Bulbasaur might run.
