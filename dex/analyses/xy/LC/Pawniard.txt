Overview
########

Pawniard is the most powerful Knock Off user in Little Cup. Because of Pawniard's ability to remove an item with an extremely powerful move, it is very hard to switch into. Furthermore, the prevalence of Berry Juice means that Knock Off's damage is not diminished by Eviolite's defense boosts most of the time. Pawniard has access to Swords Dance and Sucker Punch, often sweeping teams with the right support. However, Pawniard is easily forced out by all Fighting-types and often Ground-types as well, although they are not as common. Pawniard is often setup bait for Fighting-types such as Scraggy and Timburr, as they can freely set up a Dragon Dance and a Bulk Up, respectively. Vulpix is also a problem, as sun teams can OHKO Pawniard with sun-boosted Fire-type moves.

Standard
#######
name: Standard
move 1: Sucker Punch
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Iron Head
move 4: Swords Dance / Stealth Rock / Brick Break
ability: Defiant
item: Eviolite / Life Orb
evs: 156 Atk / 36 Def / 116 SpD / 196 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Sucker Punch gives Pawniard a way to beat faster threats after a Swords Dance, but only if they attack it. STAB Knock Off hits really hard with the 50% damage boost from the target having an item. Iron Head is for Fairies and provides a secondary STAB move for when Sucker Punch and Knock Off aren't good choices. Swords Dance is excellent for setting up on Pokemon such as non-Overheat Fletchling that can't touch Pawniard. Stealth Rock can be used in the first slot as Pawniard makes an excellent pivot, often setting up Stealth Rock multiple times throughout a match. Brick Break defeats opposing Pawniard, which is good because it's one of its own best checks.

Set Details
========

Pawniard's Attack stat is high enough that the extra points gained by maximizing Attack EVs aren't worth it, so additional EVs are put into Pawniard's defenses to reach optimal Eviolite numbers. Max Speed allows Pawniard to hit 16 Speed, outspeeding bulky versions of Mienfoo so that you can 2HKO them late-game. Berry Juice can be used over Eviolite to provide a better sweep, but this sacrifices Pawniard's ability to take hits such as Fletchling's Overheat. Life Orb provides huge power after a Swords Dance but makes Pawniard extremely frail.

Usage Tips
========

Pawniard's Knock Off is incredibly hard to switch into, so use it freely when it is safe to do so. If the opponent tries to switch Sticky Hold users into Pawniard, take advantage of the fact that Knock Off's 50% damage boost always applies against them. Defiant gives Pawniard an edge against Sticky Web teams, Intimidate users, and Defoggers. A good prediction can net you a +2 Pawniard, so pay attention to your opponent's team members and try to take advantage. Pawniard can often set up on Pokemon such as Fletchling, as Pawniard does not take a lot of damage from Acrobatics and survives an Overheat with the given EV spread. Dwebble is another option to set up on, as most Dwebble fail to do anything significant to Pawniard unless they carry Earthquake. If Pawniard carries Stealth Rock, it should be used as a pivot and should look for a safe opportunity to set up entry hazards against things like Fletchling, Dwebble, and stall-based teams.

Team Options
========

Sweepers such as Scraggy and Bunnelby appreciate Pawniard's Knock Off support. Pokemon that can switch into Fighting-type attacks make great teammates, so Spritzee or Cottonee can often be paired with Pawniard. Cottonee also offers Memento support, allowing Pawniard to almost always set up. Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Scraggy, and Timburr like Pawniard's ability to KO Fairy-, Ghost-, and Psychic-types so they can safely attack without fear of losing momentum. Surskit is a great partner, as Pawniard deters Defog users and can take advantage of the opponent's Speed drop from Sticky Web.

Choice Scarf
#######
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Knock Off
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Brick Break
move 4: Pursuit / Sucker Punch
ability: Defiant
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpD / 196 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
=====

Knock Off is the STAB move of choice and hits really hard with the 50% damage boost to a target with an item. Knock Off works really well when paired with a Choice Scarf, as Pawniard can weaken a teammate's check or counter in a pinch. Iron Head hits Fairy-, Fighting-, and Rock-types harder than Knock Off, although Knock Off should be used on Pokemon such as Onix and Geodude as they often run Sturdy + Berry Juice. Brick Break is specifically for opposing Pawniard, but it does its job well. Pawniard is extremely common and is a great answer to itself, as it resists both Dark- and Steel-type moves, so the coverage of Brick Break is important. Pursuit can trap weakened Pokemon that would normally switch out, such as Ghost-types. Sucker Punch can be used as well, but it is often redundant with the extra Speed from Choice Scarf. It is also not good to be locked into a move that baits in setup sweepers.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed investment along with a Jolly nature grants maximum damage and allows Pawniard to hit 24 Speed, outspeeding threats such as +2 Tirtouga. The remaining EVs increase Pawniard's defenses by one point. Adamant is not an option, as Pawniard needs the ability to outspeed +2 Tirtouga.

Usage Tips
========

Knock Off is a dangerous move for anything to switch into, so spamming that is usually the best option. If a Fighting- or Fairy-type is an obvious switch-in, Iron Head can be used; however, Knock Off is usually better in the long run as nothing enjoys losing its item. Pursuit and Sucker Punch should be played cautiously and only used if you have a sure check to setup sweepers, as both moves lure in these sweepers and can cost you a match if you misplay. Pawniard can check many Pokemon, most notably Tirtouga and itself.

Team Options
========

Pawniard is fairly self-sufficient and needs very little support. Pawniard will mostly be supporting its teammates with its ability to remove items. Sweepers such as Scraggy love Pawniard, as it's much easier to sweep once foes have lost their Eviolite or Berry Juice. Fighting-types love Pawniard's ability to KO Fairy-, Ghost-, and Psychic-types so they can spam Fighting-type moves. Sun teams enjoy its ability to eliminate Snover.

Other Options
########

Psycho Cut can be used to hit Fighting-types hard and has a high critical hit chance that can come in handy. Thunder Wave can be used to spread paralysis, as Pawniard often forces switches and can chase out paralysis-immune Pokemon like Magnemite and Chinchou. Magnet Rise can be used to become invulnerable to Drilbur and other Ground-types, but it is hard to set up, and even after a Magnet Rise, Fighting-types still counter Pawniard.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Most Fighting-types, such as Mienfoo and Scraggy, can pivot in and out of Pawniard's attacks. Mienfoo threatens it with a Drain Punch or a U-turn, and Scraggy can often set up a Dragon Dance on Pawniard, especially if Pawniard is locked into Knock Off.

**Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta can burn Pawniard with their ability Flame Body. They do not take much damage from Iron Head and can often OHKO back with their Fire-type STAB attacks.

**Sticky Hold Users**: Pokemon such as Grimer and Trubbish can repeatedly switch into Pawniard and threaten it with a Fire Punch and a Drain Punch, respectively. Trubbish can also set up entry hazards and spam Recycle.

**Entry Hazards**: Entry hazards harm Pawniard's late-game potential, as it is grounded and affected by Spikes. This makes entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed and Trubbish excellent counters to Pawniard.
