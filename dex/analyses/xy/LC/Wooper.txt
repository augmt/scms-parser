Overview
########

At first, Wooper doesn't appear to be much but a cute little Pokemon, but don't let this fool you! Unaware makes Wooper a reliable counter to Tirtouga and other setup sweepers, ignoring all of their boosts. Wooper is also blessed with access to Recover, an amazing move for any defensive Pokemon, and STAB Scald, which further enhances its physical bulk if it can get a burn. Wooper only has one weakness to Grass and it also has a very useful resistance to Fire. Unfortunately, Wooper lacks any offensive presence, making it very susceptible to Taunt. Wooper's also very slow, meaning that it will be taking a hit before it can move; its reliance on Eviolite to take hits makes it highly susceptible to Knock Off as well, which doesn't gel well with its poor Speed. Although Wooper has some flaws, it has many useful qualities and can be an excellent choice for your team.

Unaware
########
name: Unaware
move 1: Recover
move 2: Scald
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Yawn / Toxic
ability: Unaware
item: Eviolite
evs: 236 HP / 156 Def / 76 SpD
nature: Relaxed

Moves
========

Recover is essential to keep Wooper healthy throughout the match and aid it in stalling. Scald scares away physical attackers that fear a burn, while also hitting most of the Pokemon that resist Ground-type moves. Earthquake is Wooper's main source of damage, being a reliable STAB move with high Base Power. Yawn can force switches or cripple any Pokemon that decides to stay in. Alternatively, Toxic is great to stall the opposing Pokemon and wear them down quickly. Encore is another option to lock the opposition into an unfavorable move.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Wooper's Defense and HP, while making its Special Defense hit an Eviolite number. Eviolite is the item used instead of Berry Juice as Wooper greatly appreciates the extra bulk Eviolite provides, and it has access to reliable recovery anyway.

Usage Tips
========

Wooper is best used to counter Tirtouga, Fletchling, and other setup sweepers, as it can ignore their boosts. It's best to bring Wooper in on these Pokemon if you fear they are going to sweep your team. Try to avoid Knock Off at all costs; any Pokemon that can carry it should be removed. Timburr takes advantage of Scald's burn chance thanks to Guts, so keep Wooper out of its way.

Team Options
========

Ponyta, Growlithe, and other Fire-types make great partners as they can beat opposing Grass-type Pokemon. Grass-type Pokemon can handle opposing Grass-types as well; these include Foongus and Bulbasaur. Spritzee packs Aromatherapy, so it can cure Wooper of status. Defog users are very helpful to remove Spikes from the field. A good example is Vullaby, as it resists Grass-types for Wooper, while in return Wooper can take on Electric-type Pokemon. Finally, Dwebble is a great partner to set up entry hazards and force the opponents to rack up damage from the switches Yawn forces.

Other Options
########

Haze is an option to remove stat boosts, and thanks to Unaware, Wooper is unaffected by said stat boosts. Ice Punch is a solid coverage option to hit Grass-types, but it doesn't hit very hard, and Wooper is hard-pressed to find a moveslot for it. Curse is an option to boost Wooper's Attack and Defense, but it is outclassed by other setup sweepers in this regard. Water Absorb is usable over Unaware for a Water-type immunity, but Unaware is Wooper's main niche. Waterfall is an option over Scald, but the burn chance from Scald is too good to give up. Counter can be used, but it requires a massive amount of prediction, and Wooper often has better things to be doing. Infestation is a usable move to trap foes and cause a lot of chip damage in conjunction with Toxic. Finally, Stockpile boosts Wooper's Defense and Special Defense simultaneously, which can make it tougher to take down.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Grass-types resist Wooper's STAB attacks and can outright OHKO or force it out with their STAB moves. Ferroseed in particular does not mind any of Wooper's attacks thanks to its bulk and immunity to Toxic, but it does fear Scald's burn chance. Bullet Seed is a clean OHKO on Wooper, even with only two hits.

**Special Attackers**: Strong special attackers like Abra can take advantage of Wooper's low Special Defense and deal heavy damage to it.

**Chip Damage**: Toxic, burn, and entry hazards all wear down Wooper especially fast, even with its access to Recover.

**Taunt**: Wooper relies on chip damage of its own to deal damage, and Taunt prevents it from doing so, limiting it to just its weak attacking moves.

**Knock Off**: Knock Off removes Wooper's Eviolite, and most Knock Off users can proceed to beat Wooper after its Eviolite has been removed.
