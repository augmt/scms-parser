Overview
########

Minccino's access to both Tail Slap and Skill Link makes it a very capable sweeper. The Knock Off buff gave Minccino a reliable way to hit Ghost-types and with Misdreavus's ban, 18 Speed is a comfortable speed tier. These factors allow Minccino to be a prominent late-game threat, applying pressure to the opponent, all while being able to pivot out with a well-timed U-turn. Unfortunately, Minccino only has one move that utilizes Skill Link, Tail Slap, and is rather frail, making it weak to priority attacks. Its Normal-typing also leaves it weak to the common Fighting-type moves that run rampant in Little Cup. Aipom usually outshines Minccino due to its superior bulk, Speed, and movepool, but it does lack Tail Slap which has a higher accuracy then Aipom's Skill Link moves. However, its positives do outshine the negatives and Minccino can be a brutal sweeper with proper team support.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Tail Slap
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Wake-Up Slap / Seed Bomb
ability: Skill Link
item: Life Orb
evs: 196 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpD / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Tail Slap is Minccino's main STAB attack, smashing most of the metagame for good damage in tandem with Skill Link. Knock Off is an excellent coverage move, hitting Ghost-types which would otherwise wall Minccino. U-turn allows Minccino to escape unfavorable matchups and still deal decent damage. Wake-Up Slap provides Minccino with a means to hit Steel-types, such as Pawniard, that would otherwise survive a Tail Slap or Knock Off. Seed Bomb can be chosen instead to hit Omanyte and Tirtouga, which otherwise survive a Wake-Up Slap and proceed to Shell Smash.

Set Details
========

Life Orb boosts the damage Minccino deals and causes Tail Slap to become quite powerful thanks to Little Cup's unique damage rolls. The EVs maximize Attack and Speed, with the remainder invested in Defense and Special Defense to slightly increase Minccino's bulk. Jolly is the preferred nature, as it allows Minccino to outspeed Jolly Mienfoo, Drilbur, and Archen and also Speed tie with Pokemon such as Gastly, Stunky, and Doduo.

Usage Tips
========

Minccino is rather frail, so switching into a strong attack will severely hamper its longevity; however, if Minccino can switch in safely, it can be a dangerous threat. Knock Off can be a nice way to soften up strong physical walls and remove their item, and can punish an opponent attempting to switch their Ghost-type into a predicted Tail Slap. U-turn is to switch out of unfavorable match-ups as well as pivot out of a predicted switch-in. Wake-Up Slap is to hit Steel-types, most notably Pawniard, and Seed Bomb is to neuter mainly Omanyte and Tirtouga, along with uncommon Rock / Ground-types.

Team Options
========

Because this set functions primarily as a wallbreaker and secondary sweeper, set up sweepers, such as Scraggy and Tirtouga, make good teammates as they appreciate the removal of bulkier opponents. Larvesta and Spritzee are also good partners with their resistances to Fighting-type attacks. Entry hazard support, particularly Stealth Rock, is helpful for netting KOs; as such, Dwebble and Drilbur make good teammates, the latter being able to Rapid Spin hazards your opponent might have set. Sticky Web can be useful to outspeed some Choice Scarf Pokemon and 19 Speed Pokemon, but its usually not necessary. Bulky pivots are helpful, as they can take strong priority attacks that would otherwise harm Minccino.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Tail Slap
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Wake-Up Slap
ability: Skill Link
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 196 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpD / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Tail Slap is the STAB attack of choice due to its fantastic combination with Skill Link and the unique damage rolls of Little Cup. Knock Off hits Ghost-type Pokemon, and U-turn is Minccino's escape route from unfavorable match-ups, as well as a scouting tool. Wake-Up Slap hits Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon, most notably Pawniard, and Seed Bomb is to hit Omanyte and Tirtouga.

Set Details
========

The EVs allow Minccino to capitalize on its good Speed and Attack stats and outpace a large portion of the tier. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Minccino's maxed out 17 Speed skyrockets up to an impressive 25, outspeeding every unboosted Pokemon in the tier, as well as more than a few Choice Scarf Pokemon. Jolly is useful for outspeeding +2 Modest Omanyte, Modest Bellsprout under the sun, and a couple of other Shell Smashers; however, Adamant can be used for a larger damage output.

Usage Tips
========

This moveset functions well as both a late-game cleaner and a revenge killer. Knock Off and U-turn are the most useful early-game moves, weakening opponents and making it easier for both Minccino and its teammates to clean up later in the match. Removing opposing Normal-type immunities and resists should be a top priority, so predicting and KOing incoming Ghost-, Steel-, and Rock-type switch-ins is incredibly helpful.

Team Options
========

Teammates that can remove Steel-, Rock-, and Ghost-type Pokemon are essential. Drilbur makes a fantastic teammate with its access to Stealth Rock, Rapid Spin, and Mold Breaker Earthquake, the latter being able to hit Gastly as well as Steel- and Rock-types for super effective damage. Mienfoo can switch into both Rock- and Steel-types and forms a nice U-turn core with Minccino. Stunky and Pawniard both make decent teammates with their ability to trap and KO opposing Ghost-types with Pursuit. Magnemite is also a useful teammate, as it can trap and defeat opposing Steel-types with Hidden Power Fire, Fighting, or Ground, depending on what Pokemon threaten your team the most.

Other Options
########

Substitute is a decent option, as it does allow Minccino to avoid Sucker Punch, but Minccino's coverage moves are usually much more beneficial. Minccino can take advantage of its colorful support movepool, with options like Thunder Wave and Tickle, but lacks the bulk to reliably harass the opponent throughout the game. King's Rock is a rather annoying possibility, but is generally inferior to Life Orb due to its inconsistency. Protect can be used to block Fake Out and scout opposing movesets, but Minccino's inability to give up a moveslot generally doesn't allow for this. Aqua Tail has a higher Base Power than Wake-Up Slap, but doesn't hit Steel-type Pokemon and otherwise provides redundant coverage. Encore can be a great way to stunt set up sweepers and provide a free turn for Minccino to deal some damage and cripple opposing Pokemon with Knock Off. Eviolite gives Minccino some bulk but sacrifices the Attack and Speed boosts of Life Orb and Choice Scarf, respectively.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Steel-types make good counters to Minccino, but usually don't enjoy getting hit by Wake-Up Slap. Ferroseed in particular is an excellent means of dealing with Minccino, as it rips off a large portion of Minccino's health simply by switching into Tail Slap, due to Iron Barbs

**Priority Users**: Priority users, such as Panwiard, Timburr, and Croagunk, can override Minccino's Speed and maim it with with their priority moves.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Choice Scarf Pokemon and Pokemon that reach 19 Speed, such as Ponyta, can outspeed Minccino and capitalize on its frailty.

**Rock-types**: Rock-types, such as Dwebble, Tyrunt, and Tirtouga, can switch in and set up on Minccino, but must be wary of Knock Off, Wake-Up Slap, and Seed Bomb, respectively.

**Fast Ghost-types**: Fast Ghost-types such as Gastly can switch in on Tail Slap and set up a Substitute or hit Minccino with a Sludge Bomb, but must take care to avoid Knock Off.

**Fighting-types**: Common Fighting-type Pokemon can live a Tail Slap and hit Minccino with a super effective STAB move.
