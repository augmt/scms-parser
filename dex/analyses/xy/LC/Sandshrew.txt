Overview
########

Sandshrew has good physical bulk and Attack, along with access to Rapid Spin and Knock Off, both of which are fantastic support moves. However, besides its superior Defense stat and access to Knock Off, Sandshrew is mostly outclassed by Drilbur, which has mostly superior stats and a better ability in Mold Breaker. Sandshrew is also easily worn down due to its lack of recovery and mediocre base 30 Special Defense. Also, due to the removal of permanent weather, Sandshrew loses its previous niche as a sand sweeper, limiting its capabilities to that of a defensive support Pokemon. Although Sandshrew is outclassed in quite a few areas, it is still a solid choice on any bulky balance team.

Rapid Spin
########
name: Rapid Spin
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Stealth Rock / Rock Slide
item: Eviolite
ability: Sand Rush
evs: 116 HP / 156 Atk / 156 Def / 36 SpD / 36 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Rapid Spin allows Sandshrew to aid its teammates by removing hazards. Earthquake is Sandshrew's STAB move of choice, hitting a lot of Pokemon quite hard. Knock Off is a great utility option, hitting Ghost-types that try to spinblock, notably Pumpkaboo, a Pokemon that Drilbur cannot heavily damage. It also removes opposing Eviolites, Choice Scarves, and Berry Juices, making walls and sweepers easier to deal with. Stealth Rock is a fantastic move; Sandshrew's more offensive teammates can benefit from foes being weakened by it. Rock Slide can be used over Stealth Rock if your team already has a hazard setter, allowing Sandshrew to hit Larvesta, Flying-types, and Ice-types.

Set Details
========

The EVs provide Sandshrew with lots of bulk, hitting 23 / 18 / 10 before Eviolite, with the remaining EVs being invested in Attack and Speed, hitting 16 Attack and 11 Speed, to let Sandshrew outspeed Pokemon such as Timburr and Pumpkaboo. Eviolite boosts Sandshrew's bulk and works well with the EVs, which make Sandshrew's Defense and Special Defense even numbers. Sandshrew's abilities rather contradict its role, but if the opponent uses a sand team, Sandshrew becomes blisteringly fast thanks to Sand Rush.

Usage Tips
========

Sandshrew's impressive Defense stat allows it to switch into a majority of non-super effective physical moves; take advantage of this, setting up Stealth Rock or removing hazards with Rapid Spin while the foe switches out. If Stealth Rock is used over Rock Slide, be wary of Fletchling, as it is immune to Earthquake and lacks an item, weakening Knock Off's power. Although Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin are great moves, they make Sandshrew rather predictable, as it'll either lead or switch in shortly after the opponent sets hazards; be sure to play smartly with Sandshrew, for example nailing the obvious Pumpkaboo switch-in with a Knock Off as opposed to simply using Rapid Spin.

Team Options
========

Sandshrew pairs well with Fire-, Flying-, and Bug-types, as it can remove Stealth Rock from the field. Spikes users, such as Trubbish and Ferroseed, can partner with Sandshrew to form an effective hazard-setting core. Ferroseed, in particular, can handle the Water- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Sandshrew. Pumpkaboo can spinblock, keeping Sandshrew's Stealth Rock on the field; it also resists Water- and Grass-types attacks aimed at Sandshrew. Pawniard deters Defog users, as its ability, Defiant, gives it a large Attack boost when hit by Defog. Clerics such as Spritzee and Lickitung can compensate for Sandshrew's lack of recovery, providing it with Wish and Heal Bell / Aromatherapy support. RestTalk Munchlax can handle Foongus and special Water-types, all while absorbing status, particularly burn, that Sandshrew doesn't appreciate.

Other Options
########

Due to Sandshrew's already-impressive bulk, Eviolite can be opted out for Berry Juice, providing Sandshrew with a form of recovery; however, Sandshrew's subsequent lack of special bulk is quite noticeable, and its ability to soak up hits is diminished quite a bit. RestTalk is Eviolite Sandshrew's only reliable method of recovery, but Sandshrew lacks the resistances to properly take advantage of such a set. A fully offensive Sand Rush set can be utilized in tandem with Hippopotas, allowing Sandshrew to utilize its good Attack stat and coverage moves to sweep an opposing team. Sand Veil is an option should Sandshrew's potential Speed boost with Sand Rush not be sufficient, letting Sandshrew occasionally dodge an incoming hit while sand is up. Rock Tomb can be used over Rock Slide, allowing Sandshrew to better follow up on certain switch-ins; however, Rock Tomb fails to OHKO Fletchling after Stealth Rock. Sandshrew can make good use of a Swords Dance set, OHKOing Pumpkaboo with Knock Off at +2. Poison Jab is a solid means of dealing with Fairy-types, notably Cottonee, and spreading poison around the opposing team. Sandshrew can utilize Counter thanks to its fantastic physical bulk, but the move usually ends up wasting a moveslot and is a gimmick more than anything else.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types such as Gastly and Pumpkaboo can switch into an Earthquake or Rapid Spin with ease; however, none of them want to take a Knock Off.

**Special Attackers**: Powerful special attackers such as Abra and Omanyte can easily KO Sandshrew with Energy Ball and Hydro Pump, respectively.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types resist Sandshrew's Earthquake; furthermore, as most Grass-types are special attackers, they can KO Sandshrew with Giga Drain or Energy Ball.

**Water-types**: Although most Water-types don't resist Sandshrew's Earthquake, many of them are specially-oriented and so are able to KO Sandshrew with Scald, Surf, or Hydro Pump.

**Burn**: Burn renders Sandshrew almost useless outside of being a utility Pokemon, halving its Attack stat; it also lacks recovery, so the chip damage from burn is quite threatening.

**Hazard Removers**: Defog and Rapid Spin users, such as Vullaby, Staryu, and Drilbur, can usually cause some trouble for Sandshrew, being able to remove its Stealth Rock with ease; Staryu in particular can be an issue for Sandshrew, as it is able to KO it in addition to removing hazards.
