Overview
########

Houndour's great offensive typing and power distinguish it as one of the most offensively threatening Pokemon in the metagame, boasting nearly unresisted STAB coverage and some of the best mixed attacking stats in the tier. Anything looking to outspeed it must watch out for STAB Sucker Punch, which is capable of taking down the likes of Fletchling. However, it is easily taken out because of its many weaknesses and extremely poor bulk, leaving it vulnerable to just about anything that can land a hit on it.

Mixed Attacker
########
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Destiny Bond / Pursuit
ability: Early Bird / Flash Fire
item: Life Orb
evs: 36 Atk / 196 SpA / 36 SpD / 236 Spe
ivs: 0 HP
nature: Hasty

Moves
========

Fire Blast is the strongest move on this set, capable of 2HKOing many defensive Pokemon, and the one it will be spamming most of the time once Houndour gets in safely. Dark Pulse is a more accurate secondary STAB with a nice flinch chance, getting near-perfect coverage alongside Fire Blast as well as super effective coverage on Ghost- and Psychic-types. Sucker Punch is Houndour's tool for taking out Pokemon that outspeed it or are using slower priority, such as Fletchling, although it is unreliable and can be taken advantage of. Destiny Bond can take out slower opponents, forcing a trade with one of Houndour's checks and possibly opening up a sweep for something else. Pursuit, on the other hand, ensures that the Ghost-types Houndour naturally checks don't get away for free. Substitute is a decent move that eases prediction, but is generally inferior to the listed moves.


Set Details
========

The EV spread maximizes Special Attack and Speed with one point invested into Attack and Special Defense each. A Hasty nature lets Houndour hit 17 Speed, an important benchmark, while lowering Houndour's already pathetic Defense stat. 0 HP IVs are used to minimize recoil from Life Orb. The choice between Early Bird and Flash Fire is personal preference. Early Bird lets Houndour get around Trace Porygon and absorb sleep, mainly Foongus's Spore. Flash Fire gives Houndour an immunity to Fire-type moves, including Will-O-Wisp, and can power up Fire Blast when switching into them, but Houndour will have trouble switching into most users of these moves anyway. Life Orb is by far the best item for this set in order to hit as hard as possible while being able to switch moves.

Usage Tips
========

In general, Houndour shouldn't be switched in on predicted attacking moves it isn't immune to, as it takes a lot of damage even from resisted attacks. Bringing Houndour in after a teammate is KOed or after a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is the best way to get it in safely. Prediction is key when using Houndour, as letting a check such as Timburr in for free on Sucker Punch can be disastrous, while not using Sucker Punch against a faster opponent will usually lead to Houndour's end.

Team Options
========

Houndour appreciates teammates that can deal with Fighting-types. Trubbish and Croagunk do this well. As it is weak to Stealth Rock, entry hazard removal is a good idea when using Houndour; Drilbur, Vullaby, and Archen are all viable choices for this role. Sticky Web, while not being a particularly effective strategy in Little Cup, pairs very nicely with a Pokemon as strong as Houndour, fixing its Speed issues. Volt Switch and U-turn support is one of the best ways get Houndour on the field safely, and Chinchou, Magnemite, and Mienfoo are the most notable users of these moves. Lastly, another Dark-type such as Scraggy or Carvanha forms a good offensive core with Houndour, as Houndour can lure out one of their shared checks and take it out with Destiny Bond.


Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Destiny Bond
move 4: Pursuit / Flamethrower
ability: Flash Fire / Early Bird
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 36 Atk / 196 SpA / 36 SpD / 236 Spe
nature: Hasty / Timid

Moves
========

Once again, Fire Blast is the main move of this set, as its power is useful for revenge killing purposes and cleaning late-game. Dark Pulse serves the same purpose as a complementary STAB, and is a good move to spam with its great neutral coverage. Destiny Bond takes out any Pokemon Houndour can't KO once it has done its job. The last slot is mostly filler; Flamethrower is a more reliable Fire STAB with better accuracy at the cost of a bit of power, while Pursuit can be used for trapping purposes, but is weak and easy to take advantage of.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize power and Speed, with leftover EVs thrown into Attack and Special Defense. Hasty nature allows Houndour to outspeed Choice Scarf Pawniard and Speed tie with Choice Scarf Mienfoo, two important pokemon that Houndour definitely wants to outspeed. Use 36 Defense EVs with a Timid nature if Pursuit is not used. As Houndour won't be able to break through Porygon anyway, Flash Fire has a bit more merit on this set, but Early Bird can still be used for absorbing sleep status.

Usage Tips
========

This set works best late-game, when it can sweep through weakened teams with Fire Blast or Dark Pulse. It also can be used to take out threatening Pokemon with Destiny Bond earlier in the game, or to revenge kill Pokemon such as Pawniard.

Team Options
========

This set still needs things to handle Fighting-types, so Trubbish and Croagunk are again excellent choices. This set likes entry hazard support for easier cleaning; Dwebble and again, Trubbish, are good choices for hazard layers. As Houndour will need to switch out often, Rapid Spin support from Drilbur is appreciated even more. Carvanha and Scraggy again work well with Houndour as they can weaken or KO each other's checks.

Other Options
########

Nasty Plot could be used for a +2 Special Attack boost, but Houndour's poor bulk means setting up is often far too risky. An Eviolite set with Special Defense EVs is no longer useful due to the banning of Misdreavus. Additionally, a more physically inclined set with Crunch over Dark Pulse is usable, but Houndour's lower base Attack means this set is weaker overall and less effective at wallbreaking. Hidden Power Fighting hits opposing Houndour and Carvanha for an OHKO, but doesn't offer any other coverage that Houndour's STAB attacks don't already provide.


Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy can all take a hit and regain their HP with Drain Punch while KOing Houndour, though none of them like switching into Fire Blast. Timburr also has priority Mach Punch, which always OHKOes Houndour.

**Water-types**: Water-types such as Chinchou and Carvanha can beat Houndour one-on-one, but most have trouble switching in. Defensive Tirtouga in particular easily tanks its hits and can KO with Aqua Jet.

**Bulky Normal-types**: Lickitung, Munchlax, and Porygon can all avoid the 2HKO from Houndour and easily 2HKO back; however, Porygon has a chance to lose to two Life Orb-boosted Fire Blasts if it doesn't trace Flash Fire.

**Revenge Killers**: Priority users such as Fletchling and Croagunk can take out Houndour if they are healthy enough to survive a Sucker Punch. Faster Pokemon that resist Sucker Punch, such as Choice Scarf Pawniard, are threats as well, though Houndour outpaces them with a Choice Scarf of its own.

**Rock- and Ground-types**: Archen, Drilbur, Dwebble, and Hippopotas can all take at least one hit and OHKO Houndour. Diglett can trap and KO Houndour if it is using Substitute to evade Sucker Punch or has a Focus Sash.
