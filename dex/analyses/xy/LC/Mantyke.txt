Overview
#######
Mantyke is a unique Pokemon, as it is an amazing special wall that also has an offensive presence. It resists a good amount of types and has a very crucial immunity to Ground, giving it nice synergy with a decent number of Pokemon. To couple with Mantyke's defensive aspects, it boasts two nice offensive STAB moves in Hydro Pump and Air Slash, which can threaten many common threats in the tier. While it doesn't have the best abilities, both of them allow for Mantyke to play its various roles much more efficiently. The biggest downside to Mantyke is its crippling Electric-type weakness, despite its amazing Special Defense. It is also weak to Stealth Rock and has lackluster HP and Defense stats, though those are easily overshadowed by Mantyke's prowess as a special wall.

Rain Dance
########
name: Rain Dance
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Rain Dance
move 3: Air Slash
move 4: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Grass
ability: Swift Swim
item: Life Orb / Eviolite
evs: 76 HP / 36 Def / 200 SpA / 196 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
Rain Dance gives Mantyke amazing opportunities as an offensive Pokemon, both doubling its already decent Speed and boosting the power of its main STAB move, Hydro Pump, to ridiculous levels. Even outside of rain, Hydro Pump leaves huge dents in Pokemon that do not resist it. Air Slash is the secondary STAB move Mantyke should use, allowing it to take on both Grass- and Fighting-type Pokemon. Either Hidden Power Ground or Grass should be used in the final moveslot; both have their advantages depending on the situation. Hidden Power Ground nails Electric-type Pokemon extremely hard, its primary targets being weakened Chinchou and Magnemite. On the other hand, Hidden Power Grass nails Shell Smash Tirtouga much harder than Hidden Power Ground while still doing respectable damage to opposing Chinchou and Slowpoke.

Set Details
========
The EVs optimize Mantyke's Special Attack and Speed, allowing it to take advantage of the set to deal massive amounts of damage to opposing Pokemon when coupled with a Modest nature. 36 EVs are placed into Defense, giving Mantyke a better shot at surviving certain physical attacks, such as Drilbur's Rock Slide and Pawniard's Sucker Punch. 36 Defense EVs also hit an Eviolite number if Mantyke is holding it. Running a Life Orb allows Mantyke to hit much harder, though it is more difficult to set up rain, whereas with an Eviolite, Mantyke can set up rain very easily at the expense of some power. If Life Orb is being held, it is wise to run no HP investment and only 9 HP IVs, as it allows Mantyke to hit 19 HP and causes it to only take 1 HP from Life Orb recoil.

Usage Tips
========
The first priority when attempting to sweep with Mantyke is to remove Pokemon such as Chinchou, Magnemite, and Pokemon with Sturdy, as they can stop Mantyke cold in its tracks. After such threats are removed, Mantyke can set up rain to allow it to plow through opposing teams. The best time to set up rain is against Pokemon that Mantyke can scare out, namely Fighting- and Ground-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr. Mantyke can also set up rain against Drilbur if Stealth Rock is not up. However, if Mantyke has taken prior Stealth Rock damage, Drilbur is able to OHKO it. Another group of Pokemon that Mantyke can set up rain on would be Fire-type Pokemon that lack an Electric-type move, namely Larvesta and, to a lesser extent, Darumaka. However, Mantyke does not need rain to function, as it can still hit opposing Pokemon for a lot of damage on anticipated switches.

Team Options
========
Diglett is a nice teammate for Mantyke, as it is able to dispose of threats such as Chinchou and Pawniard while still being able to set up Stealth Rock. Drilbur is another Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock to benefit Mantyke, but unlike Diglett, Drilbur can spin away opposing Stealth Rock as well, which benefits Mantyke immensely. Ferroseed is a more defensive teammate for Mantyke, being able to take advantage of the rain to set up entry hazards and dispose of Chinchou for Mantyke. Pawniard can also aide in Mantyke's sweep by removing Eviolite from opposing walls, namely Porygon and Slowpoke.

RestTalk
########
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Scald
move 4: Air Slash
ability: Water Absorb
item: Eviolite
evs: 156 HP / 196 Def / 116 SpD / 36 Spe
nature: Calm

Moves
========
Rest keeps Mantyke alive and able to act as a great special wall for large portions of the battle. Sleep Talk lets Mantyke potentially attack opposing Pokemon after it has healed up and while it is still asleep. Scald damages opposing Pokemon and has the chance to cripple physical attackers by burning them. Air Slash prevents Mantyke from being entirely walled by Grass-types such as Pumpkaboo and Foonguss.

Set Details
========
156 EVs are placed into HP to allow for Mantyke to have more longevity. 196 EVs are placed into Defense, while 116 are put into Special Defense, increasing Mantyke' overall bulk. The EV spread's focus stays more on Defense, as Mantyke already has a ridiculously high Special Defense stat. The final 36 EVs are put into Speed, allowing Mantyke to outspeed a good deal of Pokemon, most notably Pumpkaboo.

Usage Tips
========
Mantyke should always take advantage of situations in which it can use Rest in order to keep it effective as a bulky wall. Removing Electric-type Pokemon that threaten Mantyke is a good idea, though not entirely necessary. The only issue with not disposing of them is the opponent gaining momentum with Volt Switch, which can be detrimental.

Team Options
========
Ferroseed is a great partner for defensive Mantyke, as it can set up entry hazards and is a safe switch-in to the Electric-type attacks that threaten Mantyke. In addition, Mantyke can take the Fire-type attacks that threaten Ferroseed. Both Magnemite and Lileep also synergize nicely with Mantyke while providing an offensive option to remove threats. As a more defensive partner, Chinchou works wonders in tandem with Mantyke, as Volt Absorb makes it immune to Electric-type attacks. Mantyke is, in return, immune to Ground-type attacks. Chinchou also has access to Heal Bell, meaning that Mantyke doesn't have to be as reliant on Sleep Talk to attack. Drilbur helps alleviate the entry hazard issues Mantyke faces while still being able to beat most Electric-type Pokemon for Mantyke. Pawniard is able to remove defensive threats through the use of Knock Off, leaving them in range of Mantyke's Scald or as Rest fodder. Mantyke on its own works best on more defensively inclined teams, providing a solid switch-in to many special attackers, namely Abra. Offensive teams do not appreciate the drop in momentum of using Mantyke.

Other Options
########
Surf can be run as a primary Water-type STAB move, however, Mantyke misses Hydro Pump's sheer power and Scald's potential to inflict burns. Mantyke can use Agility over Rain Dance and still get a Speed boost, but it misses out on the boost in power ofWater-type attacks and loses the Speed boost upon switching out. Ice Beam and Signal Beam can be used as other coverage moves on an offensive set. For a more supportive role, Tailwind can be used to aid teammates. Mantyke can also run Haze to surprise setup sweepers and eliminate their stat boosts. Alternatively, to better combat specially oriented setup sweepers, Mantyke can run Mirror Coat to take advantage of its absurd Special Defense stat.

Checks & Counters
########
**Electric-types**: Electric-types, such as Chinchou, Magnemite, and Elekid, have a 4x type advantage on Mantyke and can threaten it with a STAB Electric-type move. Chinchou in particular is able to take on Mantyke, as it resists Water- and Flying-type moves.

**Sturdy Users**: Sturdy users, such as Magnemite, Tirtouga, and Dwebble, have no problem taking a hit from and dealing back damage to Mantyke. Pokemon with Shell Smash and Sturdy can always set up if there are no entry hazards on the field and OHKO Mantyke with a STAB Rock-type move.

**Water-Types**: Most Water-types, including Slowpoke and Chinchou, take little damage from any of Mantyke's attacks. Chinchou especially threatens Mantyke, as it resists both of Mantyke's STAB moves and can deliver devastating attacks in return.

**Physical Attackers**: Hard hitting physical attackers such as Pawniard and Tirtouga can beat Mantyke easily by Knocking Off its item. Tirtouga can also threaten Mantyke with a STAB Rock-type move.
