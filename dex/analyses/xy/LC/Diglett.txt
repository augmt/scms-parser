Overview
########
When fully invested, Diglett reaches 20 Speed, making it the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, alongside Elekid and Voltorb. It has a fantastic ability in Arena Trap, allowing it to trap and remove specific threats. This is particularly good when paired with Pokemon which need Chinchou gone, such as Fletchling. Despite these two great qualities, Diglett is weak without Life Orb and is incredibly frail without Focus Sash; this combination makes it difficult for Diglett to switch into most decently-powered attacks.

Moves
========
Earthquake is Diglett's main STAB attack, KOes most weakened Pokemon, and is the only staple Diglett needs in its otherwise customizable moveset. Rock Slide is Diglett's primary coverage move, hitting Fletchling, Vullaby, and other Flying-types. Substitute lets Diglett bypass Sucker Punch, which is particularly useful for trapping Pawniard, and also allows it to avoid status. Protect can be used to avoid Fake Out. Memento is a good last-ditch effort and can be used after Diglett revenge kills a foe to lower the foe's attacking stats by two stages each while giving your own Pokemon a chance to set up. Shadow Claw is a more reliable means of hitting Gastly due to its 100% accuracy and typing, which prevents Gastly from setting up a Subsitute. Sucker Punch lets Diglett KO priority users such as Fletchling. Diglett can also use its Speed to set up Stealth Rock before it is KOed if nothing can take advantage of Memento and Sucker Punch is not needed.

Set Details
========
The EVs maximize Speed and Attack with the leftovers put into HP. Life Orb gives Diglett more immediate power and does not limit its usefulness later in the game with entry hazards up. Focus Sash lets Diglett more reliably switch into Pokemon such as Chinchou if entry hazards are not up and is also Diglett's only reliable way to get rid of Choice Scarf Pawniard.

Usage Tips
========
Diglett is not bulky enough to switch into many attacks, even weak ones, so it is best to use it solely for revenge killing unless you predict tho foe to us an Electric-type attack or a slow U-turn, Volt Switch, or Baton Pass. If Focus Sash is used, it's best to use a Defogger even if Choice Scarf Pawniard switches in, as Focus Sash Diglett can always take a hit and revenge kill Pawniard regardless of Pawniard being +2. Diglett can technically trap anything that is not immune to Ground-type attacks, but it's most reliable at removing Pokemon it can KO, such as Magnemite or Trubbish. Diglett is fairly weak, so it's important to make sure the opposing Pokemon cannot set up after Diglett KOes a foe.

Team Options
========

Diglett is best paired with Pokemon that benefit from the removal of Chinchou or other Electric-types, such as Magnemite; therefore, Pokemon such as Fletchling and Taillow are great partners for Diglett. Diglett also traps Poison-types, which Spritzee needs removed along with Steel-types, making it a great teammate. It also benefits greatly from slow U-turn users or entry hazards on its side of the field to break Magnemite's Sturdy or weaken foes down to Diglett's KO range. Knock Off support is very useful for bringing more Pokemon into Diglett's KO range.

Other Options
#########

Diglett can also run a Choice Scarf set to revenge kill other Choice Scarf users such as Pawniard or weakened setup sweepers such as Scraggy. It can also run Berry Juice along with Substitute and Thief as a cool way to remove a foe's item. Reversal can be used in tandem with a Focus Sash to hit bulky Normal-types more reliably after Diglett's Focus Sash is no longer intact.

Checks & Counters
#########

**Flying-types / Levitate**: Flying-types and Levitate-users will not take much damage from any of Diglett's coverage moves, even if they are super effective. They can also switch out of Diglett's Arena Trap.

**Physically Bulky Pokemon**: Diglett is not very strong, so it cannot easily KO Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Spritzee, and Slowpoke, even though they neither resist or are immune to Earthquake, and can deal heavy damage in return.

**Priority**: Due to Diglett's incredibly weak defenses, most priority moves will OHKO it, meaning it is easily revenge killed. Prime examples of strong priority moves are Pawniard's Sucker Punch and Fletchling's Acrobatics.
