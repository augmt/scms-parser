Overview
########

Lickitung is one of the bulkiest Pokemon in Little Cup, having 90 / 75 / 75 defenses. Lickitung's access to Wish and Heal Bell in conjunction with its bulk make it a great support Pokemon on defensive teams. Thanks to Lickitung's ability Oblivious, it cannot be infatuated or taunted; however, it isn't immune to Encore like Spritzee is. Lickitung also faces competition from Spritzee as a Wish passer and cleric and Munchlax and Porygon as a special wall. Lickitung also struggles against Fighting-types, which are common in Little Cup, and can often become setup bait for the foe.

Moves
========

Wish is useful for recovering health for teammates and makes it easier for them to switch in; it can also be used to heal Lickitung itself. Protect helps guarantee Wish recovery and allows Lickitung to scout the foe's attacks. Heal Bell allows Lickitung to further support its teammates and is also useful for curing status, particularly Toxic, from opposing Lickitung. Toxic can be used to stall out walls in combination with Wish and Protect. Knock Off is great for removing items and allows Lickitung to be a good counter to Ghost-types such as Gastly. Body Slam is a nice STAB attack and has a 30% chance to paralyze the foe. If Toxic is being used, Return is a viable alternative to Body Slam, as you can avoid paralyzing foes you want to poison.

Set Details
========

Eviolite is the optimal item for providing more bulk, as Wish is already a continual and reliable source of recovery and greatly outclasses Berry Juice's one-time use. 236 EVs in Special Defense and a Careful nature maximize Lickitung's special bulk, allowing it to more easily take on special attackers such as Gastly, Abra, Porygon, Magnemite, and Chinchou. Maximized special bulk is also needed to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Gastly and Life Orb Abra after Stealth Rock damage, as with any less investment, it can't handle them with entry hazards up. Maximized HP EVs further improve Lickitung's special bulk and ensure that Lickitung's Wishes are as big as possible. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense to improve physical bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Lickitung can switch into almost all unboosted non-Fighting-type attacks with ease. Therefore, keep Lickitung away from Fighting-types at all times and also watch out for Knock Off, as Lickitung's tanking capabilities are significantly reduced without Eviolite. Be careful not to poison foes with Guts, particularly Timburr. Lickitung also needs to be careful to not end up being setup bait for threats such as Swords Dance Pawniard.

Team Options
========

Spritzee can work well with and form an effective Wish-passing core with Lickitung, as they both cover each other's weaknesses. Snubbull, Koffing, and Cottonee appreciate having Lickitung as a partner for Wish support in particular and can take on the Fighting-types that beat Lickitung. Swords Dance Pawniard can easily use Lickitung as setup bait; therefore, a teammate that can stop Pawniard is strongly recommended. Both Timburr and Croagunk resist Sucker Punch while being able to hit Pawniard for massive damage with priority STAB Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, respectively. Croagunk is especially a great partner because it resists Fighting and enjoys Wishes from Lickitung. Trubbish also makes a good teammate for Lickitung, dealing with the Fighting-types that carry Knock Off with its combination of Sticky Hold, Berry Juice, and Recycle. Dark-types, such as Pawniard, Stunky, and Vullaby, can help Lickitung beat Ghost-types if it is not using Knock Off.

Other Options
########

Lickitung has access to a huge physical movepool which includes the elemental punches, Dragon Tail, Power Whip, Aqua Tail, and Earthquake; however, Lickitung is too slow to be able to sweep. Lickitung's special movepool is also fairly huge but, sadly, contains nothing Lickitung can really use, except for Fire Blast, which can hit annoying Steel-types, which are immune to Toxic, particularly Ferroseed. Curse and Swords Dance are both decent setup moves for Lickitung. Curse can be used together with RestTalk and Dragon Tail, but the introduction of Fairies makes this less viable.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Lickitung struggles with Fighting-types such as Scraggy, Mienfoo, Timburr, and Croagunk. Not only can they fire off super effective Fighting-type STAB moves, but they can also easily Knock Off Lickitung's Eviolite, greatly reducing its overall bulk.

**Knock Off**: Knock Off greatly reduces Lickitung's walling and support capabilities, so you should keep Lickitung away from Knock Off users.

**Setup Sweepers**: Swords Dance Pawniard, Belly Drum Zigzagoon, and Shell Smash users, such as Omanyte and Tirtouga, can easily use Lickitung as setup bait.
