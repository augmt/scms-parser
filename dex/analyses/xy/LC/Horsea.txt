Overview
########

Horsea is a potent sweeper thanks to its ability Swift Swim, which doubles its Speed in the rain, and its impressive Special Attack stat alongside strong attacks such as STAB Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, the former of which receives a boost in the rain. Although Horsea is very fast and powerful, it requires support from its teammates in order to sweep; as its Special Defense is lacking, it has difficulty setting up rain for itself, and despite how strong its attacks are, it won't be able to beat specially bulky foes.

Swift Swim
########
name: Swift Swim
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Substitute / Rain Dance
move 4: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Grass
ability: Swift Swim
item: Life Orb
evs: 36 Def / 200 SpA / 196 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Horsea's STAB Hydro Pump deals enormous amounts of damage under rain, OHKOing bulky Mienfoo and Vullaby after Stealth Rock. Ice Beam provides great coverage alongside Hydro Pump, hitting Grass-types such as Pumpkaboo, Foongus, and Cottonee. Substitute prevents Horsea from being crippled by status and prevents Sucker Punch users such as Pawniard and Stunky from cutting Horsea's sweep short. Rain Dance can be used if Substitute isn't needed in order for Horsea to sweep. Hidden Power Ground hits Magnemite, Croagunk, and Chinchou, which are much more common than the Swift Swim users that Hidden Power Grass hits.

Set Details
========

200 Special Attack and 196 Speed EVs with a Modest nature allow Horsea to hit as hard and fast as possible, while the remaining EVs are invested in Defense, allowing Horsea to withstand some attacks. Life Orb boosts Horsea's damage output and will inflict minimal recoil with Horsea's 19 HP. Swift Swim doubles Horsea's Speed in the rain, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame.

Usage Tips
========

Make sure to get rid of Pokemon that could halt Horsea's sweep before starting rain. Bulkier Pokemon will need to have their items removed via Knock Off, and specially bulky foes will need to be significantly worn down. Horsea also needs as many turns in the rain as possible in order to secure some valuable KOs, including bulky Mienfoo, Timburr, and Vullaby after Stealth Rock damage.

Team Options
========

Surskit, Riolu, Purrloin, Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Foongus are all capable Rain Dance setters. Mienfoo in particular is a great partner, as it can set up rain and use Knock Off, ridding bulkier foes of their items; it can also bring Horsea in safely with a slow U-turn. Chinchou and Staryu are also both valid users of Rain Dance, as they each enjoy rain-boosted Hydro Pump and accurate Thunder; Chinchou is able to come in on the Electric-type Pokemon that threaten Horsea, and bring Horsea in safely with a slow Volt Switch, while Staryu can provide Rapid Spin support. A Damp Rock can be used on rain setters with Prankster in order to increase the duration of the rain, but bulkier teammates such as Mienfoo and Foongus will appreciate having Eviolite more than Damp Rock. Ferroseed and Foongus are great counters to Chinchou, being able to switch into any of its moves and KO or cripple it if it doesn't switch out. They can also make for good switch-ins to Cottonee, which also threatens Horsea. Entry hazard users are useful, as the damage of Stealth Rock and Spikes helps soften Pokemon and breaks the Sturdy of foes such as Magnemite and Tirtouga. Other teammates that can utilize rain can help Horsea lay waste to teams with their powerful attacks. Anorith, Omanyte, and Mantyke are just some examples of offensive teammates that can be used in the rain.

Other Options
########

Horsea gets access to Focus Energy and Sniper, meaning that it can secure critical hits on all of its moves if it holds a Scope Lens, effectively giving it a 125% boost to its Special Attack. However, Horsea is much too frail to set up without support. Horsea can use Hidden Power Fire in order to take on Ferroseed, but it is weakened in the rain and the Hidden Power options listed will cover more foes. Agility can be used to let Horsea give itself a Speed boost; however, Horsea will receive the same increase from Rain Dance in addition to an increase in power to its Water-type moves. If Hydro Pump's accuracy is unappealing, Horsea can use Surf or Scald, but it really prefers the power of Hydro Pump to break past bulky walls. Clear Smog can be used to OHKO Cottonee after Stealth Rock damage, but it is almost never worth a moveslot, as Cottonee takes almost as much damage from Ice Beam. Horsea has access to Dragon Dance, but it's completely outclassed by Corphish at running a Dragon Dance set due to its lack of Attack, bulk, priority, and Knock Off.

Checks & Counters
########

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Chinchou and Magnemite can OHKO Horsea with their Electric-type STAB moves, although they must remain wary of Hidden Power Ground and Magnemite's Sturdy must not be broken.

**Grass-types**: Ferroseed resists all of Horsea's moves and is not OHKOed by Hidden Power Fire in the rain. Cottonee is bulky enough to survive an Ice Beam and OHKO Horsea with Giga Drain. It can also Encore Horsea into any other move, all of which Cottonee resists. Foongus can survive an Ice Beam and counter with Giga Drain, OHKOing Horsea and restoring a good portion of its health.

**Revenge Killers**: Pokemon with priority attacks such as Timburr and Fletchling can both finish off Horsea with their priority attacks if it is weakened, although Horsea is bulky enough to take weaker priority moves if it's healthy. Focus Sash Abra is also capable of revenge killing Horsea, particularly if the rain has ended. Vulpix can come in, cut Horsea's rain short, and OHKO it with Energy Ball.

**Speed Control**: Moves that affect Speed such as Tailwind or Thunder Wave provide a challenge, as Horsea is banking off of its ability to outspeed other Pokemon.
