Moves
========

- Prankster Copycat allows it to copy the last used move with priority. This means it can usually hit Drain Punch twice, or revenge Pokemon such as Scraggy or Dwebble.
- It can also be used to copycat things such as U-turn or Volt Switch from a teammate to keep up momentum, or set up things such as the opposing teams hazards or boosting moves.
- Protect works amazingly well with Prankster as it allows it to protect itself from, and then use certain moves such as Foongus's Spore.
-Drain Punch is the main STAB move, providing decent recovery, especially when Copycat allows it to use it twice in a row.
- Toxic is great, and can be used, with priority, to wear down bulky foes.
- Crunch is the best option against Ghost-type switch ins.

Set Details
========

- Eviolite is the preferred item as it maximizes Riolu's bulk.
- EVs are heavily invested in Physical Defense, which allows it to take on Physical attackers, such as Scraggy, with ease.
- The rest is put into Special Defense to give it some Special Bulk.


Usage Tips
========

- Riolu should be used as a pivot, switching into the Dark-, Rock-, Steel- and Normal-types it walls. 
- Often Copycat has very situational uses, so make sure you think about the plays you can make with it.

Team Options
========

- VoltTurn users such as Chinchou can often be used to get Riolu in safely, and then Riolu can copycat their Volt Switch or U-Turn to preserve momentum.
- Riolu needs something that can take on Poison-, Psychic-, Fairy-, or Flying-types. Cottonee and Fletchling are especially problematic as they can use faster priority.
- Chinchou helps with taking on Flying-types. 
- Pawniard can switch into Cottonee, as well as Psychic-types moves.

Other Options
########

- Riolu can boost its stats with Swords Dance, Agility or Bulk Up, but its boosting sets are generally outclassed by other Pokemon.
- High Jump Kick is an option for a powerful STAB move and with Copycat, it can use it twice in a row to deal quite a lot of damage.
- Iron Tail is its best option against Spritzee, but its low accuracy is off-putting.
