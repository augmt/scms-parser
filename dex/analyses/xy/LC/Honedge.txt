Overview
########
Thanks to its unique Steel / Ghost typing Honedge can take Normal-, Fighting-, and Flying-type attacks. It also has a excellent Defense stat. However, Honedge has some nasty weaknesses to Ghost-, Dark-, and Fire-type attacks, and its Special Defense does not help Honedge take any of these attacks better, especially because Ghost-type attacks are often special. It also has a low Speed stat; however, Honedge has Autotomize and Shadow Sneak to help mitigate that issue. On the offensive side, Honedge has a pretty decent physical movepool, though unfortunately, it has no attacks that benefit from No Guard, which becomes a liability.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Sacred Sword
move 4: Shadow Sneak / Shadow Claw
ability: No Guard
item: Eviolite
evs: 196 Atk / 116 Def / 140 SpD / 52 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
Swords Dance makes Honedge capable of sweeping late-game as well as threatening to defensive Pokemon. Iron Head is Honedge's main STAB move, and Sacred Sword hits Steel-types such as Pawniard, which resist Iron Head. Shadow Sneak lets Honedge pick off weakened foes and sweep late-game after a Swords Dance boost. If priority is not needed, Shadow Claw may function as a secondary STAB move so Honedge is not walled by Chinchou and has a much stronger move to use against bulky Ghost-types such as Pumpkaboo.

Set Details
========

Eviolite is preferable to Berry Juice on Honedge as it will usually be hit by Knock Off. Honedge's EV spread and nature maximizes Attack while still having enough Defense to avoid being KOed by common Earthquake and Knock Off users such as, respectively, Drilbur and Timburr, and survive Carvanha's Crunch most of the time. The Special Defense EVs allow Honedge to survive non-Life Orb Abra's Shadow Ball. 52 EVs in Speed, allow Honedge to outspeed Spritzee and 0 Speed Croagunk.

Usage Tips
========

Honedge is both a pivot and a setup sweeper. It checks Pokemon such as Fletchling, Bunnelby, and Spritzee and is able to use those opportunities to set up Swords Dance or hit its counters hard. It is best to save Swords Dance for a time when Honedge can wallbreak for another sweeper or sweep itself.

Team Options
========

Honedge has hard time getting past bulky Fighting-types with Knock Off without a Pokemon that can tank Knock Off such as Pawniard to weaken them. Spritzee and Lickitung with Wish also make for good teammates for Honedge because they can lure in Poison-, Steel-, and Fighting-type attacks, which Honedge can easily take while healing back up from Wish. Pawniard can force Honedge out, meaning bulky Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo also make good partners for Honedge. Paralysis spreaders such as Ferroseed and Cottonee also work well with Honedge because the paralysis not only helps with Honedge's low Speed, but also gives it the possibility to paralfinch foes. Similarly, Sticky Web can be used, but because of the Defiant boost Pawniard will become incredibly dangerous.

Autotomize
########
name: Autotomize
move 1: Autotomize
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Sacred Sword / Shadow Claw
move 4: Destiny Bond
ability: No Guard
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 196 Atk / 116 Def / 60 SpD / 132 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
Autotomize boosts Honedge's Speed, allowing it to outspeed its usual counters as well as slower Choice Scarf users. Iron Head is Honedge's main STAB move. Sacred Sword to hit Dark-types super effectively, namely Pawniard. Shadow Claw can also be used as a reliable secondary STAB move to allow Honedge to hit opposing Ghost-types hard. Destiny Bond lets Honedge take out one of its counters when it is done sweeping, and allows it to easily take out Sucker Punch Pawniard.

Set Details
========

Eviolite is preferable to Berry Juice on Honedge because of the inevitability of it being hit by Knock Off. Eviolite also allows Honedge to survive Choice Scarf Pawniard's Knock Off while Berry Juice Honedge will likely be KOed by Knock Off. Its EV spread maximizes Attack while still having enough in Defense to avoid KOs from common Earthquake and Knock Off users such as Drilbur and Timburr. Its Speed investment is enough for it to hit 11 so that it can outspeed 20 Speed Pokemon after an Autotomize. It's also interesting to note that Eviolite allows Honedge to survive Pawniard's Knock Off, which can hold a Choice Scarf, while with Berry Juice Honedge is likely going to get KOed by Knock Off.

Usage Tips
========

This Honedge is a good early- or mid-game check to Fletchling and Spritzee, and a good late-game cleaner. Destiny Bond allows Honedge to give its team fantastic support by KOing an opposing Pokemon so one of its teammates can sweep. After an Autotomize, it is important to decide which Pokemon Honedge wants to take out so that your other Pokemon can sweep. For example, if you are relying on a Carvanha sweep, you should take out Timburr or Mienfoo.


Team Options
========

This Honedge is more offensively oriented. It removes Fighting-types and Spritzee most of the time, meaning Carvanha, Tirtouga, Pawniard, and Scraggy make for great partners. Honedge also does a good job of removing Sucker Punch users, such as Pawniard, so Pokemon such as Gastly and Abra are great teammates.


Other Options
########

Honedge has a small movepool, so it does not have many other options. Rock Slide hits Larvesta and Fletchling super effectively. An Autotomize + Swords Dance set could work due to Honedge's relatively good coverage with just Iron Head and Sacred Sword. Life Orb can be used for more power, but Life Orb Honedge gains few KOs and is KOed by many more attacks than Eviolite Honedge. A RestTalk set can be used for more longevity. Honedge has the potential to work well on a Trick Room team, but it wastes a turn setting up Swords Dance.

Checks & Counters
########

**Knock Off Users**: Many Knock Off users are bulky enough to take a hit from Honedge and at very least 2HKO in return.

**Bulky Fighting-types**: Knock Off carrying bulky Fighting-types beat Honedge one-on-one.

**Fire-types**: As long as they can take a +2 Shadow Sneak or an unboosted Sacred Sword, Fire-types can easily switch in and either burn Honedge or OHKO it with Fire-type STAB moves. Also, Pokemon with Flame Body such as Ponyta and Larvesta have a chance to burn Honedge when it hits it them and thus are very solid switch-ins.

**Ground-types**: As long as Ground-types can take a hit from Honedge, they can usually OHKO or 2HKO it with their Ground-type STAB moves.

**Burns**: Bulky Water-types and most Fire-types can burn Honedge with Scald or Will-O-Wisp, rendering it useless.

**Dark-types**: Though Pawniard and Carvanha can't switch in safely, they can easily revenge kill Honedge.
