Overview
########

Misdreavus is one of the most versatile Pokemon in LC. With wide coverage options in Dazzling Gleam and Thunderbolt, it can often break through its own counters. Misdreavus is the best Nasty Plot sweeper in the tier, 2HKOing even specially bulky Porygon with a +2 Hidden Power Fighting. After the banning of Murkrow, Misdreavus remains one of the few Pokemon that hits 19 Speed, allowing it to outspeed almost the entire tier. Misdreavus can easily dent the opponent's team, often allowing other Pokemon to sweep. However, with XY came the rise of Knock Off. Misdreavus is OHKOed by Knock Off on less bulky sets and does not appreciate losing its Eviolite on the bulkier sets. Even with the coverage options that Misdreavus has, it often runs a straight-forward moveset, making it fairly predictable.

Nasty Plot Attacker
########
name: Nasty Plot Attacker
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Dazzling Gleam / Hidden Power Fighting / Thunderbolt
move 4: Substitute / Will-O-Wisp / Taunt
ability: Levitate
item: Berry Juice / Eviolite
evs: 36 Def / 236 SpA / 236 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Nasty Plot is the primary stat-boosting move, skyrocketing Misdreavus's already high Special Attack. Shadow Ball is Misdreavus's primary STAB move, OHKOing an incredible amount of Pokemon at +2 and is blessed with arguably the best offensive coverage in Little Cup. Dazzling Gleam is the primary coverage move and notably OHKOes Scraggy, while still hitting Vullaby for super effective damage and Pawniard neutrally. Hidden Power Fighting is still one of the best options for Misdreavus, notably dealing a large amount of damage to Pawniard without any boosts, while also 2HKOing Porygon, a very common Misdreavus check. However, using Hidden Power Fighting can lead to Pokemon such as Vullaby countering Misdreavus. Substitute is also a usable move, allowing Misdreavus to set up on Pokemon with status moves and avoiding mindgames with Pawniard. Substitute can also be used when forcing a switch to have an easier time setting up Nasty Plot. Will-O-Wisp is very notable in the current metagame due to it burning the omnipresent physical attackers of LC and essentially making them useless. Destiny Bond is also a good move for Misdreavus to use, as it prevents Carvanha from setting up on Misdreavus and also can pick off Pawniard while deterring the use of Sucker Punch.

Set Details
========

The EV spread maximizes Midreavus's Special Attack and Speed while leaving a point invested into HP. If Hidden Power Fighting is used, an EV spread of 240 Special Attack and 240 Speed should be used, as Hidden Power Fighting lowers both Speed and Special Attack IVs by one. If Eviolite is used, the 36 HP EVs can be moved to Defense. Berry Juice is a great item to allow Misdreavus to set up on resisted or weaker hits and possibly be rejuvenated to full health. Misdreavus is already decently bulky, allowing it to live a large amount of hits. However, Eviolite grants Misdreavus excellent bulk, allowing it to set up on a large amount of Pokemon.

Usage Tips
========

Simply bring Misdreavus in on any Pokemon that is unable to damage or threaten it and then use a Nasty Plot in order to begin smashing the opponent. If using Nasty Plot isn't favorable and the opponent has a Pawniard, Substitute or Will-O-Wisp can be used as an alternative. Substitute allows Misdreavus to either safely switch out of Pawniard or safely OHKO it with Hidden Power Fighting. Early-game, Misdreavus can simply spam Will-O-Wisp in order to cripple the opponent and then set up Nasty Plot later. With Eviolite, Misdreavus does best mid- to late-game, cleaning up the opponent's team. With Berry Juice, Misdreavus is best used as an early- to mid-game wallbreaker. Substitute is most recommended to be used with Berry Juice, as one can use Substitute multiple times to the point where Berry Juice activates.

Team Options
========

Fighting-types are great partners for this set, as Misdreavus despises bulky Normal-types such as Porygon and Munchlax. Choice Scarf Pokemon and Carvanha are excellent partners for this set offensively as well, as they can clean up after Misdreavus rips holes through the opponent's team. Carvahna also can KO Pokemon that Misdreavus normally has trouble with, such as Porygon or Munchlax. Fletchling is a great partner, as Misdreavus, despite being a Ghost-type, cannot usually safely switch in on Fighting-types due to the possibility of Knock Off and Fletchling forces most Fighting-types out. Fletchling can also take advantage of Misdreavus's ability to set up on Pokemon such as Archen and Chinchou.

Choiced Attacker
########
name: Choiced Attacker
move 1: Trick
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Dazzling Gleam / Hidden Power Fighting / Thunderbolt / Psychic
move 4: Destiny Bond
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Scarf / Choice Specs
evs: 36 HP / 236 SpA / 236 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========

Trick is the key move of this set; it cripples any Pokemon of your choice after the Choice item's utility has worn out. This allows Trick to cripple the opponent's best answer to Misdreavus. Shadow Ball is the main STAB move and is a great move to spam for a Choiced attacker in XY. Dazzling Gleam is the optimal complimentary move to Shadow Ball, allowing the Choice Scarf set to revenge kill Scraggy and also giving Misdreavus near perfect coverage. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to deal a large amount of damage to Porygon and Pawniard that wish to switch in and force Misdreavus out. Thunderbolt can be used to defeat Fletchling and Archen, but outside of those, Shadow Ball or Dazzling Gleam are more beneficial. Psychic can be used in order to OHKO Croagunk and have decent coverage with Shadow Ball, as well as hitting Porygon harder, but again, it is inferior outside of niche situations. Destiny Bond is used in the last slot to allow Misdreavus to KO a threat for another teammate.

Set Details
========

The EV spread gives Misdreavus maximum Special Attack and Speed. If using Hidden Power Fighting, an EV spread of 240 SpA / 240 Spe should be used, as Hidden Power Fighting lowers Speed and Special Attack IVs by one. Modest is the best nature for the Choice Scarf set, as not much can outspeed an 18 Speed Choice Scarf Pokemon. However, Timid should be used on the Choice Specs set in order to outrun most of the tier. Choice Scarf has more utility, as it can actually revenge kill sweepers and generally will Trick its Scarf later in the match, if ever. Choice Specs grants a decent amount of initial power, but generally is a more crippling item for walls to hold.

Usage Tips
========

If you are using the Choice Scarf set, analyze your opponent's team to see how useful it will be. Do not Trick early in the game like the Choice Specs set; wait closer until end-game to Trick the Choice Scarf and setup to sweep. If Misdreavus is using Choice Specs, scout your opponent's checks and counters to Misdreavus. Around mid-game, you can Trick the Choice Specs to that check or counter and then set up and attempt a sweep if the conditions are right.

Team Options
========

This set generally tries to open its own setup opportunities through the use of Trick, but it appreciates support from Fighting-types for Pokemon such as Pawniard and Porygon that can pose problems as well.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Will-O-Wisp
move 3: Taunt / Pain Split / Substitute
move 4: Heal Bell / Dazzling Gleam / Hidden Power Fighting
ability: Levitate
item: Berry Juice / Eviolite
evs: 36 Def / 236 SpA / 236 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Shadow Ball is the main STAB move, as it has great neutral coverage and a consistent damage output. Will-O-Wisp is very important on this set, as burning a Pokemon is extremely useful in the current metagame, making this move a necessity to cripple Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Pawniard, and Fletchling. Taunt has always been one of the best moves when used correctly. Misdreavus can outspeed and Taunt every single Shell Smash user in LC. It can also defeat defensive Pokemon and entry hazard users with this. Pain Split can be used if a more defensive set is required. Eviolite is always the best item if using Pain Split. Substitute can be used instead in order to avoid Sucker Punch and Knock Off from Pokemon such as Pawniard, as well as generally scouting against the opponent. Heal Bell should be used in the 4th slot, as Misdreavus can function well as a cleric due to its ability force many Pokemon out, and can allow for an opportunity to get rid of paralysis or other status effects. Dazzling Gleam has better neutral coverage with Ghost and notably OHKOes Scraggy. Hidden Power Fighting can be used over Dazzling Gleam in order to pose a mild threat to Porygon and Munchlax, while outright OHKOing Pawniard.

Set Details
========

The EVs are standard due to the fact that Misdreavus has solid natural bulk and its 19 Speed is very valuable. If Eviolite is used, the 36 Def EVs can be moved to HP. Berry Juice is the item of choice due to the fact Misdreavus has no reliable recovery, making the HP restoration very valuable. Eviolite can be used if Pain Split is used, as the longevity will really help bulkier teams.

Usage Tips
========

Misdreavus should generally just burn switch-ins early-game and try to cripple the opponent's entire team to make your teammates' lives easier. This set functions well as a lead due to both Taunt and Will-O-Wisp, as well as it having a generally good match-up with most Pokemon. On stall based teams, Misdreavus should be kept as healthy as possible to perform clerical duties.

Team Options
========

This Misdreavus is an excellent partner to many Dark-types, most notably Pawniard, as Will-O-Wisp allows Pawniard to set up much better. Misdreavus can also be a decent glue, helping to patch up weaknesses and forcing switches so that other sweepers such as Scraggy can set up and sweep the opponent's team.

Other Options
########

Misdreavus can run a Calm Mind set in order to beat specific stall teams, but this set is generally too slow to be effective. In terms of individual move options, Misdreavus can run Icy Wind to slow down switch-ins, although it is generally too weak. Taunt is an option on all the offensive Misdreavus sets, but Substitute is generally a better option. Thunderbolt can be used as it OHKOes Fletchling, but outside of that, Shadow Ball and Dazzling Gleam usually provide better coverage. On the Choice sets, Nasty Plot is an option so after using Trick, Misdreavus can set up. However, before getting rid of its item, Nasty Plot is essentially a wasted moveslot that could very well have been a coverage move. Memento is an amazing option and can often be used over Destiny Bond. Memento allows Misdreavus to sacrifice itself, allowing a devastating sweeper such as Tirtouga or Zigzagoon to sweep. Life Orb is a decent item on Misdreavus if a player favors power but doesn't want the drawbacks of being locked into one move when using the Choice Specs. However, the power increase is usually not worth the loss in bulk or the ability to gain health in a pinch and be ready to go in late-game.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Normal-types**: Pokemon such as Porygon, Munchlax, or Lickitung usually counter Misdreavus, although they must watch out for a Nasty Plot boosted Hidden Power Fighting. However, Munchlax and Lickitung can usually be defeated by Taunt or a Will-O-Wisp.

**Pawniard**: If Misdreavus does not run Hidden Power Fighting then Pawniard can usually switch in, often abusing a possible Special Defense drop from Shadow Ball. However, it must watch out for Will-O-Wisp. Choice Scarf Pawniard can usually trap it as well.

**Houndour**: Houndour can switch in on any move Misdreavus has to offer except for Hidden Power Fighting and either Pursuit trap Misdreavus or hit it with Dark Pulse.

**Vullaby**: If Misdreavus is carrying Hidden Power Fighting, then Vullaby is a great answer to Misdreavus.

**Scraggy**: Scraggy can always set up on Misdreavus lacking Dazzling Gleam and often doesn't need to worry about the burn from Will-O-Wisp, as Scraggy can have the Shed Skin ability.

**Priority users**: Misdreavus has to worry about being revenge killed by priority users such as Fletchling or Pawniard.
