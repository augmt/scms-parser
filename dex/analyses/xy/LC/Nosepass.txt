Overview
########

Nosepass is the weirdest of the famed SturdyJuice entry hazard setters of LC, being modeled after both a compass and a nose. Matching that strange design, Nosepass has access to a wide variety of moves, such as Volt Switch, that other setters lack. Nosepass boasts a base 135 Defense stat, the second highest in the metagame. However, Nosepass is arguably outclassed by the Pokemon with the highest Defense, Onix. Despite its incredible movepool, Nosepass has very weak offensive capabilities, and lacks the capacity to deal any significant damage against most of the tier. As such, Nosepass is limited to the role of a capable Stealth Rock setter with the ability to cripple its opponents with Thunder Wave and pivot out with Volt Switch.

Moves
========

Stealth Rock hampers enemy teams by breaking Sturdy and discouraging constant switches. Thunder Wave should be used if the opponent tries to set up while Nosepass is setting up Stealth Rock. Use Volt Switch for a slow switch out, which can help get Nosepass out so that it can assist later in the game, and can help get other Pokemon in safely. Rock Blast is a multi-hit STAB move that hits Flying-types pretty hard. This is extremely useful for switching into Fletchling and then punishing it if the opponent decides to keep it in, for breaking Sturdy on other entry hazard setters, and breaking Focus Sash on Pokemon such as Surskit. Dazzling Gleam can be used to damage Fighting-type switch-ins, specifically Scraggy, who takes 4x super effective damage from the move. Against most other Fighting-types, Thunder Wave and Volt Switch is a better combination, as it allows Nosepass to cripple them and get a slow switch out.

Set Details
========

Nosepass's preferred nature and EV spread depend on its chosen moves. Defense and Special Defense should be maximized in order to increase survivability. The remaining EVs should be put into Attack if using Rock Blast or into Special Attack if using Power Gem. A Bold nature boosts Defense at the expense of Attack, so it should be run if Nosepass is using Power Gem. Alternately, a Relaxed nature increases Defense at the expense of Speed, which increases the likelihood of moving last with Volt Switch. This works best with an EV spread of 76 Atk / 236 Def / 196 SpD. Sturdy and Berry Juice work in conjunction to ensure Nosepass has at least a turn to set up. With this combination, Nosepass can usually make several moves before going down or switching out.

Usage Tips
========

Get in, use Stealth Rock and maybe Thunder Wave, and serve as a suicide switch. Nosepass can tank physical hits pretty well because of its massive Defense stat and is an effective check to many common threats. Sometimes, it's more important to make a offensive move than set up Stealth Rock. Pay attention to the enemy's team and be careful with the decision that you make. While Thunder Wave can really obstruct Fighting-types like Mienfoo, it can be unwise to use if the enemy has a Timburr or Scraggy, due to Guts and Shed Skin, respectively. Use Volt Switch for a slow switch out, giving you the switch advantage on the following turn. However, Volt Switch deals almost no damage, so don't depend on it too much. Its sole purpose is to get Nosepass out and another Pokemon in safely. If there is an opposing Fletchling, keep Nosepass around to deal with it, as it can counter any set except the rare Hidden Power Grass variant.

Team Options
========

Cottonee, as a switch-in for Timburr, is extremely useful. Switch into a Drain Punch, use Encore on the Drain Punch, then fight back with STAB Fairy-type moves. Pokemon that sweep better after assistance from entry hazards, such as Taillow and Fletchling, are also good teammates for Nosepass. Ghost-type Pokemon can stop Rapid Spin users from removing Stealth Rock. Pawniard and other Pokemon with the Defiant ability discourage the enemy team from using Defog. Pokemon that appreciate a slow Volt Switch in, such as Fletchling, work well with Nosepass. Pokemon that can switch into Water-type attacks, such as Foongus or Dry Skin Croagunk, also are good partners. Foongus has great synergy with Nosepass, as they handle each other's threats.

Other Options
########

One of Nosepass's defining characteristics is its incredible movepool. It has Earthquake, Rock Slide, and several other good physically attacking moves, like the elemental punches. Of these punches, Fire Punch is the best, as it helps get past Ferroseed. One of the better alternative sets Nosepass can run is a Pain Split Eviolite set. With Nosepass's high defenses and low HP, Pain Split can truly be a problem for many opposing Pokemon. Nosepass can also run many odd moves that don't go well in a viable set but are still interesting, like Toxic, Stone Edge, Magic Coat, Magnet Rise, and Explosion, as well as Rock Polish and other boosting moves.



Checks & Counters
########

**Fast Taunt users**: Mienfoo can get off a fast Taunt, stopping Nosepass completely and forcing a switch. However, Nosepass can predict this and go directly for a Volt Switch.

**Defog and Rapid Spin users**: Pokemon that can remove Stealth Rock can negate Nosepass's hazard-setting efforts.

**Fighting-types**: As most Fighting-type Pokemon carry Knock Off, they can break Sturdy and remove Berry Juice in one turn, then Drain Punch or High Jump Kick for the KO the next.

**Water-types and Grass-types**: These Pokemon take neutral damage from Stealth Rock and almost all of the moves that Nosepass has access to. Slowpoke, in particular, walls Nosepass, taking very little damage even from Volt Switch.

**Mold Breaker**: Mold Breaker users such as Axew and Drilbur couldn't care less about Sturdy. A Superpower or Earthquake from these Pokemon can tear Nosepass apart before it can even move.
