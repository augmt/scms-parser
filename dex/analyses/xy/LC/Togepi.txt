Overview
########

Togepi was limited in previous generations by its typing and the ubiquity of Fighting-type Pokemon in the metagame. However, this generation it received a type change to Fairy, which traded one weakness and immunity for two weaknesses, three resistances, and a different immunity. Even with this massive change, Togepi's well-rounded bulk and strong coverage options make it a stellar supporting Baton Passer.

nature: Bold

Moves
========

Baton Pass is a safety net that helps you swap to another teammate that can deal with the issue Togepi's facing or pass on two different boosting options. Nasty Plot doubles Togepi's somewhat usable Special Attack and will always benefit a specially offensive recipient. Work Up, however, will boost both offensive stats by one stage, making it easier to choose which teammate to pass the boosts to. Wish can also be passed, healing whoever comes in. Morning Sun is solely for healing Togepi reliably, as it is an immediate effect. Finally, Dazzling Gleam is a powerful STAB option.

Set Details
========

The EV spread provides Eviolite numbers after the Bold nature increase and it allows Togepi to outspeed Foongus and Wynaut. The HP EVs ensure Togepi takes less damage from Stealth Rock as you switch it in.

Usage Tips
========

Switch Togepi in on Fighting-types, but be sure not to come in on those with Poison-type coverage such as Croagunk or Pancham. A field clear of entry hazards will keep Togepi at optimal health. Togepi should also avoid Poison-types and Steel-types, as they are difficult to set up and stay in on. Togepi's slow Baton Pass will aid its recipient by giving it a free entry without being hurt.

Team Options
========

Defog support from Vullaby will ensure safe entry onto the field. Vullaby can also pick off Foongus. If you would rather use Rapid Spin to keep your entry hazards active, then Drilbur will also suffice. It also has the added bonus of handling Poison-types. Fighting-types such as Pancham and Timburr are able to scare away Pawniard as well as help break down those which carry Poison-type coverage. Abra and Elekid make excellent recipients of boosts, as they can sweep with a boost from Nasty Plot or Work Up, respectively.

Other Options
########

Togepi can opt to run Fire Blast as an answer to Steel-types that resist Dazzling Gleam such as Ferroseed and Pawniard. Flamethrower can be used instead of Fire Blast, as it's more accurate and has more PP, but it's less powerful. Psychic is an option for hitting the Poison-types that resist Dazzling Gleam such as Foongus and Trubbish, but it doesn't hurt all that much despite the weakness. Togepi could utilize a Nasty Plot set which uses Stored Power and Ancient Power as the main attacking moves. Another thing Togepi has in stride is support moves. Encore and Yawn are good phazing moves that often force switches, while Mirror Coat deflects hazards and volatile statuses. Reflect and Light Screen help mitigate damage, and Counter can demolish any physical attackers. Soft-Boiled is another healing option that isn't hampered by the current weather condition and has more PP than Morning Sun. Its only downfall is that it's illegal with Nasty Plot.

Checks & Counters
########

**Phazing**: Clear Smog is a massive hamper to Togepi's success. Not only does it hit super effectively but it also robs Togepi and Baton Pass recipients of their boosts. Roar and Whirlwind users such as Hippopotas can take away boosts from Togepi and its teammates, though they don't do damage.

**Taunt**: Taunt users such as Froakie, Mienfoo and Onix can freely outspeed and eliminate it's ability to escape via Baton Pass. Mienfoo, however, is weak to Fairy-type moves, so you can take advantage of its moment of weakness.

**Switcheroo and Trick**: Buneary and Binacle will force Topepi to take their Choice item which will in turn weaken its defenses and lock it into one move.

**Steel-type Pokemon**: Pawniard and Ferroseed have a hazard to set up and Knock Off to eliminate Togepi's item. They will usually employ Iron Head to deal the most damage.

**Poison-type Pokemon**: Foongus, while slower than Togepi, can Spore and Clear Smog, forcing Togepi to start over. Trubbish, however, will take the time to nail Togepi with Gunk Shot or start stacking Spikes.

**Stat Drops** Moves and abilities that force stat drops such as Intimidate and Parting Shot will ruin your Work Up recipient, as it wont gain any Attack boosts as it comes in. Taking time to acquire more boosts will leave your team open to more trouble as well.
