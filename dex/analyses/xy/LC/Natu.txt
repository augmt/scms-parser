Overview
########

Natu has a unique Psychic / Flying typing as well as a unique and useful ability in Magic Bounce. With access to a fairly large movepool, Natu can fill a number of roles effectively. Between its defensive, dual screens, and offensive sets, Natu can make a good fit for any team. However, Natu does have some flaws. Its unique typing makes it very vulnerable to the common Electric-, Dark-, and Rock-types in the tier. Even though its ability allows it to bounce entry hazards away, it still often loses to common Stealth Rock users due to a type disadvantage. Although it has nice offensive coverage, it has terrible offensive stats to use its coverage properly. Overall, Natu can be a great addition to any team, but it needs support and prediction to use correctly.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Psychic
move 2: Roost
move 3: Heat Wave
move 4: U-turn / Thunder Wave
ability: Magic Bounce
item: Eviolite
evs: 196 HP / 156 Def / 36 SpA / 76 SpD / 36 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Roost is used for a steady source of recovery and to improve Natu's longevity. Psychic is a STAB move that hits Poison- and Fighting-types for lots of damage, as well as dealing plenty of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Heat Wave is a great coverage option to hit Ferroseed and Pawniard, which otherwise beats Natu super effectively. U-turn is used to gain momentum and also to hit opposing Psychic-types for decent amounts of damage. Lastly, Thunder Wave allows Natu to spread status with no drawbacks, as it cannot be hit with Taunt or statused itself.


Set Details
========

The given EVs maximize HP for more mixed bulk and hit Eviolite numbers in Natu's defensive stats, and the remaining EVs are put into Special Attack and Speed for slightly more offensive presence. A Bold nature increases Natu's Defense, which helps it take hits. Magic Bounce is why Natu has a niche in Little Cup, preventing it from being hit with Taunt, or statused, as well as bouncing back entry hazards. Finally, Eviolite is the only item that should be considered on this set, as Natu needs the bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Natu can always switch in on a predicted status or hazard move, but it should be wary of attacks. It should never stay in on Dark-types, as they typically have the upper hand. Use Roost whenever you have the chance in order to replenish health to boost Natu's longevity, as while Natu is bulky, it can get worn down. When in doubt, use U-turn to gain momentum and switch into a good option to take care of your opponent. Thunder Wave anything that you need gone or that threatens your team. Good Thunder Wave targets include Pawniard, which might use Sucker Punch, and Fletchling, which poses a threat to lots of Pokemon on many teams.

Team Options
========

Natu provides plenty team support. Dwebble, Fletchling, and Houndour appreciate the protection from Stealth Rock, as they aren't very bulky. Shell Smash users such as Omanyte, Dwebble, and Tirtouga can be partners as well, as they appreciate hazards gone. Natu can also deal with threatening Grass-types for these Pokemon. Fighting-types work well with Natu, as they take care of troublesome Dark-types. Ground-types such as Diglett help to beat threatening Electric-types. Anything that is weak to entry hazards and crippled by status typically benefit from Natu's presence.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Psychic
move 2: Heat Wave / Dazzling Gleam
move 3: Sucker Punch / Giga Drain / Roost
move 4: U-turn
ability: Magic Bounce
item: Life Orb
evs: 116 Atk / 196 SpA / 196 Spe
nature: Naive
ivs: 19 HP

Moves
========

Psychic is a STAB move that hits Poison- and Fighting-types for large amounts of damage. It also deals plenty of damage to anything that does not resist it. Heat Wave is a great coverage option for Ferroseed and Pawniard, which otherwise beats Natu. Dazzling Gleam is a good way for Natu to beat Dark-types such as Vullaby which are otherwise some of its worst matchups. Sucker Punch allows Natu to hit threatening Ghost-types such as Gastly, as well as Psychic-types such as Abra. It also helps to pick off weakened opponents. Giga Drain is a great coverage move that allows Natu to deal with some of its biggest threats, including Tirtouga, Omanyte, and weakened Chinchou. Roost is used for a steady source of recovery that improves Natu's longevity. Lastly, U-turn is used to gain momentum, while also hitting opposing Psychic-, Grass-, and Dark-types for decent damage.

Set Details
========

196 Speed EVs allow Natu to hit 17 Speed, which is a highly valuable Speed tier. 196 EVs go into Special Attack to allow Natu to hit harder, and 116 EVs in Attack are used so that U-turn and Sucker Punch do respectable amounts of damage. Magic Bounce is the obvious ability, as it bounces back status moves that could stop a sweep. A Naive nature is good to both boost Speed while not lowering either offensive stat. Finally, Life Orb is used to hit hard, while 19 HP IVs are used to reduce Life Orb damage.

Usage Tips
========

Offensive Natu is not bulky, so it should not be switching into attacks often. Always switch in on predicted status moves. Use U-turn whenever you don't know what your opponent will do, as it allows you to gain momentum. Life Orb damage racks up quickly, so use Roost when you run low on health. As this Natu variant is frail, slow Volt Switch and U-turn users are good teammates to get it in. Chinchou has good type synergy with Natu, while Mienfoo resists Knock Off.

Team Options
========

Dwebble, Fletchling, and Houndour appreciate the protection from Stealth Rock, as they aren't very bulky. Shell Smash users, such as Omanyte, Dwebble, and Tirtouga, can also work as partners, as they appreciate having entry hazards removed. Natu can also deal with threatening Grass-types for these Pokemon. Ground-types such as Drilbur can beat problematic Electric-types for Natu. Diglett works especially well as it traps and can safely KO them. Other Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards and crippled by status benefit from Natu's presence.

Dual Screens
########
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Psychic / Wish
ability: Magic Bounce
item: Light Clay
evs: 116 HP / 36 Atk / 76 Def / 76 SpD / 196 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Reflect and Light Screen provide bulk to Natu and its teammates, allowing them to set up. U-turn is for momentum, and it is a good way to get Natu's teammates in after setting up dual screens. Psychic is a good STAB move that is used so that Natu has at least some offensive presence. Wish can be used instead to provide recovery, and Natu can pass Wishes to its teammates via U-turn to ensure that they're at full health.

Set Details
========

Light Clay is best run here to increase the number of turns that dual screens will be up. This set is not meant to be offensive, as it is used just to set up screens while passively preventing entry hazards as well as providing Wish support. Magic Bounce is the obvious ability. The EV spread is used so that this Natu can be flexible when setting up dual screens. 196 Speed EVs are used so Natu can outspeed many Pokemon and get up screens reliably. 36 EVs are invested into Attack to give U-turn some power, while the rest of the EVs are put into HP and defenses to maximize Natu's bulk. A Jolly nature is used to raise Speed while lowering Special Attack. If you are using Psychic, you can put the 36 EVs into Special Attack instead of Attack and use a Timid nature.

Usage Tips
========

Switch Natu in on any status and hazards, but be wary of attacks. Set up dual screens to help teammates tank hits and pass Wishes. Use U-turn to gain momentum when you don't know what your opponent is going to do. Prediction is key on this set, so always predict switch-ins. Finally, always switch out of Dark-types such as Pawniard, as Natu can't do anything to them.

Team Options
========

Many Pokemon appreciate protection from entry hazards, and Natu works well to mitigate this issue for many Pokemon. Dwebble, Fletchling, and Houndour appreciate the protection from Stealth Rock, as they aren't very bulky. Shell Smash Pokemon such as Omanyte, Dwebble, and Tirtouga can be used as well, because they appreciate dual screens' protection as well as hazard blocking. Natu can also deal with threatening Grass-types for these Pokemon. Ground-types such as Drilbur can beat problematic Electric-types for Natu. Diglett works especially well as it traps and can safely KO them. Finally, anything that is weak to entry hazards and crippled by status can benefit from Natu's presence.

Other Options
########

Natu has several other options, but they either don't really fit well into its sets or are outright outclassed. Shadow Ball can be used to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types, but it is generally better to use Sucker Punch. Tailwind can be used to help Natu's teammates by giving them a free Speed boost. It would also allow Natu to get up screens faster, and it could allow Natu to invest in more bulk. Calm Mind can be used with Roost on a sweeper set, but Natu is generally too frail to pull such a set off. Air Cutter can be used as a secondary STAB move, it but is weak. Haze can be used on the Eviolite set to stop sweepers in their tracks, but Natu is typically too frail to tank hits before hazing. Toxic can be used as an alternative to Thunder Wave. Zen Headbutt can be used on a physically based Natu, but its special movepool is much better. Lastly, Feather Dance can be used on a defensively based Natu to lower opponents' Attack.

Checks and Counters
########

**Rock-types**: Rock-types such as Dwebble, Tirtouga, and Archen have a type advantage against and can force Natu to switch, or KO with their respective STABs.

**Ghost-types**: Gastly, Honedge, and Frillish can all KO Natu with a super effective STAB move. They have to be wary of Sucker Punch, however. Additionally, Gastly cannot switch in due to being threatened by Psychic.

**Electric-types**: Magnemite, Chinchou, and Elekid can all KO Natu with their super effective STAB moves.

**Dark-types**: Pawniard, Houndour, and Vullaby can all safely beat Natu with Knock Off, Sucker Punch, or Dark Pulse. Additionally, Dark-types can Pursuit trap Natu so they pose an especially threat. Pawniard has to be wary of Heat Wave, and Vullaby has to watch out for Dazzling Gleam, however.

**Special Walls**: Special walls such as Spritzee, Munchlax, and Lickitung wall Natu pretty hard. Spritzee is able to set up on Natu, Munchlax can aim for a Body Slam paralysis, and Lickitung can cripple Natu with Knock Off.
