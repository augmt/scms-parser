Overview
########

Growlithe has access to a very useful ability, Intimidate, giving it a niche as a physical wall in Little Cup. Growlithe has a wonderful total of six resistances, including one to the now much more viable Steel-type. Growlithe also benefits from Drought Vulpix being allowed in the tier, as sunlight amps up its Flare Blitz while also making its main recovery, Morning Sun, much more reliable. However, despite these great assets, Growlithe has a few flaws. It is susceptible to every single entry hazard, especially Stealth Rock, which strips off 25% of its health just by switching in. Growlithe is also outclassed as a physical attacker by Ponyta and Darumaka, and as a special attacker by Houndour. Growlithe also lacks a way to get through the very common Chinchou. Intimidate is also a double-edged sword, as it gives Defiant users +1 Attack instead of -1, which is quite an issue when Pawniard is one of the most common Pokemon in the tier. It also has issues getting past common physical setup sweepers such as Dwebble and Tirtouga thanks to their super effective STAB moves. Despite these flaws, Growlithe is a good physical wall in Little Cup.

Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Will-O-Wisp
move 2: Flare Blitz
move 3: Morning Sun
move 4: Wild Charge
ability: Intimidate
item: Eviolite
evs: 236 HP / 156 Def / 116 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

With both Will-O-Wisp and Intimidate, Growlithe can be very difficult to take down on the physical side. Flare Blitz is Growlithe's main form of attack, as it is decently powerful. Morning Sun allows Growlithe to recover health, and is boosted in Sun; however, it can be shaky under other weathers. Wild Charge gets good coverage with Flare Blitz, hitting the things that Flare Blitz cannot, such as Water-types.

Set Details
========

An Impish nature is preferred, as it gives Growlithe as much physical bulk as possible. The given EVs and nature allow Growlithe to reach 25 HP / 21 Def / 19 SpD after Eviolite, making it very bulky, especially when backed up by Intimidate. Eviolite is the item of choice here, as it gives Growlithe more overall longevity than does Berry Juice. Eviolite also allows Growlithe to take certain special attacks, such as Staryu's Scald, much better.

Usage Tips
========

Be sure to capitalize on Intimidate, as it is one of the few advantages to using Growlithe, especially against Pokemon such as Timburr. Never switch Growlithe in on a Pawniard or Inkay, as they will be given +1 Attack instead of -1, due to Defiant and Contrary, respectively. Growlithe is one of the greatest stops to the best cleric in the tier, Spritzee, as it resists its STAB Moonblast and can take its other attacks as well. Growlithe is best used after Water-types such as Chinchou and Frillish have been eliminated, as their STAB moves put an end to it. Growlithe should also watch out for other Fire-types, as they wall it to hell and back. Growlithe is a key check to many physical attackers and is a huge threat to them. However, Pokemon that commonly carry Knock Off are the bane of Growlithe, as it hates the removal of its precious Eviolite.

Team Options
========

Chinchou makes for a great partner, as it can take on the Water- and Fire-types that give Growlithe trouble, while in return, Growlithe can handle the Grass-types that give Chinchou problems. Rapid Spin or Defog support is absolutely mandatory, as entry hazards chip away at Growlithe's health all too fast. Two great candidates for this role are Tentacool and Vullaby. Vullaby is especially good, as it can take on Ground-types, but awkwardly, both Tentacool and Vullaby share weaknesses with Growlithe. Spritzee has decent synergy with Growlithe, and can pass Wishes and keep it healthy with Heal Bell, something that Growlithe absolutely needs. Growlithe can form a devastating Intimidate core with Sraggy or Snubbull as a teammate. Vulpix's Drought increases the power of Growlithe's Flare Blitz and the healing of Morning Sun, but the two of them stack weaknesses. Most Grass-types also have good synergy with Growlithe, handling Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type Pokemon, with Growlithe taking on the Ice- and Bug-types that threaten Grass-types in return.

Other Options
########

Growlithe's other ability, Flash Fire, is usable if your team is in absolute need of a way to stop Fire-types, but it is generally far less useful than Intimidate. Roar is an option to phaze opponents, although Growlithe already has issues fitting in all the moves it needs. It does, however, stop Torchic chains that can easily set up on Growlithe, which can come in handy. Flame Charge can aid in a sweep, boosting Growlithe's Speed, but Growlithe is a defensive Pokemon, not an offensive one. If it does choose to run Flame Charge, its set should consist of Flare Blitz / Flame Charge / Wild Charge / Close Combat. However, this is mostly outclassed by Ponyta, though Ponyta has more difficulty setting up and lacks a way to get past Rock-types. A Choice Band can bolster Growlithe's Attack, but this is better left to other Pokemon. Close Combat gets great coverage, but it lowers Growlithe's defenses, which is not optimal on a defensive Pokemon. Howl is the only way Growlithe can boost its Attack, but the boost is often too small and hard to set up. A special attacking set has merit, but again, it is outclassed by other Pokemon. Fire Blast and Flamethrower are alternatives to Flare Blitz if you don't enjoy the recoil. Toxic turns Growlithe into a very nice stall Pokemon. Thief can steal Eviolites and Berry Juices if your item is lost to Knock Off. Sunny Day can can work as an alternative to Vulpix support, though it isn't worth the loss of a moveslot. Justified is an extremely situational ability, but it can net Growlithe +1 Attack for switching into Knock Off.

Checks & Counters
########

**Sandstorm and Hail**: Sandstorm and hail both severely reduce the recovery from Morning Sun while also dealing chip damage, which Growlithe absolutely hates. However, Growlithe can somewhat beat Hippopotas, as Hippopotas dislikes Will-O-Wisp's residual damage and crippling of its physical attacks.

**Numel**: Numel is very rare, but it is the best counter to Growlithe out there. It cannot be burned and is immune to or resistant to everything else Growlithe throws at it.

**Bulky Water-types**: Chinchou, Frillish, and Slowpoke all wall Growlithe to infinity and back, taking next to nothing from its moves, not even Wild Charge. They can all retaliate with Scald and knock Growlithe out.

**Timburr**: Timburr can wall Growlithe, as it does not mind Will-O-Wisp thanks to Guts. It doesn't really enjoy Intimidate, but it can still come in on Growlithe and take it on. Its powerful Drain Punches can easily decimate Growlithe, while also helping it heal off the damage from Flare Blitz.

**Fire-types**: Fire-types are walled by Growlithe, however, it is also walled by them. This creates a stalemate between Growlithe and other Fire-types.

**Munchlax**: Munchlax, especially RestTalk Munchlax, is a great counter to Growlithe. Thick Fat allows it to shrug off Flare Blitz, and it can recover from repeated hits and a burn thanks to Rest. It can take any of Growlithe's moves, while slowly wearing it down in return.

**Stealth Rock**: Stealth Rock, along with other entry hazards, leave Growlithe prone to being worn down, as it tends to switch a lot.
