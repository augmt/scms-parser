Overview
########

Meowth is blessed with a great ability in Technician, which patches up its mediocre Attack stat by powering up Fake Out. It receives decent attack options such as Knock Off, U-turn, and Covet. Meowth also reaches the coveted 19 Speed, which allows it to Speed tie with threats such as Ponyta, and outspeed much of the metagame. Even with this going for Meowth, it possesses almost non-existent bulk, no resistances bar an immunity to Ghost-type moves, and a weakness to Fighting-type moves. All of this makes it incredibly difficult for Meowth to switch in reliably. Furthermore, Fake Out spam is not reliable at higher level play due to the predictability of the strategy. Meowth also faces competition from Aipom, but Technician makes Meowth arguably better.

Moves
========

Fake Out has +3 priority, more than any other priority attack, and can be used whenever Meowth is sent in. It hits very hard with STAB and Technician, especially when combined with Meowth's item, Normal Gem. This combination of boosts gives it easily the strongest Fake Out in the tier and outclasses some of the best users of the move, such as Mienfoo. Covet works very well with Fake Out, as the Normal Gem is consumed by Fake Out, freeing up the item slot for Covet to steal an item. Covet benefits from Meowth's Technician boost, making Return an inferior option. However if Life Orb is used, Return is usually better. Jolly Meowth outspeeds most of the tier, so its extremely fast U-turn makes it a very effective pivot. Knock Off allows Meowth to hit Ghost-types extremely hard and has decent coverage with Meowth's Normal-type STAB. Knock Off also lets Meowth support its team, removing items from opposing walls so that Meowth's teammates have a better chance to sweep.

Set Details
========

196 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allows Meowth to hit 19 Speed, which is essential to tie with fast threats such as Staryu, and also to outspeed Pokemon such as Mienfoo. 236 Attack EVs maximize Meowth's Attack and allow it to be an effective revenge killer. The remaining 36 EVs can be put into HP or Special Defense, as they are mostly filler. Normal Gem is the preferred item, as it boosts Fake Out and allows Meowth to abuse Covet. Life Orb can be used if the loss of an item disturbs you, or if Return is used. The extra power also helps a lot with Meowth's other moves. If you opt to use Life Orb, be sure to reduce Meowth's HP IVs to zero to minimize Life Orb recoil.

Usage Tips
========

When sent out, Fake Out should almost always be used unless Meowth is paired up against a Ghost-type. Use U-turn if a situation is not ideal as switching out allows Meowth to use Fake Out again later on. With no resistances and only one immunity, switching into attacks is extremely hard for Meowth, so it must be played conservatively. Meowth is best at revenge killing, so abuse Meowth's Fake Out and fast U-turn as much as possible.

Team options
========

Ghost-types are nice partners for Meowth, because they are immune to the Fighting-type moves it is weak to. Unfortunately, Meowth also has problems against Ghost-types, which are immune to Fake Out. As such, a Pokemon such as Pursuit Pawniard can make a great partner, as it traps Ghost-types. Meowth functions best on teams that can maintain offensive momentum, so Pokemon that can U-turn or Volt Switch in and out of battle are great. Teammates such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Archen work extremely well. Slower U-turn users such as Vullaby and Bunnelby are even more beneficial.

Other Options
########

Switcheroo can be used to pass crippling items such as Flame Orb and Choice Scarf to other Pokemon. Double Edge can be used over Return as a stronger STAB option, but the extra power is not normally worth the recoil, as Double Edge cuts Meowth's already limited longevity even further. Feint is an option for a secondary priority attack to allow Meowth to strike with priority after the first turn. This can be used to revenge kill weakened setup sweepers, such as a +1 Scraggy. Seed Bomb can be used to hit Tirtouga with a doubly super effective attack, and it also deals a great amount of damage to Chinchou. Hypnosis can be used to create momentum in tandem with U-turn, but is heavily unreliable.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Bulkier Fighting-types can take a hit and retaliate with their super effective STAB attacks, which can cleanly KO Meowth. Timburr and Croagunk can attack Meowth with STAB priority. Scraggy can set up a Dragon Dance or KO Meowth with Drain Punch. Mienfoo can KO Meowth with Drain Punch and recover any lost health by switching out.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types resist Meowth's STAB and can generally hit Meowth hard. Pawniard can deprive Meowth of its item while cleanly OHKOing it. Ferroseed can paralyze it with Thunder Wave and hit it with Iron Head or Bullet Seed.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types can switch in on Meowth's STAB thanks to their immunity to Normal-type attacks. They can then burn Meowth or hit it with a strong attack. However, Meowth's Knock Off can deter them from switching in, and its high Speed lets it outspeed or tie with most Ghost-types.

**Status**: Status effects are one of the worst things for Meowth to have. The burn effect completely cripples Meowth, as does paralysis.
