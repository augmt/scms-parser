Overview
########

Without its signature item, Flying Gem, Drifloon was usually cast aside in XY in favor of faster, more powerful Ghost-type threats, such as Misdreavus and Gastly. However, with Misdreavus's ban from the metagame, Drifloon has begun to reemerge as an offensive threat with access to a useful ability in Unburden and good typing. It also has an excellent support movepool with moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Baton Pass, Destiny Bond, Memento, Knock Off, and Tailwind. Unfortunately, Drifloon's weakness to Stealth Rock and Knock Off do hamper its capabilities, and its 17 Speed (without Unburden) isn't enough to outspeed Gastly and 19 Speed threats such as Ponyta and Abra.

AcroFloon
########
name: AcroFloon
move 1: Acrobatics
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Destiny Bond / Will-O-Wisp / Hidden Power Fighting
ability: Unburden
item: Berry Juice
evs: 196 Atk / 116 SpA / 196 Spe
nature: Naive

Moves
========

Acrobatics hits everything that doesn't resist it quite hard. Shadow Ball smacks Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-types that resist Acrobatics as well as KOing Ghost-types that Drifloon outspeeds after an Unburden Boost; Shadow Ball is also the best move to use before Berry Juice is consumed. Substitute allows Drifloon to activate Unburden and Berry Juice with ease, avoid status moves, and play around Sucker Punch users that threaten Drifloon, such as Pawniard. Hidden Power Fighting allows Drifloon to hit Pawniard and Helioptile, the only Pokemon that resist both Ghost- and Flying-type attacks, as well as being Drifloon's best option against Aron and Amaura. Will-O-Wisp can be used in the final spot to cripple the Knock Off users that shut down Drifloon. Destiny Bond also remains a good option in order to nab a quick KO on a Pokemon intended to revenge kill Drifloon, and functions wonderfully with the speed increase from Unburden. It's also a great way to pick off opposing Fletchling checks so that Fletchling can sweep later in the match.


Set Details
========

Max Attack investment allows Drifloon to hit opposing Pokemon hard with Acrobatics, and Max Speed and a positive nature lets Drifloon outspeed Pawniard before Unburden and outpace all Choice Scarf and +1 Pokemon afterwards. A Naive nature and Defense investment allows Drifloon to take common priority attacks better. Berry Juice is Drifloon's main source of recovery and is the best item to activate Unburden. If Hidden Power Fighting is chosen for the fourth slot, the EV spread should be changed to 36 HP / 196 Atk / 8 Def / 40 SpA / 8 SpD / 200 Spe.


Usage Tips
========

Drifloon usually has plenty of opportunities to safely switch into Normal-, Ground-, Fighting-, and Bug-type attacks. This set excels at late-game sweeping, when bulky Pokemon and strong priority users have been KOed or weakened. However, it can be brought in early-game to neuter its switch-ins with Will-O-Wisp and soften Flying-type resists with Shadow Ball.

Team Options
========

Like most other Flying-type Pokemon, Drifloon appreciates having Stealth Rock off the field, so a Rapid Spin user or Defog user is appreciated. Vullaby resists Drifloon's Dark- and Ghost-type weaknesses and can use Knock Off to soften up physical walls. Drilbur resists Rock-type moves, is immune to Electric-types, and has access to a powerful STAB Earthquake to hammer both of them, as well as access to Rapid Spin. Drifloon appreciates Knock Off support to be able to OHKO bulky Pokemon, such as Spritzee. Pawniard resists Ice-, Dark-, Ghost-, and Rock-type moves for Drifloon, and Drifloon takes Fighting- and Ground-type moves for Pawniard. Scraggy resists Dark-, Ghost-, and Rock-type moves, and keeps itself healthy with STAB Drain Punch, and Drifloon takes Fighting-type moves for Scraggy.


Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Hidden Power Fighting
move 4: Recycle / Substitute / Will-O-Wisp
ability: Unburden
item: Berry Juice
evs: 116 HP / 184 Def / 36 SpA / 4 SpD / 120 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Calm Mind is crucial to this set, increasing both Special Defense and the power of Drifloon's Shadow Ball. Shadow Ball is Drifloon's STAB attack and has great coverage on its own, only being stopped by Normal- and Dark-type Pokemon. Hidden Power Fighting is to hit both Dark- and Normal-types that do not take damage from Shadow Ball. Recycle allows Drifloon to regain its Berry Juice and continue to boost with Calm Mind. Substitute is a great way for Drifloon to avoid status and activate its Berry Juice. Will-O-Wisp can also be run, and allows Drifloon to patch up its Defense and cripple Normal- and Dark-types, most of which are physical attackers.

Set Details
========

The Speed investment gives Drifloon 30 Speed after an Unburden boost, enough to outspeed any relevant Choice Scarf Pokemon, even those with 19 Speed. 14 Special Attack prevents rounding down when boosting and the remaining EVs are invested primarily in defense, as it is not boosted by Calm Mind.

Usage Tips
========

Drifloon can switch in on a plethora of moves and Pokemon due to its handy immunity to Normal-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves. Calm Mind Drifloon is reliant on teammates to aid in stopping the things that can hard counter it, namely Normal- and Dark-types, as well as physically offensive Fire-types, which are immune to burns. This set also has some utility beyond simply boosting and sweeping, as access to reliable recovery allows it to switch in multiple times and spread burns.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard removal is beneficial to sustain Drifloon's longevity and allow it to be used as a utility Pokemon as well as a sweeper. Vullaby, which provides Defog support, resists Drifloon's Dark- and Ghost-type weaknesses and can cripple opposing walls with Knock Off. Drilbur, which resists Rock- and Electric-type moves, can provide Rapid Spin support and clear away pesky foes with Earthquake. Pawniard also makes a great partner, as its ability to use Knock Off can definitely aid in Drifloon's attempt to sweep the opposing team. It also resists the Dark-, Ghost-, and Ice-type moves directed at Drifloon and has its Fighting- and Ground-type weaknesses covered by Drifloon.

Baton Pass
########
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Stockpile / Calm Mind
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Baton Pass
ability: Unburden
item: Weakness Policy
evs: 36 HP / 164 Def / 84 SpD / 196 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Drifloon is one of the few Pokemon with access to Stockpile and Baton Pass, as well as Unburden. Its fantastic typing, with no quadruple weaknesses, and immunity to many forms of priority make it one of the best Weakness Policy passers in the tier. Stockpile is the star of the set, as Drifloon becomes bulky enough to survive super effective hits after a boost or two, and the defense boosts can be Baton Passed. Shadow Ball is a STAB with great coverage against most of the metagame, hitting anything that doesn't resist it for large damage coming off of +2 Special Attack. Will-O-Wisp is more efficient than Stockpile for tanking hits, permanently crippling many threats to Drifloon's Baton Pass; however, the benefits of Will-O-Wisp cannot be Baton Passed to a teammate. Baton Pass allows Drifloon to transfer its defensive and offensive boosts to a teammate. Calm Mind can be used to boost Drifloon's Special Attack and Special Defense and doesn't reveal Weakness Policy. Stockpile is usually much more reliable, however, for raising Drifloon's defenses, and Weakness Policy already does a nice job of providing offensive boosts.

Set Details
========

Max Speed investment and a positive nature allow Drifloon to outspeed Pawniard and use Stockpile before it can attack. The remaining EVs are put into bulk, as tanking super effective hits is quite difficult and this Drifloon set's priority is not to sweep, but to support. Unburden lets Drifloon outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, and Weakness Policy is a great tool to abuse with Baton Pass and Drifloon's unique typing.

Usage Tips
========

Drifloon's many weaknesses to Ice-, Electric-, Rock-, Dark-, and Ghost-type attacks come in handy with this set, and every team has multiple Pokemon that can activate Weakness Policy. Drifloon should generally Stockpile on a predicted switch, unless the switch-in is a faster physical attacker; in that case, Will-O-Wisp is the preferred option. Drifloon can tank weak Knock Offs and activate its Weakness Policy, but stronger STAB hits can ruin it without sufficient Stockpile boosts or burns. This set is hard-countered by phazers like Whirliwind Munchlax and Roar Hippopotas, although neither of them enjoy being burned, as well as Clear Smog users like Foongus and Koffing, so make sure these are removed before attempting to set up.

Team Options
========

Rapid Spin or Defog is a necessity, as Drifloon needs every bit of health it can get to tank super effective hits. Vullaby resists Drifloon's Dark and Ghost weaknesses and can use Knock Off to weaken special walls. Drilbur resists Rock, is immune to Electric, and has access to a powerful STAB Earthquake to hammer both of them, as well as access to Rapid Spin. In terms of receivers, it's best to have a well-rounded Pokemon that can take hits with Stockpile boosts and dish back with good Speed and Weakness Policy-boosted offenses. Scraggy is one of the best receivers, resisting Dark-, Ghost-, and Rock-type moves, as well as shrugging off crippling burn and paralysis with Shed Skin. It has access to Dragon Dance to help outspeed fast Pokemon and a STAB Drain Punch to keep its health up, as well as being able to beat phazers such as Munchlax and Tyrunt with Fighting moves. It lures bulky Poison-types with Clear Smog, like Koffing, Trubbish, and Foongus to Knock Off their Eviolites, making them much more fragile and easy to KO. Pawniard is another good teammate, as it has a STAB Knock Off and can take Dark-, Ghost-, Rock-, and Ice-type moves for Drifloon, with near-unresisted STAB coverage and powerful priority in Sucker Punch. Chinchou works well too, taking Electric- and Ice-type moves for Drifloon, with good bulk, unresisted coverage in three moves, and access to Agility.

Other Options
########

Status moves can be used, as Hypnosis can be run alongside Substitute to provide an 84% chance of sleep in two turns, and Thunder Wave and Toxic have their merits; however, Will-O-Wisp is usually the superior option to help protect Drifloon. Explosion is an alternative to Memento or Destiny Bond to heavily damage an opponent and bring in a switch-in, but the other two options are superior due to being able to play around Sucker Punch. Hidden Power Ground destroys Magnemite without Sturdy and still hits Helioptile, but is much weaker against Pawniard. Haze and Clear Smog are options for a support Drifloon set, but Drifloon is fragile without boosts or burns and has trouble switching in repeatedly due to its Stealth Rock weakness, limiting its ability to take boosted attacks. Knock Off can be used to remove an opponent's items and cripple them. Sucker Punch can be used to eliminate other priority users before they beat Drifloon, but most of the priority users that Drifloon fears resist Sucker Punch, like Croagunk, Pawniard, and Stunky. Disable can be used to stop Pokemon such as Porygon and Choice Scarf Pawniard, especially when Drifloon has a Substitute.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Normal-types**: Porygon is one of the hardest counters to Drifloon, as it's immune to Shadow Ball and doesn't mind burns at all while threatening Drifloon with an Ice Beam or Thunder Wave. Munchlax is immune to Shadow Ball, can tank boosted hits, and Whirlwind Drifloon away or simply use Pursuit.

**Dark-types**: Dark-types in general fare well against Drifloon, resisting Shadow Ball and threatening it with STAB Sucker Punch, Knock Off, or Pursuit. None of them enjoy Acrobatics, however, except for Pawniard. Substitute, Destiny Bond, Baton Pass, and Memento give it options to play around Sucker Punch, however.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types can easily switch into an Acrobatics and hit Drifloon with a super effective STAB attack. Shadow Ball can usually put a solid dent into them, but bulkier Electric-types like Chinchou and Magnemite can still check Drifloon.

**Rock-types**: Rock-type Pokemon, such as Nosepass and Tirtouga, can easily switch into an Acrobatics and proceed to set hazards up or boost. Drifloon can still hit them with Shadow Ball, but most Rock-types have significant bulk and can take a hit before hitting Drifloon with a STAB Rock-type move.

**Sturdy Users**: Onix and Bonsly resist Acrobatics and have a failsafe in Sturdy, and are able to OHKO with STAB attacks or, in Bonsly's case, threaten with priority.

**Stealth Rock**: Stealth Rock puts a damper on Drifloon's longevity, limiting the amount of times it can switch in.
