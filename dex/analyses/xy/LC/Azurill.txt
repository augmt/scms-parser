Overview
########

Azurill is one of the only Pokemon in Little Cup with the ability Huge Power, which doubles its Attack. Azurill's lack of Speed makes it a good Trick Room sweeper. Its Fairy typing provides a resistance to Sucker Punch and Knock Off, two very common moves. Its typing isn't very useful outside of that, however, as it has no Fairy-type STAB move to complement it. It also has a fairly shallow movepool and faces competition from Bunnelby as a Huge Power user, as Bunnelby hits 28 Attack as opposed to Azurill's 24 Attack, and it is much faster. It also requires a lot of support, including teammates that run Trick Room.

move 1: Return
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Waterfall
move 4: Iron Tail / Double-Edge
ability: Huge Power
item: Life Orb
evs: 116 HP / 196 Atk / 116 Def / 36 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Brave

Moves
========

Return is your go-to reliable STAB move that hits anything that doesn't resist it very hard. Knock Off is a great coverage move that allows Azurill to hit Ghost-types, while Waterfall rounds off the coverage by hitting Rock-, Ground-, and Fire-types super effectively. Iron Tail allows Azurill to beat a few things that otherwise wall it such as Lileep and Spritzee. Lastly, Double-Edge is another heavy hitting STAB attack, but the recoil is not appreciated.

Set Details
========

A Brave nature is used because you're going to be using this in Trick Room, so the loss of Speed is actually beneficial, while its Attack is maximized in order to hit as hard as possible. The Defense EVs add substantial bulk, allowing it to take less damage from opposing priority such as Quick Attack. Finally, a Life Orb is the item of choice, as it allows Azurill to hit even harder.

Usage Tips
========

Azurill is best brought in after a teammate has been knocked out as an early-game wallbreaker. Don't switch Azurill into an attack, as it will most likely be weakened to the point where it's useless, if it doesn't outright get KOed. Try to avoid Pawniard as much as possible, and if you can't KO a wall, Knock Off is helpful to for crippling it. Azurill's goal is to weaken the opposing team to the point that whatever cleaner you have can finish the job with relative ease.

Team Options
========

Trick Room setters such as Porygon, Spritzee, and Pumpkaboo are mandatory. Late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Bunnelby work well and appreciate Azurill for softening up the opponent's team. Hazard setters can help to break Sturdy, something that Azurill is very much grateful for, as with just one layer of Spikes and some prior damage, it can OHKO Magnemite and Dwebble. Azurill requires a lot of support to use effectively, but late-game sweepers and cleaners appreciate its help of busting through even the bulkiest of Little Cup walls with ease.

Other Options
########

Azurill has very few other options due to its barren movepool. Substitute can be used to block status, but the coverage will be missed. Eviolite can be used for extra bulk at the cost of some damage output. Bounce can be used to hit annoying Grass-types. Work Up, as a boosting move, can be used, but Azurill is too frail to utilize it most of the time, and it would rather have the coverage options. Azurill can be used outside of a Trick Room team with a healthy amount of Baton Pass or Thunder Wave support. Finally, it can use maximum Speed investment to outspeed most walls outside of Trick Room, for an easier time taking them down.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Most Steel-types, such as Eviolite Pawniard, Honedge, Aron, and Ferroseed can all beat Azurill thanks to their type advantage. Honedge should watch out for Knock Off, however, and Aron should watch out for Waterfall.

**Rock-types**: Eviolite Tirtouga, Omanyte, and Kabuto can all take on Azurill with relative ease due to their high Defense and good typing to take Azurill's coverage moves.

**Bulky Physical Walls**: Physical walls such as Spritzee, Slowpoke, and Koffing can all take hits well, and dispose of Azurill. Spritzee must be wary of Iron Tail, however.

**Status**: Burns, paralysis, and poison can all deter Azurill, as burns halve its Attack, paralysis can cause it to not move for a turn, and poison whittles its health down.
