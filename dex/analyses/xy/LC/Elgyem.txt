Physical Wall
########

move 1: Psychic

move 4: Hidden Power Fighting / Thunder Wave / Calm Mind
ability: Analytic
item: Eviolite 
evs: 236 HP / 240 Def
nature: Bold

Moves
========

- Psychic is the obligatory STAB move that deals decent damage
- Shadow Ball hits the and Psychic-types that have little to fear from Elgyem's STAB
- Recover is almost mandatory for healing off damage while tanking physical hits
- Hidden Power Fighting hits Dark-types that might switch in to wall its other attacks, and is especially good for hitting Pawniard on the switch-in
- Thunder Wave is an ideal option for quickly putting setup sweepers out of commission and making them easy to take out by teammates
- Calm Mind is a setup option that can capitalize on forced switches for more power

Set Details
========

- Eviolite is the ideal item to use here because Elgyem gets Recover to reliably heal and therefore does not need Berry Juice, and it appreciates the added bulk
- The given EVs maximize Elgyem's physical bulk and gives Elgyem an HP stat of 25, a Stealth Rock number, which is important for minimizing hazard damage
- 240 Def EVs are used instead of 236 due to Hidden Power Fighting's IV requirements
- Analytic ability works perfectly with Elgyem's low Speed, allowing it additional power against faster foes as well as switch-ins

Usage Tips
========

- Elgyem is used primarily to wall Meditite, and often gets a free turn as Meditite switches out to bring in a teammate with a better matchup
- Recover needs to be used in advance in many situations while tanking hits because of Elgyem's low Speed; if it waits too late to use it, it may not have the chance to
- Predicted switches to Steel- or Dark-types (especially Pawniard) can be capitalized on by using HP Fighting, punishing them for attempting to threaten Elygem by switching in
- Thunder Wave also makes an ideal option for crippling switch-ins and also gives Elgyem a Speed advantage that makes it easier to select moves
- Calm Mind is ideal for use with Recover to make Elgyem into a self-sustaining sweeper, much like Spritzee, but Pokemon that Elgyem is weak to will need to be removed before this can reliably be done

Team Options
========

- Fighting-types help Elgyem deal with the Dark-types that threaten it. Spritzee can help against many of these too, but it is less effective against Pawniard
- Dark-types like Vullaby are good partners for Elgyem, as they handle the Ghost-types that Elgyem fears.

Other Options
########

- Psyshock is an alternative and slightly weaker option over Psychic that can hit the physical defense of foes rather than special
- Signal Beam is an option to hit both the Psychic- and Dark-types that wall Elgyem's STAB, but it does not hit Meditite for super effective damage like Shadow Ball, and Elygem loses out on a OHKO against Pawniard if this is used over HP Fighting
- Thunderbolt is an additional coverage option for hitting Water- and Flying-types for super effective damage
- Synchronoise hits Psychic-types incredibly hard, but it unfortunately is not useful at all otherwise
- Energy Ball is an additional coverage option for hitting Grass-type-weak enemies for super effective damage
- Toxic stalling can work with Recover for wearing down bulky/support enemies
- Elgyem is slow enough to make use of Trick Room, but unfortunately it is not a very reliable playstyle in Little Cup, it also ruins the benefit of Analytic; however, a set with Trick Room, Calm Mind, Recover, and Psychic can be deadly once Psychic-type resists and immunities are removed. This is not very practical, though
- Magic Coat is a nice surprise against hazard setters or status spreaders

Checks & Counters
########

**Dark-types**: If these manage to get in, they can cause Elgyem a lot of problems, especially Pawniard if it can enter battle without taking a HP Fighting; Knock Off significantly hampers Elgyem's walling capabilities

**Ghost-types**: These can severely hurt Elygem with STAB Shadow Ball

**U-turn Users**: Even slow U-turn users like Larvesta can get a decent chunk of damage with U-turn and then switch out to a partner that can finish Elgyem off after taking the damage; ones that get STAB from it are obviously more worrisome

**Toxic**: As is the case with most self-sustaining walls, Toxic will wear Elgyem down despite its ability to recover health at will
