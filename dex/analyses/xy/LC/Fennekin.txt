Overview
########

Fennekin has an interesting niche with its ability Magician, which allows it to steal items from foes when it attacks. It can take advantage of this ability by utilizing Power Herb in conjunction with Solar Beam, which essentially gives it a 120 Base Power Grass-type move that steals the foe's item and doesn't need a charge turn. Typical answers to Fire-types hate switching into Fennekin, as not only is Solar Beam super effective on all three types that have an offensive advantage against Fire, but they also have their item taken in the process. However, outside of Magician, Fennekin doesn't have much to differentiate itself from other Fire-types. For instance, it's quite outclassed by SunnyBeam Ponyta, even if Ponyta can't steal items, and other Fire-types such as Vulpix and Larvesta, which have more raw power, reliable recovery, and can provide better team support than Fennekin can.

Magician
########
name: Magician
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Solar Beam
move 3: Psychic
move 4: Hidden Power Ground / Will-O-Wisp
ability: Magician
item: Power Herb
evs: 116 Def / 184 SpA / 196 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Fire Blast is the strongest move on the set and is Fennekin's best option for a STAB move. Solar Beam coupled with Power Herb is what gives Fennekin a niche; it can hit foes hard with a one-turn Solar Beam while simultaneously stealing their item with Magician. It easily OHKOes Omanyte and can OHKO Tirtouga if Sturdy has been broken. Psychic hits Fighting-types harder than Fennekin's other moves, 2HKOing bulky Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo while also having a chance to OHKO itemless Mienfoo. It also hits Trubbish for massive damage, and Fennekin won't be able to steal its item anyway due to Sticky Hold. Hidden Power Ground ensures Fennekin isn't entirely useless versus Houndour and other Fire-types, and it provides Fennekin with a way of hitting Chinchou after Power Herb is used up. Will-O-Wisp allows Fennekin to cripple tanky physical attackers such as Munchlax and Mienfoo.

Set Details
========

The EV spread coupled with a Timid nature lets Fennekin hit 16 Speed. 184 EVs are then invested into Special Attack, with the remaining EVs put into Defense. Power Herb allows Fennekin to use Solar Beam without requiring a turn to charge. The ability, Magician, is what prevents Fennekin from being entirely outclassed by other Fire-types, as it allows Fennekin to steal the foe's item upon using Solar Beam.

Usage Tips
========

Fennekin is most threatening when its Power Herb is still intact, and it is quite difficult to switch into because it has a nearly guaranteed item theft with Magician and Solar Beam. Take advantage of this to steal useful items such as Berry Juice and Eviolite from opposing Pokemon. Stealing consumable items such as Berry Juice is optimal for Fennekin, as it can use the item for itself and continue to steal more items. Remember that Fennekin isn't very bulky without Eviolite and isn't very powerful without a boosting item like Life Orb, so use Solar Beam as soon as possible to obtain a useful item. Also keep in mind that Fennekin shouldn't be switched into non-resisted hits due to its middling bulk; it should be brought in after a teammate has fainted or via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch.

Team Options
========

Fennekin will likely be forced out by Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types after it has used up Solar Beam, so a bulky Grass-type such as Foongus or Ferroseed makes for a good teammate to handle these Pokemon for Fennekin. Entry hazard setters are important teammates for Fennekin, as entry hazards ensure Fennekin can OHKO Pokemon with Sturdy such as Tirtouga and Onix. Ferroseed, Tirtouga, and Dwebble are good examples of Pokemon that can set entry hazards. Given that Fennekin is weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to all entry hazards, Rapid Spin support from the likes of Drilbur and Staryu is appreciated. Rapid Spin is preferred over Defog, as Fennekin prefers having entry hazards on the opponent's side. Vulpix can provide sun support to power up Fennekin's Fire Blast while also allowing it to use Solar Beam without Power Herb. However, they don't have good defensive synergy with each other. Finally, considering that Fennekin softens the opposition by removing items like Eviolite and Berry Juice, setup sweepers that can take advantage of this such as Fletchling and Scraggy make for good teammates.

Other Options
########

Hypnosis is an option to put the opposing Pokemon to sleep, but its low accuracy makes it unreliable. Magic Coat is an interesting option, allowing Fennekin to bounce back entry hazards and other status effects. Fennekin can opt to run the more accurate Flamethrower over Fire Blast, but Fennekin is already rather weak and needs all the power it can get. Psyshock is an option over Psychic, but Psychic is usually better because most of the metagame's Fighting-types have lower Special Defense. Finally, Fennekin could potentially run a boosting item such as Life Orb, but using any set that doesn't take advantage of Magician leaves it thoroughly outclassed by the likes of Ponyta, Vulpix, and several other Fire-types.

Checks & Counters
########

**Shellos**: Shellos is Fennekin's biggest counter, as it can tank a Solar Beam from Fennekin and can't have its item removed due to Sticky Hold. Shellos can heal off the damage with Recover and take Fennekin down with Scald.

**Bulky Pokemon**: Bulky Pokemon such as Porygon can wear Fennekin down slowly, even though they dislike losing their item. Porygon in particular can steal its Eviolite back from Fennekin thanks to Trace.

**Fire-types**: Fennekin can't do much to opposing Fire-types besides steal their item, and it is eventually worn down due to its lack of reliable recovery.

**Water-types**: Though they are heavily damaged and lose their item if they switch directly into Solar Beam, Water-types such as Staryu can easily threaten Fennekin out with their STAB moves.

**Rock-types**: They won't enjoy switching into Solar Beam or losing their item, but otherwise, Rock-types such as Archen check Fennekin quite easily with their STAB moves.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon in general such as Drilbur, Abra, and Gastly can revenge kill Fennekin due to its middling Speed and bulk.

**Priority Users**: Powerful priority users such as Fletchling can revenge kill Fennekin, but generally won't want to switch directly into its moves.
