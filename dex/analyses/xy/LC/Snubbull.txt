Overview
########
Snubbull is one of the few Little Cup Pokemon that changed drastically with the new generationâ€”it underwent a complete type change from Normal-type to Fairy-type, wiping its slate clean and giving it brand new strengths, advantages, and weaknesses. This often overlooked GSC Pokemon is not the punching bag for Fighting-types that it used to be, as it is now has a type advantage against them, as well as against Dark- and Dragon-types. Its STAB Play Rough brings the pain with great neutral coverage, and Earthquake scores a hard super effective hit against the vast majority of Pokemon that resist Fairy-type attacks. Other high-powered move options available to Snubbull include Close Combat and Crunch, and combined with Intimidate and incredible support options such as Heal Bell and Thunder Wave, Snubbull demands respect this time around. With this awesome makeover, Little Cup welcomes back this bulky attacker as a force to be reckoned with.

Snubbull Trouble
########
name: Snubbull Trouble
move 1: Play Rough
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Close Combat / Crunch
move 4: Thunder Wave / Bulk Up
ability: Intimidate
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 116 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 116 SpD / 36 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Play Rough is the obligatory hard-hitting physical STAB attack, smacking most of the tier at least neutrally, and has the additional chance of lowering the target's Attack stat. Earthquake hits the Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types that resist Fairy-type attacks for super effective damage, and therefore provides perfect coverage, with very few exceptions. Close Combat is a very powerful Fighting-type option that hits many Pokemon for super effective damage, but Crunch can be used to take a huge bite out of Gastly and Bronzor, two Pokemon that wall Fairy + Ground coverage via the Levitate ability. Crunch also lets Snubbull have an easier time against Slowpoke, a notable physical wall. With its sheer power, access to the Intimidate ability to neuter opposing physical attackers, and access to high-powered attacks, Snubbull forces a lot of switches, and thus has opportunities to spread status with Thunder Wave, making its enemies even easier to break down. Alternatively, Snubbull can utilize Bulk Up to become a physical juggernaut while taking advantage of the free turn provided by a fleeing foe.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread with Intimidate as the ability and Eviolite as the held item allow Snubbull to tank hits from both physical and special attackers, while still maintaining a formidable offensive presence. An Adamant nature is the optimal choice for achieving the highest immediate power possible, and Snubbull doesn't need much Speed, as it can take a lot of hits and is slower than most things even with a Jolly nature or heavy Speed investment. However, because it only takes 36 EVs to raise its Speed by a stat point, Snubbull does invest a little, so that it can outspeed certain slower Pokemon such as Bronzor and Spritzee. Berry Juice is an option over Eviolite, as it is Snubbull's only way to restore lost health, and can help Snubbull maintain momentum if it mistakenly switches into a painful super effective attack. Berry Juice is always the preferred item if Bulk Up is used over Thunder Wave, as Snubbull is otherwise unable to recover health after setting up.

Usage Tips
========

Most Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-types stand absolutely no chance against Snubbull. Scraggy is particularly vulnerable as it has a 4x weakness to Fairy-type moves. Intimidate turns Snubbull into a huge physical tank that can check other physically inclined Pokemon without even having a type advantage against them. Snubbull must wary of Poison- and Steel-type attacks, especially on the special side, as it cannot take those very well. Defiant Pawniard walks all over Snubbull if Intimidate activates its Defiant ability, as Pawniard easily outspeeds and a +1 Iron Head from it is a clean OHKO on Snubbull, regardless of the item chosen; thankfully, switching into Snubbull is a huge risk for Pawniard and Intimidate doesn't activate in this scenario.

Team Options
========

Lickitung with Wish and Toxic is an invaluable partner for Snubbull, as Snubbull can cover Lickitung's sole weakness to Fighting-type attacks and Lickitung can soften up Snubbull's enemies as well as keep both itself and Snubbull alive. Pawniard makes for a good teammate as well, as it can take the Poison- and Steel-type attacks aimed at Snubbull with ease, while Snubbull sponges the Fighting-type attacks aimed at Pawniard, forming not only a formidable offensive core but also one that covers all of the important weak points of the two. Inkay is the only Pokemon whose STABs score super effective damage on all three Pokemon in the tier that wall Fairy + Ground coverage: Bronzor, Gastly, and Koffing. Other Pokemon that can cover Snubbull's weaknesses well are Ghost-types such as Honedge, and Frillish, as well as Ground-types such as Hippoppotas and Drilbur. In addition to the aforementioned Pawniard and Honedge, Magnemite is an ideal Steel-type partner, as it is a bulky Pokemon that can trap and deal with the opposing Steel-types that might give Snubbull problems.

Offensive Support
########
name: Offensive Support
move 1: Play Rough
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Heal Bell
move 4: Thunder Wave
ability: Intimidate
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 116 HP / 196 Def / 196 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

This set has the same basic offensive functions, but has even greater bulk and also serves as a reliable supporter for its team. Play Rough and Earthquake provide near-perfect attacking coverage for Snubbull, and Heal Bell is used to keep both Snubbull and its team free of annoying status afflictions that can limit their potential. Thunder Wave is used to cripple foes and put them at a Speed disadvantage.

Set Details
========

When Eviolite is taken into account, a Careful nature and the given EVs give Snubbull an incredibly bulky defensive spread of 24 / 21 / 21. Intimidate further helps Snubbull take hits on the physical side. No Attack investment is required for this set, as support Snubbull prefers additional bulk, and it still hits hard uninvested with its trademark near-perfect coverage. This set also has no Speed investment, but with Thunder Wave as one of its disruptive options, Snubbull will be outspeeding most of its switch-ins regardless.

Usage Tips
========

With the huge array of Fighting- and Dark-type attacks flying around the tier, it is beyond easy to find an opportunity to bring Snubbull in to clear status for its team or spread paralysis on the opponent's team. After the opposing team is weakened, when there is less nead for Heal Bell or Thunder Wave, Snubbull can often find opportunities to take advantage of its excellent attacking coverage, including hitting notable threats such as Mienfoo, Tyrunt, Scraggy, and Vulpix for super effective damage.

Team Options
========

Eviolite Mienfoo with U-turn is an incredible teammate to get Snubbull in safely, and also threatens Pawniard and other Steel-types that give Snubbull a hard time after it knocks out a foe. Ground-types such as Drilbur make for excellent partners since they directly threaten the Steel- and Poison-types that can hurt Snubbull with their STABs. Abra easily gets rid of Koffing if it's an issue. Ferroseed forms an incredible defensive core with Snubbull, with both of them covering each other's weaknesses and both dishing out crippling moves. Anything that appreciates paralysis support is happy to have Snubbull on its team; slower Pokemon such as Timburr as Munchlax really appreciate the Speed advantage.

Other Options
########

Snubbull has the bulk to use RestTalk, but partnering it with a bulky Wish support is generally a better option, as it lets Snubbull carry a wider set of attacks and reliably choose which move it wants to use. Ice Punch is good for coverage, but it is unfortunately incompatible with Play Rough and therefore not worth running. Ice Fang can be used as an alternative to Ice Punch as it is legal with Play Rough, although the power drop is very noticeable. Snubbull actually has an incredible special movepool that includes Hyper Voice, Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, Shadow Ball, Sludge Bomb, Overheat, and Solar Beam, but it doesn't have the Special Attack to make good use of them and thus they are generally not worth using. Power-Up Punch can work as a Fighting-type attack that raises Snubbull's power while forcing switches, but Bulk Up is a better option for boosting and Close Combat is better for immediate attacking. Bulldoze can slow down checks on the switch and can be great late-game, but Earthquake is more reliable because of its much higher power. Counter can be used to surprise physical attackers that go for the kill against Snubbull, but after using Counter, Snubbull likely won't have the health to survive another hit, and if Snubbull uses Counter with Berry Juice, it will only get one chance to pull it off successfully. Rattled can be used to patch up Snubbull's Speed problem if you can switch it in against a Dark-, Bug-, or Ghost-type attack, but the fact that it doesn't hit 14 Speed even with a Jolly nature makes this impractical, as it can't reach a decent Speed tier even if it gets the boost.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Earthquake and Close Combat do help Snubbull a lot with hitting the Steel-types that hurt it, but they can still be problematic in some cases. Pawniard OHKOes any Snubbull set regardless of Eviolite after getting to +1 (Intimidate followed by Defiant), but cannot reliably switch into or OHKO Snubbull from full health without this boost. Bronzor can use Snubbull lacking Crunch as setup bait, as it resists Play Rough, is immune to Earthquake, and can threaten Snubbull with its STAB Flash Cannon. Ferroseed is a decent check that doesn't mind being paralyzed too much, especially since paralysis further increases the power of its super effective STAB Gyro Ball, but must be wary of Close Combat.

**Physical Walls**: Snubbull can break down a good many physical walls, but there are a couple of notable ones that beat it. Spritzee can tank Snubbull's attacks while healing with Wish and hitting Snubbull with Moonblast or setting up with Calm Mind. Physically defensive Slowpoke can take just about anything, bar Crunch, from either set, and threaten Snubbull with Thunder Wave; Scald also ruins the Snubbull Trouble set due to its burn chance.

**Fairy-type-resistant Pokemon with Levitate**: In addition to the previously mentioned Bronzor, there are two other Pokemon in the tier that resist the combination of Fairy- and Ground- type attacks. Koffing resists Play Rough, is immune to Earthquake, resistant to Close Combat, and doesn't take much from Crunch. It can threaten Snubbull with STAB Sludge Bomb and cripple the Snubbull Trouble set with Will-O-Wisp. Gastly resists Play Rough and is immune to Earthquake and Close Combat. It annihilates Snubbull with its STAB Sludge Bomb, but must be wary of switching into Crunch or Thunder Wave.

**Burn Status**: While the offensive support set doesn't mind it too much, anything with Will-O-Wisp, such as Frillish, Ponyta, or Growlithe, can ruin the attacking power of the Snubbull Trouble set. Larvesta is a Will-O-Wisp user that can decently wall both sets, being a Fire-type that takes only neutral damage from Earthquake, and it even gets U-turn to maintain momentum as Snubbull flees to avoid being burned. The countless Water-types that carry Scald are also problematic, and it's usually not a good idea to let Snubbull take repeated hits from Scald, thanks to the 30% burn chance.
