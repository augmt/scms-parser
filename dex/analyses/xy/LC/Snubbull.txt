Overview
########

Thanks to its good defensive typing and ability, Snubbull is able to function as an excellent pivot on offensive teams. Although it is inevitably compared to Spritzee as a bulky Fairy-type, its wonderful movepool, both offensively and defensively, combined with its high damage output, allow it to simultaneously support its own team and threaten the opposition. In particular, Snubbull carves itself a niche as one of the tier's premier Fighting-type checks, provided they lack Poison-type coverage moves; it is also able to function as an effective Knock Off absorber for teams that need one. Snubbull's greatest weakness is that it lacks reliable recovery unless it runs Rest and Sleep Talk, which carry their own disadvantages.

Berry Juice Support
########
name: Berry Juice
move 1: Thief
move 2: Play Rough
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Thunder Wave / Heal Bell
ability: Intimidate
item: Berry Juice
evs: 36 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 116 SpD / 116 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Thief allows Snubbull to steal an item once its Berry Juice has been used up or Knocked Off, acting as a pseudo Knock Off. Play Rough is a reliable and powerful STAB move that provides good neutral coverage alongside Earthquake, which most notably hits Magnemite and Pawniard. Close Combat is another possible coverage move that can OHKO Pawniard and hit Ferroseed hard, but it reduces Snubbull's staying power and leaves it walled by Poison-types. Thunder Wave is a good support move that cripples a variety of switch-ins and helps slower teammates attempt a sweep. Heal Bell is another useful support move that allows the rest of the team to more freely absorb status moves while Snubbull is still healthy.

Set Details
========

This set aims to support the team while maintaining a good offensive presence. The given EVs and nature maximize Snubbull's damage output and boost both its defenses so Snubbull can better take both physical and special neutral attacks. Hitting 11 Speed lets Snubbull reliably check Poison Jab Timburr, outspeed and thus 2HKO Skrelp on the switch with Earthquake, and Speed tie with Pancham.

Usage Tips
========

Switch Snubbull in on a foe it forces out and use the appropriate attack to hit the switch-in. Try to use Thief on a foe that doesn't want to lose its item, such as Eviolite Porygon. Thanks to Intimidate, a low-health Snubbull is a good Pokemon to use as fodder against physical attackers; however, do not attempt this against Defiant Pawniard, because Intimidate will activate Defiant. Heal Bell is best used when Snubbull or one of its teammates is affected by status.

Team Options
========

Snubbull pairs well with Pokemon that appreciate a check to Fighting-types, such as Porygon; offensive Steel-types in general, including Magnemite and Pawniard, have good type synergy with Snubbull. Ponyta is able to reliably check Pawniard, Foongus, and Ferroseed, three Pokemon that Snubbull thoroughly dislikes. Hidden Power Fire Gothita is able to trap and eliminate Foongus and Ferroseed; similarly, Diglett can trap and deal with specific troublesome Poison- and Steel-types.

Eviolite Support
########
name: Eviolite
move 1: Play Rough
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Thunder Wave
move 4: Heal Bell / Bulk Up
ability: Intimidate
item: Eviolite
evs: 36 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 116 SpD / 116 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Play Rough is Snubbull's STAB move of choice, dealing decent damage to Pokemon that do not resist it. Earthquake synergizes well with Play Rough, covering all three types that resist Fairy. Thunder Wave is a useful support move to cripple key threats and benefit slower Pokemon on Snubbull's team, including Snubbull itself, while Heal Bell can also help support the team. Bulk Up gives Snubbull the boost in damage needed to break through physically bulky Pokemon that could otherwise wall it.

Set Details
========

The EVs allow Snubbull to heavily damage most switch-ins and outspeed two important threats in Timburr and Skrelp, as well as Speed tie with Pancham. Leftover EVs are put in both defenses so Snubbull can hit Eviolite numbers to better take both physical and special attacks. A more defensive spread of 36 HP / 36 Atk / 196 Def / 196 SpD / 36 Spe is also an option if even more bulk is desired. Eviolite gives this set a good amount of initial bulk, allowing it to take advantage of Wish support and survive many otherwise fatal attacks.

Usage Tips
========

Switch Snubbull in on a Pokemon it is able to beat and try to hit whatever the opponent switches to. Due to Snubbull's lack of recovery outside of external support, mistakes it makes are slightly more punishable, so except against specific enemies, Thunder Wave is often the safest opening move. If Wish support is not available, a low-health Snubbull can be sacrificed to temporarily weaken physical attackers except for Pawniard, which will take advantage of Intimidate with Defiant. Heal Bell is to be used if Snubbull or a teammate is affected by a status condition. Defensive Pokemon such Spritzee and Porygon are common switch-ins to Snubbull and are good opportunities to set up Bulk Up. Utilizing Thunder Wave early in the match will make it easier to sweep with Bulk Up later.

Team Options
========

Any Pokemon that dislikes Fighting-types will appreciate Snubbull as a teammate; Lickitung in particular can pass Snubbull large Wishes to keep it healthy. Steel-types such as Pawniard and Ferroseed also appreciate Snubbull's ability to check Fighting-types, while they deal with Poison- and Fairy-types. Ponyta checks Pawniard, Ferroseed, and Foongus, while Gothita can most notably trap Foongus, Croagunk, and, if Gothita is running Hidden Power Fire, Ferroseed.

RestTalk
########
name: Rest + Sleep Talk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Play Rough
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Intimidate
item: Eviolite
evs: 36 HP / 36 Atk / 196 Def / 196 SpD / 36 Spe
nature: Careful

Moves
========

A combination of Rest and Sleep Talk allows Snubbull to reliably and repeatedly recover its health; Rest heals off any damage or status Snubbull has accumulated, while Sleep Talk ensures that Snubbull continues to pose as a threat even when asleep. Play Rough and Earthquake are good offensive moves, being Snubbull's STAB and coverage moves, respectively. Heal Bell can be used over Earthquake to support the team, and can wake Snubbull up a turn earlier if picked by Sleep Talk; however, the coverage will be sorely missed.

Set Details
========

The given EVs and nature allow Snubbull to hit Eviolite numbers and 23 / 21 / 21 bulk after Eviolite, letting it avoid the OHKO from all but extremely powerful super effective attacks. The remaining EVs are filler; 23 HP is maintained so that Snubbull only takes 2 damage from Stealth Rock. Eviolite is the item of choice for increased bulk, since Snubbull already has a method of recovery with this set.

Usage Tips
========

Switch Snubbull in on Pokemon that do not threaten it and hit the switch-in or use Rest if Snubbull's health is getting low. This set plays like a typical wall, coming in on threats that cannot hurt it significantly and whittling them down.

Team Options
========

Snubbull pairs well with Pokemon that appreciate a check to Fighting-types, such as Porygon, Ferroseed, and defensive Steel-types in general. Lickitung in particular can wake a sleeping Snubbull with Heal Bell support. Ponyta is able to reliably check Pawniard, Foongus and Ferroseed, three Pokemon that Snubbull can't handle well.

Other Options
########

Crunch OHKOes Gastly and deals more damage to Pumpkaboo formes than Snubbull's other attacks do; both Ghost-types are able to easily take on all common offensive moves Snubbull carries. Fire Punch damages Steel-types and is Snubbull's most powerful option against Ferroseed and Foongus, but Earthquake hits a greater variety of targets. Superpower can be used over Close Combat, but it reduces Snubbull's staying power by even more. Bulldoze, despite its useful Speed-lowering effect, is too weak to be effectively used as a coverage move. Snubbull's enormous special movepool is offset by its awful Special Attack stat.

Checks and Counters
########

**Pokemon That Resist Fairy**: Various Steel-, Fire-, and Poison-types are able to switch into Play Rough, but may struggle to absorb Snubbull's coverage moves. Foongus is able to almost entirely wall Snubbull and does not mind Thunder Wave, due to its already low Speed; furthermore, Regenerator allows Foongus to effortlessly check Snubbull throughout the match. Koffing does not pack Regenerator, so it can be worn down, but otherwise walls Snubbull completely. Ferroseed will not enjoy taking some of Snubbull's rarer coverage moves, but can generally withstand Snubbull's assaults fairly easily and set up hazards or hit back hard. Gastly dislikes Thunder Wave and Thief, but it is able to OHKO all Snubbull sets with Life Orb Sludge Bomb if it gets into play safely.

**Pawniard**: Although it dislikes switching into Snubbull's powerful attacks, Pawniard is able to take advantage of Snubbull's Intimidate to activate Defiant, allowing Pawniard to OHKO Snubbull and severely threaten the rest of its team with some smart switches.

**Walls**: Extremely physically bulky Pokemon such as Spritzee, Porygon, and Hippopotas are able to stall most variants of Snubbull out, although they will lose if Snubbull is a RestTalk variant and they are unable to 3HKO it or if Snubbull is running Bulk Up.
