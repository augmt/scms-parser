Overview
########

Drilbur fits many different roles in the LC metagame. With a Jolly nature, Drilbur hits 17 Speed and a strong 18 Attack, and its access to Swords Dance makes it even more threatening. However, Drilbur is more than that; it's also one of the few viable Rapid Spinners in Little Cup. It can also lay Stealth Rock, making it a very decent support Pokemon. The ability Mold Breaker allows it to hit levitating Pokemon with Earthquake and OHKO Pokemon with the ability Sturdy. Drilbur's biggest problem is that it's pretty frail, even with Eviolite, and its lack of reliable recovery also makes it easy to wear down.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Rapid Spin / Swords Dance
move 3: Rock Slide / Rock Tomb
move 4: Stealth Rock / Swords Dance
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Eviolite / Life Orb
evs: 36 HP / 236 Atk / 212 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Earthquake is a strong reliable STAB move that can hit levitating threats due to Mold Breaker. Rapid Spin is a very good move because Drilbur is one of the few Pokemon in LC that can use it well. Rock Slide or Rock Tomb provides important coverage on Flying-types, such as Archen and Fletchling. Stealth Rock is a good option if your team needs it. Swords Dance allows Drilbur to sweep if it gets an opportunity to set up, as not many Pokemon can switch into a +2 Mold Breaker Earthquake.

Set Details
========

Eviolite is the preferred item, as it allows Drilbur to take a hit from many attackers. Maximizing Speed and Attack allows Drilbur to have as much of an offensive presence as possible. Jolly is the preferred nature to outspeed Jolly Pawniard and Jolly Dwebble. Mold Breaker allows Drilbur to KO Dwebble through Sturdy if it has a Swords Dance boost and also prevents Tirtouga from setting up. It also allows Drilbur to beat standard anti-Ground-type walls such as Bronzor and Koffing and hit through Levitate with Earthquake. Berry Juice can be used, but Drilbur is often OHKOed without Eviolite because of its underwhelming defensive stats. Life Orb lets Drilbur KO more Pokemon and is great if it's using Swords Dance.

Usage Tips
========

Due to its frailty and bad defensive typing, Drilbur doesn't wall an awful lot of Pokemon, so it often finds it hard to switch in. If you can get it in against something it threatens, such as Magnemite, it can often force a switch, allowing Drilbur to set up, use Rapid Spin, or attack with Earthquake. Drilbur often works as a lead with Stealth Rock, and if you run Swords Dance it works extremely well against Dwebble leads.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate the removal of entry hazards like having Drilbur on a team. Examples include Larvesta and Flying-types like Fletchling. Drilbur likes Pokemon that can switch into Water- or Grass-type attacks, such as Foongus and Ferroseed. If you struggle with Sturdy + Berry Juice users, Drilbur is a good answer, particularly to Magnemite. Slow U-turn users such as defensive Mienfoo and Fletchling can help get Drilbur in safely so it can use Rapid Spin more easily.

Choice Scarf
##########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Poison Jab
move 4: Rapid Spin
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 212 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Earthquake is Drilbur's most powerful STAB attack and can hit Pokemon with Levitate thanks to Mold Breaker. Rock Slide is used to hit the Flying- and Bug-types which are immune to or resist Earthquake. Poison Jab, while situational, hits Grass-types for super effective damage, most notably Cottonee. While Rapid Spin is a bad move to be locked into, it allows Drilbur to remove entry hazards in a pinch.

Set Details
========

The EV spread provides as much power and Speed as possible, while a Jolly nature allows Drilbur to outspeed Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Bunnelby and Modest Choice Scarf Chinchou and to Speed tie with Jolly Choice Scarf Mienfoo and Jolly Choice Scarf Chinchou. An Adamant nature can be used, however, to have a much better chance of 2HKOing Mienfoo, Timburr, and Foongus after Stealth Rock. Choice Scarf allows Drilbur to outspeed Pokemon such as Gastly and Ponyta and KO them before they can attack. Mold Breaker is an excellent ability that allows Drilbur to hit Levitate users with Earthquake and OHKO Pokemon with Sturdy such as Tirtouga.

Usage Tips
========

Choice Scarf Drilbur fits best on teams looking for a fast Ground-type that can provide entry hazard removal if needed. Drilbur is a great late-game cleaner with Choice Scarf and Mold Breaker, so keeping it healthy until then can help you clean more easily. Once you have revealed Drilbur's Choice Scarf, your opponent might feel safe switching into a Flying-type on a predicted Earthquake. If you expect this, use Rock Slide as they switch. While Rapid Spin is a terrible move to be locked into, its ability to remove entry hazards can help in facilitating a sweep with Pokemon that dislike entry hazards, such as Tirtouga.

Team Options
========

Slow Pokemon that appreciate entry hazard removal such as Tirtouga and Magnemite make for good partners. Do note, however, that Drilbur should usually not be relied on as your only way to prevent or remove entry hazards for these Pokemon, as being locked into Rapid Spin is not ideal. Pokemon that set entry hazards such as Dwebble and Trubbish can help Drilbur net KOs, such as the OHKO on Cottonee with Poison Jab after Stealth Rock. Pokemon such as Fletchling, Vulpix, and Chinchou that can deal with Grass- and Flying-types can assist Drilbur in sweeping. In general, this set tends to work as more of a glue to teams that are having trouble with both faster threats and entry hazards.

Other Options
########

Sand Rush can be used with support from Hippopotas, but the nerf to sand really hurts the viability of this set. Drilbur can also manually set up sand to abuse Sand Rush. Poison Jab can be used to hit Fairy-types, particularly Cottonee, which is a big threat for Drilbur. A bulky EV spread can also be used to better take special attacks.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Grass-types**: Ferroseed, Lileep, Cottonee, Shroomish, and Foongus can switch in easily and take Drilbur on in most cases.

**Bulky Water-types**: Slowpoke and Frillish can easily take a hit and OHKO Drilbur with Surf or Scald.

**Faster Pokemon**: Staryu and Choice Scarf users can OHKO Drilbur because it's quite frail, and since it has no forms of recovery, it can be worn down into KO range easily.

**Burn**: Will-O-Wisp from Ghost-types that also spinblock is a nightmare for Drilbur, making Frillish a serious threat.
