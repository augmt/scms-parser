Overview
########

Timburr is an excellent Pokemon in the current LC metagame, capable of both dishing out damage and taking hits. With access to the newly buffed Knock Off and a resistance to Dark-type attacks, Timburr has only improved since the last generation. However, there are many other Fighting-type Pokemon in Little Cup that give Timburr competition for a spot on a team, but its relatively high bulk and access to priority in Mach Punch differentiates it from its competition.


Bulky Attacker
########
name: Bulky Attacker
move 1: Drain Punch
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Mach Punch
move 4: Bulk Up / Poison Jab
ability: Guts
item: Eviolite
evs: 76 HP / 196 Atk / 76 Def / 156 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

This set allows Timburr to switch into many dangerous threats, such as Pawniard, and strike back with Drain Punch to regain some of the HP it lost while switching in. Knock Off is a really nice move for Timburr as it threatens many of the Psychic- and Ghost-types that would otherwise give Timburr trouble switching in. Knock Off is also a highly spammable move because very few LC Pokemon appreciate having their item removed. Mach Punch is useful for picking off faster threats. The last slot is a decision between potentially sweeping an unprepared team and hitting the fairies that commonly switch into Timburr.

Set Details
========

Eviolite is the chosen item on this set, as it gives Timburr good bulk. Berry Juice is not as useful because Timburr can replenish its health with Drain Punch. The EV spread, coupled with an Impish nature, gives Timburr 25/21/18 defenses when factoring in Eviolite, while still allowing Timburr to pack a punch. Guts is the recommended ability for this set, as it allows Timburr to absorb status and beat defensive threats such as Misdreavus and Chinchou.

Usage Tips
========

Timburr is one of the best bulky pivots in the current metagame, as it can switch in on most neutral attacks, including any status inducing move that does not cause sleep,and then threaten the opponent with its good coverage. Timburr should use Knock Off liberally in the early-game, because very few Pokemon want to switch into Timburr and lose its item. Timburr is able to take some weaker hits due to its bulk, so it can work as a good lure for Pokemon such as Spritzee (if its eviolite has been knocked off). But if the opponent has a Pawniard or Carvanha, it is important to keep Timburr healthy so it is able to check them late-game. Thanks to Guts, Timburr can also be switched in on obvious status moves in order to power up its attacks.

Team Options
========

Archen likes to switch into Timburr, and a well-timed Knock Off paves the way for sweepers such as Scraggy and Murkrow late-game, making them good partners. Timburr can also take on Snover and Amaura thanks to Mach Punch, meaning it is a good option on a sun team or paired with Grass-type Pokemon such as Foongus. Timburr is also one of the best switch-ins to Porygon due to its typing, bulk, and Guts, so Pokemon like Chinchou appreciate Timburr's presence on a team. Setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Misdreavus appreciate Timburr softening up opposing defensive Pokemon with Knock Off. Pawniard is another good option forming a dual Knock Off core with Timburr, and Pawniard can also take on the Fairy-types that give Timburr trouble. A teammate that can handle Murkrow is also necessary for Timburr, Archen being one good option.

Other Options
########

Timburr has quite a few options that it can utilize, but they are generally not as effective as the standard set. There are a variety of coverage moves that could be used over Ice Punch, such as Thunder Punch to hit Mantyke or Stone Edge for Larvesta, but Poison Jab is usually the best option if you want more coverage, as it nails Spritzee. Iron Fist can be used over Guts if you want to boost Timburr's power right away, but this causes it to lose a lot of utility in status absorbing. Power-Up Punch can be used to boost its Attack, but it is inferior to Bulk Up and is usually a wasted turn due to its low power and Timburr's low Speed. Taunt can be used to prevent support Pokemon from using their support moves, but Timburr is generally too slow to pull it off.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Timburr has problems getting around Fairy-types such as Snubbull and Spritzee, as they resist most of Timburr's moves and can OHKO Timburr with their STAB Fairy attacks.

**Poison-types**: Poison-types such as Tentacool, Koffing, and Skrelp also give Timburr trouble due to their typing and decent bulk. Liquid Ooze on Tentacool also makes Drain Punch backfire on Timburr.

**Offensive Flying-types**: Mantyke, Murkrow, and Fletchling can all outspeed and OHKO Timburr, but all except Mantyke have trouble switching in. Mantyke can use Timburr as set-up bait to get off a Rain Dance and potentially sweep.
