Overview
########

The main reason to run Slugma over Ponyta, or any other Fire-type for that matter, is the fact that it has the advantage of a reliable recovery move. Slugma also has movepool advantages over the other Fire-types, including: Memento, Light Screen, Reflect, Lava Plume, and Earth Power. Slugma is also the only Memento user to not fear Pawniard because unlike Diglett or Cottonee, Slugma is not easily eliminated by Pawniard's priority Sucker Punch or Iron Head. However, even with this interesting movepool, Slugma finds itself being outclassed by Pokemon like Ponyta and Larvesta that not only have Flame Body, but also have higher Speed, comparable bulk, and a much greater offensive presence. Due to all these advantages that other Fire-types have over Slugma, it is very hard for it to find a spot on any serious team.

Status Spreader
########
name: Status Spreader
move 1: Recover
move 2: Fire Blast / Lava Plume
move 3: Earth Power / Acid Armor / Memento
move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Toxic / Memento
ability: Flame Body
item: Eviolite
evs: 196 HP / 196 Def / 116 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Recover keeps Slugma healthy enough to switch into physical attackers throughout the battle. Fire Blast is the suggested STAB move due to its ability to OHKO Eviolite Pawniard after Stealth Rock damage, but Lava Plume can be substituted for better accuracy and a higher chance to burn the target. Earth Power allows Slugma to hit common switch-ins like Chinchou and Tirtouga for super effective damage. Acid Armor allows you to set up on physically offensive Pokemon even further, and dares them to make contact with Slugma, which works very well with Will-O-Wisp and Toxic. Will-O-Wisp burns any target, regardless of whether contact is made or not. Toxic helps Slugma stall out Pokemon, while Earth Power hits Poison-types and Slugma's STAB move hits Steel-types, the Pokemon immune to Toxic. Memento can be used to give a team member a chance to set up.

Set Details
========

The provided EVs maximize Slugma's bulk while hitting Eviolite numbers. The Bold nature makes Slugma's Defense hit the Eviolite number 14. The EVs in HP hit a Stealth Rock number of 23, meaning Slugma can switch in times. Flame Body gives Slugma more chances to burn.

Usage Tips
========

Switch Slugma into physical attackers that make contact, like Mienfoo and Fletchling. Keep Slugma away from Timburr and Taillow because of Guts, though Taillow generally won't switch in for fear of an offensive move from Slugma. Do not use Memento on Pawniard because it will gain an x2 boost to its Attack stat thanks to Defiant; however, Fire Blast easily eliminates it provided Stealth Rock is present, while Will-O-Wisp severely cripples it.

Team Options
========

Lileep, Chespin, and Ferroseed are good partners to Slugma because they check or wall Water-types, which Slugma hates. Chespin also has an added bonus of countering Drilbur. An entry hazard remover is greatly appreciated by Slugma. Vullaby and Staryu are good choices because they are also good checks to Drilbur. Archen is also a good choice because it counters Taillow and checks Timburr. Croagunk, Spritzee, and Snubbull are also good team members because they all handle Timburr, while Snubbull and Croagunk can nail Munchlax with their super effective Fighting-type attacks.

Dual Screens
########
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Light Screen
move 2: Reflect / Will-O-Wisp
move 3: Memento
move 4: Lava Plume / Fire Blast
ability: Flame Body
item: Eviolite / Light Clay
evs: 196 HP / 196 Def / 116 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Memento, Reflect, and Light Screen are here to help a sweeper set up with ease. Recover can be used over Memento if you prefer for your Dual Screener to last longer. Lava Plume has a good chance to burn things, which is important for Slugma's support, but Fire Blast has more power. The main draw Fire Blast has over Lava Plume is that Fire Blast OHKOes Eviolite Pawniard after Stealth Rock damage. Lava Plume is the preferred STAB move on this set because it can burn foes since it is not using Will-O-Wisp. However, Will-O-Wisp can be used over Reflect.

Set Details
========

The given EVs give Slugma maximum bulk, with its Def bolstered by a Bold nature, and Special Defense hitting Eviolite numbers, and HP becoming a Stealth Rock number of 23. Flame Body gives Slugma more chances to burn foes that make contact. Eviolite gives Slugma more bulk, while Light Clay makes Screens last 3 turns longer.

Usage Tips
========

Switch into physical attackers who make contact, like Mienfoo or Fletchling, so you can burn them with Flame Body. Set up Screens and then use Memento, but do not Memento on Pawniard because you will give it an x2 boost to its Attack stat Thanks to Defiant. Fire Blast easily disposes of Pawniard, provided Stealth Rock is active. Slugma is one of the best Memento users due to opponents not wanting to risk switching in Pawniard on Slugma.

Team Options
========

Zigzagoon appreciates both Screens and Memento, which allows it to set up its Belly Drum easily. Other sweepers also enjoy this support,like Fletchling, Shell Smashers, and Timburr. An entry hazard remover like Vullaby, Drilbur, Archen, or Staryu is very appreciated by Slugma. Vullaby checks Drilbur, Archen counters Taillow and checks Timburr, while Drilbur and Staryu enjoy Slugma being able to counter Grass-types. Slugma can also absorb Will-O-Wisps for Drilbur, Vullaby, and Archen.

Other Options
########

An offensive Slugma set can be used using the ability Weak Armor with 196 EVs in both Special Attack and Speed, and then the rest of the EVs can go towards its bulk. The moves Recover, Fire Blast, Earth Power, Hidden Power Rock, and Self-Destruct are all useable on this set. Slugma has Guard Swap and Weak Armor, which could make a potentially fun set. With the use of Memento, you can make it even easier for teammates to sweep or set up. Ponyta and Vulpix are far superior offensive Pokemon overall due to their higher initial speed and offensive power.

Flamethrower can be used over both Lava Plume and Fire Blast; however, because it offers very little increased damage output from the former, you're better off sticking to the listed STAB moves. Self-Destruct can also be used on either of these sets, to provide damage before Slugma faints and also help a teammate set up, but Memento is generally a superior choice. Rock Tomb can also be used on either set for more support because it reduces the Speed of the target. Yawn can also be used to force switches and rack up entry hazard damage. Slugma also has access to Curse and Stockpile, but its lackluster Defense and Attack stats mean it can't use these moves effectively.

Checks & Counters
########

**Entry Hazards**: Slugma takes a large amount of damage just by switching into Stealth Rock and Spikes.

**Water-types**: Slugma is a huge lure for Water-types such as Chinchou, Shellos, or Staryu. These Pokemon don't mind its STAB moves, or burns, and they are all special hitters, so they don't make contact anyway.

**Ground-types**: Drilbur, Hippopotas, and Sandshrew all do heavy damage to Slugma with their STAB Earthquake. Hippopotas also has Whirlwind, so it can phaze out the Pokemon Slugma set up screens for. However, many Ground-types hate being burned.

**Rock-types**: Archen, Tirtouga, Dwebble, and other Rock-types can switch into Slugma and threaten it with their STAB moves; however, they all must be wary of switching into a Lava Plume or Will-O-Wisp due to the increased burn chance. Tirtouga must also be wary of switching into an Earth Power, and Dwebble also does not resist Slugma's Fire-type STAB attacks. Archen is immune to Earth Power and can smack Slugma with STAB Rock Slide or Earthquake, as both moves avoid Flame Body's burn chance.

**Munchlax**: Munchlax, especially the Berry Juice set, does not particularly like being burned, but it doesn't mind any attack Slugma can throw at it. Munchlax also threatens Slugma with a super effective Earthquake, or use Rest to heal the burn.

**Guts**: Timburr threatens Slugma by switching in on a Will-O-Wisp or Lava Plume and gaining a boosted Drain Punch or Knock Off to hit Slugma with. Though it cannot switch into Slugma's attacks, Taillow is another great user of Guts. Larvitar has Guts, super effective STAB moves, and Dragon Dance, which it can use to set up on Slugma.
