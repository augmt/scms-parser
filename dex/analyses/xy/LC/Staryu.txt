Overview
########

With its high Speed and phenomenal movepool, both offensively and defensively, Staryu is able to take advantage of its versatility to carve a niche on a variety of teams. Having access to key defensive moves such as the greatly sought-after Rapid Spin and a good defensive ability grants Staryu a veritable niche on slower teams, while Staryu's excellent coverage options in tandem with its good Special Attack allow it to completely flip its role to fit its team and function as a dangerous sweeper instead. However, Staryu is hindered by its frailty and lack of useful resistances as a defensive Pokemon, and it suffers from four-moveslot syndrome and being unable to easily break through one of the most prominent threats in the metagame, Chinchou. If these can be adequately dealt with, however, Staryu becomes a valuable asset to any team.


Bulky Rapid Spin
########
name: Bulky Rapid Spin
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Scald
move 3: Ice Beam / Psychic / Thunderbolt
move 4: Recover
ability: Natural Cure
item: Eviolite
evs: 116 HP / 156 Def / 236 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

A bulky set allows Staryu to take advantage of its niche as the only Rapid Spinner with reliable recovery in LC. Rapid Spin is a very useful move for teammates that are weak to entry hazards, while Scald is a reliable STAB move that carries a handy burn chance. Ice Beam, Psychic, and Thunderbolt are all coverage options; Ice Beam hits Pumpkaboo and Foongus, although both avoid the 2HKO, and allows Staryu to 2HKO Vullaby and usually OHKO Fletchling after Stealth Rock. Psychic hits Poison-types, most notably OHKOing Croagunk, as well as giving Staryu a way to hurt Guts Timburr without risking Scald burns, whereas Thunderbolt deals with opposing Water-types such as Staryu and Omanyte in addition to hitting Vullaby and Fletchling hard. Recover is necessary so Staryu can last throughout the match to use Rapid Spin and check certain threats. Hidden Power Fire can be used to 2HKO Ferroseed, but a spread of 116 HP / 156 Def / 40 SpA / 160 Spe should be used instead to accommodate for the loss in IVs; this prevents Staryu from outspeeding Gastly and Doduo, but Staryu will otherwise be able to function the same.

Set Details
========

The given HP and Defense EVs let Staryu usually avoid a 2HKO from Eviolite Drilbur's Earthquake, allowing it to spam Recover until it is ready to 2HKO with Scald, making Staryu one of LC's premier Drilbur checks. 19 Speed is hit to outspeed Gastly, Doduo, and Drilbur and possibly hit them with a coverage move. Eviolite is the item of choice so that Staryu can effectively act as a defensive Pokemon, and Natural Cure is defensive Staryu's most useful ability, allowing it to switch in on burns in particular without very detrimental effects and spin away Toxic Spikes without lasting repercussions.

Usage Tips
========

Staryu's primary purpose on a team is to use Rapid Spin, so try to get rid of bulkier Ghost-types such as Pumpkaboo before attempting to Rapid Spin. Of course, Staryu has other uses; don't be afraid to switch it in on Drilbur or any weaker physical attacker as long as you can come out on top afterwards. Keeping Staryu at full HP will allow it to check Fletchling if the appropriate coverage move is used, although this can be difficult given how Staryu is needed to switch into Stealth Rock. With that being said, avoid taking a Knock Off unless the situation absolutely calls for it, because Staryu is very frail without Eviolite.

Team Options
========

Staryu is a natural fit onto a variety of bulkier teams due to the invaluable support it provides with Rapid Spin. It is best paired with Fire- and Grass-type Pokemon to form a Fire / Water / Grass core, a combination that resists many important attacks and can be quite difficult to break. Bulky Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta are excellent partners because they not only appreciate Stealth Rock being removed from the field, but also possess good type synergy with Staryu, taking on Grass-type attacks aimed at it, most notably those from Pumpkaboo and Ferroseed. Eviolite Houndour in particular not only carries the aforementioned advantages, but is able to Pursuit trap Pumpkaboo. In return, Staryu deals with Drilbur. Bulky Grass-types such as Foongus, Ferroseed, Pumpkaboo, and Lileep are able to take on Chinchou, one of Staryu's most reliable counters, while also absorbing Grass- and Electric-type attacks in general; Staryu returns the favour by handling the Fire- and Ice-type attacks that plague these Grass-types. Outside of that, Flying-types such as Archen and Vullaby appreciate not having to switch into Stealth Rock to Defog, allowing them to take advantage of a free moveslot, although the compounded Electric-type weakness should promptly be covered. Most entry hazard setters, including the previously mentioned Ferroseed and Lileep, will enjoy having Staryu being used over Defoggers because they will not have to set up entry hazards again.


Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Hydro Pump / Surf
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Thunderbolt / Ice Beam
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Ice Beam
ability: Natural Cure / Analytic
item: Life Orb
evs: 200 SpA / 240 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

A more offensive set capitalizes on Staryu's excellent coverage and overall offensive potential. Hydro Pump is Staryu's primary STAB move and heavily damages everything it hits neutrally except for the bulkiest of specially defensive walls. Surf is generally the lesser option because Staryu needs all the raw power it can get, but unlike Hydro Pump, it is compatible with Analytic and has greater accuracy. Psychic 2HKOes Foongus, Skrelp, and most Fighting-types and OHKOes Croagunk as well as Trubbish if Stealth Rock is up. Thunderbolt heavily damages opposing Water- and Flying-types, while Ice Beam 2HKOes Pumpkaboo, Chespin, and Cottonee in addition to hitting Flying-types. Hidden Power Fire heavily damages Ferroseed and other Grass-types. Rapid Spin can be used for Staryu to act as a suicide spinner of sorts if entry hazards are particularly detrimental for a team; it helps that Ice Beam Life Orb Staryu is the only variant able to get through Pumpkaboo. Recover is an option, but Staryu's frailty will make it difficult to find opportunities to heal.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Special Attack and Speed for more sweeping potential; HP is not invested in so that Staryu can maintain a maximum HP of 19 and only lose one HP from Life Orb recoil instead of two. 19 Speed is useful to outspeed Gastly and Doduo while Speed tying with Ponyta and Abra. The given EVs take into account the drop in IVs from Hidden Power Fire, but if Hidden Power Fire is not used, then a spread of 76 Def / 196 SpA / 236 Spe would give Staryu a point in Defense at no cost. Life Orb is the best item for sweeping because it gives Staryu the increase in power it needs to obtain key KOs while still taking advantage of its excellent coverage. Natural Cure is the preferred ability because Analytic is incompatible with Hydro Pump, but Analytic is still an option to more heavily damage switch-ins.

Usage Tips
========

Staryu can act as a solid late-game win condition due to its immense Speed, power, and coverage. Of course, Life Orb Staryu is much frailer than other variants, so priority attacks and faster Pokemon should be paid more attention to.

Team Options
========

As with any offensive Pokemon, entry hazard support is greatly appreciated for Staryu to obtain key KOs; Ferroseed is an example of an entry hazard setter that has good type synergy with Staryu. Knock Off and Berry Juice + Thief users will aid Staryu in breaking through bulkier special walls it otherwise could not; similarly, Gothita is able to guarantee the removal of Eviolite from a single wall with Trick. Specific teammates to take on whichever Pokemon each individual Staryu set lacks coverage for would be helpful; for example, Hidden Power Fire Gothita is a good teammate for Staryu without Hidden Power Fire.


Offensive Rapid Spin
########
name: Offensive Rapid Spin
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Scald / Hydro Pump
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Recover / Psychic / Thunderbolt
ability: Natural Cure
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 36 HP / 200 SpA / 240 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

With greater offensive presence compared to the bulky Rapid Spin set, this set aims to better fit onto teams that cannot afford the defensive set's slight loss in momentum against certain team match-ups. Once again, Rapid Spin is hugely useful because of the utility it provides. Scald and Hydro Pump are both viable STAB moves depending on whether burn utility and accuracy or raw power is preferred; one advantage Hydro Pump has is a significantly greater chance to OHKO Drilbur. Ice Beam 2HKOes physically defensive Pumpkaboo and OHKOes Fletchling after Stealth Rock damage in addition to damaging other Grass- and Flying-types. Recover is a good option if Eviolite is used to increase Staryu's longevity; alternatively, Psychic is a solid choice to hit a variety of Poison-types. Thunderbolt hits opposing Water-types, and Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Ferroseed; the given EVs allow for the drop in IVs resulting from Hidden Power Fire.

Set Details
========

The given EVs and nature maximize offensive presence and revenge killing potential. Eviolite is the primary item of choice to survive key OHKOs and 2HKOs, but Berry Juice negates the need to run Recover, allowing Staryu to focus more on attacking. Natural Cure allows Staryu to switch in on Will-O-Wisp and Toxic Spikes without lasting repercussions, and Analytic is incompatible with Rapid Spin anyway.

Usage Tips
========

Staryu's primary purpose is to use Rapid Spin, but this Staryu variant can also act as a win condition against specific teams due to its high Speed and decent power. However, specially defensive Pumpkaboo is still problematic for Staryu as a spinner.

Team Options
========

This Staryu set is better designed to fit onto hyper offensive teams than the bulky Rapid Spin set is; one of its advantages over Drilbur is its better match-up against most entry hazard setters. Fire-types such as Ponyta, Vulpix, Larvesta, and Darumaka possess good type synergy with Staryu and will appreciate Stealth Rock being removed from the field; Houndour can once again take this one step further by Pursuit trapping troublesome Pumpkaboo. Pursuit trappers in general, including Pawniard and Stunky, make for decent teammates for Pumpkaboo alone. A teammate to handle Chinchou, such as Foongus or Diglett, will also benefit Staryu. Staryu is a good teammate for entry hazard setters instead of a Defog user because, unlike Defog, Rapid Spin does not remove entry hazards on the opponent's side; Archen and Vullaby will gain a free moveslot that is usually dedicated to Defog.


Other Options
########

Staryu's enormous movepool grants it a variety of options if a specific team calls for them, but the moves listed in the main sets tend to be the most consistently useful. Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit offensive Chinchou and Wooper and allows Staryu to better check Omanyte and Tirtouga. Similarly, Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit offensive Chinchou and Magnemite; however, it doesn't do much else, and offensive sets can already KO Magnemite with Hydro Pump. Dazzling Gleam simultaneously hits Vullaby and Fighting-types, but it is quite weak, and Staryu's other coverage options are usually more useful; Power Gem and Flash Cannon are even more niche coverage options. Staryu is one of the better dual screens setters due to its high Speed. Thunder Wave can be used for utility, but many Staryu switch-ins, such as Chinchou and Ferroseed, do not mind it very much. A Gravity set with inaccurate but powerful moves such as Hydro Pump, Blizzard, and Thunder, can be used. Staryu also makes for an effective rain setter because of its high Speed and ability to take advantage of the rain itself with boosted STAB attacks and a perfectly accurate Thunder. Rest can be used in tandem with Natural Cure to instantly heal Staryu to full health and allow it to come back in status-free after switching out, but Recover is the better option because it grants Staryu staying power. Substitute helps to ease prediction on offensive sets, but Staryu already struggles to fit into four moves all the coverage moves it needs.


Checks & Counters
########

**Chinchou:** Chinchou resists Water-type attacks, and bulkier sets can easily withstand most of Staryu's coverage moves, although Hidden Power Grass or Ground from Life Orb Staryu can do a fair amount of damage.

**Bulky Grass-types:** If Staryu does not carry the appropriate coverage move to KO them, Ferroseed, Foongus, Pumpkaboo, and other bulky Grass-types will be able to force Staryu out; additionally, Pumpkaboo is able to block Rapid Spin.

**Bulky Ghost-types:** If Staryu lacks a super effective coverage move, Pumpkaboo and Frillish can not only wall Staryu, but also prevent it from using Rapid Spin.

**Special walls:** Extremely specially bulky Pokemon that can withstand Hydro Pump, especially those that can heal off burns, will be able to wall Staryu, stall it out, or KO it; examples of these include RestTalk Munchlax and specially defensive Spritzee.
