Overview
########

Staryu has a few unique attributes that give it a pretty large niche in Little Cup. First off, it's one of the few viable users of Rapid Spin. In XY, Rapid Spin users face more competition due to the new Defog mechanics, but Rapid Spin is still a great choice, especially for teams that use hazards themselves. Staryu is also one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, hitting 19 Speed. It also has access to a good range of special coverage moves in Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, making it an offensive threat as well. However, Staryu has a few negative traits as well. It's quite frail, especially when it doesn't carry an Eviolite, and it has no way to hit the common Chinchou for any sort of large damage.

Rapid Spin
########
name: Rapid Spin
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Hydro Pump / Scald
move 3: Ice Beam / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Recover / Thunderbolt
ability: Natural Cure
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 36 HP / 200 SpA / 240 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

This set's primary role is to remove hazards with Rapid Spin, therefore it is unquestionable that Rapid Spin is the most important move. Hydro Pump is the STAB move of choice, giving Staryu a very powerful move to use. Scald is a weaker alternative STAB move, but can be useful to possibly burn the opponent. The third slot is dedicated to hitting Grass-types. Ice Beam is the preferred and more powerful option. It hits Lileep, which can easily switch in on Staryu and reset Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Fire 2HKOes Ferroseed, which can also switch in on Staryu and reset hazards, but it is incredibly weak otherwise. Recover is a fantastic move on Staryu, allowing it to heal itself, and is therefore able to switch in more and remove hazards throughout the match. However, Thunderbolt is a viable alternative to hit opposing Water-types. This is particularly useful for Frillish, which would otherwise be able to block Rapid Spin.

Set Details
========

Staryu's EV spread is relatively simple. Maximizing Speed is necessary to hit 19 Speed, which is particularly notable for speed-tying with the likes of Abra. Maximum Special Attack investment allows Staryu to hit harder. The rest of the EVs are added to HP, slightly adding to its bulk. If Recover is chosen, Staryu is best played with an Eviolite, which boosts both defenses up to 18. If you choose not to run Recover, Berry Juice is preferred to aid Staryu's longevity.

Usage Tips
========

Since Staryu's primary role is spinning, it should be kept healthy so it can remove hazards throughout the match. If you predict a Ghost-type switch-in, Hydro Pump or Scald should be the go-to moves. It allows Staryu to severely damage them, or possibly burn them if Scald is used, which will wear them down quicker. This allows Staryu to spin more easily. Staryu finds it very easy to switch into Fire-types or weak walls, such as Slowpoke and Spritzee. It also doesn't mind switching into Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, thanks to its ability Natural Cure.

Team Options
========

If anything on your team requires Rapid Spin support, it is a very good idea to consider Staryu. This includes Pokemon with the Sturdy ability, or Stealth Rock weak Pokemon, such as Fire- or Flying-types. Since Staryu has no way of significantly damaging Chinchou, partners that can switch into it are appreciated. Lileep, Ferroseed and other Grass-types are good teammates for this role, as well as a Chinchou of your own. Staryu also likes teammates that can switch into Grass-types. Fighting-types can easily switch into Lileep and Ferroseed and Fire-types can switch into all Grass-types apart from Lileep. Fire-types, Larvesta especially, also appreciate Staryu's Rapid Spin support. Finally, Pursuit users can remove Ghost-types to make Staryu's job easier. Pawniard, Stunky, and Houndour can all do this. Houndour also likes Staryu's Rapid Spin support and can switch into Grass-types.

Life Orb Attacker
########
name: Life Orb Attacker
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Grass / Rapid Spin
ability: Natural Cure
item: Life Orb
evs: 200 SpA / 240 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Hydro Pump is the STAB move of choice for this set, hitting extremely hard with a Life Orb. Ice Beam 2HKOes most Grass-types, including Lileep, and only misses out on Ferrroseed. It also deals good damage to Dragon-types, although those are rare. Thunderbolt is Staryu's best option against opposing Water-types, excluding Chinchou. Ferroseed is 2HKOed by Hidden Power Fire, and 2HKOed by a combination of Hydro Pump and Hidden Power Fire after Stealth Rock damage. However, aside from hitting Ferroseed, this move is extremely weak. Hidden Power Grass has a small chance to 2HKO RestTalk Chinchou after Stealth Rock, and always 2HKOes it after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. However, similarly to Hidden Power Fire, this move is almost useless aside from hitting Chinchou. Rapid Spin is a final option if your team desperately needs it, making Staryu a very offensive spinner.

Set Details
========

As an offensive Pokemon, Life Orb Staryu's priority is to maximize both Special Attack and Speed. It should not invest in HP as that would mean it takes 2 HP recoil instead of 1 HP. If you're not using Hidden Power, you should reduce the Special Attack and Speed EVs to 196 and 236, respectively, and add 76 EVs into Defense to help Staryu take priority attacks a bit better. Natural Cure is a fantastic ability for offensive Staryu as this means paralysis will only stop it temporarily.

Usage Tips
========

Because Staryu is reasonably frail, it can't switch in very well. Once Staryu is in, however, its primary function is to be a wallbreaker, using its powerful Hydro Pump. The coverage moves should be used for predicting switch-ins, allowing Staryu to 2HKO Pokemon such as Lileep with Ice Beam or Chinchou with Hidden Power Grass. Because of Staryu's high Speed, it can also be saved to clean up late game, once the opposing team is weakened.

Team Options
========

Staryu really appreciates hazard support to help it wear down the opposing team. Dwebble and Ferroseed have access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock, the latter also helping against Chinchou and other Water-types. Grass-types, such as Foongus and Lileep, are also appreciated to switch into Water-types. Lileep can also set up Stealth Rock for Staryu. Fire- and Flying-types make good teammates, as they can switch into the Grass-types which give Staryu some trouble. Both of these types will also welcome Staryu's ability to remove hazards from the field with Rapid Spin.

Other Options
########

Staryu makes a decent user of Rain Dance due to its high Speed, Water-type STAB, and access to Thunder, which becomes 100% accurate in rain. As for other offensive moves Staryu can use, Blizzard is an option if you decide to pair Staryu with Snover, but its accuracy is otherwise disappointing. Psychic is a good option, hitting Fighting-types super effectively, particularly Croagunk, who is immune to Water-type moves. Surf can be used, having more accuracy than Hydro Pump and more power than Scald, but it's generally inferior to the other two STAB moves. Staryu can support its team with Reflect and Light Screen and makes an okay user of the moves due to its Speed. Reflect Type is a very interesting move which Staryu can use. With it, it can change itself into a Grass-type to resist their attacks and then proceed to hit them with Ice Beam. It can do the same against Electric-types excluding Chinchou, who will usually beat it regardless. Analytic can allow Staryu to hit switch-ins harder, but it's illegal when paired with Hydro Pump or Rapid Spin, and it's often not very useful as Staryu outspeeds most Pokemon. Finally, Rest can be used to fully heal Staryu when paired with Natural Cure, but it's usually better to use Recover.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Staryu struggles against all Grass-types, particularly Ferroseed, Snover, and Lileep. It needs to run Hidden Power Fire to hit the former two, and it cannot 2HKO Lileep with Ice Beam unless it uses a Life Orb. Cottonee and Foongus also make pretty good counters to Staryu, but both are 2HKOed by Ice Beam on the switch.

**Electric-types**: Chinchou completely walls any set that Staryu can run, even Hidden Power Grass with a Life Orb, as it doesn't 2HKO bulky Chinchou without hazard support. Magnemite has Sturdy and can OHKO Staryu, and can run a Choice Scarf to outspeed it. Elekid and Voltorb also outspeed and OHKO Staryu.

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Munchlax, Lickitung, and Porygon all avoid the 2HKO from Staryu and can easily recover the damage. Other bulky Pokemon such as Spritzee, Vullaby, and Tentacool can also avoid a 2HKO from Staryu, unless it runs Life Orb.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types can prevent Staryu from removing hazards, which is often why it's chosen for teams. Frillish is perhaps the best spinblocker, avoiding the 2HKO from Thunderbolt, whilst it can keep using Recover to eventually activate Cursed Body.

**Set-up Sweepers**: Due to Staryu's lack of offensive pressure if it isn't running a Life Orb, set-up sweepers such as Scraggy and Timburr often have an easy time setting up on Staryu unless it carries a super effective move.
