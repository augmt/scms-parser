Overview
########

With a massive Special Attack stat of 90 and access Shell Smash, Omanyte is one of the best special setup sweepers in Little Cup. Omanyte separates itself from Clamperl with its Rock typing, which prevents being revenge killed by Fletchling, at the cost of it being weak to Fighting-type priority. Omanyte also has unique coverage in Earth Power, which gives it the ability to get past Chinchou and Tentacool. While many teams don't carry a Flying- or Fire-type for Omanyte to set up on, its great Defense stat also enables it to set up on certain physical attackers. Omanyte can also utilize this great Defense in a support set, as it has access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes.

Shell Smash
########
name: Shell Smash
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Surf / Hydro Pump
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Ice Beam
ability: Shell Armor
item: Eviolite
evs: 76 HP / 196 SpA / 236 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Shell Smash boosts Omanyte's Special Attack and Speed to obscene levels, allowing it to pull of a late-game sweep. Surf is Omanyte's STAB move of choice, hitting hard from its boosted Special Attack. However, Hydro Pump is an option, guaranteeing an OHKO on Timburr, Scraggy, and Berry Juice Wynaut. Earth Power OHKOes Chinchou and Tentacool, giving Omanyte a niche over other special setup sweepers. Finally, Ice Beam rounds off the set, hitting all Grass-types, except for Ferroseed, for super effective damage. If Ferroseed does cause you trouble, you can use Hidden Power Fire over Ice Beam, but then Lileep, Foongus, and Cottonee can all avoid getting OHKOed.



Set Details
========

Shell Armor is Omanyte's preferred ability because it prevents critical hits from interfering with its setup. Weak Armor is redundant with Shell Smash, as Omanyte is already boosting its Speed, while Swift Swim isn't advised because rain is uncommon. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed, with the remaining EVs put in HP, optimizes Omanyte's sweeping potential. Modest gives Omanyte maximum power and is the preferred nature. Eviolite gives Omanyte plenty of bulk to help it to set up safely.

Usage Tips
========

Omanyte should be used late-game and set up when all of its checks and counters are sufficiently weakened. Due to its typing, Omanyte can easily set up on Flying-types such as Fletchling, Taillow, and Vullaby. Omanyte can also set up on Fire-types and physical attackers, excluding Fighting-types. Thanks to its substantial physical bulk, Omanyte can survive hits from super effective moves that don't have STAB, such as Wild Charge from Ponyta or Drain Punch from Trubbish. Before attempting to sweep, Omanyte should wait for the removal of Cottonee, Timburr, Croagunk, Ferroseed, Munchlax, and Sucker Punch users. Cottonee can stop Omanyte with priority Encore or Stun Spore, Timburr and Croagunk have super effective STAB priority, and Sucker Punch users can generally hit Omanyte hard at -1 Defense. Ferroseed and Munchlax can take any hit from Omanyte and KO it back. Omanyte also requires some bulkier Pokemon, such as Porygon and Mienfoo, to be weakened slightly before attempting to sweep. Entry hazards and Knock Off support both help with this.

Team Options
========

Omanyte appreciates support in the form of lures for the Pokemon it needs removed. An unexpected Hidden Power Fire from a Water-type can catch Ferroseed off-guard and Pawniard can often be lured into Hidden Power Fighting from the likes of Cottonee or Foongus. Knock Off support is fantastic for weakening the bulkier Pokemon of Little Cup. Pawniard is a fantastic choice for this, as it can remove Eviolites from Omanyte's Fighting-type counters. Fighting-types are also good users of Knock Off and can sometimes surprise Cottonee with Poison Jab. Entry hazards are also useful against Pokemon with the ability Sturdy and specially bulky Pokemon such as Lileep. Support Tirtouga can set up Stealth Rock and use Knock Off on their shared counters. Mid-game sweepers and wallbreakers often help to punch holes in the opposing team; Taillow is a fantastic example of this. Finally, Cottonee is a great support Pokemon that can use Memento to help Omanyte set up.

Utility
########
name: Utility
move 1: Toxic Spikes / Stealth Rock
move 2: Spikes / Stealth Rock
move 3: Scald
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Shell Armor
item: Eviolite
evs: 156 HP / 116 Def / 236 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Access to all entry hazard moves besides Sticky Web makes Omanyte a viable support Pokemon. Despite lacking Solid Rock, having Spikes and Toxic Spikes lets Omanyte fill a niche that Tirtouga cannot. Both Spikes and Toxic Spikes are fantastic moves, though Stealth Rock can be used over either if your team lacks it. Scald is Omanyte's best STAB option, granting it the chance to burn physical attackers such as Mienfoo and Scraggy. Finally, Knock Off rounds out the set, helping Omanyte further support the rest of its team.

Set Details
========

The EVs and nature give Omanyte defensive stats of 22 HP / 18 Def / 16 SpD, which Eviolite boosts to 22 / 27 / 24. EVs are invested mainly into Special Defense, as Omanyte's Defense is already so high. This lets Omanyte function as a mixed wall to Flying-types, allowing it to take on Choice Specs Taillow as well as Fletchling, Doduo, and physical Taillow. Eviolite is the obvious item choice to help Omanyte take hits.

Usage Tips
========

Omanyte is a fantastic wall against Flying-types and can easily switch into them to set up entry hazards. Omanyte can also lead if you want to set up hazards early. Once hazards are set up, Omanyte should be preserved to give you a good switch-in to Flying-types late-game.

Team Options
========

Hazard-setting Omanyte apreciates Ghost-type teammates to block Rapid Spin, and Pawniard to take advantage of Defog. Omanyte also needs switch-ins to Grass- and Fighting-types. Flying- and Fire-types such as Vullaby, Fletchling, Ponyta, and Larvesta are all fantastic at doing this. Poison- and Fairy-types can also switch into Fighting-types for Omanyte. Fighting-types make good teammates as well, as they appreciate a Pokemon that can switch into Flying-types for them. Finally, many late-game sweepers, such as Scraggy and Fletchling, like the entry hazard and Knock Off support that Omanyte provides.

Other Options
########

Ancient Power is Omanyte's best Rock-type STAB move, but the low Base Power often makes another coverage move superior. Rain Dance and Swift Swim can be used, but this is usually outclassed by a Shell Smash set. Substitute is an option over a coverage move to help Omanyte avoid Sucker Punch, but the coverage it loses is usually more valuable. Weak Armor allows Omanyte to either set up Spikes faster or switch into physical threats and attempt to sweep without first using Shell Smash. However, Omanyte is much easier to wall without a Shell Smash boost to Special Attack, and after a Shell Smash, Weak Armor's boost to Speed is mostly redundant. Spikes and Scald can be used alongside RestTalk to give support Omanyte some sort of recovery. Finally, Haze can be used over Knock Off in the support set to remove stat boosts from opposing sweepers.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Due to its typing, Grass-types make the best counters to Omanyte. Ferroseed in particular can survive any hit and OHKO Omanyte back, while Cottone has priority Encore to stop it in its tracks.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types can also hit Omanyte super effectively, with Timburr and Croagunk possessing priority moves to revenge kill the Shell Smash set. Mienfoo can use Taunt to completely shut down the defensive set.

**Specially Bulky Pokemon**: Munchlax and Porygon can both take a hit from Omanyte at full health and can either OHKO back or paralyze it.

**Priority and Faster Choice Scarf Pokemon**: The Shell Smash set is prone to being revenge killed by faster Choice Scarf users or priority users such as Pawniard.
