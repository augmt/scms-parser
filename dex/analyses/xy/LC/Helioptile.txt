Overview
########
Due to its ability Solar Power, Helioptile hits an incredible 24 Special Attack in the sun with maximum investment. Combined with its unique Electric / Normal typing, it fills a niche no other Pokemon can. Helioptile resists Flying-type attacks from threats such as Fletchling and is immune to Ghost-type attacks from threats such as Gastly. With its STAB Volt Switch, Helioptile becomes an asset to sun teams, covering up common Flying-type weaknesses and pivoting right back out again.

However, its Normal typing, while somewhat a blessing, is also a curse, as it leaves Helioptile susceptible to Fighting-types which are rampant in the metagame. It has bad defenses and a limited offensive movepool, despite a great Special Attack. On top of that, it is completely dependent on the sun. Without it, it's harshly outclassed by Chinchou.

Moves
========
Volt Switch helps keep momentum in and out of sun. It can also help to safely bring in Chlorophyll users to sweep or Vulpix to set up sun. Thunderbolt is Helioptile's strongest attack and gives it a chance to sweep when the opponent is weakened. Dark Pulse is Helioptile's best coverage move, hitting Ghost-types for super effective damage. Hidden Power Ground and Hidden Power Grass give Helioptile a way to hit Chinchou, which would otherwise wall this set, super effectively. Hidden Power Ground hits Magnemite as well, but Hidden Power Grass hits Ground-types such as Drilbur. Hidden Power Fire gives Helioptile nearly perfect coverage, with only Deino resisting every attack. It is further boosted by sun, which is essential given its low Base Power, and hits Grass-types especially hard.

Set Details
========
This set functions best as an early game scout and momentum-keeper and as a late-game sweeper and revenge killer. Although Helioptile has decent Speed already, with a Choice Scarf, Helioptile outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame. It also doesn't mind being locked into a move much because of Volt Switch and its lack of good secondary options. The listed EV spread maximizes Special Attack and Speed. The remaining EVs are used to boost Helioptile's defenses. A Modest nature is recommended because Helioptile needs all the extra power it can get, but with a Timid nature, Helioptile outspeeds +1 Speed Adamant Carvanha. Between its poor defenses and Solar Power recoil, Helioptile can rarely afford to take a hit, so Berry Juice can be used instead to improve Helioptile's ability to switch into Flying-type moves.

Usage Tips
========
This set doesn't hit as hard as some other sun abusers, so recklessly using Thunderbolt at the start of the battle is inadvisable. That being said, Helioptile is best used early-game to deal chunks of damage while maintaining momentum and scouting out specific counters. It can be difficult to safely switch Helioptile in, but by making use of its immunities to Thunder Wave and Ghost-type moves, Helioptile can get a free switch. Helioptile is weak without the sun. As such, saving it until later in the game when the sun can be dependably set can give it a chance to deal severe damage to the opposing team. Bear in mind that Choice Scarf allows Helioptile to outspeed otherwise faster threats such as Ponyta.

Team Options
========
Vulpix, Larvesta, and Ponyta are good teammates, as they can set up sun for Helioptile and burn common Fighting-types. Chlorophyll users such as Oddish, Bulbasaur, and Bellsprout appreciate Helioptile's ability to threaten Fletchling and Vullaby. Knock Off support gives Helioptile a chance to sweep. Mienfoo is always a good option and forms a VoltTurn core with Helioptile. Vullaby is another fantastic choice, as it can switch into the Ground-type attacks that threaten Helioptile. Vullaby can also use STAB Flying-type attacks to threaten Timburr and Croagunk, U-turn to form a VoltTurn core with Helioptile, or Defog to eliminate Stealth Rock for Vulpix and Fire-type sun abusers. Archen has an immunity to Ground-type attacks, can use Defog to remove Stealth Rock for your team's Fire-types, carries Stealth Rock, which can help wear down opposing Flying-types, and can also use Knock Off and U-turn. Also, with Archen as a teammate, there is less pressure on Helioptile to take care of Fletchling.

Other Options
########
Life Orb is an option to improve Helioptile's damage output, but Helioptile doesn't appreciate the extra recoil damage and lack of Speed. Surf is unfortunately weakened by sun, but is a good secondary option outside of it. Helioptile gets another solid ability in Dry Skin, which allows it to switch into Water-type attacks and threaten with STAB Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, but Dry Skin sets are mostly outclassed by Chinchou. Helioptile also gets U-turn, which works against Ground-types and Chinchou. Parabolic Charge is basically an Electric-type Giga Drain that could theoretically help offset Solar Power recoil, but it's far too weak to be effective. Helioptile is the only Little Cup Electric-type to get Sandstorm, which could potentially be useful as Helioptile threatens Water-types, which are common threats to sand teams. Helioptile also gets Sand Veil, which could be useful on a sandstorm set or alongside Hippopotas. It gets two decent status moves in Glare and Toxic, but because of its poor defenses, Helioptile needs to spend most turns attacking. It gets some other moves such as Agility, Charge Beam, Rain Dance, and Thunder, but all of these moves are better used by Pokemon like Chinchou. Helioptile also has some decent physical moves such as Wild Charge, Rock Slide, and Dragon Tail, but is hampered by its horrible Attack. Helioptile has many possible options, but most of them are not viable due to its bad defenses, poor Speed, and Special Attack that is entirely dependent on the sun.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ground-types**: Ground-types can switch in to prevent Helioptile from using Volt Switch. Diglett in particular can trap and KO Helioptile as well as Vulpix, which is an important Pokemon on most sun teams.

**Chinchou**: Not only does Chinchou outclass Helioptile, Chinchou also walls it unless it carries Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Ground. Even then, Chinchou's special bulk can be a problem to get through.

**Lightning Rod**: Lightning Rod users such as Goldeen, Blitzle, and Electrike can all switch in on Helioptile's STAB moves and pick up a Special Attack boost.

**Bulky Normal-types**: Munchlax, Lickitung, and Porygon can take any attack from Helioptile with relative ease and can often deal significant damage back due to Helioptile's poor defenses.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types resist Volt Switch and Thunderbolt, but must be wary of Hidden Power Fire. Snover gets a special mention, as it gets rid of the sun. Foongus, which can switch in repeatedly thanks to Regenerator, is another notable Grass-type that is a huge threat to Helioptile.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types can KO Helioptile easily with STAB Fighting-type moves, although none of them enjoy switching into STAB Thunderbolt in sun. Timburr and Croagunk deserve special mentions because they can switch in and hit with priority moves Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, respectively.

**Priority Attacks**: Anything with strong priority attacks can deal a good chunk of damage to Helioptile before even taking a hit back. As Helioptile can't take many hits and takes damage from Solar Power each turn, these moves can be a serious problem for Helioptile.
