Overview
########

The first things that stick out about Krabby are its exceptionally high Attack and Defense. Its Attack stat is one of the highest in the tier, only falling behind Archen and Cranidos. It also has access to Swords Dance and Agility, two excellent boosting moves that allow Krabby to easily sweep unsuspecting teams with its wide coverage. Some of Krabby's downsides, however, are its low Special Defense and HP, making it unable to go toe to toe with most special attackers. Ferroseed and most other Grass-types in Little Cup can easily switch in on any of Krabby's moves, bar Superpower, and proceed to set up entry hazards or afflict it with a status ailment.

Boosting Sweeper
########
name: Boosting Sweeper
move 1: Agility
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Crabhammer
move 4: Knock Off / Return
ability: Hyper Cutter
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 116 HP / 236 Atk / 36 Def / 76 SpD / 36 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

After an Agility, Krabby can outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the tier as well as common Choice Scarf users. Crabhammer is Krabby's only physical STAB move and hits everything that doesn't resist it for a solid chunk of damage, while its only downside is the 90% accuracy. Knock Off can be used to cripple opposing walls and hit Slowpoke, Frillish, and Ferroseed, while Return has more Base Power and can hit anything, with the exception of Rock- and Steel-types. Hyper Cutter is the preferred ability, as it allows Krabby to break through Snubbull and switch into a nicely predicted Memento unscathed.

Set Details
========

The given EVs allow Krabby to outspeed most common Choice Scarf users after an Agility, and while 116 Speed can be beneficial to outspeed Choice Scarf Mienfoo and Chinchou, bulk is generally better. 12 Speed, after an Agility boost, lets Krabby outspeed the common Shell Smash Tirtouga. Eviolite is the preferred item so that Krabby can set up on opposing Pokemon that could otherwise threaten it with an OHKO; however, Berry Juice can be used against weaker Pokemon to ensure some recovery. If you decide to use Berry Juice, keep in mind that Krabby will most likely get KOed by many special moves, especially super effective ones, rendering the item useless. An Adamant nature gives Krabby more power, and there are no notable Pokemon that can hit 30 Speed and threaten Krabby.


Usage Tips
========

Switch into something that Krabby can reliably check and proceed to set up either Swords Dance or Agility as they switch out. Swords Dance allows Krabby to power through walls with ease, while Agility is more useful for dealing with faster threats. Krabby is most successful when the opponent's major priority users and bulky Grass-types have fainted, as Krabby lacks priority moves itself and has no reliable way to hit Pokemon such as Foongus and Ferroseed.

Team options
========

Krabby really appreciates entry hazard support so that can it power through bulkier Pokemon. It also appreciates Defog or Rapid Spin support so that it can reliably take a hit while setting up. Grass-type Pokemon make great partners due to their key resistances to Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Krabby; Ferroseed is a notable choice because it can also lay down hazard support. Chinchou can also absorb Electric-type attacks, while Sap Sipper users, such as Deerling and Skiddo, can benefit from Grass-type attacks.


Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Crabhammer
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Superpower / Brick Break
move 4: Return
ability: Hyper Cutter
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 36 HP / 236 Atk / 36 Def / 196 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Crabhammer is Krabby's main STAB move and is usually the prime option when revenge killing an opponent's Pokemon. Knock Off allows Krabby to severely cripple bulky Pokemon. Superpower is Krabby's best option to deal with Pawniard and Ferroseed, which can hit it hard and remove its Choice Scarf or otherwise completely wall it, respectively. Return is a nice, neutral-coverage move, and without it, Krabby is walled by Dry Skin Croagunk.


Set Details
========

These EVs allow Krabby to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and revenge kill successfully. An Adamant nature can be used if you crave more power, but this causes Krabby to Speed tie with a lot of common threats. A Jolly nature will outspeed common Choice Scarf Pokemon and Scraggy after a Dragon Dance, but you forgo the added power which can make a big difference when it comes to KOing an opposing Pokemon.

Usage Tips
========

Krabby is a great revenge killer and is best utilized in the mid- and late-game once the opponent's team is weakened, so it is guaranteed some KOs and does not have to worry about retaliation. Unfortunately, Krabby has no priority moves, so removing priority users before attempt to KO or sweep is a must. Krabby also lacks a pivot move, such as U-turn, and an item-switching move, such as Trick, which many other Choice Scarf users have access to, making it even more important that Krabby is used as a revenge killer or to clean up in the late-game. Also, do not switch into any special moves, especially Grass- and Electric-type attacks, because Krabby has a subpar Special Defense stat and an average HP stat and will likely be OHKOed.

Team Options
========

Krabby appreciates hazard support as it makes it easier to power through bulkier Pokemon. Defog or Rapid Spin support is also really helpful, as it helps Krabby retain HP so that it can take a hit while setting up. Grass-type Pokemon make great partners due to their key resistances to Electric- and Grass-type attacks; Ferroseed is especially notable, because it can also provide hazard support. Chinchou can also absorb Electric-type attacks. Krabby also benefits from a teammate that can handle common priority users, such as Fletchling and Spritzee, as priority can interfere with its sweeping.

Other Options
########

A Life Orb set can be viable because it doesn't require any setup and excels at wallbreaking, but it lacks the Speed provided by Agility or Choice Scarf. Rock Slide can be used on either set in conjunction with Sheer Force; however, this isn't very practical due to Rock Slide being the only notable physical move that Sheer Force benefits from. If you do decide to use Sheer Force and Rock Slide, replace Return with Body Slam for the additional power. X-Scissor is a nice coverage move, but most of the Grass-type Pokemon in Little Cup are hit neutrally by Bug-type attacks due to their secondary typing.


Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Krabby is walled by all of the common Grass-types in Little Cup, notably Cottonee, which can Encore Krabby's boosting moves, and Ferroseed, which is incredibly difficult for Krabby to break through, even with Superpower.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types, particularly Chinchou due to its Water-type resistance, can OHKO Krabby with a STAB move. Magnemite can also switch into any move but Knock Off, providing it still has Sturdy intact.

**Status**: Status moves also severely hinder Krabby's capabilities as a sweeper and wallbreaker. Burn and paralysis cripple it and even Toxic damage can be bothersome when trying to set up two moves and then sweep.

**Frillish and Slowpoke**: Frillish and Slowpoke are fantastic counters to any Krabby not running Knock Off, and they can easily burn it or paralyze it, respectively.

**Croagunk**: Croagunk can switch into anything, only taking neutral damage from Return or Body Slam.
