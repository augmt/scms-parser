Overview
########

Chespin boasts a unique ability in Bulletproof, which gives it an immunity to all 'ball' and 'bomb' moves, including Sludge Bomb and Shadow Ball. This allows Chespin to wall Pokemon that rely on such moves, such as Foongus and Gastly. Chespin's typing gives it useful resistances to common Water-, Ground-, and Electric-type attacks. Its access to Spikes, backed by its respectable bulk with Eviolite, enables it to be a reliable entry hazard setter. Chespin has reliable recovery in Synthesis, which increases its longevity. The icing on the cake is Chespin's access to reliable and somewhat strong STAB options, which not all Pokemon have the luxury of. However, Chespin's typing also leaves it with many common weaknesses to Flying-, Fire-, and Ice-type attacks. Fletchling is very common as well, and Chespin can't stand up to it. Chespin is also very easy to set up on should it lack Roar or Taunt because of how passive it is. It has a massive case of four-moveslot syndrome, which severely limits it, and its Speed lets it down a lot, as it will usually be taking a hit before it can do anything in return. Chespin also receives competition from other Grass-types in the tier such as Cottonee and Foongus.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Synthesis
move 3: Seed Bomb
move 4: Rock Slide
ability: Bulletproof
item: Eviolite
evs: 228 HP / 28 Atk / 236 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Bulk Up allows Chespin to differentiate itself from other defensive Pokemon by letting it set up on many Pokemon and slowly wear them down. Bulk Up enables Chespin to survive an Acrobatics from Fletchling and OHKO it in return with Rock Slide at +1. Synthesis in tandem with Bulk Up enables Chespin to keep itself healthy while setting up throughout the match. Rock Slide is a very nice move on Chespin, which naturally lures in Bug- and Fire-type Pokemon such as Larvesta and Ponyta. Seed Bomb is a very reliable STAB move that allows Chespin to beat Chinchou and gets nice all-around coverage in conjunction with Rock Slide. Although Bulk Up is highly advised, running Spikes is not a bad idea instead because of the raw support it provides. Spikes also wears down switch-ins, helping Chespin's teammates.

Set Details
========

Eviolite is the item of choice over Berry Juice because it offers more longevity and overall higher bulk; Synthesis keeps Chespin healthy as well. Chespin should invest into Special Defense to further boost it. Although an Impish nature seems a bit odd when running a specially defensive EV spread set, it provides an overall larger boost to bulk by increasing Chespin's Defense stat to an even Eviolite number. 28 Attack EVs give Chespin one extra point in Attack. Overgrow should never be considered when running Chespin, as Bulletproof always outclasses it by allowing Chespin to wall Gastly and Foongus, amongst other Pokemon. Thus, the benefits of Bulletproof far outweigh the niches of Overgrow.

Usage Tips
========

Chespin is phenomenal at countering Drilbur, which is what this set does best. Drilbur cannot break through Chespin without running Poison Jab, while Chespin severely dents it with Seed Bomb. Chespin also completely counters Pokemon that rely on 'ball' or 'bomb' moves, such as Foongus and Gastly. Therefore, try to prevent Chespin from being worn down too much to the point where it is unable to check such Pokemon. Bulk Up should not be used recklessly, as Timburr can set up on Chespin in return and eventually beat Chespin one-on-one. If running Spikes, try using it when Chespin forces a switch to slowly rack up entry hazard damage.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that have great difficulty with Drilbur are prime partners; this includes Pokemon such as defensive Chinchou and Magnemite. Chinchou in particular has nice synergy with Chespin and can keep it healthy with Heal Bell. Chespin doesn't appreciate opposing Fire- and Flying-types, which Chinchou keeps in check. When running Spikes, Pokemon that enjoy foes being worn down before they sweep, such as Titrouga and Larvesta, make good partners.

Spikes Support
########
name: Spikes Support
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Seed Bomb
move 3: Synthesis
move 4: Low Sweep / Roar / Rock Tomb
ability: Bulletproof
item: Eviolite
evs: 68 HP / 28 Atk / 156 Def / 236 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Chespin differentiates itself from Ferroseed as a Spikes setter because of its access to reliable recovery in Synthesis and its lack of a Fighting-type weakness. Seed Bomb allows Chespin to beat Drilbur, the tier's main Rapid Spinner, a trait that both Ferroseed and Trubbish lack. Synthesis keeps Chespin healthy throughout the match and allows it to repeatedly set Spikes and pivot much more easily. Low Sweep OHKOes Pawniard on the switch and is a great move in general to hit and slow Steel-types and other switch-ins. Roar, on the other hand, phazes out Steel-types and forces the opponent's team to take repeated entry hazard damage. Rock Tomb is weaker than Low Sweep but has the benefit of being able to smack Fletchling on the switch and slow it down for a teammate to better take it on. These three moves all provide certain benefits, and all are viable to use on Chespin.

Set Details
========

The allocated defensive EVs allow Chespin to hit Eviolite numbers, achieving maximum bulk all-around. This investment, alongside an Impish nature, allows Chespin to make full use of its Defense stat and allows it to be a very viable physical wall and pivot. 28 Attack EVs are a minor investment but provide a tiny boost in Attack, which could potentially be helpful. Eviolite is always preferred over Berry Juice, which serves little purpose on Chespin because of its access to Synthesis. Bulletproof is an extremely useful ability because it allows Chespin to wall Gastly and Foongus with ease, making it the preferred option over Overgrow.

Usage Tips
========

Chespin finds a key niche in its ability to take on and beat Drilbur with ease. Ferroseed and Trubbish, other Spikes setters, both fail to do this, so be sure to capitalize on Chespin's ability to do so. Chespin has no Fighting-type weakness, allowing it to differentiate itself from Ferroseed; it also has much better bulk than Trubbish and access to reliable recovery. Chespin should use its high physical bulk to pivot into physical threats such as Drilbur and Mienfoo and either set Spikes or use Synthesis as it forces them out. Chespin should not try to set Spikes all at once, but rather set them gradually throughout the match. Chespin recieves competition from Foongus, which has access to Spore and is another bulky Grass-type pivot; however, Chespin has a nifty Ground-type resistance that allows it to differentiate itself from Foongus. Always be sure to highlight on Chespin's perks and benefits over its competition when using it.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate Chespin's ability to wall Drilbur and Mienfoo, such as Chinchou and Magnemite, make for good partners; these two Pokemon in particular stand out for their synergy and ability to form a pivot core together with Chespin. Chinchou stands out for its access to Heal Bell, keeping Chespin healthy by ridding it of status. Magnemite is able to pivot into Chespin with Volt Switch and really appreciates Chespin's ability to take on Drilbur. Pawniard also likes Chespin's ability to wall Drilbur and Mienfoo and is able to punish Defoggers trying to remove Spikes thanks to Defiant. Tirtouga has nice synergy with Chespin and enjoys Chespin's ability to take on both Drilbur and Mienfoo; Tirtouga also appreciates Spikes support to wear down foes for late-game sweeping.

Other Options
########

Curse sets can be pulled off thanks to Chespin's high Attack stat; however, its defensive capabilities far eclipse its offensive ones. Chespin also has access to Swords Dance to become an immediate threat, but it's often too slow to pull off a sweep. Stone Edge is interesting to hit potential Fire- and Flying-type switch-ins, but it has little use aside from this, and Rock Slide or Rock Tomb usually do the job better. Payback is interesting, as it allows Chespin to OHKO Gastly. Brick Break hits Pawniard hard, deterring it from setting up. Poison Jab hits Spritzee for super effective damage but has subpar coverage otherwise. Aerial Ace gets nice coverage and is also a way to hit Foongus. Finally, Toxic is viable to hurt a ton of defensive Pokemon while also putting most other Pokemon on timers.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fletchling**: Fletchling resists Chespin's STAB moves and can easily set up a Swords Dance on it. Fletchling also has a powerful STAB attack of its own to dispose of Chespin with. Chespin can catch it off guard with Rock Tomb, however, so Fletchling has to be sure Chespin is not carrying this move. Fletchling also doesn't enjoy switching into the rare Leech Seed, but this is not as much of a problem as Rock Tomb is. Low Sweep also lowers Fletchling's Speed, which can be detrimental to it. Finally, Chespin can even Roar away Fletchling as it switches in, thus racking up Stealth Rock damage, but Fletchling is still usually going to prevail against Chespin.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Pawniard and Ferroseed wall Chespin and render it setup fodder. However, if Chespin is running Low Sweep, such Pokemon have to worry about Chespin, and no Steel-types, bar Ferroseed, particularly like to take the rare Leech Seed. Honedge walls Chespin regardless, but it too does not like to take residual Leech Seed damage.

**Super Effective Attacks**: Flying-type moves from Fletchling, Fire-type moves from Ponyta, and Ice-type moves from Snover all put a dent in Chespin, even though it is bulky. Chespin can dent all of these Pokemon with Rock Slide or Rock Tomb, but it really should not be staying in on any of them. It is worthwhile to note that it is immune to Sludge Bomb thanks to Bulletproof, technically removing Chespin's Poison-type weakness, but some Poison-types run Sludge Wave solely to deal with Chespin.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Foongus, Cottonee, Ferroseed, and opposing Chespin are immune to Leech Seed and resist Seed Bomb and Rock Slide. However, these Grass-types fail to do much to Chespin in return, creating a stalemate.
