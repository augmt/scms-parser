Overview
########

Chespin has solid stats all around and an awesome ability in Bulletproof, which grants it immunities to many moves, including Sludge Bomb and Shadow Ball. It also comes with a fairly unique typing in LC that resists Ground and isn't weak to Rock, making it a great check to Drilbur bar the rare Poison Jab variants. Unfortunately, this typing comes with weaknesses to fairly common attacking types in Flying, Fire, and Bug. Chespin faces a lot of competition, as other Spikes setters, specifically Ferroseed, are typically better in a support role and Pumpkaboo-XL is a better Drilbur check. Despite this, Chespin's typing and coverage options give it a niche, though sometimes these coverage options aren't enough and many Pokemon are able to use Chespin as setup bait.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Seed Bomb
move 2: Synthesis
move 3: Spikes / Drain Punch
move 4: Rock Slide / Drain Punch
ability: Bulletproof
item: Eviolite
evs: 68 HP / 28 Atk / 156 Def / 236 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Synthesis keeps Chespin healthy throughout the match, but it only has 8 PP, meaning Chespin is fairly limited in its recovery. Seed Bomb is Chespin's best STAB choice and hits many common Rapid Spin users super effectively. Spikes allows Chespin to support the team by breaking Focus Sash and Sturdy and supplying important chip damage. Rock Slide punishes Flying- and Fire-types that would otherwise love to switch in on Chespin, particularly Fletchling and Larvesta. Drain Punch hits Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Pawniard while providing a small bit of recovery, but it fails to OHKO either and Chespin is able to beat Ferroseed without it. If Drain Punch is used over Rock Slide, many Pokemon that Chespin would otherwise counter, such as Foongus and certain variants of Gastly, are able to stall it out of Synthesis PP and force it out.

Set Details
========

The EVs and Eviolite maximize Chespin's bulk while slightly boosting Chespin's offensive presence. Bulletproof transforms Chespin into a great counter to Gastly, Foongus, and Bellsprout because of its immunity to Shadow Ball, Sludge Bomb, and Weather Ball.

Usage Tips
========

Try to abuse Chespin's Bulletproof immunities whenever possible. Chespin has the capability to completely wall some Pokemon and should use the free turns it gets to set up Spikes or to predict a switch-in. You should also use Synthesis as efficiently as possible to conserve PP.

Team Options
========

Chinchou has excellent typing synergy with Chespin, covering its weaknesses to Flying, Ice, and Fire while Chespin deals with some of Chinchou's best checks, such as Foongus, Drilbur, and opposing Chinchou. Pawniard provides a way to punish Defog users that will want to clear away Chespin's Spikes. Although Chespin has a good matchup against common Rapid Spin users, a Ghost-type partner such as Frillish is still beneficial to block the move entirely; Frillish in particular nicely resists four of Chespin's weaknesses. Essentially any Rock-type will cover many of Chespin's weaknesses and appreciate Chespin's resistances to Ground, Water, and Grass.

Bulk Up
########
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Synthesis
move 3: Seed Bomb
move 4: Rock Slide
ability: Bulletproof
item: Eviolite
evs: 228 HP / 28 Atk / 236 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Bulk Up transforms Chespin into a great win condition, while Synthesis keeps Chespin healthy and allows it to set up multiple times throughout a match. Seed Bomb is Chespin's best available STAB move, and Rock Slide has good coverage alongside it, hitting Fire-, Flying-, and Bug-types super effectively. Unfortunately, this set is walled by Steel-types, but Chespin can't afford to replace any of its moves.

Set Details
========

The EVs focus primarily on increasing Chespin's special bulk because it will be boosting its Defense through Bulk Up. Bulletproof grants Chespin many immunities to specific moves and allows Chespin to wall Pokemon that could otherwise counter it.

Usage Tips
========

Take advantage of Bulletproof's immunities. Using Bulk Up as a Pokemon that checks Chespin, such as Archen or Fletchling, comes in may allow Chespin to beat said check. Synthesis needs to be used conservatively because of its low PP. Although this set is walled by Steel-types, many of them can't prevent Chespin from setting up and brute forcing its way through them.

Team Options
========

Chinchou resists some of Chespin's most common weaknesses in Flying, Fire, and Ice while providing extremely beneficial Heal Bell support; meanwhile, Chespin resists both of Chinchou's weaknesses. Almost all Rock-types cover many of Chespin's weaknesses and appreciate its resistances to Water, Grass, and Ground. Stealth Rock support greatly assists Chespin in breaking through the Fire- and Flying-types that bother it. Bulk Up Chespin faces a lot of competition from Bulk Up Timburr and should only be used on teams that prefer the switch-in to the many Pokemon that Chespin checks over Timburr's access to priority, Knock Off, and ability benefiting from status.

Other Options
########

Wood Hammer is a stronger STAB move, but that comes with unwanted recoil. Stone Edge can also be used as a stronger alternative to Rock Slide, but the additional power is almost never worth the lower accuracy for Chespin. Aerial Ace and Poison Jab could be used to hit Grass-types super effectively, but they lack significant coverage or power. Zen Headbutt hits Poison-types such as Croagunk and Foongus super effectively, but Chespin's other coverage moves are usually superior. Bulldoze can also be used to hit Poison-types along with Steel-types, but its Base Power is quite low and it will activate Pawniard's Defiant. Payback can be used to hit Ghost-types harder, but Chespin is usually able to deal with them without it. Superpower is an alternative to Drain Punch, but using it lowers Chespin's defenses, which is counterproductive with Chespin's primary role. Chespin also has access to setup moves such as Belly Drum and Swords Dance, but it lacks the Speed necessary to effectively use them. Lastly, Chespin can use Roar to rack up entry hazard damage and prevent Pokemon from setting up on it.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Only fearing Rock Slide, Fire-types can heavily damage or KO Chespin. Some, such as Ponyta, can heal off anything Chespin does and burn it. Specially offensive Fire-types, such as Vulpix and Houndour, can ignore Bulk Up boosts and OHKO Chespin.

**Flying-types**: Although Flying-types don't want to switch in on Rock Slide, many of them threaten to OHKO Chespin. Some of them, such as Vullaby, even carry Defog to clear away Chespin's Spikes.

**Setup Sweepers**: Due to Chespin's lack of immediate offensive power, many Pokemon, particularly Bulk Up Timburr or a boosting Croagunk, find it easy to set up against Chespin.

**Poison-types**: Chespin does wall some Poison-types such as Gastly and Bellsprout, but others that don't rely on Sludge Bomb can switch in on any attack and force Chespin out without a problem. Croagunk is one of Chespin's best counters because of its resistance to all of Chespin's common attacks, but Chespin does have problems breaking through others, such as Trubbish and Koffing.

**Steel-types**: Chespin lacking Drain Punch is unable to significantly damage most Steel-types. The only one it can consistently beat without Drain Punch is Ferroseed, while the others easily wall it and, if necessary, stall it out of Synthesis PP.
