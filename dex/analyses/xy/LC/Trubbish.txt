Overview
########
Trubbish's defensive qualities are very valuable in a metagame filled with Fighting-types and Knock Off, both of which it can deal with thanks to its pure Poison typing and Sticky Hold ability. Because of this, Trubbish is often able to get free turns to set up Spikes or heal with the Recycle + Berry Juice combo, which pairs excellently with Sticky Hold. Despite Trubbish's low offensive presence, it has taken a undisputed advantage from Misdreavus's ban.

Spikes
#######
name: Spikes
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Recycle
move 3: Gunk Shot
move 4: Drain Punch
Ability: Sticky Hold
Item: Berry Juice
Evs: 116 HP / 36 Atk / 100 Def / 20 SpD / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Setting up entry hazards reliably is Trubbish's main draw, so Spikes is the most important move on this set. Recycle allows Trubbish to repeatedly use Berry Juice to heal to full HP after losing half of its health, giving Trubbish great staying power. Gunk Shot is the most powerful STAB move available to Trubbish, and it hits decently hard against neutral targets despite Trubbish's low base Attack. Drain Punch is mainly for Pawniard, which Trubbish checks, but also hits other Steel-types that are immune to Gunk Shot super effectively. 

Set Details
========
Maximum Speed and a Jolly nature give Trubbish 17 Speed, enough to Speed tie with Mienfoo and outspeed non-Choice Scarf Pawniard. The rest of the EVs are mainly put into Defense in order to tank Knock Offs better.


Usage Tips
========
Trubbish can easily switch in on most Fighting- and Fairy-types or Knock Off users and set up a layer of Spikes.

Team Options
========
Pokemon such as Pawniard and Porygon are good Trubbish's teammates, appreciating its ability to wall the Fighting-types that threaten them. Pawniard also provides a way to discourage the use of Defog to remove entry hazards, as it receives a +2 Attack boost from it thanks to Defiant. Late-game cleaners such as Scraggy and Carvanha can sweep easier with Spikes support and therefore enjoy having Trubbish as a teammate. A Ghost-type to block Rapid Spin is a good choice, as Drilbur otherwise has no trouble removing Trubbish's Spikes.


Other Options
########
Toxic Spikes is a viable alternative to Spikes, but is absorbed by Poison-types. Trubbish can use special attacks such as Sludge Bomb, Dark Pulse, or Hidden Power Fighting alongside Spikes and Recycle; though weaker than their physical alternatives, they aren't affected by burns. Eviolite gives Trubbish more bulk, but it loses its reliable recovery in Recycle paired with Berry Juice. Rock Blast offers coverage against Dwebble and Archen, while Seed Bomb is Trubbish's only way to deal with Ground-types. Clear Smog helps Trubbish prevent setup, but is blocked by Substitute. Finally, Explosion lets Trubbish act as a suicide lead.

Checks & Counters
########
**Ghost-types**: Even with Thief, Gastly will not be easy to stop from switching in. Otherwise, without Thief, Trubbish can hardly damage Gastly at all.

**Ground-types**: Ground-types can easily KO Trubbish. Diglett has Arena Trap to trap and KO Trubbish. Drilbur has access to Rapid Spin, which removes Trubbish's entry hazards.

**Rapid Spin / Defog**: These remove hazards, and Trubbish has no way to stop this on its own. Archen can switch in repeatedly on Trubbish and remove its entry hazards or threaten a KO with Earthquake.

**Psychic-types**: Abra can OHKO Trubbish with ease if given a free switch, while Slowpoke takes little damage from Gunk Shot and can paralyze or KO Trubbish.

**Setup**: Pokemon Trubbish is usually called upon to wall, such as Scraggy or Croagunk, can take advantage of its low offensive presence to set up on it if they carry a boosting move.
