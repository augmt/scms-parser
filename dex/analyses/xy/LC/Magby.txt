Overview
########

At first glance, Magby looks like just another wimpy baby Pokemon. However, it has many qualities that enable it to truly stand out in Little Cup. Boasting access to the revered 19 Speed tier and excellent attacking stats, Magby is quite the threat. Its movepool contains gems such as Belly Drum, Mach Punch, Cross Chop, Flare Blitz, and more. However, the blessings don't end there; it gets access to two good abilities, Flame Body and Vital Spirit, as well as being a Fire-type, which prevents burns and is generally potent offensively. While slightly held back by its fragility and weakness to Stealth Rock, as well as its susceptibility to priority, Magby is not a Pokemon to be underestimated.

Belly Drum
########
name: Belly Drum
move 1: Belly Drum
move 2: Fire Punch
move 3: Mach Punch
move 4: Return / Thief
ability: Vital Spirit / Flame Body
item: Berry Juice
evs: 236 Atk / 252 Spe
ivs: 29 HP
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Belly Drum boosts Magby's Attack stat to 68, letting it destroy the metagame. Fire Punch is Magby's primary physical STAB move, and it does enough at +6 to justify not using Flare Blitz. Mach Punch provides Magby priority to use on Pokemon it would Speed tie with or be outsped by, such as Meowth and Elekid. Return OHKOes Chinchou at +6, a very important benchmark, and does heavy damage to Pokemon that resist Fire, such as Munchlax and Slowpoke. Thief allows Magby to steal items from Pokemon like Tirtouga, which it cannot beat without entry hazard support. Thunder Punch can also hit some of the Water-types that resist Fire Punch, such as Slowpoke, super effectively.

Set Details
========

Magby can potentially reach 19 Speed, and this set does so, making it impossible for Pawniard to revenge kill it, barring the very rare and exploitable Choice Scarf Sucker Punch. This set utilizes only 29 HP IVs, which allows Magby to activate Berry Juice's recovery immediately after using Belly Drum. Berry Juice grants Magby recovery, getting it back to full HP no matter what. Vital Spirit lets Magby be one of the best Foongus switch-ins and protects it from other sleepers, like Gastly. Finally, Flame Body can be used to cripple any Pokemon trying to use Fake Out to chip away at it, such as Mienfoo, Aipom, and Meowth.

Usage Tips
========

Magby should be brought in by means of revenging or a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, preferably coming in on something that can not threaten it, such as Snover, Larvesta, Mienfoo, or Foongus lacking Stun Spore. Keep in mind, however, that Magby is extremely frail and will fall to many powerful neutral attacks. Magby can also switch in on Will-O-Wisp for free, as it cannot be burned due to its typing. Once Magby has gotten in, set up Belly Drum and sweep. It's okay to retreat, however, as switching it into a Fake Out can burn the foe, effectively neutering it; however, only do that if you must.

Team Options
========

Pursuit trapping from the likes of Pawniard can easily facilitate a Magby sweep, as Ghost-types are immune to its only form of priority. Defog or Rapid Spin support is also appreciated, as Stealth Rock chips off a quarter of Magby's HP, and Sticky Web neuters it. Sticky Web support is appreciated, as it usually prevents grounded foes from outspeeding it, meaning Magby doesn't have to use Mach Punch. Knock Off support is also appreciated to stop Choice Scarf users and remove Eviolites. Magby draws status like moths to a flame, so a status absorber or cleric is appreciated as a teammate. Any way to weaken bulky Water-types like Chinchou is appreciated; for example, Hidden Power Ground Magnemite can lure in and weaken the foe's Chinchou, and Mienfoo or Pawniard can Knock Off Slowpoke's Eviolite. Finally, Pokemon with Sturdy can usually withstand Magby's attacks, so Stealth Rock support is appreciated.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Flare Blitz
move 2: Cross Chop
move 3: Mach Punch
move 4: Return / Thunder Punch
ability: Vital Spirit / Flame Body
item: Life Orb
evs: 236 Atk / 252 Spe
ivs: 0 HP
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Flare Blitz is Magby's most powerful physical STAB attack, and it has immense power, especially under the sun. Cross Chop hits Munchlax and Porygon hard, as well as Rock-types. Return hits Chinchou considerably harder and provides decent neutral coverage. Thunder Punch, however, hits Archen and bulky Water-types not named Chinchou harder. Finally, Mach Punch gives Magby priority and OHKOes Pawniard while bypassing Sucker Punch.

Set Details
========

252 Speed EVs and a positive nature allow Magby to reach 19 Speed, bypassing Pawniard's Sucker Punch. It can also Speed tie with or outspeed many common Pokemon, such as Aipom, Pawniard, and Mienfoo. All the remaining EVs are put into Attack to let Magby hit harder. Life Orb lends Magby much more power, and 0 HP IVs cause it to only lose 1 HP per attack. Vital Spirit gives Magby a safe switch against Foongus and other sleep-inducing Pokemon like Gastly. Flame Body can also be used, as it lets Magby have a chance of burning a Fake Out or faster / more durable priority user as Magby goes down; however, Magby will only have one shot at this, as almost any attack will KO it after the recoil.

Usage Tips
========

It is recommended that you bring Magby in safely, whether by means of a slow Volt Switch, U-Turn, a switch into a resisted attack, or by revenging something. Will-O-Wisp is an excellent attack to switch in on, as Magby cannot be burned by nature of its typing. Once it is in, it can break opponents down with its powerful attacks.

Team Options
========

Pursuit trapping by the likes of Pawniard and Stunky can defeat the Ghost-types that are immune to three of Magby's attacks. Defog or Rapid Spin support is recommended, as Stealth Rock hurts, and Sticky Web neuters Magby. Sticky Web support is appreciated, as it prevents Diglett from switching in and KOing with Sucker Punch, and also prevents Pokemon like Carvanha from outspeeding Magby after one boost. Finally, any way to weaken bulky Water-types like Chinchou is appreciated; for example, Hidden Power Grass Chinchou can weaken opposing Chinchou, and Mienfoo or Pawniard can Knock Off Slowpoke's Eviolite.

Other Options
########

A mixed set consisting of Flare Blitz / Mach Punch / Thunder Punch / Overheat is usable, but Cross Chop is usually preferred over Overheat. A Substitute + Focus Punch set is also decent, but Magby struggles to force switches and get a Substitute up. However, this can be quite powerful if used successfully. Magby doesn't have too many options, unfortunately.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Pressure**: If the opponent is going on the offensive, Belly Drum Magby will be hard-pressed to set up without significant team support.

**Shell Smash Users With Sturdy**: If no entry hazards are up, Tirtouga and Dwebble can survive a hit with Sturdy, recover, and KO with one or both of their STAB moves.

**Ghost-types**: If running Return, Life Orb Magby can only use its STAB on Ghost-types. Some Ghosts, like Frillish, can easily absorb a Flare Blitz and OHKO back.

**Bulky Priority Users**: Corphish, Timburr, Croagunk and other durable priority users can tank Magby's Mach Punch and KO it with Aqua Jet, Mach Punch or other priority; Timburr even benefits from a burn because of its ability, Guts.

**Flash Fire**: If using Flash Fire, Ponyta and Growlithe can switch into Fire Punch or Flare Blitz, get a boost from Flash Fire, and in Ponyta's case, Speed tie. However, both can survive a hit and OHKO back.

**Faster Pokemon**: Anything faster than Magby can KO it unless they are weak to Mach Punch, due to Magby's frailty.

**Hippopotas**: Hippopotas takes negligible damage from the Life Orb set and can survive a +6 Fire Punch while OHKOing back with Earthquake.

**Diglett**: If its Focus Sash is intact, Diglett can switch in, outspeed Magby, and KO with Sucker Punch.
