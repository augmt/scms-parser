Overview
########
Scraggy can be a threatening sweeper with Dragon Dance or cleaner with a Choice Scarf. It has solid bulk and occupies a good Speed tier, outspeeding 21 Speed Choice Scarf users after a boost. STAB Knock Off is very powerful, and Scraggy can use it both to weaken its own checks and to sweep. Furthermore, Scraggy's three useful abilities help it set up, and, in the case of Moxie, make its sweep harder to stop. However, Scraggy is weak to the newly introduced Fairy-types, sporting a 4x weakness to their STAB while also having both of its STABs resisted by them. Many popular Fighting-types also check Scraggy easily, although few of them can match Scraggy as a Fighting-type sweeper.

########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Drain Punch
move 4: High Jump Kick / Poison Jab / Zen Headbutt / Head Smash
ability: Shed Skin / Moxie
item: Eviolite
evs: 36 HP / 156 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpD / 212 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========
This set aims to sweep an opponent's team with the use of Dragon Dance. Knock Off is the main STAB attack, and it is best used early-game to weaken Scraggy's own checks and counters. Drain Punch is the Fighting-type STAB of choice and helps Scraggy stay healthy, making it much harder for Scraggy to be revenge killed by priority attacks. The last slot can go to a multitude of moves. High Jump Kick is preferred, as it is a much stronger Fighting-type STAB with a chance of OHKOing Eviolite Mienfoo after a boost. Poison Jab can 2HKO Spritzee after some prior damage and loss of its Eviolite to Knock Off. Zen Headbutt can be used if Croagunk is a problem, as it is a clean OHKO. Head Smash can be used if you care to run a more risky set, as it always OHKOes Vullaby after a boost and Stealth Rock damage. Head Smash also OHKOes Larvesta and Ponyta.

Set Details
========
The EVs maximize Speed and give Scraggy extra points in bulk, with the rest thrown into Attack to deal as much damage as possible. Jolly is the preferred nature, as after a boost, Jolly Scraggy outspeeds all 21 Speed Pokemon, an important benchmark. Eviolite is chosen to increase Scraggy's bulk and therefore enable it to set up multiple Dragon Dances. Shed Skin is the preferred ability because it limits worries about status, although Moxie or Intimidate can be used to great effect. Moxie allows for devastating late-game sweeping, while Intimidate allows Scraggy to set up more easily. A more offensive spread of 36 HP / 236 Atk / 212 Spe is usable if you prefer the boost in damage output. This spread has a higher chance of OHKOing Fletchling with an unboosted High Jump Kick, a high chance to OHKO Trubbish with Zen Headbutt at +1, and can deal more damage to Spritzee with Poison Jab at +1.

Usage Tips
========
Early-game, Scraggy should use Knock Off on its checks and counters as they switch in. Once everything on the opponent's team has been weakened, Scraggy can set up and sweep. Most of Scraggy's checks and counters cannot take boosted attacks without their item. Scraggy is great on almost any team thanks to its bulk and power, but offensive teams and balanced teams work best.

Team Options
========
Fletchling is a great partner, as Scraggy lures in numerous Fighting-types that Fletchling can immediately threaten, and Scraggy can use Knock Off against Pokemon that give Fletchling trouble, such as Chinchou. Pawniard forms a double-Dark core, so the two can weaken each other's checks and counters. Carvanha also forms a double-Dark core and provides wallbreaking power to weaken Scraggy's counters, such as Larvesta or Spritzee. Destiny Bond also helps to take down a big threat on the opponent's team. Frillish can spread burns to weaken the opponent's team and provide synergy by sponging Fighting-type attacks intended for Scraggy. Larvesta helps because Scraggy lures in Fighting-types for Larvesta to burn. Scraggy appreciates entry hazards from Dwebble or Ferroseed as they soften up the opponent's team, making it easier to sweep.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: High Jump Kick
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Drain Punch
move 4: Poison Jab
ability: Moxie
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 36 HP / 236 Atk / 212 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
This set aims to be an effective revenge killer while also maintaining the option of sweeping late-game. High Jump Kick is a great STAB move that can be abused with Scraggy's ability, Moxie, to quickly gain Attack boosts. Knock Off is another excellent option and can also be used to revenge kill. Drain Punch can be used to heal, although more often than not Scraggy should use the more powerful High Jump Kick. Drain Punch is a safer early-game Fighting-type STAB, however. Poison Jab is used in order to hit Spritzee and Snubbull.

Set Details
========
Scraggy's EVs are maximized for power and Speed to revenge kill more effectively. With a Choice Scarf attached, Scraggy outspeeds all Pokemon at 21 Speed or below. Moxie is the preferred ability, as it allows Scraggy to rack up Attack boosts quickly and efficiently, and if played right, can result in a sweep.

Usage Tips
========
This set aims to sweep late-game and to revenge kill. Most Ghost-types will not switch into Scraggy for fear of Knock Off, allowing for one or two High Jump Kicks early-game. However, once the Choice Scarf is revealed, it is best to use either Drain Punch or Knock Off, depending on the situation, to avoid the disasterous recoil from a High Jump Kick miss against a Ghost-type switch-in. This set is best used late-game to clean up with Moxie, but can also be used to revenge kill if need be. You can use Scraggy to weaken its own checks and counters with Knock Off, but the Dragon Dance set is far superior in that regard due to the bulk achieved by equipping an Eviolite.

Team Options
=========
Pokemon that can easily wear down the opponent so Scraggy can abuse Moxie make the best teammates. As such, Pokemon such as Dwebble or Ferroseed are extremely beneficial, as none of Scraggy's counters enjoy switching in on a full layer of entry hazards. Pawniard is helpful as well, as it spreads Knock Offs and Pursuit traps Ghost-types that block Scraggy's High Jump Kicks.

Other Options
########
A bulky Intimidate set can be used to check some physical attackers and ease Scraggy's set up with Dragon Dance. Zen Headbutt can be used on either set in order to hit Croagunk harder than any other move and is a safe option for hitting numerous opposing Fighting-types. Iron Head can be used over Poison Jab if you prefer the flinch chance, although the 4x super effective hit on Cottonee is preferred. The poison chance from Poison Jab makes wearing down Scraggy's checks and counters much easier as well.

Checks & Counters
########
**Fighting-types**: Mienfoo, Timburr, and Croagunk can take Scraggy's moves with a bulkier set and KO in return with their STAB moves. Croagunk also has the advantage of resisting both of Scraggy's STABs.

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types resist both of Scraggy's STABs and hit it with 4x super effective moves in return. Cottonee can use Encore against the Dragon Dance set and set up.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types can switch in on High Jump Kick from the Choice Scarf set to force Scraggy to take recoil damage.

**Fletchling**: Fletchling can revenge kill Scraggy with a priority Acrobatics. A maximum Attack item-less Fletchling has a chance of OHKOing Scraggy with its priority Acrobatics after Stealth Rock, but the unboosted Dragon Dance set can 2HKO bulky Fletchling with High Jump Kick.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Choice Scarf Pokemon carrying a super effective attack, such as Mienfoo, can be used to KO a +1 Scraggy.
