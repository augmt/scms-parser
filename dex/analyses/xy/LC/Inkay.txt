Overview
########

Inkay has a powerful niche due to the combination of Contrary and Superpower, which creates a snowball effect: after using Superpower, Inkay's Attack and Defense are raised, which allows it to slowly accumulate boosts. However, Inkay's low Speed holds it back greatly, and it needs either Trick Room or Choice Scarf to mitigate this. Its bulk is also severely lacking, and without any boosts, it is not able to take many hits. Although Inkay only has two weaknesses, it also has no resistances, which gives it a lack of opportunities to switch in. Inkay's movepool is also quite small, so it does not have very much to work with. Finally, it lacks recovery, meaning it is worn down quickly. Although Inkay has its fair share of flaws, its unique niche still makes it a fine choice for your team.

Moves
========

Inkay has a unique niche in its combination of the ability Contrary and the move Superpower. After one or two Superpowers, Inkay becomes quite powerful and bulky. Psycho Cut is Inkay's other STAB move and gets great coverage alongside Superpower. Switcheroo is used to steal the opponent's items, such as Berry Juice or Eviolite, crippling Pokemon that rely on them while locking them into a move with Choice Scarf. Night Slash gets good neutral coverage and is another STAB option for Inkay.

Set Details
========

Choice Scarf is essential to bolster Inkay's Speed; with Choice Scarf equipped, Inkay reaches 22 Speed, outspeeding the entire unboosted tier. The given Speed and Attack EVs give Inkay the maximum power and Speed possible, while 12 EVs in Defense and HP give it an extra boost in both of these stats. Adamant nature is a possibility; however, Inkay's damage isn't increased enough to merit its use over Jolly.

Usage Tips
========

Inkay is fairly simple to use: spam Superpower to attempt to create a snowball effect to accumulate boosts. However, be careful about being locked into certain moves; being locked into Superpower leaves Inkay vulnerable to Ghost-types, while Psycho Cut leaves Inkay vulnerable to being revenge killed by Dark-types. Although Inkay should mainly focus on setting up with Superpower, try to predict when to set up early- or late-game, and if you can't find a proper time to sweep, use Switcheroo.

Team Options
========

Steel-types such as Pawniard and Honedge have great synergy with Inkay because they resist Inkay's Fairy-type weakness and Inkay can revenge kill Fighting-types in return. Pawniard, in particular, is a good partner, as it can Pursuit trap Ghost-types and allow Inkay to freely spam Superpower; it also can Knock Off Eviolites to help Inkay do more damage. Hazards are essential to wear down potential switch-ins, making Dwebble a good partner. Rapid Spin or Defog support is helpful because Inkay switches often and can be worn down quickly.

Other Options
########

Rock Slide is an option for coverage, hitting Flying- and Fire-type Pokemon. Topsy-Turvy could potentially be of use; however, it is difficult to pull off and Inkay is too slow to utilize it effectively. Hypnosis can cripple a Pokemon and wreak havoc, but it has shaky accuracy, making it unreliable. Trick Room is an alternative to Choice Scarf to mitigate Inkay's Speed issues, although its other uses are limited. Destiny Bond can catch something off guard as a last resort. Payback can work well with Inkay's poor Speed, although it is a bit unreliable. Substitute has merit, as Inkay can often find room for it, although the loss of HP is a bit of a downfall. Finally, with Sticky Web support, Inkay can run Eviolite instead of Choice Scarf.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bug-types**: Bug-types such as Dwebble and Larvesta resist Superpower, and can effectively remove Inkay with their STAB moves, which Inkay is 4x weak to. Pokemon that carry U-turn can also take down Inkay and keep up momentum.

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types like Spritzee and Cottonee resist Superpower and have super effective STAB moves to dispose of Inkay.

**Faster Pokemon**: Pokemon equipped with a Choice Scarf or Pokemon with naturally higher Speed can revenge kill Inkay easily.

**Special Attackers**: Most special attackers can give Inkay a hard time, as Inkay lacks much Special Defense.

**Residual Damage**: Residual damage adds up quickly because Inkay switches often. Toxic Spikes in particular wears it down especially quickly.
