Overview
########

Shelmet is very bulky by Little Cup's standards, boasting impressive 50 / 85 / 65 defenses. This, along with its access to Recover, makes Shelmet a fantastic user of Spikes, as they will allow it to reliably set up several layers of the entry hazard. Although its typing leaves it weak to common Flying-, Fire-, and Rock-type moves, it has resistances to Fighting-, Grass-, and Ground-type moves which allow it to set up on many common Pokemon, particularly Foongus. In addition, due to its ability, Overcoat, Shelmet is immune to Spore. However, Shelmet's low Speed and limited offensive capabilities can lead to it becoming setup bait itself and being an easy target for opposing Taunt users. Shelmet is also outclassed by Ferroseed in many instances as an entry hazard setter, as Ferroseed has better defenses and can set up on Foongus more easily; however, Ferroseed lacks reliable recovery and cannot set up as easily on Fighting-types.

Moves
========

Spikes is an effective entry hazard, as it wears down the opposing team every time a Pokemon switches in, and Shelmet's bulk and access to Recover make it a particularly reliable user of the move. Infestation is a weak attack, but it traps the opponent and deals passive damage, allowing Shelmet to set up on Pokemon that can't do anything to it, such as Foongus and Spritzee. Toxic is another way for Shelmet to inflict damage on top of Infestation. Although Toxic is generally considered less reliable than other forms of passive damage in Little Cup, the damage it and Infestation inflicts can add up very quickly. Toxic is also useful for crippling bulky switch-ins that try to remove entry hazards, such as Vullaby and Drilbur. Recover is the key to Shelmet's amazing bulk and longevity; it can stall many Pokemon out when combined with Toxic and Infestation.

Set Details
========

The HP, Defense, and Special Defense EVs chosen give Shelmet 23 / 27 / 24 bulk, which is extremely bulky in Little Cup. Overcoat allows Shelmet to come in freely on Foongus, which it can proceed to trap and set up on.

Usage Tips
========

Shelmet is best used as a switch-in to Fighting-types and Pokemon such as Foongus. From there, it can proceed to set up Spikes. However, Pokemon like Bulk Up Timburr can set up quite easily on Shelmet. Shelmet's bulk along with Recover enables it to stall out opponents with a combination of Infestation and Toxic.

Team Options
========

Chinchou and Tirtouga make for great partners, as they resist Flying-type attacks from Pokemon such as Fletchling and can come in on Fire-type attacks from the likes of Ponyta and Larvesta, all of which are massive threats to Shelmet. A spinblocker such as Pumpkaboo can help keep Shelmet's entry hazards up. Pawniard can discourage opposing Defoggers in addition to having good type synergy with Shelmet; it can beat the Flying- and Rock-types that trouble Shelmet, while Shelmet can take on the Fighting-types that beat Pawniard. Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Mienfoo and Magnemite, are great at forcing enemies out and causing them to take entry hazard damage. Shelmet works well on stall teams, as they benefit from entry hazard support; however, Ferroseed usually fits better on those teams.

Other Options
########

Shelmet can run an effective Baton Pass set with Acid Armor, Substitute, or Curse; however, Shelmet is easy to Taunt and will have to take two attacks before being able to pass its boost. Baton Pass can also be used to preserve momentum or get a teammate in safely, as Shelmet's Speed means it will generally move second. As far as attacking options go, Bug Buzz hits harder than Infestation, but it doesn't trap the opponent or inflict passive damage. However, it hits through Substitute, preventing Shelmet from becoming setup bait. Energy Ball can be used to hit Pokemon such as Tirtouga and Chinchou, while Sludge Bomb can be used to hit Fairy-types; however, it's hard justifying giving a slot to those options over Infestation. Acid Armor could also be used on the usual set to prevent Fletchling and Bulk Up Timburr from gaining an advantage, although Shelmet will have to catch the former on the switch. Shell Armor can be useful for protecting Shelmet from critical hits, which can ruin a Baton Pass chain, but having an immunity to Spore and weather damage is generally preferred. Yawn is an effective option over Toxic to force switches, but this leaves Shelmet unable to take on nearly anything with any form of recovery. Encore can help versus Pokemon that would otherwise set up on Shelmet, but its low Speed prevents this strategy from being effective.

Checks & Counters
########

**Flying-types**: Flying-types such as Fletchling, Taillow, Vullaby, and Archen are capable of dealing a lot of damage to Shelmet with their super effective STAB moves.

**Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta take negligible damage from Infestation and can wipe Shelmet out with a Flare Blitz after just a little prior damage.

**Rock-types**: Most Rock-types are bulky enough to take little damage from any of Shelmet's attacks, and Pokemon such as Tirtouga, Archen, Dwebble, and Onix can all 2HKO Shelmet with their STAB moves.

**Taunt Users**: Taunt users such as Mienfoo and Onix can leave Shelmet unable to set up Spikes or use Recover. Shelmet is quite slow and therefore susceptible to Taunt.

**Poison-types**: Although most Poison-types are easy setup bait for Shelmet, they are unaffected by Toxic, making them difficult to wear down.
