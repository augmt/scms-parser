Overview
########
With access to the unique combination of Tough Claws and Shell Smash, Binacle is a very capable sweeper. When given a Choice Scarf or Choice Band, it is also a dangerous revenge killer or wallbreaker, respectively. Along with these great assets, Binacle has a number of powerful STAB moves that add to its fantastic offensive potential. All of these factors contribute to Binacle being a serious threat in Little Cup. However, a Water / Rock typing leaves Binacle weak to several common attacking types and forms of priority. In some ways, it is outclassed as a Shell Smash sweeper by Tirtouga, and it lacks power when running a Choice Scarf. Despite these problems, Binacle remains a powerful threat that earns itself a place on many teams.

Shell Smash
########
name: Shell Smash
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Razor Shell
move 3: Cross Chop
move 4: Stone Edge / Earthquake
ability: Tough Claws
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 100 HP / 180 Atk / 196 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
Shell Smash boosts Binacle's power to sky-high levels. Razor Shell is the main move, hitting like a truck after Tough Claws and Shell Smash boosts. Cross Chop sets Binacle apart from Tirtouga by helping it get past Ferroseed, something that Tirtouga cannot do. Earthquake hits Croagunk, which could impede Binacle otherwise. Stone Edge is a good secondary STAB that can be used over Earthquake. Poison Jab can be used if Fairy-types present a serious threat to your team.

Set Details
========
The EVs maximize Binacle's sweeping potential and allow it to hit 30 Attack and 28 Speed after a Shell Smash, while also slightly increasing its bulk. An Adamant nature maximizes Attack while still allowing Binacle to outspeed everything necessary. Eviolite lets Binacle survive Croagunk's Vacuum Wave at -1; if carrying Earthquake, Binacle would be able to KO back easily as well. Berry Juice gives Binacle a means of recovering HP.

Usage Tips
========
Avoid setting up too early. Binacle functions best in the mid- to late-game, when its major checks have been KOed or weakened considerably. Binacle has ample setup opportunities on Pokemon such as Vullaby, Trubbish, and Fletchling, and is best brought in after either a teammate goes down or on a weak or resisted hit. After setting up, spam Razor Shell to smash through the opposing team, since it is the most reliable of Binacle's moves. If a Pokemon that resists Razor Shell is brought in, simply use the appropriate coverage move.

Team Options
========
First and foremost, Pokemon that can give Binacle chances to set up are the most important teammates. Cottonee in particular is a fantastic teammate, as it has incredible synergy with Binacle as well as access to moves such as Encore and Memento, which grant ample setup opportunities. Wynaut functions similarly to Cottonee, and while it lacks Memento, it has Shadow Tag to help remove the Fighting-types that trouble Binacle. Fighting-types can support Binacle with Knock Off while also luring out Trubbish and Fletchling, providing Binacle with good setup opportunities. Powerful Flying-type attackers, such as Fletchling and Taillow, are useful teammates since they can beat Croagunk, Binacle's best counter. Entry hazards are important to ensure certain KOs on Pokemon; as such, Trubbish, Dwebble, and Drilbur make good partners as well. Larvesta is good for checking Fighting- and Grass-type Pokemon, which easily KO Binacle with their powerful STAB attacks. Tirtouga makes a surprisingly good partner, as it appreciates how Binacle can break through Ferroseed and weaken the rest of the opposing team.

Switcheroo
########
name: Switcheroo
move 1: Switcheroo
move 2: Razor Shell
move 3: Stone Edge / Cross Chop
move 4: Earthquake / Cross Chop
ability: Tough Claws
item: Choice Band / Choice Scarf
evs: 100 HP / 180 Atk / 196 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========
Switcheroo is a fantastic move as it allows Binacle to cripple common switch-ins such as Ferroseed while also stealing their item. To utilize Switcheroo to its full potential, it's best for Binacle to come in on Pokemon it naturally scares out, such as Fletchling or Vullaby. Razor Shell's chance to drop the opponent's Defense is amazing, as it often helps Binacle get past bulkier foes. Stone Edge provides a solid secondary STAB that hits hard. Earthquake gives Binacle the ability to break through Croagunk, which would otherwise completely wall it, while Cross Chop provides Binacle with a better means of dealing with Ferroseed. Poison Jab could be used hit Spritzee harder, but it provides almost nothing else in the way of coverage, making it a pretty poor option.

Set Details
========
The given EVs maximize Binacle's Attack and Speed, while also slightly increasing its bulk. If using a Choice Band, Adamant is the recommended nature to hit as hard as possible. For instance, Binacle will have a 50% chance to OHKO Croagunk with Stone Edge after one layer of Spikes. With a Choice Scarf and a Jolly nature, Binacle hits 22 Speed, letting it outpace the entire unboosted metagame.

Usage Tips
========
Switcheroo is Binacle's biggest niche and is the main reason for using it. Binacle's item decides its role on the team. Choice Band Binacle functions as a wallbreaker, while Choice Scarf Binacle acts as a revenge killer. Without Eviolite, Binacle's defensive capabilities are incredibly underwhelming. As such, switching it in on predicted switches, weak resisted hits, or after one of your Pokemon has fainted is important.

Team Options
========
Binacle appreciates teammates that can deal with Fighting-types; in this regard, Taillow, Croagunk, and Fletchling are all good partners. Fighting-types also make good teammates, as they can help beat the Steel-types that can wall Binacle. Mienfoo in particular is incredibly useful, as removing items such as Eviolite with Knock Off helps Binacle clean up late-game. Entry hazard setters such as Drilbur, Dwebble, Trubbish, and Ferroseed help net KOs, with Trubbish having the best synergy with Binacle. Sweepers such as Scraggy, Carvanha, and Tirtouga appreciate the support Binacle provides. Spritzee has decent synergy with Binacle and can keep it healthy with Wish + Aromatherapy support. Ponyta and Larvesta can spread burns to weaken opponents and also beat the Grass-types that cause Binacle so much trouble.

Other Options
########
Sniper could be used over Tough Claws on a gimmicky Scope Lens set for a Stone Edge that always lands a critical hit, but the boost in power that Tough Claws gives is generally preferred. X-Scissor could be used to hit Slowpoke, but even at +2 Attack it will never OHKO, and it is useless outside of this. Shadow Claw also hits Slowpoke hard, but likewise has little other use.

Checks & Counters
########
**Fighting-types**: Most Fighting-types are bulky enough to tank unboosted hits from Binacle and can KO it back with their strong STAB attacks. Timburr and Croagunk both have access to priority, making them even more threatening.

**Bulky Grass-types**: Foongus and Ferroseed can tank a Razor Shell and KO Binacle with a STAB Grass-type attack. Ferroseed completely walls the Choice Scarf set, but it will be OHKOed by a +2 Cross Chop from the Shell Smash set.

**Status Inflicters**: Being a physical attacker, Binacle is rendered useless by burns, so be careful against foes with Flame Body or Will-O-Wisp. Cottonee can lock Binacle into Shell Smash and OHKO with Giga Drain. Slowpoke can cripple Binacle with Thunder Wave and wear it down with Scald.

**Priority**: Mach Punch and Aqua Jet can take out the Shell Smash and Choice Scarf sets, especially if Binacle is weakened or at -1 defenses.

**Fast attackers**: The Choice Band set has terrible speed. It is easily outsped, and often just a fast attacker can take Binacle down.
