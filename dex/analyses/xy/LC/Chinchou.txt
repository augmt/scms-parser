Overview
########

Resistances to incredibly common offensive types and an immunity to popular Electric-type moves give Chinchou a niche among the best of the best. Backing up its phenomenal typing is Chinchou's wonderful movepool, including Volt Switch to maintain momentum, solid coverage moves, and numerous supportive options. Although Chinchou's Defense and Special Defense aren't the best, they are usually made up for by its stellar HP. It's certainly true that a lack of reliable recovery, no outstanding stats in particular, and weaknesses to Grass- and Ground-type moves all prevent Chinchou from absolutely crushing the tier, but given its unmatched advantages, Chinchou's position as one of the most prominent threats in the metagame remains undeniable.

Bulky Attacker
########
name: Bulky Attacker
move 1: Hydro Pump / Scald
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Heal Bell / Thunder Wave / Soak
move 4: Thunderbolt / Hidden Power Ground
ability: Volt Absorb
item: Berry Juice / Eviolite
evs: 76 HP / 212 Def / 152 SpA / 60 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

This set allows Chinchou to maintain offensive pressure on the opponent while checking a variety of important threats, such as Fletchling and Carvanha. Hydro Pump is Chinchou's most powerful option for its Water-type STAB move, preventing frailer Pokemon from being able to safely switch into it. Scald is an excellent alternative for perfect accuracy and a burn chance. Volt Switch is a huge part of Chinchou's effectiveness, allowing it to deal a bit of damage to its counter after forcing something out and switching to a teammate better suited to handle the new Pokemon. It's usually a good idea to dedicate a moveslot to an option from Chinchou's vast supportive movepool; Heal Bell gives Chinchou another way to take advantage of the switches it causes and cure its team of status ailments, while Thunder Wave can cripple faster Pokemon. Soak is yet another method to deal with unfortunate switch-ins, leaving them vulnerable to Volt Switch and giving Chinchou's team even more momentum. Thunderbolt is a fine choice for the last slot in case Volt Switch's switching effect is detrimental or for the greater Base Power, but Hidden Power Ground can be used instead to hit Magnemite and opposing Chinchou.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread and nature allow Chinchou to better handle Flying-types such as Fletchling while maintaining power. If more offensive presence is desired, a spread of 52 Def / 232 SpA / 224 Spe with either a Timid or Modest nature could be used. Volt Absorb is Chinchou's preferred ability since it provides a form of unreliable recovery and Chinchou already resists Water-type moves, making Water Absorb less exciting. As for items, Berry Juice and Eviolite are both wonderful options, depending on whether you prefer a one-time heal or more initial bulk.

Usage Tips
========

If the opponent has no immunities to Electric-type attacks, Volt Switch is probably the most spammable move, allowing Chinchou to constantly maintain momentum. However, more caution should be exercised if the opponent has a Ground-type Pokemon such as Drilbur or Diglett. Both are able to outspeed Chinchou and hit it hard with STAB Ground-type attacks once they are in safely; Diglett is especially threatening because Arena Trap will prevent Chinchou from switching out after a misprediction. As Chinchou forces a lot of switches, these can be good opportunities to use Heal Bell.

Team Options
========

Chinchou is incredibly easy to fit onto any type of team, but of course, certain Pokemon appreciate its capabilities more than others. Pokemon that are able to cover Chinchou's Grass and Ground weaknesses, such as Fletchling and Vullaby, make excellent teammates. Fletchling and Vullaby also get access to U-turn for more momentum. Since bulky Normal-types such as Porygon and Lickitung are able to wall Chinchou indefinitely, a Fighting-type to beat these, such as Mienfoo, is also helpful; Mienfoo also has access to U-turn, gaining further momentum for your team. Spritzee is another Pokemon that is able to stall out Chinchou, so Pawniard or Magnemite as a teammate could be beneficial; Pawniard is able to set up Stealth Rock to further take advantage of the switches Chinchou causes, while Magnemite gets Volt Switch. Spritzee is able to pass Chinchou Wishes, allowing the latter to stick around longer. Any sweeper that might otherwise be crippled by status, such as Moxie Scraggy or Shell Smash Omanyte, is able to take advantage of Chinchou's access to Heal Bell.

RestTalk
########
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Scald
move 4: Volt Switch / Discharge / Heal Bell
ability: Volt Absorb
item: Eviolite
evs: 76 HP / 212 Def / 148 SpD / 60 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

If you need a Pokemon to repeatedly check a multitude of top-tier offensive threats while absorbing status, then this is the Chinchou set for you. The combination of Rest and Sleep Talk gives Chinchou the recovery that it so badly needs, while not leaving it completely vulnerable when asleep. Scald is the preferred Water-type STAB move for this set, dealing decent damage and carrying perfect accuracy; if the handy burn chance kicks in, Chinchou becomes incredibly difficult to break on the physical side. Volt Switch is an excellent option in the last slot for coverage and momentum, but Discharge can be used if you do not want to switch Chinchou out, while also having a decent paralysis chance, even if it doesn't mesh well with Scald's burn chance. Heal Bell can also be used if your team needs the support badly; it also instantly wakes Chinchou if Sleep Talk picks it.

Set Details
========

The given EVs and nature hit Eviolite numbers and net Chinchou 25 / 21 / 21 defenses after Eviolite, meaning it can be quite difficult to break through both physically and specially without boosted or super effective attacks, with the remainder of the EVs being dumped into Speed so Chinchou can Speed tie with opposing 14 Speed Chinchou. If special attackers are deemed more important for Chinchou to check, a spread of 76 HP / 132 Def / 228 SpD / 60 Spe with a Calm nature can also work, granting it 25 / 18 / 24 defenses instead. Volt Absorb is once again the preferred ability to take incoming Electric-type attacks, and it allows Chinchou to check certain other variants of Chinchou by outlasting them. Because this Chinchou has recovery in the form of Rest, Eviolite is almost always the item of choice for maximum defensive potential.

Usage Tips
========

Always make sure to think ahead about your opponent's attack. If they've worn Chinchou down to where they can knock it into critical range on the next turn, you're usually better off using Rest instead of attempting to KO them, unless you have no use for Chinchou outside of beating that specific Pokemon. As mentioned before, this Chinchou set is a wonderful status absorber for the team as it can heal the status off through Rest. This Chinchou set isn't particularly powerful, but can still make for a solid pivot.

Team Options
========

As with the previous set, this Chinchou pairs well with Pokemon that are able to cover Chinchou's weaknesses to Grass- and Ground-type attacks, such as Fletchling and Vullaby, with those that are also able to utilize VoltTurn being ideal. This Chinchou can fit in on any team that is having trouble with Flying-type spam and can act as a decent glue Pokemon in general thanks to its nice overall bulk. If Heal Bell is chosen, Pokemon that appreciate a cleric also make good teammates.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Hydro Pump / Scald
move 3: Dazzling Gleam / Ice Beam
move 4: Thunderbolt
ability: Volt Absorb
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 52 Def / 232 SpA / 224 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Although Choice Scarf Chinchou might not be as popular as it was when Gligar was around, it is by no means any worse; in fact, its rarity can actually work to its benefit due to surprise value. Choice Scarf Chinchou acts as a solid revenge killer and decent late-game sweeper while also checking some threats thanks to its typing. Volt Switch is a spammable STAB move which gives your team momentum, although you should be careful of using it around immunities. Hydro Pump and Scald can both function as Chinchou's Water-type STAB move of choice, depending on whether you prefer power or accuracy and a burn chance. The other two moves are filler; Dazzling Gleam is able to take out standard Dragon Dance Scraggy after one layer of Spikes but doesn't do much else, while Ice Beam can be used to hit Dragon- and Grass-types, although Dragon-types are scarce in the current metagame, and bulkier Grass-types are usually able to avoid the 2HKO from Ice Beam anyway. Thunderbolt is used in the last slot in case the extra damage over Volt Switch is needed or it would be preferable not to switch out.

Set Details
========

Maximizing Special Attack and Speed EVs makes Chinchou as offensively threatening as possible, with the remaining EVs being put into Defense to better take on priority moves. A Modest nature is necesary for more power, as Chinchou's damage output might be underwhelming otherwise. Volt Absorb grants Chinchou more switch-in opportunities and is the only way this Chinchou variant can recover HP outside of support from teammates.

Usage Tips
========

This Chinchou set can be somewhat frail due to its lack of Eviolite or Berry Juice, and as such, it should be treated as an offensive Pokemon, meaning switching into unresisted moves is not recommended under most circumstances. As mentioned previously, refrain from spamming Volt Switch if the opponent packs an immunity to the move, especially if it's Diglett, as Chinchou will be locked into Volt Switch and can't switch out of Diglett's Arena Trap. Luring in Ground-type Pokemon and knocking them out with STAB Water-type moves will make using Volt Switch less risky later on in the match.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can take advantage of the momentum Chinchou brings by also utilizing VoltTurn while covering Chinchou's weaknesses are good teammates. Fletchling, Taillow, and Vullaby all fit the bill. Larvesta in particular can fire off massively powerful U-turns and spread burns with Flame Body or Will-O-Wisp, which helps to compensate for Chinchou's lower Defense. Because this Chinchou variant switches so much while not having many ways to recover HP, Rapid Spin or Defog support can be beneficial; Vullaby and Archen are two Pokemon with access to both Defog and U-turn. Pokemon to deal with bulky Normal- and Fairy-types that Chinchou is unable to muscle through, such as Mienfoo for the former and Magnemite for the latter, make for solid teammates.

Other Options
########

Chinchou's movepool gives it a variety of options, but the majority of the relevant ones are already listed. Ice Beam can be used on one of the non-Choice Scarf sets to hit Grass-types, but it doesn't hit much else, and most bulky Grass-types will be able to shrug it off anyway. Hidden Power Grass or Ground can be used on the Choice Scarf set to hit opposing Chinchou, with Hidden Power Ground also hitting Magnemite hard, but they fail to 3HKO defensive Eviolite Chinchou, and due to Choice Scarf Chinchou's lack of recovery, it will usually end up losing regardless. Agility can turn Chinchou into a sweeper, but it is difficult to set up, and Chinchou lacks the raw power needed to sweep. Chinchou has access to Confuse Ray and Thunder Wave, but such a strategy is unreliable at best. It is a decent Rain Dance setter, as it can abuse Thunder and boosted Hydro Pumps with such a set. Toxic cripples Porygon and Berry Juice Munchlax, but has extremely limited utility outside of that. Hidden Power Fire hits Ferroseed and Snover hard, but is a mediocre option if those two aren't on the opposing team, and neither is especially common in the current metagame.

Checks & Counters
########

**Diglett**: Although not really a counter, Diglett, once it is in safely against Chinchou, is able to trap and remove it from the game with STAB Earthquake, although Life Orb and one layer of entry hazards are required to outright OHKO the RestTalk variant.

**Special Walls:** RestTalk Munchlax and Download Porygon, if it gets the Special Attack boost, are almost always able to beat all variants of Chinchou except those that carry Soak, although Chinchou can simply Volt Switch out. Spritzee, Recycle Munchlax, and Trace Porygon can usually beat the Choice Scarf sets and bulky attacker sets without Soak, but risk getting PP stalled out by the RestTalk variant.

**Bulky Grass-types:** Bulky Grass-types, such as Foongus, Lileep, Ferroseed, and Snover, are all able to wall common variants of Chinchou and force it out with STAB Grass-type attacks; Lileep in particular gains a Special Attack boost from Chinchou's Water-type STAB thanks to Storm Drain. However, none of them will want to deal with Soak Chinchou.

**Bulky Fighting-types Unconcerned About Burns:** Timburr and Croagunk can reliably beat Chinchou in a one-on-one situation unless Chinchou carries Soak, as the former doesn't mind Scald burns and the latter is immune to Scald entirely thanks to Dry Skin, but both will get worn down by Volt Switch.

**Opposing Chinchou:** Bulky variants of Chinchou that carry Hidden Power Ground or Grass will usually win against those that do not, as well as Choice Scarf Chinchou.

**Powerful Physical Attackers:** Drilbur can check Chinchou by switching into Electric-type moves and forcing it out with the threat of a STAB Earthquake, but will not appreciate Water-type moves. Excluding the RestTalk variant, strong physical attackers in general are able to prey on Chinchou's lower Defense, but most will not want to be burned by Scald.
