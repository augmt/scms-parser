Overview
########

Bunnelby has a great Attack stat by virtue of Huge Power and lots of coverage moves, making it an excellent wallbreaker. Bunnelby also has a decent Speed stat, although it typically needs to be assisted by Choice Scarf or Sticky Web. Unfortunately, Bunnelby struggles against many prominent threats such as Fighting-types, Pawniard, and Fletchling. It has very poor bulk and lacks useful resistances, which leaves it vulnerable to many priority attacks. Bunnelby can be a huge offensive threat, but it definitely requires support to do so.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Return
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Iron Head
ability: Huge Power
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 228 Atk / 52 Def / 220 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Return is Bunnelby's most powerful STAB move and hits incredibly hard. U-turn allows Bunnelby to wear down its checks and counters and preserve momentum. Earthquake provides excellent coverage with Return, hitting many Steel- and Rock-types. Iron Head hits foes that resist Return + Earthquake coverage, namely Ghost-types such as Gastly, Pumpkaboo, and Drifloon neutrally and Archen super effectively. Quick Attack can also be used over a coverage move to give Bunnelby's team additional priority but leaves Bunnelby easily walled.

Set Details
========

Choice Scarf allows Bunnelby to outspeed all unboosted Pokemon in the tier. A Jolly nature enables Bunnelby to outspeed other common Choice Scarf users such as Scraggy and Magnemite; however, an Adamant nature ensures Bunnelby hits as hard as possible. The EV spread maximizes Bunnelby's offensive capabilities, with the remaining EVs invested into Defense to better handle priority moves.

Usage Tips
========

Bunnelby's primary use in the early parts of the game is to revenge kill and wear down its own checks. Once priority users and checks, such as Pawniard or Ferroseed, have been removed, Bunnelby is able to sweep. It's especially important to remove priority move users because many of them can KO Bunnelby after minimal damage.

Team Options
========

Pursuit support from Pokemon such as Pawniard and Stunky helps greatly in allowing Bunnelby to clean late-game with Return. Diglett helps remove foes resistant to Return as well because of its ability to trap and KO many Rock- and Steel-types. A check to Fighting-types is very important when using Bunnelby, with Spritzee being an excellent choice. Any Pokemon that can beat common priority move users, especially Pawniard and Fletchling, is very helpful. Ponyta is able to beat both of them, provided Stealth Rock is not on your side of the field. Entry hazards enable Bunnelby to KO Pokemon that rely on Sturdy and provide enough chip damage to obtain important 2HKOs.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Return
move 2: Quick Attack
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Iron Head / Thief
ability: Huge Power
item: Life Orb
evs: 228 Atk / 52 Def / 220 Spe
ivs: 23 HP
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Return is Bunnelby's best STAB option and hits incredibly hard. Quick Attack is vital for revenge killing many frail Pokemon such as Carvanha and Fletchling. Earthquake has great coverage in conjunction with Return, as it heavily damages or KOes Rock- and Steel-types. Iron Head punishes Archen and Dwebble, which are otherwise good checks to Bunnelby, and is a great move for hitting Ghost-types such as Gastly, Drifloon, and Pumpkaboo, all of which could completely wall Bunnelby without it. Thief is specifically for hitting Ghost-types, notably Pumpkaboo-XL and Frillish.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Bunnelby's offensive capabilities and the remainder is put into Defense to better take on priority moves. Reduced HP IVs ensure Bunnelby takes minimal Life Orb recoil, due to the recoil rounding down. Life Orb transforms Bunnelby into a threatening wallbreaker and a tough Pokemon to switch into. An Adamant nature helps Bunnelby hit as hard as possible, though a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed all Magnemite and Speed tie with Pawniard.

Usage Tips
========

Avoid switching Bunnelby directly into battle due to its low bulk, absence of resistances, and tendency to being worn down by Life Orb. Bring Bunnelby in safely as much as possible with the use of slow pivot move users. If Bunnelby ever gets hit by a Knock Off or another item-removing move, Thief can be used to take an item.

Team Options
========

Life Orb Bunnelby goes exceptionally well with Sticky Web because it lacks the Speed to handle faster threats. Surskit is considered the most viable option for Sticky Web, but Spinarak may be used to switch into the Fighting-types that threaten Bunnelby. Bulky pivots such as Mienfoo and Chinchou provide Bunnelby with opportunities to come into battle. Depending on Bunnelby's coverage move, a teammate to handle Archen or bulky Ghost-types may be necessary. Pawniard nicely handles Archen, and Pursuit traps Ghost-types.

Other Options
########

Wild Charge could be used over Iron Head to hit Archen and Frillish super effectively, but it comes with unwanted recoil and worse coverage and can be abused more easily if locked into. Bounce hits Fighting-types but is extremely obvious and isn't able to KO in most cases. Brick Break hits Steel-types, but Earthquake is almost always better. Bunnelby has many boosting moves such as Bulk Up, Agility, and Power-Up Punch, but boosting sets are all incredibly vulnerable to priority. Bunnelby has access to Spikes, but it lacks the bulk to effectively use them. Stone Edge or Rock Slide may be used to hit Archen as well as the Fire-types that threaten to burn Bunnelby but unfortunately has worse accuracy than Iron Head and inferior coverage. A set with Salac Berry, Flail, and Focus Sash or Endure is incredibly threatening to any teams lacking priority, but it is also hard to pull off.

Checks & Counters
########

**Priority Moves**: Bunnelby's poor bulk means that many priority move users such as Fletchling or Pawniard can KO it after very little prior damage.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types struggle immensely to switch in but are typically able to survive any attack and threaten to easily OHKO Bunnelby. Timburr and Croagunk are especially menacing because of their Fighting-type priority moves.

**Ghost-types**: Although they may fear some of Bunnelby's coverage moves, many Ghost-types can take advantage of moves Choice Scarf Bunnelby gets locked into. Ghost-types such as Gastly and Drifloon are also faster than the Life Orb set and threaten to greatly hinder, damage, or KO Bunnelby. Other Ghost-types such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Frillish are very bulky and may be able to completely wall Bunnelby.

**Ferroseed**: Ferroseed's incredible bulk lets it come in on any of Bunnelby's attacks. It also punishes Bunnelby's contact moves, specifically U-turn, due to Iron Barbs. Ferroseed can use Bunnelby to set up entry hazards or choose to cripple it with Thunder Wave.

**Status**: Being burnt or paralyzed can completely ruin Bunnelby's offensive presence. It also lacks the bulk to effectively stall through sleep turns and will usually be relegated to death fodder.
