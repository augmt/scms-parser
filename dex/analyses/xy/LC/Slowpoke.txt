Overview
########

With a very unique typing and outstanding defensive stats, Slowpoke easily distinguishes itself as one of the tier's most solid walls. Its ability, Regenerator, gives it a unique niche that allows it to switch in and wall a multitude of threats without sustaining too much damage in the long run. This, coupled with Slowpoke's high HP and Defense, useful resistance to Fighting-type moves, and access to support moves such as Thunder Wave, Slack Off, and Scald, makes Slowpoke a very difficult wall to muscle past. Unfortunately, Slowpoke does have quite a list of weaknesses and a pitiful Special Attack stat, making it relatively easy to defend against. Still, its bulk and longevity make it one of the tier's best walls.

Moves
========

Scald is Slowpoke's STAB attack of choice, being able to hit things decently hard and also potentially burn them. Slack Off is a reliable form of recovery, letting Slowpoke heal itself while continuing to wall the opposition. Thunder Wave can cripple offensive opponents, making it easier for teammates to handle them later. Finally, Psychic is a secondary STAB move that hits the Fighting-types that Slowpoke walls for a fair amount of damage. As an added bonus, it also hits Poison-types, and can help deter them from trying to inflict status on Slowpoke. Fire Blast can also be used in the last slot to nail Steel-, Bug-, and Grass-types that give Slowpoke problems, making it harder to switch into.

Set Details
========

This set's main goal is to wall physical attackers and act as a bulky tank to support Slowpoke's team. A high Defense stat and Regenerator make Slowpoke a very solid Pokemon that can be difficult to KO and almost impossible to wear down. With Scald and Thunder Wave, Slowpoke can easily wall, cripple, and outlast loads of common powerhouses. Slowpoke's longevity and ability to switch in many more times than its opponents make it a long-lasting support Pokemon that can easily sponge attacks and cripple offensive sweepers. Its typing also helps it wall many Fighting-types, but the buff to Knock Off makes this slightly risky against certain Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr. In addition, Slowpoke's weaknesses to common attacking types and attacks such as Volt Switch and U-turn make it difficult to wall many common top-tier threats.

Usage Tips
========

Because of its ability, Slowpoke can easily heal itself after most minor misplays. Despite this, Slowpoke shouldn't be used randomly. It should be used against physical attackers that can't reliably and continuously hit it super effectively. Once in, Slowpoke should cripple its opponent with either Scald or Thunder Wave. The EVs give Slowpoke a small boost in power, so Scald and Psychic will deal decent damage to anything they hit super effectively. If Slowpoke sustains too much damage or the opponent switches into a counter, Slowpoke can either heal itself with Slack Off or switch out and heal with Regenerator. Slowpoke should watch out for mixed attackers, as its Special Defense stat isn't very high and it is susceptible to repeated strong special STABs. Slowpoke also has to watch out for Knock Off, which hits hard and cripples it by removing its Eviolite.

Team Options
========

Slowpoke can easily fit into a multitude of defensive cores since it doesn't fear switching out because of Regenerator. Grass-types are the best partners for Slowpoke, because they resist the Grass- and Electric-type attacks that Slowpoke is weak to, while Slowpoke resists the Fire- and Ice-type attacks that threaten them. Notable Grass-types include Foongus and Ferroseed. Fairy-types also work well with Slowpoke. They can absorb Dark- and Bug-type attacks while Slowpoke beats Poison-types, the Fairies' bane. Spritzee gets a special mention, as it can provide Aromatherapy and Wish support for Slowpoke, which Slowpoke really appreciates. In general, Pokemon that can handle Grass-, Electric-, and Dark-types are ideal partners for Slowpoke. Pawniard is notable, as it has good type synergy with Slowpoke and appreciates the paralysis support that Slowpoke provides. Vullaby, too, gets a special mention as it can easily wall many of the Pokemon that Slowpoke can't, such as Bellsprout and Scraggy. Together, they can handle most of the tier aside from Electric-types, forming a very solid core.

Other Options
########

Slowpoke has a load of other options. Yawn can be used to put troublesome opponents to sleep and force switches. It also makes Slowpoke difficult to switch into. Surf hits harder than Scald, but lacks the ability to burn. Slowpoke can use Zen Headbutt if it chooses to attack physically, as its Attack stat is a bit higher than its Special Attack. Slowpoke can also run a neat Trick Room set, and while it doesn't have the power to take advantage of the effect itself, Regenerate lets it switch in and out to set it up for teammates. Finally, Slowpoke can run Trick with a Choice item to try to catch a bulky opponent off guard.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: In general, Grass-types are the best answers to Slowpoke. They don't mind Scald or Psychic and can stomach paralysis. They can KO Slowpoke with Grass-type STAB attacks. However, certain Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Snover must watch out for Fire Blast, which will deal serious damage to them.

**Dark-types**: Dark-types are also scary. While they don't appreciate burns or paralysis, they can come in and Knock Off Slowpoke's Eviolite, removing much of its bulk and dealing tons of damage. Dark-types such as Carvanha and Pawniard can deal heavy damage with their super effective STAB attacks.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types are immune to Thunder Wave and don't mind sponging a few hits in order to KO Slowpoke. Chinchou is one of Slowpoke's best counters, as Thunder Wave heals it and it resists Scald. Chinchou can also use Heal Bell to heal its teammates of status inflicted by Slowpoke. Magnemite can easily switch in against Psychic and KO Slowpoke with Thunderbolt.

**Knock Off**: Knock Off is severely crippling to Slowpoke. Not only does it deal super effective damage, but it also removes Slowpoke's Eviolite, severely reducing its bulk.

**Toxic**: Slowpoke in general doesn't mind Toxic, but it is a useful status condition to keep Slowpoke on its toes by putting a timer on it.
