Overview
########

Lotad has a unique typing with a nice STAB combination; however, it has low stats. It depends on rain to work well, as Swift Swim, gives Lotad a small niche on rain teams by doubling its Speed. It has a nice movepool which includes powerful STAB moves. However, Lotad is weak to common types in Flying and Bug.

move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Rain Dance
move 3: Giga Drain / Energy Ball
move 4: Ice Beam
ability: Swift Swim
item: Life Orb
evs: 116 Def / 196 SpA / 196 Spe
ivs: 19 HP
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========

This is the only viable set that Lotad should run. Rain Dance doubles Lotad's Speed. Hydro Pump and Giga Drain are the main STAB moves. Energy ball could be used over Giga Drain for its higher damage output, but Giga Drain's recovery is usually more useful than a chance to OHKO Chinchou after Stealth Rock. Ice Beam is for coverage, hitting Flying-types hard. Surf or Scald can be used over Hydro Pump for their accuracy and utility, respectively, but Lotad's mediocre Special Attack usually makes them not worth it.

Set Details
========

A Modest nature allows Lotad to hit 24 Speed under rain, while a Timid nature lets it hit 26 Speed, which allows it to outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Chinchou, Jolly Choice Scarf Drilbur, and Jolly Choice Scarf Mienfoo. With a Modest nature, Lotad Speed ties with Jolly Choice Scarf Bunnelby, Jolly Choice Scarf Cranidos, Modest Choice Scarf Chinchou, Adamant Choice Scarf Drilbur, and Adamant Choice Scarf Mienfoo. It is also important to note that reducing Lotad's HP IVs to 19 allows it to take less damage from Life Orb recoil; the EVs maximize Lotad's both Special Attack and Speed, while slightly boosting its defenses.

Usage Tips
========

Switch Lotad in after a foe has been KOed or through a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. Set the rain up and sweep while predicting correctly. Preserving Lotad until late-game until its main counters, such as Ferroseed, Mantyke, and Munchlax, are KOed is advisable.

Team Options
========

Lotad is rain-dependent, so it's nice to have other Rain Dance users that can support it. Also, entry hazards are beneficial, allowing Lotad to secure some important KOs.
Ferroseed can be a good teammate for this reason, while Chinchou can be useful to deal with Mantyke and provide rain support, and Scraggy is a powerful teammate that can deal with Munchlax, supporting Lotad's sweep.

Other Options
########

Although Lotad is able to utilize a SubSeead set, it is outclassed in that role by other Grass-types such as Cottonee.

Checks & Counters
#######

**Special Tanks and Walls:** Pokemon with decent special bulk are obviously Lotad's main counters; for example, Croagunk can take any hit from Lotad thanks to its type and ability.

**Strong Priority Abusers**: Fletchling can revenge kill Lotad with ease thanks to its access to Gale Wings Acrobatics.

**Weather Inducers** Weather setters such as Vulpix and Snover can easily revenge kill Lotad by removing the rain that Lotad relies on.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Faster Choice Scarf users can easily KO Lotad, due to its fraility.
