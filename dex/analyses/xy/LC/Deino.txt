Overview
########

Deino isn't the best to use competitive-wise. It has decent bulk with a unique typing, but the introduction of Fairy-types hurts its usefulness. It also has a decent Attack stat, but a poor Speed stat, which forces it to run a Choice Scarf. The only reason to use Deino is Hustle, but it is quite unreliable. With its small niche in Little Cup, Deino just barely manages to be useful on teams as a revenge killer and a late-game cleaner.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Superpower
move 4: Zen Headbutt
ability: Hustle
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 20 HP / 236 Atk / 36 Def / 212 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

STAB Outrage has insane power with Hustle, but is somewhat unfavorable to be locked into due to Fairy-types. Crunch is the reliable secondary STAB move of choice, with good coverage. Superpower provides coverage on Steel- and Rock-types. Lastly, Zen Headbutt is for coverage on Poison-types such as Trubbish and Fighting-types such as Mienfoo.

Set Details
========

The EV spread used maximizes Speed and Attack, its two most prominent stats, while the rest is put in HP and Defense to boost Deino's bulk. A Jolly nature is used to maximize Speed so that Deino can outspeed most of the tier with a Choice Scarf. Lastly, Hustle gives Deino its niche, and is the only ability to consider using.

Usage Tips
========

Use Deino as a late-game cleaner or a revenge killer, as that is all it is capable of. Before trying to clean late-game, make sure all Pokemon with Sturdy aren't at full HP. Entry hazards aid tremendously in this case.

Team Options
========

Poison-types such as Foongus, Trubbish, and Croagunk are good teammates, as they resist Fairy-type moves and can pick off Fighting-types for Deino. Additionally, Trubbish also makes a good teammate as it can lay Spikes for Deino to have an easier time cleaning. Finally, Ghost-types make good teammates as they are immune to Fighting-type moves. Honedge and Gastly stand out, as they also resist Fairy.

Other Options
########

Deino can use Fire Fang and Ice Fang to hit Cottonee, but outside of that, those moves have little use. A bulky Eviolite set can be used with Thunder Wave and Dragon Tail, but other Eviolite users such as Lickitung generally work better. Lastly, a Rest and Sleep Talk set with Dragon Tail can be used, but isn't recommended.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Snubbull, Cottonee, and Spritzee can all take a hit and KO with either Play Rough, Dazzling Gleam, or Moonblast, respectively. They can all come in on a Choice-locked Outrage and finish Deino off.

**Fighting-types**: Mienfoo, Timburr, and Scraggy are all really good Pokemon that deal with Deino. Scarf Mienfoo beats and outspeeds it, Timburr can tank a hit and use Drain Punch or Mach Punch if it's weakened, and Scraggy can tank a hit, set up, and Drain Punch, or just use Drain Punch.

**Physical Walls**: Physical walls such as Spritzee and Hippopotas can easily take any hit and retaliate with their respective STAB moves. They can also recover any health they lost in the process with their recovery moves.

**Status**: Deino is especially weak to status, as burns halve its Attack, paralysis slows it down, and poison whittles its health down and limits its switch-ins.
