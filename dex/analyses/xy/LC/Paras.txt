Overview
########

Paras has a small niche in Little Cup thanks to its access to useful moves such as Spore, Knock Off, and Aromatherapy, as well as a very helpful ability in Dry Skin, which gives it an immunity to Water-type moves. Its Bug / Grass typing provides it with useful resistances to Electric-, Fighting-, Grass-, and Ground-type moves, giving it plenty of opportunities to switch in and support the team. Its positive traits end there, however, as its typing leaves it with a whopping six weaknesses, including 4x weaknesses to both Fire- and Flying-type moves, as well as a weakness to Stealth Rock. In addition to this, Paras has very low Speed and HP stats, making it even tougher for it to perform its role well.

Moves
========

Paras is one of only three Pokemon in Little Cup with access to the 100% accurate Spore, allowing Paras to reliably put a foe to sleep as long as it isn't immune to powder moves or sleep. Knock Off allows Paras to cripple Pokemon that switch into it by removing their items and ensures that Paras isn't dead weight against opposing Grass-types. Bullet Seed hits reasonably hard coming off Paras's base 70 Attack and provides Paras with a useful STAB move as well as a method of dealing with Focus Sash, Sturdy, and Substitute users. Aromatherapy can be used instead to heal Paras and its teammates of status. Synthesis allows Paras to stay healthy throughout the match so that it can continue to check Water- and Fighting-types.

Set Details
========

76 HP EVs let Paras hit 21 HP, allowing it to switch into Stealth Rock four times without fainting. An Impish nature and 236 Defense EVs give Paras good physical bulk, allowing it to act as a good check to Fighting-types. The remaining EVs are put into Special Defense and Attack to boost Paras's bulk and damage output. Dry Skin gives Paras a useful immunity to Water-type moves at the cost of an even larger weakness to Fire-type attacks, but this is hardly a drawback, as Paras is OHKOed by every relevant Fire-type attack regardless of Dry Skin.

Usage Tips
========

Paras should try to switch into Water-type moves such as Scald if possible, as these moves will heal Paras thanks to Dry Skin. In addition to its Water immunity, Paras has plenty of other resistances that it can take advantage of when it switches in, such as Ground, Grass, and Fighting. Be wary of switching into potential U-turn or Volt Switch users, however, as Paras has very exploitable weaknesses and is easily forced out. Spore should be used as soon as possible to take an opposing Pokemon out of commission. Keep in mind that Grass-types, as well as Overcoat users such as Vullaby, are immune to Spore, so Paras should use Knock Off against these potential switch-ins to remove their items. After a foe has been put to sleep by Spore, the free turn can be used to heal up with Synthesis, use Aromatherapy, cripple the switch-in with Knock Off, or switch to a teammate.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate solid switch-ins to Fighting-types, such as Pawniard, have good synergy with Paras. Pokemon that resist Fire- and Flying-type moves, such as Archen and Chinchou, pair well with Paras, as they can patch up its biggest weaknesses. In return, Paras can cover Archen's weaknesses to Electric- and Water-type moves, as well as Chinchou's weaknesses to Ground- and Grass-type moves. Houndour is a great teammate, as it gains a Flash Fire boost from Fire-type moves aimed at Paras and can easily take down the Grass-type Pokemon that give Paras trouble. However, keep in mind that the two share a weakness to Rock-type moves. Teammates that can remove entry hazards, such as Vullaby and Drilbur, make for good teammates, as Paras is vulnerable to all entry hazards and weak to Stealth Rock.

Other Options
########

Swords Dance is an option to boost Attack, but Paras is too slow to make good use of the boost. Because the foe will often switch out after being put to sleep by Spore, Stun Spore can be used to cripple another one of the opponent's Pokemon as it switches in. Counter is an option to heavily punish U-turn users. X-Scissor is a decently powerful STAB move and can be used to hit Grass-types, which are immune to Spore, but the most common Grass-types in the metagame, Ferroseed, Foongus, Cottonee, and Pumpkaboo-XL, are only hit neutrally by the move. Since Paras often switches into Fighting-types, which often carry Knock Off, Thief is an option to steal the foe's item. Leech Seed is an option to help wear down the opponent's team. Brick Break can be used to smack Pawniard and Houndour on the switch. Agility gives Paras a much-needed boost to its Speed, but Paras's mediocre coverage and susceptibility to priority such as Fletchling's Acrobatics make it a very lackluster sweeper. Effect Spore could be used over Dry Skin, but it's luck-based and situational at best.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Foongus and Ferroseed are perhaps the best counters to Paras, as they are immune to Spore and aren't heavily threatened by any of its moves. Foongus threatens Paras with Sludge Bomb, while Ferroseed can use Paras as an opportunity to set up entry hazards.

**Other Pokemon Immune to Spore**: Overcoat users such as Vullaby and Shelmet are immune to Spore and can handle Paras with their STAB moves. Other Pokemon such as Spinarak and Magby are immune to sleep altogether thanks to Insomnia and Vital Spirit, respectively, and can defeat Paras with their STAB moves.

**Flying-types**: Flying-types such as Fletchling and Archen can easily defeat Paras with their STAB attacks.

**Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Vulpix, Ponyta, and Larvesta can easily KO Paras with their STAB moves. Larvesta in particular can gain momentum on Paras with U-turn.

**Poison-types**: Once Sleep Clause has been activated, Paras can't do much to opposing Poison-types such as Koffing and Croagunk, which heavily threaten Paras with their STAB Poison-type moves.
