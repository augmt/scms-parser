Magnemite can function well as a bulky attacker thanks to the combination of Berry Juice and Sturdy. Sadly, the Steel-type lost its resistance to Ghost- and Dark-type moves in XY, making Magnemite a less reliable check to Pokemon such as Gastly and Pawniard. In addition, Magnemite heavily relies on items, so the Knock Off buff greatly hurt hurts it as well. Not all is dark for Magnemite though, as the Steel-type is super effective against the new Fairy-type Pokemon, meaning that it can counter or check Pokemon like Spritzee and Snubbull. It was also given a gift with the unbanning of Berry Juice, allowing it to be a top notch abuser of the infamous Berry Juice and Sturdy combo. Magnemite's Choice Scarf set can also still function as a solid revenge killer, and its typing still allows it to function as a good pivot for offensive teams, with its ability to Volt Switch out of threats, absorb paralysis, and keep pressure on the opponent with its solid coverage.


Sturdy + Berry Juice
########
name: Sturdy + Berry Juice
move 1: Flash Cannon
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Grass
move 4: Recycle / Thunderbolt
ability: Sturdy
item: Berry Juice
evs: 240 SpA / 236 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========
Flash Cannon is Magnemite's primary STAB move due to its decent Base Power and super effective coverage against Fairy-type Pokemon. Volt Switch allows Magnemite to maintain momentum against several of its checks and counters, including Ponyta, Larvesta, and Ferroseed. Hidden Power Ground hits opposing Magnemite and Chinchou for super effective damage, while Hidden Power Grass can do the same to Chinchou and Ground-types. Thunderbolt is as an alternative Electric-type STAB move that is more powerful than Volt Switch and does not force Magnemite out, while Recycle allows Magnemite to reuse its Berry Juice after it has been consumed.

Set Details
========
Sturdy is the recommended ability, as it prevents Magnemite from being OHKOed by any attack at full health. Berry Juice allows Magnemite to recover any damage taken from powerful attacks and also restores Sturdy so that it can activate again. Modest is the recommended nature to maximize Magnemite's Special Attack, allowing it to hit as hard as possible. A Timid nature can alternatively be used to outspeed threats such as Shellder, Adamant Scraggy, and Porygon.

Usage Tips
========
Magnemite should generally avoid switching into Knock Off users such as Pawniard, as it is crippled by the loss of Berry Juice. Spikes and Stealth Rock should also be removed before switching Magnemite in to preserve Sturdy. If Magnemite is not at full health and is not in a position where the foe's attacks will bring it into Berry Juice's activation range, then it should be used with caution.

Magnemite should be used as both a lure and a pivot. Due to its 4x weakness to Ground-type moves, Magnemite can often lure Ground-types such as Diglett and Hippopotas, survive the impending Ground-type move, and often 2HKO them in return with Flash Cannon. Once all Ground-types are eliminated, Magnemite can maintain momentum with Volt Switch, allowing it to pivot in and out of the match.

Team Options
========
Foongus is an exceptional partner for Magnemite, as it counters Chinchou and checks the Fighting-types that generally give Magnemite trouble. Trubbish is also a great partner, as it can consistently switch into Knock Off users thanks to its ability Sticky Hold and resistance to Fighting-type moves. Spritzee also keeps many Fighting-types in check and can provide Wish support to help keep Magnemite's Sturdy ability intact. Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Drilbur is recommended to prevent Sturdy from being neutralized by entry hazards. Other Pokemon with U-turn and Volt Switch, including Chinchou and Mienfoo, are great partners to preserve momentum. If Magnemite is not using Hidden Power Ground, then teammates that can deal with Chinchou, such as the previously mentioned Foongus, are good partners.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Flash Cannon
move 3: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Grass
move 4: Thunderbolt
ability: Sturdy
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 240 SpA / 236 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Magnemite reaches 21 Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Volt Switch is Magnemite's primary STAB attack due to its decent Base Power and allows Magnemite to maintain momentum against several of its checks. Flash Cannon is Magnemite's secondary STAB move, hitting Fairy- and Ground-types for decent damage. Hidden Power Ground hits opposing Magnemite and Chinchou for super effective damage, while Hidden Power Grass can be used instead to hurt Chinchou and Ground-types. Thunderbolt is an alternate Electric-type STAB move, as it is stronger than Volt Switch and does not force Magnemite out, potentially allowing it to sweep the foe's team late-game.

Set Details
========
Sturdy is the recommended ability, as it allows Magnemite to survive any attack at full health. A Modest nature is used to maximize Magnemite's power. A Timid nature is not recommended as an alternative here because Choice Scarf Magnemite already outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame, making a Timid nature rather pointless unless you specifically want to outspeed a few boosted threats.

Usage Tips
========
As with the previous set, Magnemite should generally avoid switching into Knock Off users such as Pawniard, as it can no longer function as a revenge killer if it loses its Choice Scarf. Entry hazards should also be removed to keep Sturdy intact. If Magnemite is at 1 HP, it should be wary of priority moves such as Fletchling's Acrobatics and Croagunk's Vacuum Wave.

Team Options
========
Foongus, again, is an exceptional partner for Magnemite, as it can counter Chinchou and can check Fighting-types that generally give Magnemite trouble. Trubbish is also an excellent partner due to its ability to consistently switch into Knock Off users and Fighting-types. Spritzee is able to counter a majority of Fighting-types in the tier and is able to keep Magnemite's Sturdy ability intact with Wish. Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Drilbur is recommended to prevent Sturdy from being neutralized by entry hazards. Other Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Mienfoo and Chinchou, are also good partners to preserve momentum. Pokemon that can defeat Sucker Punch users, like Timburr and Scraggy, are also good partners.

Other Options
########
Magnemite's poor movepool leaves it with only a few viable options apart from the ones found in the main sets. Hidden Power Fire is a viable option on a Magnet Pull set dedicated to trapping Steel-types, but it is generally advised to use Pokemon that can simply counter Steel-types, such as Fighting-types. Using the Analytic ability provides more power when facing faster enemies and on the switch, but losing the survivability of Sturdy is costly. Substitute can be used to take advantage of the switches Magnemite forces. Magnet Rise can also be used to temporarily alleviate Magnemite's weakness to Ground-type moves. Finally, Thunder Wave can be used to lower the opponent's Speed. However, a majority of Magnemite's switch-ins are immune to Thunder Wave, limiting its usefulness.

Checks & Counters
########
**Residual Damage**: Entry hazards, hail, and burns negate Sturdy, making Magnemite prone to being OHKOed by powerful attacks such as Mienfoo's Drain Punch.

**Knock Off**: Knock Off significantly cripples Magnemite by removing its item.

**Ground-types**: Ground-types such as Hippopotas and Drilbur are immune to Volt Switch and Thunderbolt. Drilbur in particular is an excellent check as it can OHKO Magnemite through Sturdy thanks to its Mold Breaker ability.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Foongus don't take much damage from either of Magnemite's STAB moves. Ferroseed can use Magnemite as setup bait for entry hazards, while Foongus can cripple Magnemite with Spore and regain any lost health with Regenerator.

**Fire-types**: Ponyta and Larvesta are not OHKOed by Thunderbolt, have access to reliable recovery, and can either disrupt Magnemite with Will-O-Wisp or directly OHKO it with Flare Blitz.

**Fighting-types**: Bulky Fighting-types such as Mienfoo, Croagunk, and Timburr are not OHKOed by Thunderbolt and can either OHKO Choice Scarf variations of Magnemite with the combination of Drain Punch and a priority move or cripple Magnemite by removing its item with Knock Off.

**Bulky Pivots**: Chinchou takes little to no damage from Magnemite's STAB moves and can deal a large amount of damage to Magnemite with Scald. It must watch out for Hidden Power, however. Porygon and Munchlax do not take much damage from any of Magnemite's attacks, can recover from any damage taken, and deal solid damage in return with Shadow Ball and Earthquake or Fire Punch, respectively.
