Overview
########

Although Shuppet's Speed and defenses are paltry, Shuppet actually has a decent base 75 Attack stat. By carrying a Focus Sash, Shuppet can take advantage of its poor Speed to support a Trick Room team and use its inverted Speed as much as possible. Being immune to Normal- and Fighting-type moves, Shuppet is able to more securely use Knock Off, its main non-priority attack. Unlike the other Ghost-types in LC, Shuppet has access to all of Shadow Sneak, Knock Off, and Destiny Bond. In any case, Shuppet is outclassed by Pumpkaboo as a Trick Room lead, as Explosion is a better move than Knock Off for a Pokemon of this role.

Moves
========

Trick Room allows Shuppet to support its team. While Shadow Sneak is its only priority STAB move, Knock Off can cripple Pokemon that switch into Shuppet, by removing their item. The last slot is for Destiny Bond, allowing Shuppet to KO itself and bring a foe down with it ; however, this only works if Shuppet can outspeed the foe with Trick Room.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread maximizes Attack, and the rest of the EVs are invested into both defenses, which are unsatisfactory. On the other hand, other EVs investiment with Shuppet's Focus Sash and desired low Speed, will be useless. Focus Sash ensures Shuppet can survive one attack and set up Trick Room. Furthermore, it allows for synergy with Destiny Bond if you decide to use it. Frisk is useful to scout for items carried by foes, but Cursed Body could be better. With a 30% chance to disable any move that hits Shuppet, Cursed Body could force any foe to switch out and thereby allow a Trick Room sweeper to beat or force out something it couldn't otherwise. Using Cursed Body usually allows Shuppet to push out Fighting-types, as most Fighting-types only have one means of hitting Ghost-types for decent damage, Timburr and Croagunk in particular.

Usage Tips
========

After Trick Room is set, Shuppet's priority Speed is useful for hitting other Pokemon with Destiny Bond and boosted Knock Off, which can be used as well. A priority move such as Shadow Sneak could be useful to revenge kill foes. By using Destiny Bond, you secure at least one KO before Shuppet faints. With Trick Room, Shuppet can play a different role other than just a suicide lead, but that Shuppet's poor defenses prevent it from safely switching in multiple times to set up Trick Room.

Team Options
========

Pokemon such as Spritzee and Porygon that can set Trick Room while also taking advantage of it make for excellent partners for Shuppet. Slow, offensive Pokemon benefit nicely from Trick Room, utilizing its effects to mend their low Speed stat and sweep opposing teams; Pokemon that can fulfill this role are great comrades for Shuppet, as Bunnelby, Magnemite, Cubone, Golett, Solosis, and Trapinch.

Other Options
########

An Adamant Choice Band set would also profit from Shuppet's priority moves, taking advantage of its synergy with Frisk and Trick. Shuppet's movepool shows many options, some playable and others the very opposite. Shadow Ball is a good STAB move, but it's not so easy to find a free moveslot for it. Sucker Punch has a higher Base Power than Shadow Sneak and could be used as an alternative, but it is only useful if the foe attacks. Furthermore, Payback could be useful, as its Base Power doubles if the foe has taken its turn. Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp could used. Will-O-Wisp can be useful for crippling Knock Off absorbers, for example. Although Shuppet can learn Phantom Force, it's better not to use it, because wasting a turn with Phantom Force must be avoided. Shuppet learns Taunt too but cannot use very well, due to its low Speed.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fletchling**: Fletchling is a good counter to offensive Trick Room Shuppet, as it is not affected by Knock Off or Shadow Sneak, bypasses Trick Room with Gale Wings, and can recover any lost HP using Roost prior to KOing Shuppet.

**Dark-types**: Dark-types threaten Shuppet, as they resist its main moves. Some Dark-types even have access to Sucker Punch and Pursuit. Pawniard, Vullaby, and Scraggy are especially threatening, as they can KO Shuppet with Knock Off.

**Spritzee**: Wish + Protect Spritzee can wall Shuppet easily, but it's quite rare to see Spritzee and Shuppet face-to-face, as Spritzee doesn't want to lose its Eviolite to a lead Pokemon.

**Faster/Prankster Taunt Users**: Cottonee, Prankster Purrloin, Mienfoo, Aipom, and Onix, are prime examples of Pokemon that can outspeed and Taunt Shuppet, preventing it from setting up Trick Room.

**Physically Bulky Pokemon**: Despite Shuppet's good Attack stat, has few strong attacking moves and can only really be threatening with Knock Off. Ferroseed, Lickitung, Porygon, Mienfoo, and Timburr are examples of bulky Pokemon that Shuppet can't easily beat.
