Overview
########

With decent Speed and Defense stats, a good offensive movepool, and a good defensive typing, Skorupi manages to find itself a niche in the Little Cup metagame. There are many things holding Skorupi back, however. Although it has a wide offensive movepool, its Attack stat is far too low to work effectively. Even though it has high Defense, iSkorupi's low Special Defense hinders its overall defensive capabilities. Finally, although Skorupi sports an interesting offensive typing, that typing also leaves it hampered by weaknesses to common Psychic-, Flying-, Rock-, and Fire-type moves.

Moves
========

Toxic Spikes is for spreading status throughout the opposing team and for limiting the switch-ins your opponent can make. Normally, only one layer should be set due to the fast-paced nature of Little Cup. Taunt is a very valuable move that allows Skorupi to block other entry hazard setters, such as Ferroseed and Dwebble. Poison Jab is a reliable STAB move that allows Skorupi to hit Fairy- and Grass-types, most notably Cottonee, hard. Lastly, Knock Off is a great utility move that can remove Eviolite and Life Orb as well as do a great deal of damage to Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon.

Set Details
========

196 EVs go into HP for a decent amount of bulk, while 36 EVs in both Attack and Defense give a small boost for both stats. The last 236 EVs are invested in Speed and, when paired with a Jolly nature, allow Skorupi to hit 17 Speed, which is a very valuable Speed tier for a Taunt user. The ability of choice, Battle Armor, prevents any surprise critical hits. Lastly, Eviolite bolsters defenses, furthering Skorupi's defensive presence.

Usage Tips
========

Skorupi can be used as a sort of suicide lead, since it isn't providing much offensive leverage unless your opponent carries Fairy-types. As a lead, Skorupi likes to Taunt other leads and gain momentum by spreading status amongst your opponent's team via Toxic Spikes. It should watch out for STAB Rock-type attacks, however. If you have set up a layer of Toxic Spikes, you can go for a Knock Off, Skorupi's go-to utility move, to cripple your foe. Finally, always try to stay away from special attackers, as Skorupi's ability to take special hits isn't quite as good as its ability to take physical ones because its Special Defense is very low.

Team Options
========

Gothita makes an exceptional teammate, as it traps and eliminates any Poison-type Pokemon that try to absorb Skorupi's Toxic Spikes. Ground-types such as Diglett work well to beat opposing Rock- and Fire-type Pokemon. Chinchou makes a great teammate, checking threatening Flying- and Fire-type Pokemon for Skorupi. Munchlax makes for an excellent teammate, as it resists Fire-type moves thanks to Thick Fat and can take special moves for Skorupi. Additionally, it can Pursuit trap threatening Psychic-types for Skorupi, while Skorupi walls Fighting-types in return. Rock-types such as Onix and Aron make good teammates, as they can cover Skorupi's Flying- and Fire-type weaknesses. Additionally, Onix is a cool partner for Skorupi because its Stealth Rock complements Skorupi's Toxic Spikes. Rapid Spinners such as Drilbur and Staryu make good teammates to spin away hazards that bother Skorupi. Additionally, Drilbur and Staryu can handle the Fire- and Rock-types that might give Skorupi trouble with their STAB attacks.

Other Options
########

Although Skorupi has a variety of other options, it is typically too weak to utilize them effectively. It has access to a multitude of boosting moves, including Swords Dance, Accupressure, Hone Claws, and Agility. Brick Break can be used to beat threats such as Pawniard and Aron, but Skorupi would rather use its defensive moves most of the time. A Sniper set with Cross Poison, Night Slash, and either Scope Lens or Razor Claw can be used to some success, as a Sniper critical hit amounts to a 2.25x damage boost, which is more than a super effective hit. Whirlwind can be used to reliably phaze physical sweepers with its great Defense stat, as well as to spread Toxic Spikes status. Rock Tomb can be used to deter Flying- and Fire-type opponents, while also lowering the Speed of others. Lastly, Toxic is an alternate option to Toxic Spikes for immediate status spreading, but it does not support Skorupi's teammates as effectively.

Checks & Counters
########

**Flying-types**: Flying-types such as Fletchling, Doduo, Archen, and Vullaby can all outspeed and dispose of Skorupi with their strong STAB attacks. Additionally, they are immune to Toxic Spikes, and many even have the ability to Defog them away.

**Steel-types**: Steel-type Pokemon such as Pawniard, Honedge, and Aron are immune to Toxic Spikes and can wall Skorupi quite effectively. Honedge should be wary of Knock Off, however.

**Rock-types**: Rock-types such as Archen, Dwebble, and Onix can easily take Skorupi out with their super effective STAB moves, while also resisting Skorupi's go-to STAB move, Poison Jab.

**Abra**: Abra is a great check to Skorupi, as it is immune to Toxic Spikes and can OHKO Skorupi with a Psychic. Additionally, it cannot be OHKOed if holding a Focus Sash, which furthers its ability to check Skorupi.

**Fire-types**: Growlithe, Ponyta, Larvesta, and Vulpix can all OHKO Skorupi with their Fire-type STAB moves.

**Poison-types**: Croagunk and Stunky can absorb Skorupi's Toxic Spikes as well as resist both of its attacking moves, rendering Skorupi nearly useless. Setup sweeper variants of Croagunk, such as Bulk Up and Nasty Plot, are especially threatening, as Skorupi cannot touch them.
