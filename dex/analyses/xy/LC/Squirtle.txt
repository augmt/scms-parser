Overview
########

Squirtle's primary role on a team is to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin, but it is outclassed in many ways by Staryu. There are reasons to use Squirtle, however, because of its access to priority moves such as Aqua Jet and Fake Out, better bulk, and the ability to Rapid Spin on Ghost-types thanks to Foresight. Unfortunately, Squirtle has poor Attack and Speed stats so it's typically delegated to being used on more defensive teams, but its lack of recovery hinders it on such team archetypes.

Rapid Spinner
########
name: Rapid Spinner
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Fake Out
move 3: Waterfall
move 4: Ice Punch/Aqua Jet/Foresight
ability: Torrent
item: Eviolite / Berry Juice
evs: 84 HP / 52 Atk / 156 Def / 84 SpD / 92 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Rapid Spin is Squirtle's niche that enables it to clear away opposing entry hazards. Fake Out is important for free chip damage while Waterfall is the STAB move of choice. Ice Punch can be used to hit the majority of Grass-types in the tier, particularly Pumpkaboo, which blocks Rapid Spin. Ice Punch is very weak, however, so Squirtle can forgo it for additional priority in Aqua Jet, which lets Squirtle revenge kill and deal additional chip damage before fainting. Foresight allows Rapid Spin to hit Ghost-types.

Set Details
========

Torrent is the ability of choice, which boosts Squirtle's power when at low HP. The shown EV spread reaches even numbers, which are the optimal numbers to use with an Eviolite. The Speed EVs also allow Squirtle to outspeed many Ghost-types in the tier, especially Honedge and Pumpkaboo-XL, which would want to block Rapid Spin. Squirtle has great bulk and will often have to take a Knock Off to Rapid Spin, so Eviolite is preferred; however, Squirtle does lack recovery, so Berry Juice could potentially be useful.

Usage Tips
========

Squirtle has no recovery, so it's easily worn down. You can avoid this by only switching in when necessary. The most important times to switch Squirtle in are when you need to clear entry hazards or revenge kill with priority. Additionally, using Fake Out on a burned or poisoned target allows for more free damage.

Team Options
========

Anything that appreciates the removal of entry hazards loves having Squirtle as a teammate. Fire- and Flying-types such as Larvesta and Doduo also cover Squirtle's Grass-type weakness, while Squirtle can beat the Ground- or Rock-types that threaten them. Squirtle also works well with Toxic Spikes because you can rack up a lot of free damage after Fake Out and poison damage. If you're not using Toxic Spikes, Staryu will almost always be the better choice. Grass-types cover Squirtle's weaknesses to Grass and Electric. Cottonee is a particularly good teammate because it also dissuades sweepers that would want to set up on Squirtle.

Other Options
########

Squirtle has many physical coverage options such as Brick Break, Bite, and Zen Headbutt, but they are rather weak and Squirtle will often lose to the intended target anyway. Squirtle could use a special set with Scald, Ice Beam, and Aura Sphere, but then Squirtle's biggest niche of having priority moves is gone. Choice Scarf Squirtle with Water Spout has potential, but is outclassed by other users such as Remoraid and Frillish. You could equip Squirtle with a Life Orb to spam hard-hitting priority moves, but Seel is better in this regard. Haze would allow Squirtle to not become setup bait, but most setup sweepers will beat Squirtle anyway. Toxic can be used to hinder walls that Squirtle couldn't otherwise due to its poor offensive stats.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types such as Pumpkaboo and Frillish are good answers to Squirtle. They block Rapid Spin and can Recover off any damage Squirtle does to them.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Chinchou all threaten to do huge damage to Squirtle.

**Grass-types**: Ice Punch is very weak and Grass-types can beat Squirtle even after switching in on it. Ferroseed and Foongus are the most problematic of these.

**Dry Skin, Storm Drain and Water Absorb Users**: Squirtle's non-STAB attacks will do negligible damage to Pokemon immune to Water and they will be able to whittle it down in return. Mantyke in particular doesn't care about Squirtle.

**Water-types**: Squirtle is completely walled by the opposing Water-types and almost every one can beat Squirtle, due to Squirtle's terrible offensive stats and lack of recovery.

**Setup Sweepers**: Any sweeper that doesn't mind Waterfall or Ice Punch can freely set up and wreak havoc on Squirtle and its team.

**Bulky Pokemon**: Squirtle will be easily worn down and generally wont be able to do much back to generally bulky Pokemon, such as Porygon and Spritzee.
