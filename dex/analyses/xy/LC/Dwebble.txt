Overview
########
Dwebble has returned to Generation VI Little Cup, resuming its role as one of the most capable entry hazard setters in the metagame. However, since Berry Juice is no longer banned, many new options have opened up for the little crab. It has become a potent SturdyJuice Pokemon, utilizing this and Shell Smash to become a potent sweeper. With the change of generation, Dwebble has not only maintained its role as a good Pokemon, but has also improved. Despite its incredible utility, Dwebble does have some glaring weaknesses. It’s outclassed as a Shell Smash sweeper by Tirtouga. Dwebble is also weak to Rock-type moves which are common among other entry hazard setters, Water-type moves which some late-game sweepers carry, and Steel-type moves which the now-prominent Pawniard carries.

Entry Hazard Layer
########
name: Entry Hazard Layer
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Spikes
move 3: Rock Blast
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Sturdy
item: Berry Juice
evs: 236 Atk / 236 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Stealth Rock breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy on almost all enemies and helps teammates KO the opposition. Spikes is ideally used after Stealth Rock is set up or if the opponent has no Ground-type immunities, and further assists the team with securing KOs. Rock Blast is the optimal choice as a STAB move for this set as it discourages setup sweepers, Substitute users, and opposing users of Sturdy or Focus Sash from setting up on Dwebble. Knock Off weakens foes by removing their items and delivers a powerful hit, particularly against Ghost- and Psychic-types.

Set Details
========

Berry Juice is the best item for Dwebble as it functions well with Sturdy. By combining Sturdy and Berry Juice, Dwebble is capable of surviving for two or three more turns than expected. 236 Speed EVs allow Dwebble to outspeed the majority of the tier and Speed tie with much of it as well, giving it ample opportunities to set up entry hazards. No EVs should be invested into HP to ensure that Berry Juice will fully heal Dwebble and so reset Sturdy.

Usage Tips
========

Oftentimes, the opponent will assume that Dwebble is carrying Sturdy and Berry Juice. They will subsequently switch out, giving Dwebble an extra turn to lay down entry hazards. This can mean more KOs for your team later on. Leading with Dwebble means that it can get up at least one layer of entry hazards, unless the opposing Pokemon is a Taunt user. Since Knock Off was buffed, Dwebble won't have to deal with as many Ghost-type switch-ins. However, avoid running Dwebble against Fighting-types, especially those using Knock Off and Drain Punch, as they can come out of these encounters victorious and with full health.

Team Options
========

Teammates that can prevent entry hazard removal are ideal, as they defeat this set's entire purpose; Ghost-types like Gastly block Rapid Spin and Prankster Taunt prevents Defog from being used. Defiant Pawniard makes a good teammate that can severely punish an opposing Defog user for trying to get rid of Dwebble's hazards, rewarding Pawniard with a hefty +2 Attack on the switch-in. Water-types like Chinchou cover Dwebble's only two weaknesses, Water- and Steel-type attacks, and are ideal partners for tanking some of the attacks that threaten it. Dwebble really appreciates something to switch into Mienfoo, particularly Taunt variants; Larvesta and Ponyta can threaten with a burn as it uses Fake Out, and Spritzee's ability nullifies Taunt.

SturdyJuice Smash
########
name: SturdyJuice Smash
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: X-Scissor
move 3: Stone Edge / Rock Blast
move 4: Earthquake / Knock Off
ability: Sturdy
item: Berry Juice
evs: 236 Atk / 236 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Shell Smash is the move that really makes Dwebble threatening, because it makes it both powerful and fast in one turn. X-Scissor is a Bug-type STAB that deals considerable damage. Stone Edge is a Rock-type STAB that is very strong, but a bit inaccurate. Rock Blast can be used instead to bypass Focus Sash and Sturdy, and it can potentially deal more damage than Stone Edge, but the number of hits is random, making it unreliable. Though Knock Off helps a bit with coverage, its ability to knock off foes' items is more important to Dwebble. Earthquake is an alternative that provides decent coverage with Dwebble's Rock-type STAB attack, and is notably good for nailing Chinchou. Earthquake is usually more important than Knock Off as it is a means of getting around Steel-types, and provides a neutral move against Fighting-types. Dwebble is usually a late-game sweeper and therefore should rely more on the fact that its counters are already weakened than on moves that weaken them further, but using Knock Off instead of Earthquake helps it function as an early-game wallbreaker.

Set Details
========

Berry Juice is the best item option for Dwebble, as Sturdy guarantees a turn of survival in the vast majority of cases and Berry Juice then restores Dwebble to full health even if it was hit with a move that would normally OHKO, resetting Sturdy in the process. A Speed stat of 15 guarantees it will outspeed most Choice Scarf users after a Shell Smash. Attack is maxed out to optimize Dwebble's sweeping ability after setting up with Shell Smash. No EVs should be placed into HP, as raising Dwebble's HP would keep Berry Juice from resetting Sturdy upon use.

Usage Tips
========

Dwebble can set up with Shell Smash against almost any attacker in the tier. The only Pokemon that it has problems with are Fighting-types with Knock Off, Steel-types, multi-hit moves, especially Rock Blast, Fake Out, which break Sturdy, and status moves, like burns or paralysis. Steel-types are easier to handle if Earthquake is included on the set, but Knock Off can be particularly helpful in breaking down walls.

Team Options
========

Spritzee and Trubbish make good partners because they help Dwebble beat Fighting-types, which resist both of Dwebble's STABs and can be very problematic. Trubbish can also set up Spikes, which Dwebble appreciates. Chinchou can help with tanking the Water- and Steel-type attacks aimed at Dwebble, and is particularly useful for keeping Magnemite at bay. Fire- or Fighting-type partners are good for threatening Steel-types as well, particularly Pawniard and Ferroseed. When not being used as a lead, Dwebble appreciates entry hazard removal from Defog or Rapid Spin, as entry hazards break its Sturdy and can ruin its SturdyJuice Shell Smash strategy.

Other Options
########

Aerial Ace hits the Fighting-types that wall both of Dwebble's STABs, but it is on the weak side and not useful outside of this role. Poison Jab is a nice surprise for the Fairy-types that wall Dwebble's X-Scissor, though it's a useless move otherwise. Rock Slide is usually weaker than Rock Blast, but deals more reliable damage. Flail can be used with Shell Smash and Sturdy to deal insane damage after Dwebble is taken to 1 HP, but the many priority users in the tier make this a dangerous strategy. Setting up Flail also means losing Berry Juice, which is a substantial cost. Counter can be used to surprise the Fighting-types that normally have little to fear from Dwebble, as well as other physically inclined foes, and it works well with Sturdy, but it's hard to find room on a set for this option.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types like Scraggy, Mienfoo, and Timburr all threaten Dwebble. They resist its STABs as well as most of its usual coverage moves. Fighting-types that carry Knock Off and Drain Punch can bypass Dwebble's SturdyJuice strategy completely.

**Steel-types**: Pawniard, Magnemite, and Ferroseed especially resist Dwebble's STABs and hit back with a super effective move.

**Burn**: Will-O-Wisp and Scald users threaten both sets by breaking Sturdy with a burn. A burn especially hinders a Shell Smash set, as Dwebble relies on its Attack to break through opponents.

**Prankster Paralysis**: Purrloin and Cottonee can get off a Thunder Wave before Dwebble can even move. This slows Dwebble down significantly and has a chance of keeping it from moving.

**Trick / Switcheroo**: Dwebble absolutely hates being deprived of its Berry Juice, and despises having it replaced with a crippling item that renders it useless, such as a Choice item or Flame Orb.

**Taunt users**: Taunt users such as Mienfoo can prevent Dwebble using Shell Smash or setting up entry hazards.
