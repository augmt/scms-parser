Overview
########

Pineco has access to the SturdyJuice combination, which allows to endure one hit from full health. It can set up every entry hazard (except Sticky Web) and it learns Rapid Spin, which allows it to remove entry hazards. It also has a good physical bulk. However, despite of these traits, it can't stop opposing Pokemon from setting up and is a very predictable lead with a detrimentally low base Speed. It limits teambuilding because it has to be paired with a spinblocker and a Defiant user to properly take advantage of entry hazards and it can be outclassed by the faster and the more offensive Dwebble.

Entry Hazard Lead
########
name: Entry Hazard Lead
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Spikes
move 3: Rapid Spin
move 4: Explosion / Payback
ability: Sturdy
item: Berry Juice
evs: 236 Atk / 36 Def / 236 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Set up Stealth Rock to break Focus Sashes and to threaten Flying-types which are immune to Spikes. Spikes deal big damage to grounded Pokemon every time they switch in. Rapid Spin is for removing entry hazards set by opposing Pokemon. Explosion can do a large amount of damage while blocking Rapid Spin and Defog, but generally, Pineco is too slow to take advantage of it. Payback can be preferred in order to hit Ghost-Types.

Set Details
========
The Sturdy + Berry Juice combination allows Pineco to survive at least one hit and set up one entry hazard, if it doesn't get its item Knocked Off. 236 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature are preferred in order to deal a good amount of damage, 236 Speed EVs help set up more entry hazards against slower Pokemon, and 36 Defense EVs are a helpful filler.

Usage Tips
========
Pineco has to be used as a lead, because if it is switched into an attack, its Sturdy could be lost. Stealth Rock is usually the first move to use, while Spikes is used to hurt less offensive teams more. Rapid Spin is used against the other common leads such as Dwebble or Tirtouga to remove entry hazards and break Sturdy. Explosion is used in order to prevent the majority of the setup sweepers from boosting their stats after you've set up at least one layer of Spikes or Stealth Rock.

Team Options
========
Like every entry hazard lead, Pineco needs a spinblocker as a switch-in for Rapid Spin. Pumpkaboo, Phantump and Frillish are the best choices for this role. Cottonee with Encore could be a nice teammate in order to deter opposing Pokemon from setting up on Pineco and sweeping. Pawniard deters Defoggers because it gets an Attack bonus from the move thanks to Defiant.

Other Options
########
Rock Slide is a good option for a more offensive set and hits Natu. A physically defensive set with Mental Herb allows Pineco to avoid Taunt from Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Onix, and Stunky. Counter could replace Explosion to KO Drilbur after it has used Rock Slide, which is often used against Pineco. An Eviolite set with Pain Split or a Light Clay set with Reflect and Light Screen could be nice alternative sets. Pineco can also set up Toxic Spikes if your team needs this support. Endure could be a good idea if Sturdy has been broken.

Checks & Counters
########

**Taunt Users**: Taunt users such as Cottonee, Mienfoo, Stunky, and Onix can easily stop Pineco from setting up.

**Entry Hazard Removers**: Defoggers such as Archen, Vullaby, and Stunky as well as Rapid Spinners such as Drilbur, Staryu, and Anorith cause great problems to Pineco as they remove every entry hazard that it sets up. Drilbur is a big problem, as it can KO Pineco with Rock Slide.

**Setup Sweepers** Pokemon such as Bulk Up Timburr, Swords Dance Fletchling and Belly Drum Zigzagoon, and Magby can boost their stats against Pineco and threaten the whole team.

**Magic Bounce Natu**: Natu forces Pineco to avoid setting up entry hazards thanks to its ability, Magic Bounce.
