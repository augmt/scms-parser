Overview
########

Joltik is a bit of a mixed bag; on one hand, it has a good STAB move combination, only two weaknesses, and access to a speedy Volt Switch. On the other hand, it finds itself outclassed as an Electric-type by Chinchou and Magnemite. It does have a few redeeming qualities, however, such as its resistance to Fighting-type attacks, neutrality to Ground-type attacks, and ability to punish Chinchou with Giga Drain. No other Electric-type in Little Cup shares this unique combination of traits, which gives Joltik a small niche in Little Cup.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Bug Buzz
move 3: Volt Switch
move 4: Giga Drain
ability: Swarm
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 36 HP / 220 SpA / 236 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Thunderbolt is Joltik's strongest Electric-type STAB move and is a good tool to use for revenge killing. Bug Buzz is an equally powerful secondary STAB move that hits Grass-types and through Substitute. Volt Switch allows Joltik to scout early- and mid-game. Finally, Giga Drain provides important coverage against opposing Ground-types and Chinchou, which could otherwise switch into Joltik with ease.

Set Details
========

The EV spread maximizes Special Attack and Speed. As Joltik is already very fast with Choice Scarf, a Modest nature is preferred to maximize its damage output; however, a Timid nature can be used to ensure you outspeed threats such as +2 Jolly Tirtouga and Jolly Choice Scarf Pawniard. The chosen ability is Swarm, as Joltik lacks moves that can take advantage of Compound Eyes, and Unnerve is almost completely useless, as it doesn't prevent Berry Juice consumption. Swarm, while situational, is the best option, as it can power up Bug Buzz when Joltik is significantly weakened.

Usage Tips
========

Be careful when scouting with Joltik. Don't click Volt Switch right away if your opponent still has Chinchou or a Ground-type, as this could potentially lose a lot of momentum for your team. Instead, consider using Giga Drain or a tactful double switch. As a Choice Scarf user, Joltik can be used to scout early-game, then brought in for revenge killing throughout the game. It can switch into resisted hits if needed, but you must be wary of what Joltik is switching into, as strong neutral hits can KO it.

Team Options
========

Joltik works best in a VoltTurn core to keep momentum flowing and the opponent at a disadvantage. Mienfoo makes for a great partner thanks to its resistance to Rock and ability to hit special walls on their weaker physical side. Mienfoo is able to heavily damage Magnemite and Munchlax, two Pokemon that wall Joltik. Having an entry hazard remover is critical because Joltik is weak to Stealth Rock and switches in and out a lot. Archen can also form a VoltTurn core with Joltik and keep entry hazards away with Defog, but one must keep in mind that the two Pokemon share a weakness to Rock. Several Rapid Spin users pair very nicely with Joltik. Staryu can take on Fire-, Rock-, and Ground-types with ease, while Joltik resists Staryu's weaknesses to Electric- and Grass-types. Drilbur and Tentacool also pair well with Joltik due to their abilities to take on Fire- and Rock-types. Finally, teammates that can set up entry hazards are useful, as this takes advantage of the switches Joltik forces and can net it KOs that it would otherwise miss.

Substitute + 3 Attacks
########
name: Substitute + 3 Attacks
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Bug Buzz
move 4: Giga Drain
ability: Swarm
item: Life Orb / Berry Juice
evs: 36 HP / 220 SpA / 236 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Substitute can ease prediction and allows Joltik to scout powerful attacks and shield itself from status. Thunderbolt and Bug Buzz are Joltik's strongest STAB moves and are quite powerful when backed by Life Orb. Bug Buzz allows Joltik to hit Grass-types hard, and Giga Drain allows Joltik to hit Ground-types and Chinchou for a lot of damage while recovering health lost from Substitute and Life Orb recoil.

Set Details
========

The EV spread maximizes Joltik's Special Attack and Speed, with the remaining EVs put into HP. A Timid nature is preferred, as it allows Joltik to hit 17 Speed and outspeed the common Pokemon with 16 Speed. Life Orb provides Joltik with more power than Choice Scarf, but Berry Juice is an decent alternative because it gives Joltik more longevity and works well alongside Substitute.

Usage Tips
========

Joltik can use its decent Speed to scout the foe's moves with Substitute and then proceed to hit the foe hard with Thunderbolt or Bug Buzz. If the opponent switches in a Pokemon meant to absorb an Electric-type move, such as Chinchou, it'll get smacked by Giga Drain and Joltik will regain the HP it lost from setting up the Substitute. Substitute can also be used to dodge Sucker Punch from Sucker Punch users such as Pawniard.

Team Options
========

Damage piles up quickly on Joltik due to its vulnerability to Stealth Rock, Life Orb recoil, and use of Substitute, so teammates that can remove hazards with Rapid Spin or Defog, such as Staryu, Archen, and Drilbur, help immensely. As a special attacker, Joltik struggles getting past special walls, so teammates with high Attack and access to Knock Off, such as Pawniard, Timburr, and Mienfoo, can help wear them down. Finally, a teammate that can set up Stealth Rock or Spikes is useful for taking advantage of the opponent's switching and can net Joltik some extra KOs.

Other Options
########

Hidden Power Fighting can be used to KO Pawniard, a Pokemon that Joltik otherwise has trouble dealing with. Hidden Power Ground is an option to OHKO Magnemite if its Sturdy has been broken, while still dealing respectable damage to Chinchou. Joltik can run an Agility set with Life Orb, but its overall frailty and susceptibility to priority prevents it from being a consistent sweeper. A bulky set with Eviolite or Berry Juice with support options like Thunder Wave is feasible, but Joltik is better suited to an offensive role. Energy Ball can be used over Giga Drain, but Giga Drain's healing effect is much more useful than a slight increase in damage output, especially because Energy Ball doesn't gain any notable OHKOs that Giga Drain would otherwise miss. Charge Beam is a method of boosting Joltik's Special Attack, but is unreliable. Joltik has access to Sucker Punch for priority, allowing it to OHKO Gastly, but lack of STAB on Sucker Punch and Joltik's low Attack stat means it won't be doing any significant damage. Joltik gets many physical options, such as Wild Charge, X-Scissor, and Poison Jab, but again, Joltik's Attack stat is too low to effectively pull off a physical or mixed set.

Checks & Counters
########

**Munchlax**: Munchlax stands out as the best counter to Joltik, as it can sponge any attack Joltik throws at it and can deal heavy damage with Body Slam or OHKO it with Fire Punch.

**Magnemite**: Magnemite resists all moves commonly carried by Joltik and can wall it with Recycle and Berry Juice.

**Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta can easily switch in on Bug Buzz and Giga Drain and threaten Joltik with their STAB moves.

**Specially Bulky Pokemon**: Specially bulky Pokemon can switch into Joltik with ease, especially because Joltik isn't overwhelmingly powerful.

**Priority Users**: Joltik struggles against strong priority users such as Pawniard, which can take away around 80% of its health with a Sucker Punch. Fletchling can revenge kill Joltik with Acrobatics and a bit of prior damage.

**Pokemon with Sturdy + Berry Juice**: If there are no entry hazards on the field, Tirtouga and Dwebble can come in and render Joltik setup fodder. Dwebble is particularly good at this, as Rock Blast can beat the Subsitute + 3 Attacks set with ease.
