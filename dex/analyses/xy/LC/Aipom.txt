Overview
########

Being a Normal-type in a metagame with a lot of threatening Fighting-type Pokemon might make Aipom look underwhelming, but it is much better than most people think. Aipom occupies the coveted 19 Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed most of the metagame, and Skill Link Furry Swipes 2HKOes most neutral threats even without Life Orb. Additionally, it has a superb movepool, with coverage attacks such as Brick Break and the elemental punches, utility moves such as U-turn and Knock Off, and support options such as Taunt and Baton Pass that make it a solid anti-lead. Aipom also has enough bulk with Eviolite to survive strong hits from the likes of offensive Mienfoo's Drain Punch with Eviolite.
However, Aipom does have its flaws; its Normal typing gives it zero resistances, a sole Ghost immunity, and a nasty Fighting-type weakness that leaves it vulnerable to top threats such as Timburr and Scraggy. Lack of reliable priority also makes it hard for Aipom to safely revenge kill some Pokemon.

Moves
========
Fury Swipes is Aipom's strongest STAB move, as it's able to 2HKO the most part of the metagame. Knock Off is Aipom's best way to hit Gastly; it also removes Eviolite from walls that switch in so Aipom can break through them more easily with Fury Swipes. Brick Break deals heavy damage to Rock- and Steel-types, such as Pawniard. U-turn allows Aipom to act as a pivot. Taunt allows Aipom to be an effective lead, preventing hazards from Dwebble; it also prevents any Pokemon from setting up. Fake Out is a solid +3 priority and Fake Out + Fury Swipes does a lot of damage to most threats. Ice Punch is also a good option to hit defensive Archen.

Set Details
========

The EV spread gives Aipom maximum Attack and Speed, with the remaining EVs going in HP for a bit of extra bulk. With a Jolly nature, Aipom hits the 19 Speed tier. Adamant can be used if you need more power and don't mind Aipom missing out on the 19 Speed tier. For instance, Adamant Life Orb Aipom can 2HKO Spritzee without needing to Knock Off its Eviolite first. Eviolite is the main item on this set because of Aipom's decent bulk, while Life Orb can be used for increasing Aipom's damage output.

Usage Tips
========

Aipom should spam Knock Off to guarantee Fury Swipes will always do the most damage possible and to support the team. With access to both U-turn and Taunt, it can be used as a part of a VoltTurn core. Use Aipom early- or mid-game so it can do as much damage as possible to the opposing team. If your opponent is using Ponyta or Larvesta, exercise care; they are very solid counters to Aipom as each hit from Fury Swipes has a 30% chance to burn Aipom, assuming Ponyta and Larvesta are running Flame Body.

Team Options
========

Spritzee is Aipom's best partner, as it easily KOes Fighting-type Pokemon, can pass Wish, and heal status. Timburr is a good status absorber and KOes some of Aipom's Rock- and Steel-type counters. Fletchling is another good teammate as it is also able to deal with most Fighting-type Pokemon and has access to U-turn. Entry hazard setters such as Archen and Drilbur are appreciated as well. Aipom works well with another teammate that can maintain offensive momentum, so Pokemon with access to U-turn or Volt Swich, such as Mienfoo, Archen, and Chinchou are good partners. Slower U-turn users such as Vullaby are even better, as they can get Aipom in safely.


Other Options
########
With access to a huge movepool, Aipom has a lot of options. A set with Fake Out and Last Resort is funny and powerful but walled by too many Pokemon. Aipom is one of the few Pokemon that can Baton Pass Nasty Plot, but there are better passers. Double Slap is good if you want a bit more accuracy, but it is weaker than Fury Swipes. Another item Aipom could use is King Rock to have a 41% chance of flinching with Fury Swipes, but it is too luck-based. Gunk Shot is a good option to KO Spritzee. Hone Claws is interesting, but hard to set up. Thunder Wave is a good support option. Aipom learns Seed Bomb so it can KO Tirtouga. Finally, Aipom also learns both Sunny Day and Rain Dance, but there are better weather setters.


**Checks & Counters**
########
**Fighting-types**: Timburr, Scraggy, and Mienfoo are bulky enough to survive hits from Aipom and KO it. Scraggy can set up Dragon Dance, Timburr can set up Bulk Up, and Choice Scarf Mienfoo checks and KOes Aipom.

**Status**: Burn inducers such as Chinchou can cripple Aipom. Also, Aipom fears Flame Body users such as Ponyta and Larvesta because its main STAB, Fury Swipes, is a multi-hit move, so each hit has a 30% chance to burn Aipom.

**Rock-types**: Onix, Tirtouga, Dweeble, and Archen easily wall most of Aipom's attacks and do solid damage to it. Dwebble and Archen are even neutral to Brick Break, so they are very solid Aipom counters.

**Steel-types**: While Aipom will always win against Berry Juice Magnemite, it is checked by Choice Scarf Magnemite. Thunderbolt is a guaranteed 2HKO and Aipom can't OHKO it with any move. Ferroseed is very annoying; if it switches in on Aipom's Fury Swipes, Iron Barbs will do a lot of damage to Aipom.
