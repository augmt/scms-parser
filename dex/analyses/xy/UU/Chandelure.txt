Overview
########

Chandelure sports a huge base 145 Special Attack, making it an optimal special wallbreaker. Chandelure also sports three immunities to some of the most common attacking types in the tier: Fighting, Fire, and Normal. This allows it to utilize an effective revenge-killing Choice Scarf set and a wallbreaking Choice Specs set. Unfortunately, poor base 60 HP lets its checks and counters easily revenge kill it. Additionally, Chandelure's subpar base 80 Speed means that anything with base 145 Speed or higher, such as Mega Aerodactyl, will outspeed and OHKO Choice Scarf Chandelure, and Chandelure's typing and lack of bulk makes it Pursuit bait.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Energy Ball
move 4: Trick / Memento
ability: Flash Fire
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Fire Blast is the standard Fire-type STAB move, OHKOing most frail Pokemon. Shadow Ball is the go-to Ghost-type STAB move if the opponent's team can handle Fire-type moves or has an apparent Ghost-type weakness to exploit. Energy Ball is useful for revenge killing weakened bulky Water- and Ground-types and OHKOes Swampert. Trick is a good option against stall teams or bulky Pokemon that attempt to work around Chandelure's wallbreaking ability, as well as against win condition Pokemon such as Curse Snorlax. Alternatively, Memento is a good option to severely cripple the opponent's Pokemon, giving your team a setup sweep opportunity.

Set Details
========

252 Special Attack EVs allow Chandelure to wallbreak as easily as possible. 252 Speed EVs, Choice Scarf, and a Timid nature allow Chandelure to outspeed and revenge kill anything under base 145 speed. Flash Fire allows Chandelure to absorb Fire-type moves such as Sacred Fire and Flare Blitz and proceed to use Fire Blast at 1.5x power.

Usage Tips
========

Use Choice Scarf Chandelure as a revenge killer or moderately powerful special wallbreaker. Chandelure can be used as an anti-lead but is much more effective as a late-game cleaner or mid-game revenge killer. Chandelure can be an effective spinblocker against Forretress, but it fears Tentacruel and Donphan for Scald and Earthquake, respectively.

Team Options
========

Vaporeon can take on most bulky Water- and Ground-types that threaten to OHKO Chandelure due to its horrid bulk. Chandelure also partners well with Protect users, which can scout out Choice-locked Fighting-, Normal-, and Fire-type moves that Chandelure can switch into. Choice Band Machamp and Life Orb Lucario are good partners to get past some of Chandelure's specially defensive checks, such as Umbreon and Blissey. Dark-types such as Hydreigon can relieve some offensive pressure while mitigating Chandelure's Ghost- and Water-type weakness. Chandelure's weakness to Stealth Rock is a huge detriment to its wallbreaking ability. As a result, Rapid Spin and Defog users increase Chandelure's longevity. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Mega Abamosnow make strong offensive partners, especially when Chandelure is using Memento.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Fire Blast / Flamethrower
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Energy Ball
move 4: Trick
ability: Flash Fire
item: Choice Specs
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Fire Blast hits even Chandelure's common switch-ins, like Hydreigon, for decent damage while OHKOing all moderately bulky threats that do not resist it, such as Nidoqueen. Flamethrower is an alternative, reliable Fire-type STAB move OHKOing most frail Pokemon thanks to Choice Specs. Shadow Ball is the standard go-to Ghost-type STAB move if the opponents team can handle Fire-type moves or if the opponent has an apparent Ghost-type weakness to exploit. Energy Ball is useful for revenge killing slightly weakened bulky Water- and Ground-types and OHKOes Swampert; however, Chandelure still won't be OHKOing any of its bulky Water- and Ground-type checks and counters without prior damage. Trick is a good option against stall teams or bulky Pokemon that attempt to work around Chandelure's wallbreaking ability.

Set Details
========

252 Special Attack allows Chandelure to wallbreak as easily as possible. 252 Speed EVs and a Timid Nature allows Chandelure to outspeed most walls, letting it perform its wallbreaking role effectively. A Modest nature can be used to secure a 2HKO against Florges after Stealth Rock, although Timid is generally the better nature because it allows Chandelure to outspeed neutral base 90s. Flash Fire allows Chandelure to absorb Fire-type spam moves like Sacred Fire and Flare Blitz, and use Flamethrower or Fire Blast at 1.5x power.

Usage Tips
========

Use Choice Specs Chandelure as a high-powered special wallbreaker with the capability of 2HKOing the majority of the tier that doesn't resist it. Chandelure is very effective as a mid-game wallbreaker or revenge killer against bulkier Pokemon such as a partially injured Mega Blastoise or Hippowdon. Chandelure can easily dismantle balanced teams, OHKOing the common Life Orb Nidoqueen and Choice Band Machamp while 2HKOing many Pokemon common on balance teams, ranging from Mega Ampharos to Vaporeon. Chandelure can be an effective spinblocker against Forretress, but it fears Tentacruel and Donphan for Scald and Earthquake, respectively.

Team Options
========

Vaporeon can take on most bulky Water- and Ground-types that threaten to OHKO Chandelure due to its horrid bulk. Chandelure also partners well with Protect users, which can scout out Choice-locked Fighting-, Normal-, and Fire-type moves that Chandelure can switch into. Choice Band Machamp and Life Orb Lucario are good partners to get past some of Chandelure's specially defensive checks, such as Umbreon and Blissey. Dark-types such as Hydreigon can relieve some offensive pressure while mitigating Chandelure's Ghost- and Water-type weakness. Chandelure's weakness to Stealth Rock is a huge detriment to its wallbreaking ability. As a result, Rapid Spin and Defog users increase Chandelure's longevity.

Substitute + Calm Mind
########
name: Substitute + Calm Mind
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Calm Mind
move 3: Flamethrower
move 4: Shadow Ball
ability: Flash Fire
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Substitute allows Chandelure to work around switches and common stall playstyles, including teams that utilize Pokemon such as Blissey. Calm Mind increases Chandelure's already huge Special Attack, allowing it to 2HKO a large portion of the tier. Flamethrower is a reliable STAB move that appreciates the Calm Mind boosts. Shadow Ball is Chandelure's secondary STAB move and provides it with reasonable offensive coverage.

Set Details
========

252 Special Attack EVs ensure that Chandelure can wallbreak as easily as possible, even taking care of Blissey at +6. 252 Speed EVs allow Chandelure to outspeed most slower wallbreakers, such as Machamp, Nidoqueen, and Mega Blastoise, as well as any neutral base 90 Speed Pokemon. The 4 Special Defense EVs are used for the rare-yet-effective Download Porygon-Z, which can interrupt a sweep with Dark Pulse. Hydreigon is still a common switch-in for Chandelure, so an alternative spread with 112 HP EVs taken from Special Attack ensures that Chandelure survives Choice Scarf Hydreigon's Dark Pulse after one Calm Mind, allowing Chandelure to secure a surprise KO if Hydreigon has taken prior damage. 112 HP EVs also prevent uninvested Florges's Moonblast from breaking Chandelure's Substitute.

Usage Tips
========

It is best to save Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure as a late-game win condition or as a setup sweeper against stall playstyles. Despite having less special power than the Choice Scarf set, Chandelure can still serve as an effective moderate wallbreaker against weakened balanced threats. Chandelure can be an effective spinblocker against Forretress, but it fears Tentacruel and Donphan for Scald and Earthquake, respectively.

Team Options
========

Vaporeon can take on most bulky Water- and Ground-types that threaten to OHKO Chandelure due to its horrid bulk. Choice Scarf Hydreigon has almost perfect type synergy with Chandelure. Shaymin loves Blissey being gone and deals easily with bulky Water- and Ground-type Pokemon that threaten Chandelure, and the two together put enormous pressure on Hydreigon. Chandelure also partners well with Protect users, which can scout out Choice-locked Fighting-, Normal-, and Fire-type moves that Chandelure can switch into. Choice Band Machamp and Life Orb Lucario are good partners to get past some of Chandelure's specially defensive checks, such as Umbreon and Blissey. Dark-types such as Umbreon can relieve some defensive pressure while mitigating Chandelure's Ghost- and Water-type weaknesses. Chandelure's weakness to Stealth Rock is a huge detriment to its wallbreaking ability. As a result, Rapid Spin and Defog users increase Chandelure's longevity. Lastly, Florges, similarly to Umbreon, can take pressure off Chandelure when facing Hydreigon.

Other Options
########

Expert Belt is an option to bluff a Choice set. A bulkier Substitute + Calm Mind set can be used, decreasing the Speed EVs to hit lower benchmarks such as 242 for Adamant Honchkrow and uninvested base 100s. Hidden Power Fighting hits Pokemon that resist Chandelure's STABs moves, such as Hydreigon and Houndoom. A Substitute + Pain Split set with Life Orb can be effective, particularly against Pokemon with high HP such as Vaporeon and Snorlax, as Pain Split takes advantage of Chandelure's low HP. Taunt stops various Pokemon from setting up and healing. Will-O-Wisp is great against some switch-ins, such as Assault Vest Machamp, Mega Aerodactyl, and Snorlax. Trick Room is another option and works particularly well with Memento.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Water-types**: Suicune, Empoleon, Vaporeon, and Tentacruel all absorb Chandelure's attacks fairly well and can generally beat Chandelure in a one-on-one situation with Scald.

**Hydreigon**: Hydreigon is the most common and strongest offensive check against Chandelure bar Snorlax. A Dark Pulse or Draco Meteor will OHKO Chandelure, or cripple one of its teammates.

**Pursuit**: Pursuit users such as Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl can easily force Chandelure to switch and revenge kill it.

**Special Walls**: The Choice Scarf set will have trouble breaking through Umbreon, Blissey, and Florges, as they all wall Chandelure's special attacks, with Trick being Chandelure's only option to effectively work around Blissey and Florges. Fortunately, Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure can work around both of these threats.

**Assault Vest**: Snorlax and Machamp are amongst the common Assault Vest users that can survive a Choice Specs-boosted Fire Blast and OHKO Chandelure.
