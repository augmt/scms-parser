Overview
########

Flygon has many of the tools to be great, but falls just short in many of them. With the new Defog mechanics, it received a niche in checking many Fire-types while clearing the field of entry hazards, which is made easier by its resistance to Stealth Rock and immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web. It has a defensive typing that lends it immunities to Ground- and Electric-type moves, as well as some resistances to Rock-, Fire-, and Poison-type moves. It even boasts good Speed that lets it use its STAB moves to revenge kill many Pokemon in the tier, including Choice Scarf Hydreigon.

However, Flygon's Speed tier doesn't let it outspeed Choice Scarf Mienshao, which can OHKO with High Jump Kick after Stealth Rock. Its Choice Scarf set is also rather weak, as Flygon only has a base 100 Attack stat, but the rare Choice Band set sits at a Speed where many non-Choice Scarf threats can outspeed and KO it. It also has slightly disappointing stats, all of them sitting at base 80 except for its base 100 Attack and Speed. Finally, its 4x weakness to Ice-type moves really hurts, especially since many bulky Water-types often run Ice Beam. That said, Flygon's positive traits are often enough to find it a place on many teams.

move 1: Outrage
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Defog
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Outrage is a very powerful STAB move that badly damages many threats in the tier such as Haxorus and Hydreigon. Earthquake is another powerful STAB move that makes revenge killing Fire-, Poison-, Electric-, and Steel-types such as Darmanitan, Chandelure, Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Raikou, Jirachi, and Empoleon much easier. U-turn allows Flygon to gain momentum for the team as often as Flygon forces the foe to switch out, especially if a Dragon-type such as Hydreigon or Haxorus is in play. Finally, Defog is in the final slot to clear away entry hazards in a pinch.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed and Attack investment allow Flygon to revenge kill to the best of its ability. A Jolly nature allows Flygon to outspeed and revenge kill Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Choice Scarf Darmanitan, and +1 Haxorus.

Usage Tips
========

Try to bring Flygon in after a teammate is KOed so it can revenge kill the foe. Flygon can also lead at the beginning of a battle, so you can choose to attack outright, U-turn out to scout the opponent's lead, or gain momentum in the event of a switch. Also, before using Outrage, try to remove all opposing Fairy- and Steel-types so Flygon isn't walled and stuck inside the battle.

Team Options
========

Hard-hitting Life Orb users such as Darmanitan, Hydreigon, Nidoqueen, Mienshao, as well as Choice Band Krookidile make for good partners, as they make it easier for Flygon to clean up late-game. Additionally, entry hazard setters such as Nidoqueen and Forretress can make it easier for Flygon to clean. Keep in mind, however, that some of them share weaknesses. For example, Hydreigon, Krookidile, and Nidoqueen are all weak to Ice-type moves. Some of these Pokemon can carry U-turn to form a dual U-turn core with Flygon.

Other Options
########

Dragon Claw can be used over Outrage if you fear being locked into a move that results in confusion, but the drop in power is significant. An offensive Hone Claws set can be used as a setup sweeper, but it is outclassed by better sweepers in the tier, especially Haxorus. Stone Edge hits Flying-types hard, but Outrage is almost as powerful in those situations and Stone Edge's imperfect accuracy is a further detriment. Iron Tail can be used to hit Fairy-types super effectively, but it is rather unreliable and doesn't even 2HKO Florges before Stealth Rock damage. A defensive Defog set looks appealing, but many attackers can overwhelm Flygon without much trouble. Finally, Choice Band confers more wallbreaking power, but it is still rather weak and only has a decent Speed tier.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types such as Swampert, Vaporeon, and Suicune can take almost anything Flygon can throw at them and hit back hard with Ice Beam.

**Mega Abomasnow**: Mega Abomasnow can come in easily on anything except for Outrage or the rare Fire Blast or Fire Punch and OHKO Flygon with its STAB Ice Shard.

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types such as Florges, Aromatisse, and the rare Granbull can take anything Flygon has and hit back hard with a super effective STAB move.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Bronzong wall Flygon and can set up Stealth Rock or attack it back.
