Overview
########

UU isn't a very kind metagame to Flygon. While it is a very versatile Pokemon with access to great STAB attacks including Outrage and Earthquake, it is easily countered by many different Pokemon. Flygon, however, does have a niche in being a great Defog user, as it is resistant to Stealth Rock and immune to all other entry hazards thanks to its Ground typing and Levitate, respectively. Its typing and ability also allow it to freely switch into Ground- and Electric-type attacks. It sits in a good Speed tier with base 100 Speed and can dish out some good damage thanks to its base 100 Attack. Flygon's main drawbacks, however, are its mediocre bulk and 4x weakness to Ice, making it very susceptible to attacks such as Ice Shard and Ice Beam.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Defog
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Outrage is Flygon's main STAB move and hits considerably hard coming off of its base 100 Attack, but it should only be used late-game once all Steel- and Fairy-type Pokemon have been removed. Earthquake is a secondary STAB option that hits most Poison-, Rock-, Steel-, Fire-, and Electric-type Pokemon for super effective damage, providing Flygon with great coverage. U-turn helps Flygon keep momentum during the match. Finally, Defog is used to get rid of entry hazards so that a teammate can get a clean switch.

Set Details
========

252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature along with a Choice Scarf maximize Flygon's Speed, enabling it to outspeed key threats including Mega Sceptile, Choice Scarf Darmanitan, +1 Haxorus, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. 252 EVs are put into Attack to let Flygon hit as hard as possible. The leftover EVs are placed into Special Defense, making it easier for Flygon to take special attacks while also giving Download users such as Porygon-Z an unneeded Attack boost rather than a Special Attack boost.

Usage Tips
========

Leading with Flygon on the get-go to either attack or U-turn out on a predicted switch can be helpful. Switch Flygon into a predicted Ground- or Electric-type move or right after a teammate has fainted so it can revenge kill the foe. As mentioned earlier, don't use Outrage while there are still Steel- and Fairy-type Pokemon on the field. Instead, use it late-game when they have been removed and the rest of the opponent's team has been weakened.

Team Options
========

Hard-hitting attackers such as Mega Beedrill, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, Darmanitan, and Mienshao make it easier for Flygon to clean up late-game thanks to their powerful attacks. Pokemon with access to Volt Switch or U-turn such as Mega Beedrill, Raikou, Rotom-H, Darmanitan, and Tornadus can form a VoltTurn core with Flygon. Volt Switch users deserve a special mention, as they can take on the bulky Steel- and Water-types that threaten Flygon. Be aware that most of these Pokemon are weak to Stealth Rock and appreciate Flygon's Defog support. Stealth Rock users such as Nidoqueen, Forretress, Mega Steelix, and Mega Aggron make it easier for Flygon to sweep late-game.

Other Options
########

Dragon Claw can be used instead of Outrage for a more reliable STAB option that doesn't prevent Flygon from switching out, but the power loss is noticeable as it is 33% weaker. Iron Tail is an option to hit Fairy-types for super effective damage, but the accuracy is a bit shaky. Stone Edge can be used to hit Flying-type Pokemon for super effective damage, but Outrage usually does the trick. A mixed attacking set with Draco Meteor, Earthquake, Fire Blast, and Roost or U-turn is viable to catch your opponent off-guard and to hit their physically defensive switch-ins with a powerful Draco Meteor or Fire Blast. A bulky Defog set can be used but is generally inferior to offensive Defog sets. Finally, a Choice Band set can be used for more power, but Flygon needs all the Speed it can get.

Checks & Counters
########

**Physically Defensive Walls**: Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Chesnaught can wall Flygon due to their magnificent physical bulk.

**Bulky Steel-types**: Bulky Steel-types including Mega Steelix, Mega Aggron, and Bronzong can wall Flygon and set up Stealth Rock or attack it.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Suicune, and Swampert can sponge any of Flygon's attacks and retaliate with a super effective Ice Beam.

**Ice-types**: Ice-type Pokemon such as Mega Glalie and Mega Abomasnow have a good chance to OHKO Flygon with their priority Ice Shard.

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types such as Florges and Aromatisse can take a hit from Flygon and hit back with a super effective STAB attack.
