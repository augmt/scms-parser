Overview
########

Alomomola is one of the best physically defensive Pokemon in UU because of its good Defense stat, enormous HP stat, and wonderful defensive typing. It stands out from its Water-type brethren because of its ability to pass monstrous wishes to its teammates as well as recovering HP while it switches out via Regenerator.

Sadly, this is where the fun ends. Alomomola is cursed with having low Special Defense and faces major competition from fellow Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon. Suicune has good physical defense and can use Calm Mind to be a win condition for some teams. Vaporeon has better Special Defense, access to Wish, and a respectable 110 Special Attack, something Alomomola could only dream of. Its low Special Defense is absolutely critical to look out for, because Alomomola can fall quickly to strong special attacks. Just make sure to play Alomomola to its strengths and it will be sure to not disappoint.

Moves
========

Wish is the main move of this set, allowing Alomomola to heal itself and its teammates to great effect. In fact, it can heal frail sweepers almost all the way to full health. It also helps with weakened walls and Pokemon that lack reliable recovery and still serve a defensive role such as Ampharos. Protect helps turn Wish into reliable recovery and can also be used to scout your opponent's moves or net an extra turn of Leftovers recovery. Scald is a reliable, albeit weak STAB move that keeps Alomomola from being Taunt bait and has a nifty 30% chance to burn the opponent, which is always nice for a wall. Toxic is recommended in the last slot to win stall wars with opposing Pokemon such as Slowking, as well as putting opposing sweepers on a timer. Knock Off can be used in the last slot to remove your opponent's item while simultaneously dealing decent damage to the enemy, but Toxic is usually preferred.

Set Details
========

The EVs and nature are used to maximize Alomomola's physical bulk. The 232 EVs in HP provide a Leftovers number while minimizing Stealth Rock damage. Leftovers are always useful for a defensive Pokemon, allowing it to get a bit extra recovery and minimize residual damage. Regenerator is an amazing ability, recovering a third of Alomomola's health when it switches out, which it will be doing a lot when it passes Wishes. A Bold nature should be used over Relaxed unless you choose to run Knock Off over Toxic, because it helps minimize damage from Foul Play and confusion.

Usage Tips
========

Alomomola should mainly be used to pass enormous Wishes and to switch into physical attackers. It can easily switch into many physical Fire-types including Arcanine, Darmanitan and Entei. Scald should only be used for its burn chance and to keep Alomomola from being useless against Taunt users. Toxic should be used to stall out opponents and win stall wars with other Pokemon such as Slowking. Also, its ability to put sweepers on a timer can be the difference between winning and losing a battle. Keep in mind that when using Alomomola you can lose a lot of momentum and therefore is not suited for offensive teams, but functions well in stall and balanced teams.

Team Options
========

Bulky Grass-types make excellent partners for Alomomola, as they resist both of its weaknesses. Amoonguss in particular has good HP and Special Defense as well as access to Regenerator, forming an effective defensive core between the two. Pokemon that can capitalize on Alomomola's massive Wishes also make good partners. Mega Ampharos has no recovery outside of Rest and covers Alomomola's weaknesses, making them good options to use together. Frail sweepers such as Mega Absol, Mega Houndoom, and Starmie also benefit greatly from Alomomola's massive wishes. Pokemon that can remove Grass-types make awesome teammates for Alomomola. Entei, Arcanine, Darmanitan, Honchkrow, and Crobat are all excellent examples of Pokemon who can fulfill this role.

Other Options
########

A mixed defensive spread of 40 HP / 216 Def / 252 SpD with a Bold or Relaxed nature can be used for more special bulk, but but the physically defensive is usually preferred as it allows larger Wishes and retains its main advantage over Vaporeon. Waterfall is an option over Scald, but the latter is usually recommended because the chance to burn is more valuable than the extra power, especially considering Alomomola's abysmal attacking stats. Mirror Coat is an option to surprise special attackers, but can require a bit of prediction and requires Alomomola to take a hit and takes up a valuable moveslot.

Checks & Counters
########

**Special Attackers**: Strong special attackers in general can deal major damage because of Alomomola's low special defense and reliance on Wish + Protect for recovery.

**Electric-types**: Powerful Electric-types can deal significant damage to Alomomola with their super effective STAB moves. Also, Electric-types are usually specially based and they can capitalize on Alomomola's low Special Defense. Heliolisk in particular can come in on a predicted Scald and retaliate with a STAB Thunderbolt or gain momentum with Volt Switch.

**Grass-types**: Grass types such as Roserade can deal significant damage to Alomomola with their super effective STAB moves. These two can remove status given to them by switching out thanks to Natural Cure. Also, most Grass-types in UU are specially based.

**Toxicroak**: Toxicroak is immune to Scald and Toxic and resists Knock Off, allowing it to come in and set up, causing potentially nasty situations for your team.
