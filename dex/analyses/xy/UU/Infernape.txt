Overview
########

Infernape is the epitome of a versatile offensive Pokemon in UU. With a great movepool that includes strong coverage, and access to support moves such as Stealth Rock, Infernape has many viable sets. While its bulk is underwhelming, its secondary Fire typing allows it to switch in to Will-O-Wisp. All of this combined with an impressive Speed stat, access to boosting moves, and high base Attack and Special Attack stats make Infernape a huge threat in UU.


Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Grass Knot
move 4: Close Combat / Vacuum Wave
ability: Blaze
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive

Moves
========

Nasty Plot turns Infernape into an incredible special-attacking wallbreaker. Fire Blast is the strongest move on this set and does hefty damage to bulky walls such as Florges. Grass Knot provides strong coverage against heavy Pokemon weak to it such as Suicune and Hippowdon. Vacuum Wave allows Infernape to prevent Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon from revenge killing it, while Close Combat lets Infernape surprise and beat Blissey and Snorlax.

Set Details
========

If you choose to run Vacuum Wave, an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe is optimal to maximize Infernape's damage output and Speed. However, running Close Combat shifts the optimal EV spread to one of three options: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naive nature ensures the OHKO on Blissey after Stealth Rock, 84 Atk / 172 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naive nature guarantees the OHKO on Umbreon after Stealth Rock, and 136 Atk / 120 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naive nature ensures the OHKO on Blissey regardless of whether Stealth Rock is present. You can invest further to ensure the OHKO on Umbreon, but this is not worth it. In all cases, a Speed-boosting nature allows Infernape to outspeed most of the unboosted tier. Blaze is the optimal ability, as Iron Fist is useless on this set no matter what moves you decide to run.

Usage Tips
========

Many times, your opponent will expect one of Infernape's physical sets. You can take advantage of this by bringing Infernape in against a special wall such as Blissey and using Nasty Plot on the switch to a physical wall. If you don't have Close Combat, try to weaken opposing Blissey before starting to set up. Fire Blast still does around forty percent of Blissey's HP when Infernape is at +2, but Infernape doesn't appreciate being paralyzed by a healthy Blissey. As with all Infernape sets, the most common counters are Choice Scarf users that can OHKO it due to Infernape's low bulk. If you want to keep Infernape alive and can't defeat the Choice Scarf users with Vacuum Wave, don't hesitate to switch out.

Team Options
========

Nasty Plot Infernape works best on balanced or hyper offensive teams. On balanced teams, a solid defensive core can help patch up Infernape's weakness to Choice Scarf users and provide plenty of chances to set up. On hyper offensive teams, Infernape's access to powerful moves and strong priority allows it to destroy weakened teams. Nasty Plot Infernape works well with Sticky Web, which allows it to eliminate grounded Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile that otherwise threaten it out. It also works well with Dugtrio, which can weaken or beat many of Infernape's best counters, including Victini.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Close Combat
move 2: Overheat / Fire Blast
move 3: Grass Knot
move 4: Mach Punch / Earthquake
ability: Blaze / Iron Fist
item: Life Orb
evs: 228 Atk / 28 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive

Moves
========

Close Combat is Infernape's main spammable STAB move, and it easily OHKOes defensive threats such as Blissey. Overheat gives Infernape great neutral coverage and is its best special STAB move. Alternatively, Fire Blast can be used; it's slightly weaker, but doesn't limit Infernape's effectiveness after it's used once. Grass Knot does significant damage to lured-in threats such as Suicune and Swampert. Mach Punch is a strong priority move that deals hefty damage to offensive threats such as Hydreigon, while Earthquake is guaranteed to OHKO Chandelure and does hefty damage to Victini as well.

Set Details
========

A spread with 228 Attack EVs guarantees the OHKO on Chandelure with Earthquake and Umbreon with Close Combat. If you choose not to run Earthquake, however, you can run as few as 136 Attack EVs to retain the OHKO on Blissey. A Naive nature allows Infernape to outspeed most Pokemon while not making it too weak to physical priority. Life Orb boosts Infernape's damage output to extreme levels. If you're using Mach Punch, Iron Fist is your best choice as an ability; otherwise, Blaze powers up Infernape's Fire-type STAB moves when Infernape is at low HP.

Usage Tips
========

This Infernape set can rip holes in teams multiple times throughout the game, so don't sacrifice it early game. With this set, Infernape can bluff both physical and special sets as well as surprise threats such as Swampert, Chandelure, and Victini with its coverage. Use Mach Punch with caution, as it isn't extraordinarily strong.

Team Options
========

All-out attackerInfernape works well on many teams, especially those that can benefit from a lure for Pokemon such as Blissey and Chandelure. While Infernape can help out offensive teams by being an effective wallbreaker, it also appreciates a strong defensive core to keep it healthy. Entry hazard support is especially helpful as it increases the number of Pokemon Infernape can surprise and take out.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Flare Blitz
move 2: Close Combat
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Stone Edge / Grass Knot
ability: Blaze
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Flare Blitz and Close Combat hit hard and are great for late-game cleaning, though you must be careful of the recoil and stat drops respectively. U-turn allows Infernape to maintain momentum against bulky threats such as Suicune. Stone Edge allows Infernape to hit Chandelure and Victini, while Grass Knot helps deal damage to bulky Water-types such as Swampert, as well as to Rhyperior.

Set Details
========

Infernape's great 108 Speed combined with a Choice Scarf allows it to outspeed nearly the entire tier. In order to accomplish this, a Jolly nature is necessary, as otherwise, Infernape can be outsped by threats such as Choice Scarf Mienshao. Blaze is the only useful ability for this set, as it powers up Flare Blitz when Infernape is about to faint. If you choose to run Stone Edge, a simple EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe allows Infernape to deal the most damage. If you run Grass Knot, try a Naive nature instead. There's no need to invest in Special Attack, as Infernape needs to retain as much physical power as possible.

Usage Tips
========

Choice Scarf Infernape is best used as a revenge killer. It can also easily finish off weakened teams late-game. Use U-turn liberally, especially if the opponent has a bulky Pokemon that Infernape can't break through, such as Suicune. This allows you to wear down these threats and maintain momentum.

Team Options
========

Choice Scarf Infernape fits the bill for a fast Choice Scarf user on an offensive team. Entry hazards are greatly appreciated, as Choice Scarf Infernape relies heavily on passive damage and forcing switches in order to rack up damage, which will allow it to sweep late-game. One great partner is Mega Ampharos, which forms a nice VoltTurn core with Infernape, can threaten out bulky Water-types, and can get Infernape safely in with a slow Volt Switch.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Close Combat
move 3: Mach Punch / Thunder Punch
move 4: Flare Blitz / Fire Punch
ability: Iron Fist / Blaze
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance boosts Infernape's already impressive Attack to incredible levels. When boosted, Mach Punch easily OHKOes offensive threats such as Hydreigon. Close Combat becomes insanely strong after boosts. Thunder Punch allows Infernape to more easily break through bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Alomomola. Flare Blitz deals incredible damage, but Fire Punch is an option if recoil is an issue.

Set Details
========

Swords Dance Infernape doesn't need a complicated EV spread, as a spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe maximizes its power and Speed. A Jolly nature ensures that Infernape can outspeed most of the metagame, bar Choice Scarf users. Iron Fist is the optimal choice if you run any of the elemental punches or Mach Punch, but Blaze can boost Flare Blitz's damage output to unprecedented levels.

Usage Tips
========

Not everything can be OHKOed by +2 Infernape, so don't carelessly set up a Swords Dance if the opponent has a healthy Suicune that can tank a hit and potentially KO Infernape in return. Try to bring Infernape in on Pokemon that its non-boosting sets scare out, as this will help it get free boosts. Finally, while Flare Blitz does massive damage, it also quickly lowers Infernape's own health, so use it sparingly.

Team Options
========

Swords Dance Infernape fits best on a more offensive team that can whittle down its defensive counters and allow Infernape to sweep. Zoroark is a particularly interesting partner, as it can run a Nasty Plot set alongside Swords Dance Infernape to confuse opponents. As with all Infernape sets, entry hazards are key to securing crucial KOs and sweeping.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Mach Punch
move 2: Close Combat
move 3: Flare Blitz / Fire Punch
move 4: U-turn
ability: Iron Fist
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

With a Choice Band, Infernape makes the most out of its high Base Power moves and respectable stats to deal surprising damage right out of the gate. Mach Punch can deal with many offensive threats, while Close Combat and Flare Blitz allow Infernape to break through most walls. Fire Punch is weaker than Flare Blitz, but it allows Infernape to stick around for longer due to lack of recoil. U-turn allows Infernape to maintain momentum against threats it can't 2HKO.

Set Details
========

Infernape's optimal EV spread is a simple 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe spread that allows it to deal hefty damage while outspeeding much of the metagame. A Jolly nature is mandatory to deal with offensive threats. Iron Fist is the best ability, as it increases the power of Mach Punch and Fire Punch.

Usage Tips
========

Choice Band Infernape should be used as a revenge killer and a wallbreaker. It still has a great Speed tier and a resistance to Dark, so it can come in on Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon locked into Dark Pulse and retain momentum. As with other sets, U-turn is always a great option if the opponent has a dangerous wall such as Alomomola at high health. Choice Band Infernape has many offensive checks, so don't hesitate to switch out into something bulkier in order to preserve Infernape for later on.

Team Options
========

Choice Band Infernape works very well with Pokemon such as Ampharos and Forretress that have access to a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. They allow Infernape to come in safely multiple times and break walls. Infernape works well with defensive cores that can patch up its weakness to Choice Scarf Pokemon and heal it up to increase its longevity. However, Infernape also works well on hyper offensive teams, where it can use its high damage output and strong priority to sweep through a weakened team.

Lead
########
name: Lead
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Overheat / Fire Blast / Taunt
move 4: Close Combat / Grass Knot / Taunt
ability: Blaze
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Hasty

Moves
========

Although Infernape is usually used in a purely offensive capacity, its high Speed allows it to set up Stealth Rock reliably. U-turn maintains momentum for the team and allows Infernape to come in multiple times in case its entry hazards are removed. Overheat is a nuke, and its accompanying stat drop isn't as crippling because lead Infernape will be switching out or fainting anyway. However, Fire Blast is an option if you want more consistent damage. Taunt can be used to prevent opposing Pokemon from setting up entry hazards, removing them with Defog, or using status moves. Close Combat churns out hefty damage. Finally, Grass Knot can be used to surprise Rhyperior, Swampert, and other bulky Pokemon weak to it.

Set Details
========

If you choose to run Close Combat, running maximum Attack EVs is the best option, as it allows Infernape to deal the most damage to threats. However, if you choose to run Grass Knot, maximum Special Attack EVs allow you to increase the damage Overheat and Grass Knot do. You can also tweak the EVs to target specific threats for your team. Blaze combined with Focus Sash allows Infernape to take a hit and retaliate with a boosted Overheat. Finally, a Hasty nature is chosen over a Naive nature due to this set's use as a lead, as with Focus Sash, taking less damage from priority is less important than taking less damage from special hits such as Hydreigon's Dark Pulse.

Usage Tips
========

Infernape is successful as a lead due to its ability to set entry hazards and prevent them through threatening or Taunting opposing hazard setters. Depending on the lead matchup, prioritize either getting damage off or setting up Stealth Rock on a game-by-game basis. While Infernape does have a Focus Sash, there's no need to sacrifice it in the first few turns just because it's a dedicated lead: keeping it around can be valuable, as it still has significant offensive presence.

Team Options
========

Lead Infernape fits best on offensive teams that can benefit from its entry hazards, fast Taunt, high damage output, and access to U-turn. Infernape pairs well with Ghost-types, such as Sableye, as they can prevent the successful use of Rapid Spin. Sweepers such as Sharpedo and Mienshao enjoy Infernape's ability to soften up walls and set entry hazards to aid their sweeps.

Other Options
########

Infernape's movepool is ridiculously diverse, so it has plenty of other options. It can run a Bulk Up set, but its lackluster bulk isn't really helped enough to justify this over a different boosting set. Lead Infernape can choose to run Fake Out to break Focus Sashes and deal chip damage, or it can run Endeavor, which complements its Focus Sash and allows it to cripple walls. A Work Up mixed attacking set is also an option, but this is usually outclassed by a different boosting set. Calm Mind is similar to Bulk Up in that it doesn't solve Infernape's lack of bulk and is outclassed by other boosting sets. Gunk Shot and Iron Tail can be used on many of the sets to break through Fairy-types, but their low accuracies and marginal power difference to Flare Blitz makes them not worth it. Hone Claws can be used in conjunction with these low-accuracy moves, but it is otherwise underwhelming. Encore can be used as a surprise support move, but sacrificing valuable coverage is detrimental. A Sunny Day offensive set can be used on specific teams, but Infernape has trouble reliably setting it up. Defensive sets with Slack Off and/or Will-O-Wisp might seem viable on paper, but Infernape's horrible bulk makes them ineffective. Infernape's Nasty Plot set can feasibly run Hidden Power Ground to more easily get past Chandelure and Victini, but it has trouble sacrificing coverage.


Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types such as Suicune can defensively check any set not running Grass Knot.

**Chandelure**: Chandelure is a good defensive counter to any set that relies purely on Fire-, Fighting-, and Grass-type moves. It does have to watch out for Earthquake and Stone Edge, though.

**Victini**: Similarly to Chandelure, Victini takes minimal damage from Infernape's Fire- and Fighting-type STAB moves, and it offensively threatens Infernape in return. It also needs to be wary of Earthquake and Stone Edge, but to a lesser extent due to its higher bulk.

**Priority**: Infernape's frailty makes it susceptible to priority, such as Lucario's Extreme Speed. This weakness is compounded by the fact that its two main physical STAB moves either reduce its HP or its defensive stats.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon, Mienshao, and Flygon as well as naturally fast Pokemon such as Alakazam and Mega Aerodactyl can force Infernape out unless it holds a Choice Scarf.

**Dugtrio**: Although it is somewhat susceptible to priority from the Swords Dance and Nasty Plot sets, Dugtrio can easily trap and beat any Infernape set.
