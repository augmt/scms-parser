Overview
########

With its high Attack stat and decent bulk, Machamp can function as an effective bulky attacker when holding Assault Vest. Its base 130 Attack is nothing to laugh at, especially when paired with powerful moves. No Guard is an excellent ability on Machamp, as it grants perfect accuracy to moves such as Dynamic Punch and Stone Edge. Also, it gets decent coverage moves such as Knock Off.

Sadly, Machamp isn't without its flaws. It has a subpar Speed stat that leaves it outsped by many common threats. Additionally, Assault Vest does nothing to help its underwhelming physical bulk, which leaves it prone to many Flying-type attacks. It also faces major competition from other Fighting-types in UU such as Scrafty and Mienshao. However, Machamp's access to No Guard and ability to function as an effective bulky attacker sets it apart from its UU brethren.

nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Dynamic Punch is a powerful STAB move that always causes confusion, making it a staple on Machamp. It is also granted perfect accuracy thanks to No Guard. Knock Off gets nearly perfect neutral coverage alongside Dynamic Punch and can remove items such as Leftovers and Eviolite from opponents, potentially crippling them for the rest of the match. Stone Edge is another good coverage move that hits Flying- and Bug-types super effectively and is also perfectly accurate thanks to No Guard. Bullet Punch is good for picking off weakened opponents and hits Fairy-types super effectively, though Stone Edge deals more damage to them. Ice Punch can also be used in the last slot to hit threats such as Gligar, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen super effectively.

Set Details
========

The Speed EVs allow Machamp to outspeed minimum Speed Umbreon in addition to slow threats such as Chesnaught and Blissey. Attack is maximized with an Adamant nature to deal the most damage possible and the rest of the EVs are placed in HP. Assault Vest allows Machamp to take special attacks very well. 164 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed minimum Speed Florges, but it significantly takes away from Machamp's bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Machamp does its best in the early- to mid-game because of Dynamic Punch's ability to force the opponent to switch. Dynamic Punch should be used most of the time unless the opponent brings in a Pokemon that resists Fighting-type moves. If the opponent has a Pokemon such as Florges or Celebi that Machamp can't deal significant damage to, it is recommended you switch Machamp out for a Pokemon that can handle them. Florges and Celebi are easily handled by Nidoqueen and Hydreigon, respectively.

Team Options
========

Nidoking and Nidoqueen make good partners, as they can defeat problematic walls such as Florges and Chesnaught. Additionally, they can set up Stealth Rock, which makes Machamp's job significantly easier. U-turn and Volt Switch users can bring in Machamp for free, which helps Machamp stick around longer. Hydreigon does this job well and can also check bulky Psychic-types. Honchkrow appreciates the fact that Machamp can break through Hydreigon, Honchkrow's greatest offensive counter, and in turn, Honchkrow can take down walls such as Chesnaught and Florges, which Machamp cannot. Mega Aggron makes a good partner as it can remove Florges as well as set up Stealth Rock. Mega Ampharos can switch into the Flying-type attacks Machamp fears, and Machamp can remove Choice Scarf Hydreigon that try to revenge KO Mega Ampharos. Machamp also enjoys hazard support from Pokemon such as Froslass, which can also spread paralysis.

Other Options
########

Poison Jab can be used to take out Fairy-types, but Machamp does not like giving up any of its moves, and Fairy-types are handled more easily by other Pokemon. A Choice Band set seems appealing, but it is outclassed by Pokemon such as Mienshao. Earthquake can be used to hit Poison-types, but like Poison Jab, it is not worth giving up a moveslot. Choice Scarf can be used for the surprise factor as it can get the jump on Pokemon such as non-Scarf Mienshao, but it has little use otherwise. The classic SubChamp set can be used as the confusion from Dynamic Punch gives it many turns to set up a Substitute, but it isn't as good as the Assault Vest set. Bulk Up can be used to boost Machamp's Attack, but it can be hard to set up sometimes.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types such as Aromatisse and Florges can take any attack Machamp can throw at them and hit back hard with a super effective STAB move.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types such as Sableye and Doublade have little trouble handling Machamp, as they are immune to Dynamic Punch and take little from Machamp's coverage moves.

**Poison-types**: Poison-types such as Nidoqueen, Crobat, and Toxicroak take little damage from Machamp's attacks and can set up Stealth Rock, hit back hard with Brave Bird, or set up on it.

**Psychic-types**: Psychic-types such as Celebi and Cresselia take a small amount from Dynamic Punch and Stone Edge, but must be wary of Knock Off.

**Physical Walls**: Physical walls such as Gligar, Chesnaught, Suicune, and Hippowdon take little from any of Machamp's attacks, though Gligar needs to be careful if Machamp opts to run Ice Punch.
