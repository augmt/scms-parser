Overview
########

Mega Glalie has very solid offensive stats, combined with good bulk and Speed. Mega Glalie's base 120 Attack might not look too impressive by UnderUsed standards, but thanks to Refrigerate, it becomes a huge threat, boosting the power of moves such as Double-Edge and Explosion to really high levels. However, Mega Glalie still has some prominent flaws. Ice is terrible defensively, as it comes with weaknesses to Fighting-, Fire-, Rock-, and Steel-type attacks, all of which are common in the current metagame. Also, Mega Glalie lacks the movepool to show some versatility, making it very predictable.

Moves
========

Double-Edge is Mega Glalie's strongest spammable move, but forces it to take recoil damage, and for this reason Return can be used in this slot. A Refrigerate-boosted Explosion hits most Pokemon in the tier for huge damage, which makes it a great option for finishing off weakened walls and removing a specific threat from the game. Super Fang has no immunities thanks to Refrigerate, so Mega Glalie is capable of crippling all of its checks and counters, and in some cases break through them with the combination of Super Fang and Explosion. Earthquake hits Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon, such as Empoleon and Infernape, for super effective damage. Freeze-Dry threatens bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Suicune and Vaporeon, without reliance on Super Fang and Explosion. Ice Shard makes Mega Glalie harder to revenge kill, because it threatens faster Pokemon such as Crobat, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Pidgeot. Taunt shuts down some defensive Pokemon, and works really well with Super Fang. Also, Spikes can take advantage of the amount of switches Mega Glalie causes and its ability to punish Defog and Rapid Spin users.


Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Mega Glalie's Speed and power. A Naive nature is needed to outspeed important threats such as Roserade, Hydreigon, and Haxorus, and to Speed tie with base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as Shaymin and Jirachi. Sets without Freeze-Dry should run 4 SpD EVs, as this prevents Download users from getting a Special Attack boost, and Jolly nature instead of Naive.


Usage Tips
========

Mega Glalie usually doesn't survive during an entire game, as its main role is to break or cripple walls early- or mid-game. If Mega Glalie needs to use Explosion to remove a important threat, don't hesitate on sacrificing it. Using its main STAB move first is usually the best option; however, Super Fang and Freeze-Dry can punish possible switch-ins if you predict right. Mega Glalie might be able to set up Spikes in many occasions, but this doesn't mean it should be used just to fulfill the role of an entry hazard setter, because there are dedicated Spikes users that can do that better and it is a waste of Mega Glalie's power.


Team Options
========

Mega Glalie appreciates teammates that can control entry hazards on the field. Rapid Spin and Defog users, such as Donphan and Crobat, help mitigate Mega Glalie's Stealth Rock weakness. Entry hazards help Mega Glalie wear down walls, which makes Pokemon such as Swampert and Chesnaught good teammates. However, if Mega Glalie is running Spikes, there's no need for another user of that move. Pokemon capable of dealing with bulky Steel-type Pokemon, such as Suicune and the aforementioned Swampert, are needed because Mega Glalie struggles to break through them without significant previous damage. Sweepers that enjoy walls such as Mega Aggron, Forretress, and Suicune being weakened or removed from the game are great to run alongside Mega Glalie; examples include Haxorus, Darmanitan, and Kingdra.



Other Options
########

Body Slam can be used over Double-Edge or Return, because the 30% chance of paralysis allows Mega Glalie to cripple some offensive threats, such as Choice Scarf Jirachi. Hidden Power Fire hits Forretress, but it's only for one threat and makes Mega Glalie lose one point in Speed. Facade helps Mega Glalie deal with Scald burns, however it is extremely situational.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Steel-types**: Steel-types resist Mega Glalie's STAB move and Earthquake does not help against some of them, such as Forretress and Mega Aggron. However, the combination of Super Fang and Explosion does 79% minimum to standard Mega Aggron, which means Mega Glalie can possibly cripple it.

**Bulky Water-types**: Without Freeze-Dry, Mega Glalie can't touch bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Vaporeon, without resorting to Super Fang and Explosion, and they usually carry a recovery move, which means they can heal up the turn Mega Glalie explodes. However, Freeze-Dry does up to 40% to most of them, which is a potential 2HKO after entry hazards and/or Super Fang damage.

**Faster Pokemon**: Base 100 Speed isn't bad, but it isn't anything special either. Faster Pokemon that aren't OHKOed by Ice Shard, such as Infernape and Mienshao, can revenge kill Mega Glalie.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Choice Scarf users can revenge kill Mega Glalie as long as Ice Shard doesn't OHKO.

**Residual Damage**: A Stealth Rock weakness, lack of immunities and resistances, and Double-Edge recoil make Mega Glalie fairly easy to wear down.

**Capitalizing on Explosion**: More often than not, Mega Glalie is going to be forced to use Explosion to hurt the foe's team, which removes it from the game. The issue with this is that only a handful Pokemon can tank Explosion and nothing in the tier can switch into Mega Glalie without any risk, thanks to its other moves.
