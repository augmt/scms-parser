Overview
########

Porygon2 is absurdly bulky, as it has good defenses that are boosted by Eviolite. Because of this, Porygon2 is a great check to several threatening Pokemon in the tier, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Salamence. Furthermore, Porygon2 has great coverage moves, such as Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, as well as a large support movepool. It also has three amazing abilities in Trace, Download, and Analytic. Porygon2's typing is decent; it has only one weakness, but no resistances and only a single immunity to an uncommon type in UU, Ghost. Porygon2 is also very item-reliant because it relies on Eviolite for its good bulk. It is also very slow, which leaves it easily outsped by a lot of threats in the metagame. Because its Special Attack isn't anything spectacular, Porygon2 is setup bait for many Pokemon. Lastly, Porygon2 is very vulnerable to status users, as it doesn't have passive recovery from Leftovers to reduce the damage taken from the status, nor it does have a way to cure it.

Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Toxic / Thunder Wave
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Discharge / Thunderbolt
move 4: Recover
ability: Trace
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Toxic puts a timer on the longevity of Pokemon without a way to cure it. Thunder Wave can be used too, as it cripples offensive threats by lowering their Speed. Discharge is usually preferred for its 30% chance to paralyze the foe, but Thunderbolt can be used for more power while still having a small 10% chance of paralyzing the foe. Recover is used in the last slot because it provides Porygon2 with a form of reliable recovery.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread maximizes Porygon2's Defense, which is boosted by a Bold nature as well. Trace lets Porygon2 copy and identify the ability of the opposing Pokemon, which can provide useful at times; for example, Porygon2 can Trace Krookodile's Intimidate and lower its Attack. Eviolite is the best item for this set, as it greatly increases Porygon2's overall bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Recover should be used often, as Porygon2 is slow and will usually move last, and with this, Porygon2 stays healthy, which is recommended. Porygon2 is also great for pivoting into moderately powerful physical attacks or even switching into U-turn while taking minimal damage. Porygon2 is also a great switch-in to several physical attackers such as Mega Aerodactyl, Salamence, Crobat, and Entei, as it can take their hits and cripple them with status.

Team Options
========

Status absorbers or Pokemon that provide cleric support all are great choices; Porygon2 hates getting statused because it has no passive recovery, so status really hampers its survivability. Pokemon such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl, which can handle Fighting-types such as Infernape and Toxicroak, make for great partners. Additionally, Crobat is capable of removing entry hazards, which force Porygon2 to recover if switched in often. Physically offensive wallbreakers such as Darmanitan and Tyrantrum can break through special walls such as Florges and Blissey, which Porygon2 has trouble with.

Tank
########
name: Tank
move 1: Tri Attack
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Discharge / Thunderbolt
move 4: Recover
ability: Download / Analytic
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Tri Attack is a powerful STAB move, especially after a Download boost. Ice Beam is a coverage move that hits a variety of types for super effective damage, and it also forms perfect neutral coverage with Discharge and Thunderbolt. Discharge has decent power and a good 30% chance to paralyze opposing Pokemon, which can be useful against offensive Pokemon. Thunderbolt, however, is an option for extra power. Recover is used for reliable recovery to regain any health taken off from opposing attacks.

Set Details
========

The listed EV spread with a Bold nature lets Porygon2 function as a bulky special attacker. Eviolite is the best item for the extra bulk Porygon2 gets from it. Download is great for a possible Special Attack boost upon switching in, but it can be unreliable due to the fact that it can also boost Porygon2's Attack. Analytic is a secondary option that should be used with Thunderbolt, as the Speed drop from Discharge's paralysis will make Porygon2 miss out on the boost from Analytic. Analytic boosts all of Porygon2's attacks as long as it moves last and punishes switches. However, this is somewhat unreliable too. Trace can be used to hard wall threats such as Chandelure, as Porygon2 can acquire Flash Fire and gain an immunity to Chandelure's Fire-type attacks.

Usage Tips
========

Porygon2 can switch into many opposing attacks relatively easily. However, don't switch it into a very powerful attack such as a Draco Meteor from Hydreigon, as this set lacks some defensive investment. Porygon2 should never be switched into Fighting-type attacks as they can easily KO Porygon2. Check carefully for which Pokemon Porygon2 can get a Special Attack boost with Download against; Mega Aggron is an example that obviously has higher Defense than Special Defense. Also, don't forget that Porygon2 is extremely slow, so don't wait until it is at very low health to use Recover.

Team Options
========

A status absorber or cleric support is really useful, as Porygon2 hates getting statused because it lacks passive recovery from Leftovers, and it has no way to cure it. Florges and Umbreon are Pokemon that can do this well. Pokemon such as Granbull, Crobat, and Gligar, which can handle powerful Fighting-types such as Mienshao, make for good partners too. Physically offensive wallbreakers such as Emboar can break through special walls that Porygon2 has trouble with. Emboar can also switch into Will-O-Wisp. Entry hazards make it easier for Porygon2 to KO foes, and Sticky Web is useful along with Download or Trace to outspeed several more foes. Analytic should never be used with Sticky Web because Porygon2 will outspeed more Pokemon and its damage output will be lowered. Good entry hazard setters include Azelf, Chesnaught, Hippowdon, and Galvantula.

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Toxic / Thunder Wave
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Discharge / Thunderbolt
move 4: Recover
ability: Trace
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Toxic wears down walls by continuously inflicting damage at the end of each turn, but Thunder Wave cripples offensive threats and is a viable option too. Ice Beam has excellent coverage, decent power, and forms solid neutral coverage with Electric-type moves. Discharge is better on this set for the nifty 30% chance to paralyze, though Thunderbolt is good for more power. Recover is a form of reliable recovery that lets Porygon2 stay healthy.

Set Details
========

The EVs are invested in HP and Special Defense to reliably wall threats such as Chandelure, Hydreigon, and Nidoking. Trace is advantageous in niche situations, such as using Intimidate against Krookodile on the switch or Tracing Sheer Force when switching into Nidoking. Eviolite greatly boosts Porygon2's overall bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Use Recover often, as Porygon2 is slow and will most likely not be able to Recover first. If there are Pokemon with abilities that Porygon2 can take advantage of, such as the aforementioned Chandelure and Nidoking, it can be switched into them to take their attacks while also taking advantage of their abilities. Make sure to switch Porygon2 into Pokemon it walls effectively, such as Mega Blastoise, Nidoqueen, Alakazam, and Kyurem.

Team Options
========

A status absorber or cleric support is appreciated; Porygon2 hates getting statused because it really hampers its survivability due to its lack of reliable recovery. Furthermore, Pokemon such as Crobat and Granbull, which can handle powerful Fighting-types such as Mienshao, are great team options, because Porygon2 cannot stand up to those. Physically offensive wallbreakers such as Darmanitan are good choices to break through special walls that Porygon2 has trouble with, such as Florges.

Trick Room
########
name: Trick Room
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Recover
move 3: Thunderbolt / Tri Attack
move 4: Ice Beam / Tri Attack
ability: Download / Trace
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD
nature: Quiet
ivs: 0 Spe

Moves
========

Trick Room lets slower threats such as Mega Abomasnow move first and is a good support move because of that, but it also helps Porygon2, as it is slow itself. Recover is a form of reliable recovery for Porygon2 and allows it to stay healthy. Thunderbolt has decent overall coverage and has excellent neutral coverage alongside Ice Beam. Ice Beam provides great coverage, decent power, and forms the BoltBeam combo with Thunderbolt. You can opt to give up a coverage attack for STAB Tri Attack.

Set Details
========

The given IVs and nature make Porygon2 as slow as possible to take full advantage of Trick Room. The EV investment make it a good bulky attacker by boosting its HP as well as its Special Attack. Eviolite is mandatory for the extra bulk, which Porygon2 really needs for tanking hits. Download can get Porygon2 a +1 Special Attack boost if it switches into the right Pokemon, though Trace can help it completely wall select threats such as Chandelure with Flash Fire. Analytic shouldn't be used, as Porygon2 will usually move first in Trick Room, negating its effect.

Usage Tips
========

This set should only be used on Trick Room teams, as Porygon2 is great at supporting slower Pokemon such as Mega Abomasnow and Snorlax. Set up Trick Room any time it is not active to support your slow team. Use Recover often to keep Porygon2 alive so it can come back and reset Trick Room if necessary.

Team Options
========

A status absorber or a Pokemon with cleric support is handy; Porygon2 hates getting statused because it has no passive recovery from Leftovers, and the status will eventually wear it down. Pokemon that beat powerful Fighting-types such as Lucario and Infernape are excellent choices, as Porygon2 cannot beat them; Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl are good partners for this reason. Physically offensive wallbreakers such as Tyrantrum and Swords Dance Mega Abomasnow can break through special walls such as Florges, which Porygon2 finds problematic. However, at times, Tyrantrum is at a disadvantage under Trick Room because of its decent Speed. Trick Room sweepers that can make use of Trick Room's effect make for good partners. A few examples include Mega Camerupt, Pangoro, Mega Abomasnow, and Mega Ampharos. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Forretress is appreciated in order to KO foes with greater ease.

Other Options
########

Charge Beam can be used for boosting Porygon2's Special Attack and letting it hit harder, but lacks the raw power that Thunderbolt has. Shadow Ball is an attacking option that hits the Ghost-types immune to Tri Attack, but provides redundant coverage, as most Pokemon it hits super effectively are beaten by other moves regardless. Psych Up lets Porygon2 win versus set up sweepers such as Calm Mind Suicune and Calm Mind Chandelure, but Porygon2 lacks the space for the move. Trick prevents Porygon2 from being crippled by opposing Trick or Switcheroo users, as Porygon2 can use it to get its Eviolite back, but it has very situational uses. Dark Pulse is a final option to hit Ghost-types and get a flinch, but Porygon2 outspeeds barely any other Pokemon, and just like Shadow Ball, most targets are beaten by Porygon2's coverage attacks anyway.


Checks & Counters
########

**Item Removal**: Item removal cripples Porygon2, as the loss of Eviolite lowers its bulk significantly, making it way easier to beat. Good Knock Off users include Mega Beedrill and Krookodile. Trick users such as Chandelure and Rotom-H can cripple Porygon2 as well by removing its Eviolite, as they can lock Porygon2 in a status move and force it to switch.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Mienshao, Machamp, and Infernape can beat it with their powerful STAB attacks.

**Status**: Toxic will wear down Porygon2 after several turns, as it deals increasing damage. Paralysis makes Porygon2 move last, and burns deal damage at the end of every turn.

**Taunt Users**: Common Taunt users such as Azelf can Taunt Porygon2, prevent it from recovering, and beat it with a STAB attack.

**Bulky Steel-types**: Bulky Steel-type Pokemon such as Mega Aggron and Escavalier resist Porygon2's STAB attacks as well as its coverage attacks and can take it out with their STAB attacks.

**Powerful Wallbreakers**: Very powerful wallbreakers such as Darmanitan can break through Porygon2's great bulk. These wallbreakers hate Thunder Wave, though.
