Overview
########

Ditto is one of the best revenge killers in the metagame thanks to its ability, Imposter. It works best on hyper offensive teams where the goal is to take the opponent down as quickly as possible. It also has a niche over other Scarfers by not being slowed down by Sticky Web. Sadly, Imposter doesn't copy the opponent's HP stat, and as Ditto has a pathetic base 48 HP and is vulnerable to hazards, it can be worn down quickly. Ditto also only has one role to play in the game, which makes it very predictable, and because of Ditto's need to attack due to Choice Scarf, it is complete deadweight against stall teams.

Imposter
########
name: Imposter
move 1: Transform
ability: Imposter
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Relaxed

Moves
========

Transform is Ditto's only legal move, and you won't be using it unless you are against an opposing Ditto anyway.

Set Details
========

Choice Scarf is the best item for Ditto, since unless the opponent itself has Choice Scarf, Ditto will always outspeed the opponent. 248 EVs in HP allow Ditto to take less damage from Stealth Rock, while maximum investment in Defense allows it to take less damage if in a Struggle war with another Ditto. 0 Speed IVs gives Ditto Hidden Power Ice and allows Ditto to be outsped in the rare case of a Struggle war.

Usage Tips
========

It is best to switch Ditto in after a successful U-turn or Volt Switch. Ditto cannot switch in while an opponent is boosting because it then will not get the boosts it needs. Ditto is also a terrible switch-in to opposing Scarfers because there is only a 50/50 chance of it going first and not fainting due to its pathetic 48 HP stat. Ditto can scout Pokemon with large movepools like Jirachi if necessary, or scout against leads if you want to use it more defensively.

Teammates
========

Ditto isn't a Pokemon to build a team around, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have Pokemon it would like to have as teammates. Rapid Spin or Defog support is highly appreciated because of Ditto's abysmal HP stat, and the fact that it is harmed by all entry hazards, except Sticky Web. Users of U-turn or Volt Switch are also greatly appreciated as an offensive teammate, allowing for both Ditto and the U-turn or Volt Switch user to scout a team.

Other Options
########

While Hidden Power Ice is generally the best option, you can also use different IVs to get different Hidden Powers such as Hidden Power Fire. A Focus Sash set may seem viable, but it risks being broken by entry hazards. A Red Card set is another appealing option to phaze sweepers, but Ditto may have to switch out and lose the boosts it accumulated. If you really want to use one of those sets, Sticky Web support is beneficial.

Checks & Counters
########
**Substitute/Illusion**: If Ditto's opponent is behind a Substitute or has the ability Illusion, it can't transform at all. This means Zoroark and common Substitute users render Ditto useless.

**Calm Mind**: Some Calm Mind users can beat Ditto, since they can either boost or heal while Ditto will is locked into a move.

**Return/Frustration**: Depending on its happiness, either Return or Frustration can make Ditto's job harder.
