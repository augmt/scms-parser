Overview
########

As far as physical Fire-types go, Entei has languished in obscurity, oft overlooked in favor of powerhouses like Darmanitan and Victini. Generation VI has changed all of that, bringing Entei roaring back as it received one of the best physical attacks in the game: Sacred Fire. This sets Entei apart from its competitors and works fantastically with Extreme Speed, a great priority move, and Entei's main selling point over its rivals. However, Entei still faces competition from other physical Fire-types, particularly Darmanitan and Victini, which boast greater power and superior coverage. Entei's barren movepool and the fact that Extreme Speed and Flare Blitz force the use of an Adamant nature reduce its versatility. Despite its faults, Entei is a great wallbreaker that may not set the world on fire, but can easily leave the opponent's team in ashes.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Sacred Fire
move 2: Extreme Speed
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Flare Blitz
ability: Pressure
item: Choice Band / Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Sacred Fire is an extremely good move and is the main reason why Entei is viable. Its 50% burn rate makes it very easy to spam and enhances Entei's ability to break through tough walls. Extreme Speed is similarly necessary. At +2 priority, it allows Entei to move before other priority users such as Honchkrow, and it deals significant damage to many offensive threats thanks to its high Base Power. Stone Edge provides nice coverage in tandem with Sacred Fire, targeting opposing Fire-types such as Houndoom and Arcanine. In the final slot, Entei's best option is Flare Blitz, which can come into play if Sacred Fire's PP begins to run low and on rare occasions that extra power or perfect accuracy is required. Iron Head hits Florges hard without worrying about recoil, but has little use outside of this. Finally, Bulldoze is an option as the Speed drop can come in handy, but it offers negligible coverage.

Set Details
========

Choice Band and Life Orb are both good item choices. Choice Band provides more immediate power, while Life Orb allows Entei to switch moves; for example, Entei can finish off a Pokemon with a combination of Sacred Fire and Extreme Speed. Using a Life Orb does reduce longevity, though. An Adamant nature is required as Flare Blitz and Extreme Speed come from a specific event. The EV spread is quite standard to maximize Speed and Attack.

Usage Tips
========

This set is quite straightforward in how it should be played. Basically, spam Sacred Fire even if the opponent has Pokemon that resist it, such as Slowking, as a burn will often cause more damage in the long run than a coverage move. Similarly, only use coverage moves if a burn is not valuable, Entei is facing another Fire-type, or they significantly out-damage Sacred Fire. It is important to note that Sacred Fire, Extreme Speed, and Stone Edge have only 8 PP. Against stall teams or Pressure users such as Suicune, be careful that you don't run out of PP. Entei's decent natural bulk and Fire typing provides it several opportunities to switch in and wreak havoc. Florges is a great target as Entei only fears the rare Toxic.

Team Options
========

Entei struggles against bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert. Raikou and Mega Manectric can threaten these Pokemon as well as gain momentum with Volt Switch. Toxicroak is a decent offensive answer to Water-types, though it shares a Ground-type weakness with Entei. Defog or Rapid Spin support is always a good idea when using Entei. Flygon has great type synergy, while Starmie and Mega Blastoise can threaten bulky Rock- and Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Hippowdon. Grass-types such as Celebi are excellent partners, as they can deal with the Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon that resist Sacred Fire.

Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Sacred Fire
move 2: Extreme Speed
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Flare Blitz
ability: Pressure
item: Assault Vest
evs: 252 Atk / 240 SpD / 16 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Sacred Fire provides an excellent combination of power and utility, hitting quite hard while also spreading burns due to its very high 50% burn rate. Extreme Speed is a strong priority move that can pick off faster weakened threats and Choice Scarf users before they can move. The +2 priority is also very handy, allowing Entei to move before most other priority attacks such as Sucker Punch from Absol or Honchkrow. Opposing Fire-types are hit hardest by Stone Edge. It also hits Flying-types such as Noivern harder than Sacred Fire does. In the final slot, Flare Blitz provides a noticeable boost in power and greater PP if that is required. Iron Head and Bulldoze are decent utility options to target Fairies and lower the Speed of opposing Pokemon, respectively.

Set Details
========

With an Assault Vest equipped, Entei is surprisingly bulky on the special side. For example, it can comfortably survive Life Orb Nidoking's Earth Power and Starmie's Hydro Pump before Stealth Rock damage. As such, the given EVs promote Special Defense while maintaining the ability to hit hard. 16 EVs in Speed allow Entei to outrun Adamant Metagross before it sets up an Agility. Flare Blitz and Extreme Speed are event moves; therefore, an Adamant nature is necessary.

Usage Tips
========

This set is more of a tank, taking special attacks and dealing heavy damage in return. Entei finds many chances to switch in against the likes of Florges. Sacred Fire and Extreme Speed are the two moves that should be used the most; Sacred Fire in particular is usable even if the opponent has a Pokemon that resists it. This is because a burn can often be more damaging in the long run than a coverage move. Despite Entei's high special bulk with an Assault Vest, avoid switching into or staying in on strong super effective attacks unless it's absolutely necessary, as Entei will be worn down quite quickly otherwise. Keep in mind that Sacred Fire, Extreme Speed, and Stone Edge have only 8 PP, so play carefully against Pressure users or in longer matches so Entei doesn't run out of PP.

Team Options
========

Defog or Rapid Spin support is almost essential to prevent this set from being worn down and becoming unable to tank hits effectively. Mega Blastoise and Starmie are reliable spinners that threaten Ground- and Rock-types. Flygon has great type synergy with Entei. Entei's lack of recovery makes Wish support useful. Florges works nicely, as Entei can deal with most Steel-types that commonly switch into Florges. Vaporeon also synergizes well with Entei. Grass-types in general have great synergy with Entei, as they threaten all types that resist Sacred Fire. Roserade fulfill this role as well as set up Spikes to wear down opposing Pokemon.

Other Options
########

Entei has very few other options in terms of moves. Special coverage in the form of Fire Blast or Flamethrower could take physical walls by surprise, but is generally ineffectual. A bulkier set with Lava Plume or Will-O-Wisp is potentially viable, but again struggles to be consistently effective. Choice Scarf could work on occasion, but is considerably outclassed by Darmanitan. A Sunny Day + Solar Beam set can defeat usual counters such as Swampert and Quagsire, as can Hidden Power Grass. Flame Charge boosts Speed to possibly allow a sweep, but Entei rarely finds opportunities to use it.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Water-types**: Suicune and Vaporeon take very little from any attack and can heal burns from Sacred Fire with Rest and Heal Bell, respectively. CroCune also uses Entei as setup fodder. Vaporeon and Quagsire don't mind burns due to their access to reliable recovery. Swampert and Mega Blastoise can easily switch into any move and retaliate with a super effective STAB attack, though they do not enjoy being burned.

**Bulky Ground- and Rock-types**: Hippowdon and Rhyperior completely stop Entei, though they hate being burned. Flygon can take any attack Entei can throw at it, though it is prone to being picked off by Extreme Speed if it is sufficiently weakened.

**Revenge Killers**: Naturally faster Pokemon that can reliably revenge kill Entei make for good checks. Mega Aerodactyl and Flygon are good examples. Choice Scarf users such as Chandelure and Krookodile are similarly effective. Focus Sash Dugtrio can trap and remove Entei but cannot switch in due to Sacred Fire's burn chance.

**Flash Fire**: Pokemon with Flash Fire such as Houndoom and Chandelure make spamming Sacred Fire a bit unwise.

**Stealth Rock**: Because it takes 25% of Entei's health with every switch in, Stealth Rock is a nice way to wear Entei down over the course of a match.
