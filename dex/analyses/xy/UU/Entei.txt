Overview
########

Entei received a massive buff when it received Sacred Fire, one of the most beneficial attacks in the game. Thanks to Sacred Fire's STAB boost, and amazing 50% chance to burn, even supposed checks will have a hard time switching into Entei, factoring in possible entry hazards and burn damage. Entei's access to Extreme Speed makes it a fantastic late-game cleaner, and its solid bulk and a decent base 100 Speed allows it to outspeed common walls such as Chesnaught and Cresselia. However, Entei is plagued with a vulnerability to every form of entry hazard, including the very common Stealth Rock, and no reliable recovery, making it unable to switch in multiple times. Because Flash Fire is unreleased, Entei must run Pressure, which is a rather mediocre ability unless Entei is using a bulkier set. Its Speed stat, while decent, is also nothing spectacular, especially considering that Entei is forced to run an Adamant nature to use Extreme Speed and Flare Blitz.


Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Sacred Fire
move 2: Flare Blitz
move 3: Extreme Speed
move 4: Stone Edge
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Sacred Fire packs high power with the STAB boost and a good chance to burn, while Flare Blitz has more PP and gives the extra power that Sacred Fire does not have; be aware, however, that Entei takes recoil damage if it chooses to use Flare Blitz. Extreme Speed is a priority move and can pick off weakened and faster foes such as Mega Beedrill and Crobat after they have taken Stealth Rock damage. Stone Edge targets Flash Fire users and opposing Fire-type Pokemon such as Arcanine and Chandelure as well as Mega Aerodactyl on the switch.


Set Details
========

An Adamant nature is required, as Extreme Speed and Flare Blitz are event-only moves. Choice Band is the preferred item, maximizing Entei's attack, although Life Orb can be used for the ability to switch moves but gives Entei slightly less power. Maximum Attack EVs are for maximum damage output, while the Speed EVs let Entei outspeed everything up to positive-natured base 86 Speed Pokemon.


Usage Tips
========

Unless the opponent has a Flash Fire user, Entei's best bet is to spam Sacred Fire. Even checks and counters to Entei don't appreciate the residual damage from a burn combined with possible damage from entry hazards. Sacred Fire's 95% accuracy can cause issues, and it also has limited PP, so Pokemon such as Suicune, which has Pressure, can easily PP stall Entei's Sacred Fire. Because of this, you should also be wary of Flash Fire users such as Chandelure. Don't switch Entei in and out often while Stealth Rock is present on your side of the field, as the combination of Life Orb recoil, if it is being used, and entry hazards wear Entei down extremely fast.


Team Options
========

Powerful Electric and Grass-type Pokemon such as Mega Ampharos and Shaymin are handy for dealing with the bulky Water-types that give Entei trouble, as most of them can stall out Entei's Sacred Fire. Mega Blastoise and Empoleon can force out Rock-types and clear entry hazards with Rapid Spin and Defog, respectively. Entry hazard setters such as Rhyperior make Entei's job easier, as entry hazard damage and burn damage quickly wear down Entei's switch ins.


Other Options
########

Entei has a somewhat shallow movepool, so it does not have many other decent options. Assault Vest is viable to raise Entei's passable special bulk, a specially attacking Calm Mind set can be used to surprise physical walls, and a Sunny Day + Solar Beam set can be used to hit many of Entei's checks and counters.


Checks & Counters
########

**Mega Ampharos**: RestTalk Mega Ampharos can easily eat up any hit from Entei and doesn't fear Sacred Fire burns. It can pivot out or force Entei out with its STAB moves.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon, Alomomola, and Suicune take Scared Fire very well and can PP stall Entei.

**Entry Hazards**: Stealth Rock and Spikes wear down Entei very quickly, and it without team support, Entei can't recover any entry hazard damage it takes.

**Bulky Ground-types**: Bulky Ground-types such as Krookodile and Rhyperior take little to no damage from Sacred Fire, fearing only its chance to burn, and can even set up Stealth Rock to wear Entei down.

**Flash Fire Users**: Pokemon with Flash Fire, such as Chandelure can switch in to Choice-locked Entei and get a boost in the process

**Curse Snorlax**: Curse Snorlax can freely switch into Entei and easily set up.

**Defensive Arcanine**: Thanks to Intimidate, defensive Arcanine, and can switch into Entei with little problem, barely fearing even Stone Edge.

**Revenge Killers**: Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Jolly Krookodile can easily revenge kill Entei. However, both fear Sacred Fire burns, so they cannot freely switch in.
