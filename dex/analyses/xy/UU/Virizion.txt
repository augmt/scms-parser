Overview
########

Virizion is one of the only Pokemon that can set up on bulky Water-types without fear due to its nice set of resistances and good overall stats, particularly in Speed and Special Defense. Virizion is also fairly versatile, being able to run two great boosting sets in Swords Dance and Calm Mind, making it one of the best offensive Grass-types around. However, Virizion has a few flaws that prevent it from being as effective as it can be. Its attacking stats are slightly underwhelming, and it requires setup to do a lot of damage. While its typing gives it some nice resistances, it also heavily cripples it, as weaknesses to common attacking types such as Flying, Fire, and Poison make it hard for it to switch in. Despite this, Virizion can make it past these flaws and serve as one of the best Grass-types in the tier.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Close Combat
move 3: Leaf Blade
move 4: Zen Headbutt / Stone Edge
ability: Justified
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance boosts Virizion's Attack and allows it to sweep. Close Combat is Virizion's main Fighting-type STAB attack, having good power and coverage; however, it lowers Virizion's defenses. Leaf Blade is Virizion's Grass-type STAB attack which smacks the bulky Water-types that Virizion sets up on, particularly Suicune and Swampert, as well as Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Donphan. Zen Headbutt hits Poison-types such as Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Amoonguss. Stone Edge hits Flying-types, such as Noivern, Tornadus, and Crobat, for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

The given EVs and a Jolly nature are used to maximize Virizion's Attack and Speed stats. A Jolly nature is needed to outspeed Pokemon like Choice Scarf-lacking variants of Mienshao, Hydreigon, and Jirachi. A Lum Berry lets Virizion switch into Scald from bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Mega Blastoise, multiple times without fear, as well as preventing it from being set on a timer by other status users. Life Orb can also be used to give Virizion a power boost, letting it deal more damage, which is appreciated considering Virizion's need for a boost to do a lot of damage.

Usage Tips
========

Virizion should be attempting to set up and sweep after switching into Pokemon whose attacks it resists, as it counters bulky Water-types such as Suicune, especially with Lum Berry. It also should only be attempting to sweep when common checks to it such as Crobat, Aerodactyl, and Choice Scarf Darmanitan are removed. It should also be trying to take advantage of Justified by switching into Dark-type moves, such as Dark Pulse and Knock Off.

Team Options
========

Stealth Rock setters, such as Nidoqueen, Swampert, and Jirachi, are appreciated as teammates, as they can make it easier for Virizion to sweep and wear down its common checks with Stealth Rock. As Virizion is very weak to Flying- and Fire-types, Pokemon that can switch into them repeatedly make for good partners, such as Mega Ampharos, Rhyperior, and Suicune. As Virizion disposes of bulky Water- and Ground-types with ease, Pokemon that appreciate the removal of them are also good partners, such as Krookodile.


Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Substitute / Synthesis
ability: Justified
item: Leftovers
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Calm Mind boosts Virizion's Special Attack and Defense. Giga Drain is Virizion's main Grass-type STAB attack, stealing a good portion of the opponent's health when boosted. Although it is unreliable, Focus Blast is Virizion's main Fighting-type STAB attack and hits like a nuke when boosted. Substitute takes advantage of Virizion's ability to force switches and lets it set up without taking damage. Synthesis provides reliable recovery and can be used if Giga Drain does not provide enough recovery.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread is used to maximize Virizion's Speed and Special Attack. A Timid nature is used to allow Virizion to outspeed Choice Scarf-lacking variants of Mienshao, Hydreigon, and Jirachi. Leftovers is used to give Virizion passive recovery each turn.

Usage Tips
========

Virizion should be setting up when switching into Pokemon it can easily take hits from, particularly Water- and Ground-types. Virizion shouldn't be setting up until mid- or late-game, as it needs faster Pokemon that can switch into it multiple times, such as Crobat, out of the way before it can sweep.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Swampert is appreciated, as hazards make it easier for Virizion to sweep. Pokemon that can beat special walls such as Florges are also good partners for Virizion, such as Entei, Jirachi, and Snorlax. Crobat is a massive threat to this set, as it can bypass Virizion's Substitutes with Infiltrator, and it does not take much damage from Virizion's attacks, so it can switch in with ease. Pokemon that can deal with Crobat, such as Mega Ampharos, are great partners for Virizion.

Other Options
########

Virizion has access to Work Up, letting it serve as a mixed sweeper, but a Work Up set really doesn't do much that the Swords Dance and Calm Mind sets don't accomplish. Virizion can run Sacred Sword for an alternative to Close Combat, but it is much weaker, making it inferior to Close Combat. Virizion can try to run a stallbreaker set with Taunt, but it's generally too weak to pull it off, and it doesn't have a lot of ways to deal with Flying-types. Virizion has access to dual screens, but a dual screens set is generally done better by other Pokemon, such as Azelf and Cresselia.

Checks & Counters
########

**Flying-types**: Pokemon such as Crobat, Noivern, Mega Aerodactyl, and Tornadus all threaten Virizion out due to its 4x weakness to Flying-type moves, and the former two can switch in to both of its STAB moves multiple times, only fearing Stone Edge. Crobat is especially dangerous, as its Infiltrator ability lets it pass through Virizion's Substitutes.

**Psychic-types**: Cresselia can take most of Virizion's hits with relative ease and retaliate with a STAB Psychic-type move. Other Psychic-types, such as Alakazam, Azelf, and Espeon, can also serve as great checks to Virizion, but they cannot switch in due to their poor physical bulk.

**Choice Scarf users**: Common Choice Scarf users, such as Darmanitan, Jirachi, Chandelure, and Mienshao can all check Virizion, but they are all nailed by one of Virizion's moves if boosted.

**Doublade**: Doublade completely walls both sets with its massive Eviolite-boosted defenses, and it can easily set up on Virizion.

**Grass-types**: Amoonguss, Celebi, and Trevenant resist both of Virizion's STAB moves and don't take too much from even a boosted Stone Edge, though Amoonguss has to be wary of Zen Headbutt.
