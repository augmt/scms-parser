Overview
########

With its solid bulk and good Attack stat, Donphan can work as a great Rapid Spin user on any team. With a useful ability in Sturdy, access to Knock Off, and priority in the form of Ice Shard, Donphan is an exceptional offensively based spinner. It has several flaws that hinder its success, however. With no form of reliable recovery, Donphan struggles to spin away hazards more than once a battle. Along with this, it also faces competition from the likes of Mega Blastoise and Forretress. Lastly, it cannot take special hits very well, due to its poor Special Defense stat.

Moves
========

Rapid Spin is the main reason to use Donphan, providing a way to remove entry hazards for the team. Earthquake is a reliable, powerful STAB move, granting Donphan the ability to beat Fire-, Steel-, and Electric-type Pokemon with ease. Knock Off is used to nail Ghost-types trying to spinblock. Stealth Rock is to support Donphan's team with its own hazards, helping to wear down opposing threats, while Ice Shard can come in handy sometimes for picking off weakened foes, though it is very weak.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment is used to dish out a lot of damage, and enough Speed investment is used to outspeed standard Jellicent. An Adamant nature is used to bolster Donphan's offensive presence. Leftovers is the item of choice, used for gradual, steady recovery. With an Assault Vest, Donphan forgoes the ability to use Stealth Rock in order to increase its pitiful special bulk, enabling it to survive strong special attacks and brush off weak ones. Sturdy is the only ability to consider, as it can guarantee Donphan gets off a move as long as it's at full health.

Usage Tips
========

There are a few things to watch out for when using Donphan, including Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type coverage moves. Keep Donphan around as long as you can, and do not let it fall if the opponent still has a entry hazard setter. Earthquake and Knock Off have decent coverage and should be used where necessary, but leave attacking duty primarily to teammates and focus on keeping Donphan healthy. With proper use of prediction and calculation, Donphan can deal with Ghost-types with one of Earthquake, Knock Off, or Ice Shard.

Team Options
========

Cleric support from Pokemon such as Granbull and Umbreon really improves Donphan's longevity. Blissey, Alomomola, and Florges can all help keep Donphan healthy with their Wish support. Additionally, Alomomola and Donphan have good type synergy, as Alomomola can take Water- and Ice-type moves well, while Donphan can block Electric-type moves. Fire-type Pokemon such as Darmanitan, Infernape, Rotom-H, and Chandelure make for good teammates, as they appreciate entry hazards removal and can take on Grass-types for Donphan with ease. Additionally, mixed Infernape, Rotom-H, and to an extent, Chandelure, can handle Water-types for Donphan. Generally, any Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon can benefit from Donphan's presence.

Other Options
########

Donphan can utilize a myriad of alternate options effectively. Choice Band can be used for more power, but generally Donphan wants to run Stealth Rock. Head Smash is a high Base Power move for hitting threatening foes such as Crobat; Stone Edge can also be used for this purpose, but the high power of Head Smash is usually worth the recoil. An Endeavor set with Sturdy and Ice Shard can be used, but it is pretty gimmicky. Seed Bomb is a really nice move for Donphan, as it allows it to beat threatening Water-types such as Swampert and Quagsire. Roar can be used to phaze out physical setup sweepers, while Toxic can be used to wear them down. Finally, Play Rough can be used on a more offensively based Donphan, getting coverage against Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-type Pokemon.

Checks & Counters
########

**Water-types**: Water-type Pokemon such as Suicune, Swampert, Vaporeon, and Kingdra can all take a hit and either OHKO Donphan with their STAB attacks or gradually wear it down.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Roserade, Shaymin, and Celebi can all OHKO Donphan with a super effective STAB move, while Donphan cannot do much back. Roserade needs to be wary of Earthquake, however.

**Physical Walls**: Hippowdon, Quagsire, Swampert, and Mega Aggron can all take multiple hits from Donphan and proceed to either stall it out or finish it off quickly.

**Status**: Burn and poison really hamper Donphan, as they halve its Attack and whittle it down, respectively.

**Ghost-types**: Sableye, Cofagrigus, Jellicent, and Froslass block Donphan's main move, Rapid Spin, and can either wear it down with burns or KO it with a super effective attack.
