Overview
########

Togetic finds a niche in ORAS UU with a unique Fairy / Flying typing that gives it resistances or immunities to some of UU's common offensive types in Fighting, Dark, Bug, Ground and Dragon. Despite Togetic's base defenses looking mediocre at best, they can be boosted by Eviolite. Furthermore, Togetic has a good variety of support moves, such as Defog and Wish, at its disposal.

Togetic isn't without faults, however, as it is a very passive Pokemon whose highest attacking stat is its mediocre base 80 Special Attack. Togetic is also unable to utilize any of its abilities to full extent, as Hustle is unusable due Togetic's low Attack stat, Serene Grace isn't too useful without access to a flinch-inducing move, and Super Luck is, as the name implies, very luck-based.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Seismic Toss / Dazzling Gleam
move 2: Roost
move 3: Defog
move 4: Heal Bell / Thunder Wave / Toxic
ability: Serene Grace
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

This set allows Togetic to function as an entry hazard remover as well as an overall support Pokemon depending on its last move. Seismic Toss allows Togetic to damage foes consistently, chipping away 100 HP with each hit. Dazzling Gleam, on the other hand, isn't as consistent but is a good STAB attack that allows Togetic to effectively KO Dragon- and Fighting-types, among others. Roost allows Togetic to reliably recover HP, which is essential for any wall. Defog removes entry hazards from the field, making it a good support move, as it prevents Togetic and its teammates from being worn down by Stealth Rock and other entry hazards. Heal Bell allows Togetic to act as a cleric, removing status from itself as well as its teammates. Thunder Wave slows down opposing Pokemon, making it a good move to stop sweepers from doing their job. Lastly, Togetic can put sweepers and defensive Pokemon alike on timers with the use of Toxic.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs are used to maximize overall bulk while letting Togetic take less damage from Stealth Rock. 252 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature are used to ensure maximized special bulk. An alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD can be used with a Bold nature instead to deal with the numerous Fighting-types in the tier better. Serene Grace is the chosen ability, as Hustle lowers the accuracy of Seismic Toss and Super Luck is incompatible with Defog. Eviolite boosts Togetic's defenses by 50%.

Usage Tips
========

Should the listed spread be used, send Togetic in against special attackers it walls, such as Mega Sceptile and non-Iron Tail Hydreigon, and take advantage of them by either crippling them or supporting Togetic's teammates. However, if the alternate EV spread is used, be sure to send Togetic in against Fighting-types it can wall, such as Heracross and Machamp, and take advantage of them, but be wary of super effective coverage moves they tend to carry. Should Togetic and its teammates need entry hazards removed, try to use Defog as soon as possible.

Team Options
========

Physical walls, such as Hippowdon and Suicune, make for good partners if the listed EV spread is in use, as they can wall the various physical attackers that threaten Togetic. Should the alternative EV spread be used, however, special walls, such as Blissey and Snorlax, make for optimal partners, as they can deal with the special attackers that trouble Togetic. Pokemon that appreciate entry hazard removal, such as Moltres and Fletchinder, value Togetic as a teammate. Bulky Steel-types, such as Forretress and Mega Aggron, make for good teammates, as they resist or are immune to four of the types Togetic is weak to, namely Ice, Rock, Steel, and Poison.

Nasty Pass
########
name: Nasty Pass
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Roost
move 4: Dazzling Gleam / Magic Coat
ability: Super Luck
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Sassy

Moves
========

Nasty Plot boosts Special Attack by two stages, making it a good boosting move that makes any special attacker a very dangerous sweeper. Baton Pass allows Togetic to pass a boost to its teammates. Roost gives Togetic a form of reliable recovery, which in turn allows it to pass boosts more than once should it be weakened. Dazzling Gleam is a good STAB attack that allows Togetic to make use of the Nasty Plot boosts itself if need be. Magic Coat, on the other hand, allows Togetic to bounce back support moves such as Taunt and Whirlwind, which would otherwise stop this set from being utilized effectively.

Set Details
========

The given EVs allow Togetic to maximize its special bulk while ensuring Togetic takes minimal damage from Stealth Rock. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD with a Relaxed nature can also be used to take on physical attackers. The 0 Speed IVs and Sassy nature allow Togetic to be as slow as possible, ensuring Togetic takes a hit instead of the Baton Pass recipient. An Eviolite is the chosen item, as it boosts Togetic's defenses.

Usage Tips
========

This set should attempt to set up on special attackers Togetic walls and opposing walls and proceed to pass the boosts to dangerous special attackers such as Mega Sceptile and Speed Boost Yanmega.

Team Options
========

Special attackers that benefit from Togetic passing Nasty Plot boosts, such as Mega Sceptile and Choice Scarf Hydreigon, make for good teammates. Mega Blastoise gets a special mention for not only being a good recipient of a Nasty Plot boost but also being able to remove Stealth Rock, which hinders Togetic. Physical wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Entei and Choice Band Heracross, also make for good partners, as they effectively remove special walls that stop Togetic's Nasty Plot recipients from effectively sweeping.

Other Options
########

Togetic has access to both Reflect and Light Screen but is unable to utilize them effectively because it has to hold Eviolite to retain its bulk and therefore cannot hold Light Clay to lengthen the number of turns the screens last. An offensive Nasty Plot set is usable but is usually ineffective, as Togetic has mediocre Speed and Special Attack. A Wish set can be used, but due to Togetic's low HP stat, it is unable to heal much of its teammates' HP. Togetic has access to Encore, which allows it to lock foes into a favorable move, but Togetic tends not to have space on any set for it. Lastly, Flamethrower allows Togetic to hit Steel-types for super effective damage but uses up an important slot for both of its sets.

Checks & Counters
########

**Poison-types**: Poison-types don't worry much about any move Togetic uses, bar Thunder Wave, and can either OHKO or 2HKO with a powerful STAB move. Nidoqueen and Nidoking get a special mention for being immune to Thunder Wave.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types, such as Magneton and Doublade, can easily switch into any move Togetic uses and proceed to 2HKO with a powerful STAB move.

**Wallbreakers**: Wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Darmanitan and Choice Specs Rotom-C, don't worry too much about any of Togetic's moves, while they can either OHKO, 2HKO, or force it out due to their powerful STAB attacks.

**Haze Users and Phazers**: Pokemon that can remove stat boosts, such as Clear Smog Amoonguss, Haze Tentacruel, and Whirlwind Hippowdon, can stop Togetic's Nasty Plot set from being utilized effectively, but they don't really affect the support set.
