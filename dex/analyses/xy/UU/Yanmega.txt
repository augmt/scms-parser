Overview
########

Yanmega is a Pokemon graced with two great abilities. The first, Tinted Lens, bypasses resistances and turns Yanmega into a powerful wallbreaker when equipped with Choice Specs. The second ability, Speed Boost, allows Yanmega to easily clean up late-game once it has accumulated a boost or two. To complement these abilities, Yanmega also has a nice base 116 Special Attack and a good base 95 Speed, meaning Yanmega can be quite efficient at performing these roles. However, Yanmega does have some notable flaws that prevent it from becoming as threatening as it could be. The first is its Bug / Flying typing, which comes with numerous weaknesses, including a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. Yanmega also has bad overall bulk, leaving it vulnerable to priority and limiting switch-in opportunities. However, Yanmega's biggest flaw is the amount of competition it faces for a teamslot. Other Choice Specs users such as Chandelure and Porygon-Z give it a ton of competition as a special wallbreaker, while Yanmega faces competition from Sharpedo as a Speed Boost cleaner.

Choice Specs
##########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Bug Buzz
move 2: Air Slash
move 3: Giga Drain
move 4: U-turn / Sleep Talk
ability: Tinted Lens
item: Choice Specs
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========

Bug Buzz is Yanmega's most powerful STAB attack, and with Tinted Lens making it basically unresisted, it is extremely hard to switch into. Air Slash is Yanmega's secondary STAB attack, which also hits extremely hard with Tinted Lens taken into account. As Yanmega's STAB moves are nearly unresisted, Giga Drain is chosen in the third slot to allow Yanmega to recover HP against Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types. While U-turn may seem unusual on a Choice Specs set, using it can help keep the momentum during a match. Sleep Talk can be used in the last moveslot to allow Yanmega to function as a sleep absorber if your team lacks one.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed allows Yanmega to be as fast and powerful as possible. With a Modest nature, Yanmega can net some key 2HKOs, including a 2HKO against specially defensive Mega Aggron and a chance to 2HKO physically defensive Florges after Stealth Rock. However, a Timid nature can be helpful for outspeeding Pokemon such as Nidoking and Roserade. Choice Specs is the item of choice on this set, as it allows Yanmega to hit extremely hard in combination with Tinted Lens, which lets Yanmega bypass resistances from the opposing Pokemon, essentially allowing its moves to be nearly unresisted.

Usage Tips
========

It's important to try to keep Stealth Rock off the field as much as possible in order to increase Yanmega's longevity. Bug Buzz will be the move it'll be using most of the time, as it's basically unresisted thanks to Tinted Lens. U-turn will be used a decent amount too, especially against more offensively-inclined teams to help gain momentum. Depending on what nature it's running, make sure you know what Yanmega can and can't outspeed. If Yanmega falls asleep while running Sleep Talk, be wary of the amount of possible sleep turns it has left, or else you may use Sleep Talk on the turn it wakes up.

Team Options
========

Rapid Spin or Defog support is close to necessary, as Yanmega loses 49% of its health to Stealth Rock. Good users of the move include Starmie, Mega Blastoise, Crobat, Donphan, Flygon, and Empoleon. Rhyperior, Mega Ampharos, and Rotom-H can take Fire-, Flying-, and Electric-type attacks for Yanmega with ease, with the latter also being able to take Ice-type attacks for Yanmega. Pokemon that deal with Blissey and Florges, such as Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Jirachi are all helpful partners, as Blissey and most variants of Florges have enough Special Defense to reliably wall Yanmega. Pokemon which can set up Spikes, such as Roserade and Froslass, help Yanmega wallbreak much easier. Generally, offensive Pokemon that dislike stall teams appreciate Yanmega's ability to wallbreak.

Speed Boost
########
name: Speed Boost
move 1: Bug Buzz
move 2: Air Slash
move 3: Giga Drain / Ancient Power
move 4: Protect
ability: Speed Boost
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Bug Buzz is Yanmega's main STAB attack, having the highest Base Power of any of its moves. Air Slash provides a secondary STAB move that hits the Fighting-types that resist Bug Buzz. Protect allows Yanmega to get a guaranteed Speed boost, something crucial for starting a sweep. Giga Drain beats bulky Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types such as Swampert, Hippowdon, and Rhyperior while also healing off Life Orb and Stealth Rock damage. Ancient Power is an option, however, to hit the Flying- and Fire-types such as Chandelure and Noivern that resist Yanmega's main STAB move. It's also a great move to catch Fletchinder on the switch, a Pokemon that would otherwise deal with Yanmega quite easily.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Modest nature makes Yanmega as powerful and as fast as possible, with emphasis on Special Attack due to Speed Boost already raising Yanmega's Speed to great levels. Life Orb gives Yanmega as much power as possible, while Speed Boost allows Yanmega to boost its Speed and clean late-game.

Usage Tips
========

When using Yanmega, make sure it's because of its positives over Sharpedo; slightly better bulk, a Ground-type immunity, and a better way of dealing with Grass-types are a few of the advantages Yanmega has over Sharpedo. Try to use Yanmega late-game, when most of your opponent's team has been heavily weakened. Using Protect the first turn you send out Yanmega is important to give it an immediate Speed boost. Keeping Stealth Rock off the field is important to give Yanmega the highest chance of sweeping.

Team Options
========

Once again, Rapid Spin or Defog support is support essential. Good users include Starmie, Mega Blastoise, Crobat, Donphan, Flygon, and Empoleon. Pokemon that can deal with Blissey and Florges, such as Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Jirachi are all helpful partners, as Blissey and Florges can easily stop Yanmega from sweeping. Wallbreakers are generally helpful, as Yanmega has trouble getting past a lot of walls without Tinted Lens. Notable wallbreakers include Life Orb Mienshao, Honchcrow, Chandelure, Porygon-Z, Victini, Nidoking, and Mienshao. Toxic Spikes support from Nidoqueen and Tentacruel is helpful, as not only can Yanmega gain a Speed boost from a Protect, but also weaken a Pokemon into KO range. Rotom-H can cover Yanmega's Fire-, Electric-, Flying-, and Ice-type weaknesses, while Pokemon such as Mega Ampharos and Rhyperior can cover Yanmega's Fire-, Electric-, and Flying-type weaknesses. Hippowdon can also take Rock- and Electric-type attacks with ease. Pokemon which can set up Spikes, such as Roserade and Froslass, help Yanmega clean much easier. Essentially, any team looking for a late-game cleaner will appreciate Speed Boost Yanmega.

Other Options
########

A set with Endure + Weakness Policy can actually be very effective, as it makes use of Yanmega's many weaknesses to give it a +2 boost, which in combination with Speed Boost, makes Yanmega both fast and powerful. It's not as consistent as Life Orb, however, making Life Orb the generally superior option. Hidden Power Ground hits Fire-types and Steel-types for super effective damage, though most Steel-types don't take very much damage from Hidden Power Ground due to its low Base Power. Psychic can be used on the Choice Specs set to hit Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, but it's usually better just spamming Bug Buzz. Finally, Shadow Ball can hit Chandelure super effectively, but has very little utility outside of that.

Checks & Counters:
########

**Stealth Rock**: Stealth Rock strips Yanmega of a large amount of its health each time it switches in, making it a very effective tool at wearing Yanmega down. Good users of Stealth Rock include Nidoqueen, Hippowdon, Azelf, and Mega Aggron.

**Florges and Blissey**: Both Florges and Blissey can use their massive special bulk to wall anything Yanmega throws at it. It's important to note, though, that Modest Choice Specs Tinted Lens Yanmega has a chance to 2HKO physically defensive Florges after Stealth Rock.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as specially defensive Mega Aggron and Empoleon wall the Life Orb set with ease. They do not enjoy taking Modest Bug Buzzes from Tinted Lens variants, however.

**Flying-types**: Flying-types such as Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat resist Bug Buzz and can retaliate with a super effective STAB move. The Speed Boost set can use Ancient Power, however, to deal good amounts of damage to them.

**Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Chandelure, Entei, and Infernape resist Bug Buzz and can OHKO with their powerfu STAB attacks. Fletchinder gets a special mention for 4x resisting Bug Buzz and OHKOing back with Acrobatics. They do not like getting hit by Ancient Power, however.

**Faster Attackers** While nothing really enjoys switching in on the Choice Specs set, most fast attackers can easily revenge kill it. Examples include Victini, Darmanitan, Mienshao, and Mega Houndoom.
