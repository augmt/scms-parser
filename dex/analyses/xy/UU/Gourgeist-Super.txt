Overview
########

Gourgeist-XL possesses a unique typing that allows it to be a spinblocker that resists the STAB attacks of both Donphan and Blastoise, making it easier to play around them. It has a good Defense stat, allowing it to function as a good physical wall. Furthermore, it has decent Attack and Speed stats for a wall. Moreover, Gourgeist-XL has access to various support moves, such as Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp. With Gourgeist-XL gaining access to Synthesis in ORAS, it finally outclasses its counterpart, Trevenant.
However, Gourgeist-XL's typing isn't too good defensively, giving it weaknesses to common coverage moves, such as Knock Off, which limits its potential as a wall. Gourgeist-XL also has pitiful special bulk.

Moves
========

Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers, allowing Gourgeist-XL's teammates to switch into them with ease. Leech Seed allows Gourgeist-XL to slowly wear down foes while recovering HP at the same time. Synthesis gives Gourgeist-XL a form of reliable recovery. Seed Bomb is a reliable STAB attack that allows Gourgeist-XL to beat the various bulky Water-types in the tier. Lastly, Foul Play is an option to punish physical attackers, especially those that attempt to set up on Gourgeist-XL and don't care about Will-O-Wisp, such as Swords Dance Heracross and Swords Dance Infernape.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP and Defense EVs allow Gourgeist-XL to be as physically bulky as possible. Frisk is the chosen ability, as it allows Gourgeist-XL to scout the foe's item. Leftovers is chosen as the held item, as it gives Gourgeist-XL passive recovery.

Usage Tips
========

Gourgeist-XL's unique typing and good Defense stat should be used to full extent by blocking predicted use of Rapid Spin, as well as walling physical attackers, such as Mega Swampert, Cobalion, and non-Fire Blast Salamence. Gourgeist-XL shouldn't attempt to stay in on Rapid Spin users with super effective coverage moves, such as Dark Pulse Mega Blastoise. Gourgeist-XL should always attempt to wear down foes with Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed.

Team Options
========

Gourgeist-XL is a physical wall, making special walls, such as Blissey and Florges, good partners, as they wall special attackers that threaten Gourgeist-XL. Bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Vaporeon, make for good teammates, as they take on Ice- and Fire-types that threaten Gourgeist-XL. Entry hazard setters, such as Forretress and Nidoqueen, make for good teammates, as they capitalize on Gourgeist-XL's ability to effectively block Rapid Spin. Lastly, Pokemon with access to phazing moves, such as Roar Suicune and Whirlwind Snorlax, make for good teammates, as Gourgeist-XL is setup fodder for most Pokemon that use Substitute.

Other Options
########

Destiny Bond allows Gourgeist-XL to take down other Pokemon along with it, but can't fit on the set. An offensive set is an option, but Gourgeist-XL isn't too good offensively due to its mediocre offensive typing. Gourgeist-XL has access to Trick Room, but it is unable to utilize it effectively due to its decent Speed stat.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Fire-types, such as Entei and Darmanitan, aren't threatened by any of Gourgeist-XL's moves and can OHKO it with a super effective STAB attack.

**Dark-types**: Dark-types, such as Hydreigon and Pangoro, can easily OHKO Gourgeist-XL with a super effective STAB attack but have to be wary of Will-O-Wisp. Mega Absol and Mega Houndoom get a special mention for not being affected by Will-O-Wisp.

**Special Attackers**: Due to Gourgeist-XL's low HP and Special Defense, special attackers such as Mega Pidgeot and Kyurem can easily KO it with a powerful STAB attack and while not having to worry about Will-O-Wisp.
