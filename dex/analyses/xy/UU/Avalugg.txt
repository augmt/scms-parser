Overview
########

Due to being a slow, defensive Ice-type, Avalugg may not immediately come to mind as a Rapid Spin user in the UU metagame, especially given its weakness to Stealth Rock. However, Avalugg has a few advantages that can make it a worthwhile addition your team. Like the iceberg that was able to sink the Titanic, Avalugg is highly resilient, boasting an impressive base 184 Defense stat backed by a respectable base 95 HP. Being one of only two Rapid Spin users in the tier with Recover (the other being Starmie), Avalugg is able to reliably keep itself healthy to clear entry hazards multiple times in a match. This goes well with its ability Sturdy, which allows it to survive fatal hits at full HP. Access to Earthquake and Crunch allows Avalugg to take on Fire- and Steel-types and spinblockers respectively while maintaining decent coverage alongside its Ice-type STAB move, supported by its usable base 117 Attack stat.

Of course, Avalugg still has flaws that hold it back, the most notable being Ice-type's poor defensive capabilities, which lets down its great defensive stats. This, on top of a weakness to Stealth Rock and susceptibility to all entry hazards, can make using Rapid Spin difficult. Its Special Defense is also incredibly poor, rendering Avalugg setup fodder for nearly all special sweepers in the tier and even some physical ones, while being the slowest Pokemon in the metagame next to Escavalier means it is almost always going last. However, with adequate support, Avalugg can still fulfill its role on your team and should not be overlooked.

Rapid Spinner
########
name: Rapid Spinner
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Recover
move 3: Avalanche
move 4: Roar / Earthquake / Toxic
ability: Sturdy
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 Def
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Rapid Spin is the only reason to use Avalugg, as it allows Avalugg to support its team by removing entry hazards. Recover restores HP, increasing Avalugg's longevity and ability to sponge hits and subsequently use Rapid Spin throughout a match. Avalanche is Avalugg's only physical Ice-type STAB move, which doubles in power if Avalugg takes a hit before attacking. This goes well with its negative priority, ensuring Avalugg will take a hit most of the time, while its base 117 Attack stat makes the move hit decently hard with little investment. Roar is preferred for the last moveslot since it can phaze opposing Pokemon and hinder sweepers trying to set up on Avalugg while also being able to wear the opposing team down with damage from entry hazards. Earthquake rounds out Avalugg's coverage, hitting the Fire- and Steel-types Avalugg tends to attract for super effective damage, while Toxic can be used to wear down most switch-ins to Avalugg, keeping pressure on them even when Avalugg is forced out. Crunch can be used to hit Ghost-types trying to block Rapid Spin, though bear in mind most Ghost-types have the bulk to take a Crunch from Avalugg and either attack or burn it.

Set Details
========

This is Avalugg's only outright viable set in UU. Rapid Spin gives it an edge over most Defog users, since Avalugg can clear hazards from only its own side, and its survivability is augmented by Recover. Maximum HP investment gives Avalugg a Stealth Rock number while maximizing its titanic Defense, allowing it to take on physical attackers such as Honchkrow, Flygon, Donphan, Snorlax, and Krookodile. Its immense physical bulk allows Avalugg to even take unboosted super effective physical moves, such as Mega Aerodactyl's Stone Edge, and Metagross's Meteor Mash without requiring Sturdy to be intact. Sturdy allows Avalugg to take a devastating hit in an emergency and retaliate, either getting off a crucial Rapid Spin (after using Recover) or attacking in hope of getting a KO before going down. Leftovers gives Avalugg much-needed passive recovery, while Rocky Helmet can be used to hurt physical attackers, as Avalugg can still restore its own HP with Recover, though the recovery from Leftovers will often prove more useful. An alternate spread of 248 HP / 168 Def / 92 SpD can be used to allow Avalugg to avoid the 2HKO from Florges's Moonblast. If Stealth Rock is up, Avalugg can still switch in on Florges as long as it doesn't opt to go for Moonblast.

Usage Tips
========

Keeping Avalugg as healthy as possible is absolutely vital to using it effectively, as it can still be worn down by entry hazards and repeated attacks. Avalugg also should not be the sole physically defensive Pokemon on your team; too many of UU's premier physical attackers including Darmanitan, Mienshao, and Infernape have strong STAB moves that can easily exploit Avalugg's weaknesses. When switching Avalugg in to go for Rapid Spin, use Recover if it is above 50% of its HP and is able to force out the opposing Pokemon; fully restoring its HP reactivates Sturdy, ensuring that it's able to use Rapid Spin safely while offsetting damage it may have taken from switching into entry hazards. After Avalugg has taken a hit, Avalanche doubles to 120 Base Power, so use this to take advantage of its great Attack stat and deal heavy damage to attackers it's healthy enough to take hits from. Avalugg is bulky enough to take super effective coverage moves that lack STAB typing, such as Stone Edge from Choice Scarf Mienshao and Superpower from Honchkrow or Mega Absol. These moves can put a dent in Avalugg, but they will not be enough to break through it outright, allowing Avalugg to still check these Pokemon.

Team Options
========

Other physically defensive Pokemon to take Fire-, Fighting-, Rock-, and Steel-type moves make great partners for Avalugg, such as Qwilfish, Swampert, Jellicent, and Hippowdon. Special walls that cover Avalugg's exploitable Special Defense, such as Florges and Umbreon, can form a balanced defensive core with Avalugg to cover both sides of the offensive spectrum. Pokemon who benefit from Avalugg's Rapid Spin support, such as Victini, Honchkrow, Darmanitan, Mega Aerodactyl, and Yanmega, appreciate Stealth Rock being off their side of the field. Poison-types such as Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Roserade, and Toxicroak are able to absorb Toxic Spikes for Avalugg, as it hates having to risk getting poisoned before being able to even use Rapid Spin.

Other Options
########

Avalugg's movepool is very limited, though it still has a few other interesting options to choose from. Curse can be used with Avalanche, Earthquake, and Recover, though it has to compete with Snorlax, Swampert, and Mega Aggron as a Curse user, and its typing and poor Special Defense also make it difficult to stay in and set up. Mirror Coat can be used to surprise special attackers, which works well in tandem with Sturdy, ensuring Avalugg survives the blow and retaliates; however, this can leave Avalugg too weak to do much else afterwards, making it highly situational. A set utilizing Hail and Icy Rock with the Ice Body ability can be used to offer support to Hail teams. Gyro Ball works with Avalugg's abysmal Speed stat, allowing it to deal more damage to Florges as well as faster switch-ins that don't resist the move. Bulldoze can also be used over Earthquake to reduce the Speed of opposing Pokemon, though it is significantly weaker, and most Pokemon still outrun Avalugg with -1 Speed; however, Avalugg's teammates can take advantage of this.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Victini, Darmanitan, Entei, Chandelure, Rotom-H, and Mega Houndoom can annihilate Avalugg with their STAB moves and can switch in on it as it goes for either Avalanche or Rapid Spin. They have to be aware of switching in on a potential Earthquake, Toxic, or Roar with Stealth Rock up, as all will result in them being worn down or KOed. Rotom-H, however, is an exceptional threat if Avalugg chooses to run Earthquake, as it's immune to Earthquake and resists Avalanche, fully countering Avalugg with ease.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Mienshao, Infernape, Machamp, and Toxicroak can punish Avalugg with their Fighting-type STAB attacks, while Toxicroak is able to set up on it as well. However, Toxicroak has to be wary of switching in on an Earthquake, and Avalanche deals respectable damage to all of them after Avalugg takes a hit.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Mega Aggron, Forretress, Metagross, and Jirachi all resist Avalanche, are immune to Toxic, and have the bulk to stomach an Earthquake from Avalugg. While they may not be able to dispatch Avalugg immediately with their Steel-type STAB moves, they all are able to set up Stealth Rock on Avalugg, even after it uses Rapid Spin. Jirachi is capable of breaking Avalugg down with successive flinches from Iron Head, and Meteor Mash from Metagross deals serious damage, especially if it manages to gain an Attack boost.

**Special Attackers**: Nearly every special attacker in the tier is able to 2HKO Avalugg due to its abysmal Special Defense. Special attackers that can switch in on Avalanche, such as Mega Blastoise, Empoleon, Starmie, Shaymin, Chandelure, Porygon2, and Mega Houndoom, are all threats to Avalugg.

**Setup Sweepers**: Setup sweepers like Swords Dance Toxicroak, Substitute + Calm Mind Raikou, Suicune, Cloyster, and Nasty Plot Azelf can set up on Avalugg easily, even if it carries Roar, as they tend to theaten it even before setting up too.

**Status**: Avalugg struggles with being burned or poisoned, as both statuses negate Sturdy and wear down its HP, making it harder for Avalugg to stay in on strong attackers. Being badly poisoned by Toxic keeps Avalugg from being able to offset the damage with Recover after enough turns have passed, while burns neuter its Attack. Switching into Toxic Spikes also makes Avalugg incredibly easy to wear down, even if it manages to spin them away.

**Spinblockers**: Ghost-types such as Chandelure, Cofagrigus, Sableye, and Trevenant can switch in to block Rapid Spin, keeping entry hazards on the field. However, they have to be wary of switching in on Toxic. Once they do switch in, however, they are all able to threaten Avalugg by either breaking through it or burning it, eventually forcing it out.

**Mixed Lures/Attackers**: Though they are rare, mixed attackers that can lure in Avalugg, such as Fire Blast Mega Absol, mixed Sharpedo, and lead Azelf with Fire Blast, are all able to surprise it with the appropriate coverage move.
