Overview
#######

Dragalge's STAB moves, Draco Meteor and Sludge Wave, both have perfect coverage bar Steel-types, and the former even packs a huge Base Power of 130. Combined with Adaptability, which doubles the Base Power of Dragalge's STAB moves, this makes Dragalge a great wallbreaker. Dragalge's Draco Meteor, for reference, OHKOes standard Alomomola. Furthermore, Dragalge's great defensive typing and good bulk allow it to pivot into many attacks in the tier, such as Fire Blast and Scald, and then retaliate with ease. However, Dragalge's low Speed somewhat offsets this, as it will usually be taking a hit before it is able to deal damage. And while Dragalge has a good defensive typing, it is still susceptible to very common moves such as Ice Beam, Earthquake, and Psyshock. Dragalge is also susceptible to both Stealth Rock and Spikes, although it does absorb Toxic Spikes. Dragalge's main STAB move, Draco Meteor, drops its Special Attack by two stages, which can make it setup bait at times.

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is Dragalge's most powerful STAB move, and when combined with Choice Specs is able to OHKO most Pokemon that don't resist it. Sludge Wave is Dragalge's secondary STAB move, and is much more reliable to use against frailer targets because it doesn't drop Dragalge's Special Attack. Sludge Bomb is an alternative option, however, as the small poison chance pressures most special walls and the power drop is negligible, although the ability to hit Chesnaught without dropping Draaglge's Special Attack is missed. Focus Blast provides coverage against Steel-types, which resist both of Dragalge's STAB moves. Dragon Pulse is a more reliable STAB move that doesn't drop Dragalge's Special Attack and allows it to deal more damage late-game. However, the power drop is notable and is only really the better choice for more reliability. However, one could opt for a Dragon Fang and Toxic Spikes due to the multitude of switches Dragalge forces while still having a high-powered Draco Meteor. Hydro Pump is an option to OHKO Rock- and Ground-types, but it doesn't do much outside of this. Hidden Power Fire OHKOes Forretress and 2HKOes Bronzong after Stealth Rock damage. Dragon Tail with a Mild nature is also an option on sets running the Dragon Fang, as Dragalge will then lack the power to 2HKO Umbreon and other special walls, so it can instead deter their healing by forcing them out.

Set Details
========

Adaptability is the best ability on this set, as it allows Dragalge to function as a total nuke with its STAB moves. 252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximize Dragalge's Special Attack. 68 Speed EVs allow Dragalge to outspeed Relaxed Swampert so Dragalge can slam it with a Draco Meteor. The remaining EVs are put into HP to boost Dragalge's bulk and allow it to use its great defensive qualities to pivot into attacks better. Choice Specs boosts Dragalge's Special Attack even further, allowing it to hit harder. However, Dragon Fang must be used if Toxic Spikes is being run to ensure Dragalge can switch moves yet still retain the power with Draco Meteor. An alternative spread with 92 Speed EVs is an option to pressure Blissey, although Blissey will usually just recover off the damage.

Usage Tips
========

This set mainly functions as a wallbreaker. Most of the time, you'll usually just be using Draco Meteor to try and dent the foe or flat-out OHKO it. However, while using Draco Meteor is generally the best option, try to use it a bit sparingly if Sludge Wave can get the job done, due to Sludge Wave's lack of a Special Attack drop. Due to the amount of switches Dragalge forces, Dragalge can set up Toxic Spikes on to cripple the opponent's switch-ins. Dragalge's great defensive typing and good bulk allow it to tank many hits and pivot into special attacks that it resists. It is imperative that you use correct prediction when the opponent has an opposing Fairy- or Steel-type, as they can easily force Dragalge out if you don't correctly use Sludge Bomb or Focus Blast on the switch. However, this set is fairly easy to use, and it basically is just breaking through the foe with powerful attacks.

Team Options
========

Even with Focus Blast and Hidden Power Fire, Dragalge still struggles against fully invested Steel-types such as Jirachi and Bronzong due to their high special bulk. Dugtrio and Choice Specs Magneton can trap these Pokemon and clear the path for Dragalge. Trick Room support is an option due to Dragalge's low Speed stat. Cresselia and Reuniclus have great defensive synergy with Dragalge, are both very bulky, and can reliably set it up. Porygon2 is an option, as it tanks most attacks that threaten Dragalge and can also set up Trick Room. Physical attackers that beat special walls are good partners for Dragalge. Darmanitan and Choice Band Entei incinerate special walls with their Fire-type STAB moves and even have decent offensive synergy with Dragalge. Dragalge is easily countered by Psychic-types such as Mega Alakazam, Cresselia, and Slowking, so having a partner that can easily Pursuit trap them such as Krookodile makes it easier for Dragalge to wallbreak. Wish support is greatly appreciated, as Dragalge easily gets worn down by entry hazards; Aromatisse and Alomomola both have great defensive synergy and pass enormous Wishes. Machamp is a great partner, as it lures in Fairy-types for Dragalge while Dragalge lures in Steel-types for Machamp, and they could both benefit from the aforementioned Trick Room.

Other Options
########

An Assault Vest might seem like a good option for Dragalge due to its high Special Defense and reasonable power with Adaptability. However, this isn't the case, as Dragalge is worn down very quickly by entry hazards and its lack of natural recovery, and it still lacks a bit of power. Thunderbolt is an option for those who want a more reliable way to hit Suicune, although it does not provide much out of this due to Draco Meteor hitting other targets harder. A Life Orb is an option for those who do not want Dragalge to be setup bait, but Dragalge will still lack a bit of power that it has with Choice Specs and it is even worn down quicker due to entry hazards chipping away at its health. Shadow Ball can be used in the last slot to 2HKO Jirachi and Bronzong. Albeit a very gimmicky option, Venoshock is an option to take advantage of Toxic Spikes' poison. Lastly, a full defensive set is viable, as Dragalge has access to many moves such as Dragon Tail, Haze, and Scald. Poison Touch would be the chosen ability for this set to spread poison with Dragon Tail.

Checks & Counters
########

**Special Walls**: Dragalge is unable to break through multiple special walls in the tier such as Blissey and Cresselia. Dragalge will end up letting them use it as setup fodder or they'll set up as Dragalge switches out. Although Dragalge can use Draco Meteor and remove half of the foe's health, the foe will likely use some form of recovery and Dragalge is forced to switch after the Special Attack drop.

**Bulky Steel-types**: Steel-types are resistant to Dragalge's main STAB move and are completely immune to its secondary one, making them an easy switch-in. While Dragalge will usually pack Focus Blast, bulky Steel-types that are neutral to Focus Blast such as Jirachi and Bronzong easily check it due to their high bulk and can either set up or attack. Even then, Focus Blast's accuracy is unreliable and makes it harder to spam it against even super effective targets.

**Faster Pokemon**: Pokemon that are faster and have the type advantage over Dragalge such as Alakazam and Krookodile are easy checks to Dragalge. They both outspeed Dragalge and can strike with a super effective STAB move. However, almost none of these Pokemon are able to switch into Dragalge, as they fear being hit with a STAB move.
