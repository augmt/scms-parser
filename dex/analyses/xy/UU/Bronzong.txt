Overview
########

Bronzong is an incredible support Pokemon, having access to dual screens, Stealth Rock, and Trick Room, which sets it apart from many other Psychic-type Pokemon in the tier. It also has a fantastic defensive typing and great stats to go along with it. However, Bronzong is not without its faults; it has no reliable recovery, new weaknesses to Dark- and Ghost-types, and it is extremely slow. It also faces stiff competition from Jirachi and many other Psychic-type Pokemon in the tier such as Azelf and Cresselia. Nonetheless, Bronzong can be a great asset to your team. 


Trick Room Lead
########
name: Trick Room Lead
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Explosion
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Heatproof
item: Mental Herb
evs: 252 HP / 104 Atk / 152 Def
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Relaxed


Moves
========

Trick Room is the most important move, reversing the Speed order so that Pokemon that are normally slower move first. Stealth Rock is used because Bronzong can easily set it up with its bulk. Explosion lets a slow sweeper come in safely, dealing a massive amount of damage to anything that does not resist it. Finally, Earthquake lets Bronzong hit the Steel- and Fire-types that try to switch in for super effective damage.


Set Details
========

Maximum HP EVs allow Bronzong to survive hits better. The Defense EVs let Bronzong always survive an Adamant Choice Band V-create from Victini. Heatproof is used over Levitate so Bronzong is never OHKOed by any unboosted Fire-type attack. Mental Herb is used in order to prevent Bronzong from being setup bait and let it set up Trick Room or Stealth Rock without fearing Taunt. A Relaxed nature further increases Bronzong's ability to take physical hits and lets it move first in Trick Room.


Usage Tips
========

Always lead with Bronzong and use Trick Room. Bronzong will force a lot of switches due to Trick Room, so try and predict accordingly. Use Explosion when you predict your opponent will set up and give one of Bronzong's teammates a free switch-in. However, if your opponent has a Ghost-type, play safely and switch Bronzong out. It's always better to have more Trick Room turns, as Bronzong won't be doing much to Ghost-types anyway.


Team Options
========

Bronzong won't need much support, as it will be using Explosion after it has fulfilled its role; rather, it will be supporting its offensive teammates. Pokemon that appreciate Trick Room support, such as Ampharos, Escavalier, and Snorlax, make excellent partners, as they can use the few Trick Room turns to deal damage to or KO many Pokemon in the tier. Wish passers, especially Aromatisse because it cannot be Taunted, pair well with Bronzong if it doesn't use Explosion because they can allow Bronzong to set up Trick Room multiple times before it uses Explosion. Pokemon that cover Bronzong's weaknesses, such as Krookodile, Umbreon, and Hydreigon, make good partners because they have great type synergy with it, taking on the Dark- and Ghost-type moves that trouble Bronzong. Bulky Mega Evolutions such as Mega Blastoise make good partners, as they are able to switch into Knock Offs aimed at Bronzong.


Tank
########
name: Tank
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Gyro Ball
move 3: Toxic
move 4: Protect / Earthquake
ability: Levitate / Heatproof
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Relaxed


Moves
========

Bronzong is an amazing tank thanks to its numerous resistances and great bulk, and it can thus set up Stealth Rock very easily. Gyro Ball is Bronzong's STAB attack of choice, hitting anything that does not resist it very hard. Toxic allows Bronzong to put a timer on many deadly sweepers and walls. The last move is a toss-up between Protect and Earthquake. Protect can be used to scout the opponent's next move and rack up Toxic damage. Earthquake allows Bronzong to check Nidoqueen and Nidoking and hits the Fire- and Steel-types that try to switch into Gyro Ball.


Set Details
========

The given EV spread maximizes Bronzong's ability to take physical hits. A Relaxed nature is used to increase Bronzong's Defense and Gyro Ball's power. Leftovers gives Bronzong a form of passive healing, recovering the HP lost from Stealth Rock or a potential burn. Levitate is the ability of choice, making Bronzong immune to Ground-type moves. Heatproof can be used to make Bronzong neutral to Fire-type attacks and halve burn damage; however, it leaves Bronzong unable to check many Pokemon such as Flygon and vulnerable to Spikes. Bronzong can use a specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD, allowing it to check many special attackers such as Nidoqueen, Nidoking, Shaymin, and Calm Mind Jirachi more easily, although you must note that it then cannot take on the prominent physical attackers in the tier as easily.


Usage Tips
========

Bronzong should set up Stealth Rock as soon as you can. In addition, try not to get Bronzong burned, because it has no way of curing it and will be worn down easily unless it uses Heatproof. Predict well, because Bronzong will almost always go last because of its horrible Speed stat.


Team Options
========

Though Bronzong is a fantastic support Pokemon, it appreciates some support as well. Umbreon and Florges make excellent partners; both can pass Wish, and they can also heal status with Heal Bell and Aromatherapy, respectively. Fire-type Pokemon such as Chandelure and Houndoom are excellent partners, absorbing the Fire-type moves aimed at Bronzong courtesy of their Flash Fire ability. However, note that Chandelure shares many of the same weaknesses as Bronzong. Lastly, Water-type Pokemon such as Suicune and Vaporeon pair well with Bronzong, taking the Fire-type moves aimed at it; in return, Bronzong can take the Grass-type attacks directed at them.


Dual Screens
########
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Light Screen
move 2: Reflect
move 3: Stealth Rock
move 4: Explosion
ability: Levitate
item: Light Clay
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Impish


Moves
========

Bronzong is often regarded as inferior to Azelf and Cresselia as a dual screens user, but it does have some advantages over them. It is bulkier and has a better defensive typing, which gives it more chances to set up Light Screen and Reflect. Light Screen and Reflect are obviously the most important moves, halving damage from special and physical attacks, respectively. This allows Bronzong to be a great team supporter. Bronzong also finds it very easy to set up Stealth Rock thanks to dual screens and its bulk. Explosion is used to let a teammate come in safely.


Set Details
========

The given EVs maximize Bronzong's ability to take physical hits. Light Clay is used because it increases the duration of Light Screen and Reflect. An Impish nature is used to further increase Bronzong's Defense stat.


Usage Tips
========

Bronzong should try and set up dual screens as soon as it can, and depending on which Pokemon it is facing, use the appropriate screen. After it has set up both screens, it can set up Stealth Rock or deal massive damage with Explosion and bring in a sweeper safely. However, be wary of using Explosion if your opponent has a Ghost-type Pokemon. If you predict a Ghost-type switching in, Bronzong can set up Stealth Rock or double switch into a Pokemon that can deal with the Ghost-type better.


Team Options
========

Bronzong doesn't need any team support because it will be using Explosion most of the time when it finishes setting up dual screens. Setup sweepers that appreciate dual screen support, such as Houndoom and Scrafty, make excellent partners because they both have great type synergy with Bronzong and can set up and sweep more easily under dual screens.


Other Options
########

Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit many Pokemon, most notably Flygon and Gligar, harder than any other move, but since Bronzong is not invested in Special Attack, it will do very little damage. Gravity can also be used, removing Ground-type immunities and making some shaky moves more accurate, but it's hard to find a moveslot for it. A Calm Mind set can also be used, but Bronzong is highly outclassed by Jirachi in this regard. Finally, Iron Head can be used to hit Kyurem that can otherwise easily PP Stall Gyro Ball, but outside of this it has little use.


Checks & Counters
########

**Taunt**: Taunt stops Bronzong right in its tracks, preventing it from setting up. Pokemon such as Crobat and Azelf usually run Taunt, but they have to be wary of Gyro Ball and Explosion, which deal heavy damage.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Suicune and Jellicent take little damage from Bronzong's moves; the former can set up, whereas the latter can burn or wear Bronzong down with Shadow Ball.

**Fire-types**: Fire-type Pokemon such as Entei, Chandelure, and Houndoom can force Bronzong out with their respective Fire-type STAB moves, but they have to be wary of Earthquake. Rotom-H resists Gyro Ball and is immune to Earthquake courtesy of Levitate; it can burn Bronzong, keep momentum with Volt Switch, or KO with Overheat.

**Dark-types**: Dark-type Pokemon such as Scrafty, Hydreigon, and Krookodile stop Bronzong right in its tracks and can use it as setup fodder or KO Bronzong with their STAB moves.
