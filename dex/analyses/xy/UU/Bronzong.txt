Overview
########

Bronzong is an excellent support Pokemon, having access to Stealth Rock, dual screens, and Trick Room, which makes it a valuable addition to many teams. It has great overall bulk which is backed up by a decent defensive typing and a great ability, making it an excellent counter to many of the tier's top threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Kyurem, Shaymin, Nidoqueen, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Mega Abomasnow. Its main selling point over its Steel-type brethren, such as Mega Aggron and Forretress, is Levitate, which makes it immune to entry hazards bar Stealth Rock and rules out using Ground-type coverage commonly seen on sweepers such as the aforementioned Mega Aerodactyl, Kyurem, Mega Abomasnow, and Nidoqueen as a means of getting past it. It also does not take up a Mega slot, which is another advantage it holds over Mega Aggron.

However, the big metallic bell is not without its faults; its mediocre offensive stats and terrible Speed mean that it is setup bait for several Pokemon, and its lack of reliable recovery makes it prone to being worn down and it will not like to switch in repeatedly to take even resisted hits. Its typing makes it weak to Dark-type moves, and with the prevalence of Knock Off and trapping ability of Pursuit, this is quite crippling.

move 2: Gyro Ball
move 3: Toxic
move 4: Earthquake / Protect
ability: Levitate

ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Sassy

Moves
========

Bronzong is one of the most reliable Stealth Rock users in the tier, being able to use its excellent defenses and multiple resistances to come in and set it up with ease. Gyro Ball is powered up greatly by Bronzong's terrible Speed, taking a good chunk out of most Pokemon that don't resist it. Iron Head can be used as an alternative option to conserve PP, especially against SubRoost Kyurem, and hit slow Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Mega Abomasnow harder; however, it is far weaker than Gyro Ball against faster Pokemon. Toxic helps to cripple many sweepers and walls and goes well with Bronzong's defensive nature, while Earthquake hits Steel- and Fire-types that resist its STAB moves, such as Empoleon and Entei. Protect can be used instead of Earthquake to garner a much-appreciated free turn of Leftovers recovery and let poison damage build. However, this leaves Bronzong completely helpless against Steel-types.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP and Special Defense make Bronzong an immensely sturdy special sponge, equipping it to take on some of the most threatening special attackers in the tier such as Kyurem, Nidoqueen, and Shaymin. A Sassy nature combined with 0 Speed IVs powers up Gyro Ball as much as possible. A Careful nature should be run if Iron Head is used. Leftovers is a must for longevity, as Bronzong lacks a reliable recovery move. Bronzong can use a physically defensive set instead with a spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD and a Relaxed nature to better counter physical attackers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Dragon Dance Salamence. Whichever one you use depends on your team's requirements, though Bronzong can usually take on the aforementioned Pokemon well enough even without investment.

Usage Tips
========

Bronzong is one of the most reliable Stealth Rock users in the tier, so take advantage of its excellent defenses and multiple resistances to switch it in and set it up with ease. Thanks to Levitate and its Stealth Rock resistance, it can switch in multiple times throughout the match, making it an excellent defensive pivot for balanced teams. With its great bulk, it makes for an excellent counter to many of the tier's top threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Kyurem, Shaymin, Nidoqueen, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Mega Abomasnow. Be careful of switching it in recklessly though, as with no reliable recovery Bronzong is not going to like repeatedly taking even resisted hits too often.

Team Options
========

Common sweepers that benefit from Stealth Rock support, such as Salamence and Mega Aerodactyl, are great partners. Bronzong has no reliable recovery, so Wish users make for excellent teammates. Physically defensive Aromatisse and Vaporeon in particular have excellent defensive synergy with Bronzong and can pass it massive Wishes thanks to their huge HP stats. Knock Off absorbers such as Mega Blastoise and Chesnaught are also appreciated by Bronzong, which is severely crippled by the move. A particularly good teammate for Bronzong is Tentacruel; it and Bronzong complement each other perfectly, resisting each other's weaknesses and being able to set up Stealth Rock, spin, and set up Toxic Spikes between them.

Trick Room Support
########
name: Trick Room Support
move 1: Gyro Ball
move 2: Trick Room
move 3: Earthquake / Stealth Rock
move 4: Explosion
ability: Levitate
item: Macho Brace / Mental Herb
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Brave

Moves
========

Gyro Ball is ridiculously powerful when backed up by the Attack investment, Brave nature, and Macho Brace. With Macho Brace and 0 Speed IVs, Bronzong hits 31 Speed, which means that anything with a Speed stat of 185 or over is smashed with a 150 Base Power STAB move. Trick Room allows Bronzong to outspeed the vast majority of the metagame and wreak havoc on offensive teams in particular, making it an excellent late-game cleaner. Earthquake does huge damage to the Fire-types and Steel-types that resist Gyro Ball, while Stealth Rock can be used to provide team support if required. Explosion is used to go out with a bang once Bronzong's job is done, hopefully taking something down with it in the process.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP provides Bronzong with decent overall bulk, while maximum Attack is needed to hit as hard as possible. The Brave nature, 0 Speed IVs, and Macho Brace power up Gyro Ball to ridiculous levels. Mental Herb can be used to prevent Taunt users from ruining Bronzong's day, while Leftovers is an option for increased longevity.

Usage Tips
========

Trick Room Bronzong can be played as a suicide lead of sorts to set up Stealth Rock and Trick Room quickly and then explode in order to bring your slow sweepers in safely. It finds plenty of opportunities to come in and provide support with its excellent bulk and resistances. Bronzong can also be used as a sweeping tool late-game against weakened teams with Gyro Ball's immense power. Even though this set is offensively oriented, Bronzong still has excellent bulk with the HP investment and can therefore be used to check threats that could potentially be dangerous to your team without Bronzong, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Dragon Dance Salamence, Nidoqueen, and Kyurem.

Team Options
========

This Bronzong doesn't need much support itself; instead, it can provide excellent support for dedicated Trick Room teams. Hence, slow sweepers that benefit from Trick Room support, such as Mega Abomasnow, Mega Camerupt, Escavalier, and Mega Ampharos, make for great teammates. Bronzong has no reliable recovery, so Wish users such as Aromatisse and Vaporeon can be used to continuously replenish Bronzong's health so that it can switch in to set up Trick Room multiple times in the match. Bronzong appreciates Knock Off absorbers such as Mega Blastoise and Chesnaught, as it is severely crippled by the move.

Other Options
########

Bronzong can run an effective dual screens set with its bulk and defensive typing. Its access to Explosion also lets it set up screens and then explode to let a teammate come in safely. Hypnosis can be used to temporarily incapacitate threatening switch-ins or to let a teammate set up. Bronzong can also utilize Trick with Choice Band or Iron Ball as its held item in order to cripple some of its common switch-ins including Suicune, Rotom-H, and Gligar. Grass Knot 2HKOes Swampert and hits bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon harder than Bronzong's other moves, while Hidden Power Ice can be used to deal significant damage to Salamence and Gligar. However, without any Special Attack investment these moves are not going to be doing much damage unless they are 4x super effective, and are hence quite situational.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dark-types and Ghosts Dark- and Ghost-types**: Dark- and Ghost-type Pokemon can easily KO Bronzong with their STAB attacks. Krookodile is especially threatening, as it can permanently remove Bronzong from the game with Pursuit.

**Bulky Sweepers**: Certain bulky sweepers such as Suicune, Feraligatr, Snorlax, and Cresselia can use Bronzong as setup bait, but they dislike Toxic.

**Reuniclus**: Bronzong is utterly helpless against Reuniclus. Toxic has no effect on it thanks to Magic Guard, while Gyro Ball does pitiful damage due to Reuniclus's terrible Speed stat.

**Fire-types**: Powerful Fire-types such as Entei, Chandelure, and Darmanitan can KO Bronzong with their STAB attacks, although they need to watch out for Earthquake.
