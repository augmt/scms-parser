Overview
########

Being the only fully evolved Pokemon to have the ability Arena Trap gives Dugtrio a niche in in UU; it can pick off and revenge kill many threats, as Arena Trap renders them unable to escape. It also has an excellent base 120 Speed stat, only being outsped by few select Pokemon and Choice Scarf users. However, not all is well for Dugtrio, as it has a relatively low Attack stat for an offensive Pokemon and is extremely frail, failing to survive even some resisted attacks. Because of this, Dugtrio is a high-risk, high-reward Pokemon that only works well if used correctly. Dugtrio also has a shallow movepool, making it extremely predictable.

Trapper
########
name: Trapper
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: Aerial Ace
move 4: Memento / Sucker Punch
ability: Arena Trap
item: Choice Band / Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Earthquake is a powerful STAB move and is the move Dugtrio will be using the most. Stone Edge completes the EdgeQuake combo, hitting Flying- and Bug-types that are immune to and resistant to Earthquake, respectively. Aerial Ace allows Dugtrio to pick off weakened Grass-types such as Shaymin and Roserade while also OHKOing Heracross. The last move is mostly filler; Memento supports sweepers that require set up while Sucker Punch can be used to pick off faster threats.

Set Details
========

The EVs given maximize Attack and Speed. Either a Jolly or Adamant nature can be utilized. Jolly Dugtrio outspeeds more threats such as Infernape and Espeon, whereas Adamant Dugtrio hits harder and ensures some important KOs on foes such as Entei if Dugtrio is using a Life Orb. Choice Band is used to increase Dugtrio's mediocre Attack to decent levels, helping it revenge kill threats. Alternatively, a Life Orb can be used to still hit hard while also giving Dugtrio the option to switch moves.

Usage Tips
========

Dugtrio should be used to revenge kill foes and clean late-game using its excellent Speed, or to trap and KO major threats to your team. Due to its frailty, bring Dugtrio in through a free switch, either after a teammate has fainted or with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Ground-, Electric-, Fire-, Steel-, Poison-, and Rock-types, such as Mega Abomasnow and Slurpuff, make good partners as Dugtrio gives them an easier time sweeping. Due to its frailty, Dugtrio is unable to switch in on many attacks, so slow pivots such as Vaporeon and Mega Ampharos are good partners. Toxic Spikes setters such as Tentacruel and Roserade appreciate the removal of grounded Poison-types that soak up the Toxic Spikes, and therefore are good partners for Dugtrio.

Other Options
########

Toxic is a viable option that allows Dugtrio to cripple walls such as Alomomola and Hippowdon. Pursuit may seem redundant on a Pokemon that has a trapping ability, but Pursuit allows Dugtrio to trap Ghost-types such as Chandelure. Substitute can be used to dodge Sucker Punches from slower threats such as Honchkrow and Toxicroak. A Focus Sash + Stealth Rock set can be used to better ensure Dugtrio gets a move off.

Checks & Counters
########

**Pokemon That Can Escape From Arena Trap**: Flying-types, Ghost-types, and Levitate users are the only Pokemon capable of switching out of Arena Trap, so they can switch out to a more suitable counter.

**Bulky Grass- and Water-types**: Bulky Grass- and Water-types such as Amoonguss and Suicune respectively can usually survive a hit from Dugtrio and can OHKO back with their super effective STAB moves.

**Dedicated Physical Walls**: Physically bulky Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Hippowdon can easily eat up any hit and heal up or 2HKO Dugtrio.

**Fast Revenge Killers**: Dugtrio is extremely frail, so a majority of Choice Scarf users and faster Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Mega Aerodactyl respectively, can easily revenge kill it.

**Priority**: After a bit of damage, a majority of the priority attacks in the tier, such as Entei's Extreme Speed and Fletchinder's Acrobatics, can clean up Dugtrio.
