Overview
########

Being the only fully evolved Pokemon to have the ability Arena Trap gives Dugtrio a niche in in UU; it can pick off and revenge kill many threats, as Arena Trap renders them unable to escape. It also has an excellent Speed stat, only being outsped by Aerodactyl, Crobat, and Noivern while also Speed tying with Alakazam. However, not all is well for Dugtrio, as it has a relatively low Attack stat for an offensive Pokemon and is extremely frail, falling to even some resisted attacks. Because of this, Dugtrio is a high-risk, high-reward Pokemon that only works well if used correctly. Also, Arena Trap only traps grounded Pokemon, so Flying-types, Levitate users, and Ghost-types can switch out to a more suitable counter. While it does have its downsides, Dugtrio's Speed and trap-and-kill utility earns it a spot on many teams.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: Aerial Ace
move 4: Sucker Punch / Memento
ability: Arena Trap
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Earthquake is a powerful, reliable STAB move that deals significant damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Stone Edge hits the Flying- and Bug-types that resist Earthquake super effectively and forms the famous EdgeQuake combination. Aerial Ace is used to pick off threats such as Roserade and Shaymin with low HP and deals heavy damage to Chesnaught. Sucker Punch is mostly a filler move, but the priority can come in handy for picking off faster threats and getting the jump on Alakazam. Memento is also an option in the last slot to give a sweeper a chance to set up after Dugtrio has done its work.

Set Details
========

The EVs are used to maximize Dugtrio's Attack and Speed, which are the stats that Dugtrio should be depending on the most. A Jolly nature is recommended over Adamant because the Speed is absolutely crucial to Dugtrio's success, but Adamant can be used to guarantee a 2HKO on Blissey. A Choice Band is used to boost Dugtrio's Attack to decent levels. Also, because of Arena Trap, no prediction is required as the opponent can't switch unless it is a Ghost- or Flying-type or has the ability Levitate.

Usage Tips
========

This Dugtrio set should be used for removing threats, revenge killing, and cleaning up late-game. It can trap and KO major threats to your team using its high Speed stat. Also, double switch into Pokemon that Dugtrio can take out. For example, you can bait Empoleon, double switch into Dugtrio, and then remove it with Earthquake.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Poison-, Steel-, Ground-, Rock-, Fire-, and Electric-types make good partners as they can sweep more easily after their checks are removed. For example, Lucario likes the removal of Nidoqueen, which Earthquake hits super effectively, Calm Mind Suicune appreciates having Electric-types out of its way, and even walls such as Florges can benefit as Earthquake hits Poison- and Steel-types super effectively. Blissey also like the removal of Lucario, which otherwise decimates her with Close Combat. Other Pokemon Dugtrio can effectively trap and KO include Mega Ampharos, Tentacruel, Arcanine, Jirachi, and Mega Houndoom. Dugtrio is also good at removing offensive threats to your team because of its high Speed, so even defensive Pokemon make good partners for Dugtrio. They can also switch into attacks that Dugtrio can't take.

Reversal
########
name: Reversal
move 1: Reversal
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge / Memento
move 4: Stealth Rock / Sucker Punch / Memento
ability: Arena Trap
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

At low HP, Reversal becomes the most powerful move Dugtrio possesses and has good coverage. If Focus Sash activates, it reaches 200 Base Power, making it more powerful than Earthquake after STAB. Earthquake is a reliable STAB move, but keep in mind that it is less powerful than Reversal when at low HP. Stone Edge provides coverage against Bug- and Flying-types, and the three combined have perfect neutral coverage. Stealth Rock can be used in the last slot if your team lacks a setter, and it gives Dugtrio something to do other than attack when trying to get to low HP. Memento can be used in the last slot too for situations where Dugtrio is stuck against something it can't beat and you want to give another sweeper a chance to set up. Sucker Punch can be used for a priority move as well.

Set Details
========

The chosen EVs maximize Attack and Speed, which are the only stats that matter for Dugtrio as it is incredibly frail. Focus Sash guarantees that Dugtrio can do something on the first turn and helps get into the low HP range so Reversal can be effective. A spread of 12 HP / 244 Atk / 252 Spe can be used to guarantee that Dugtrio will be in the 2% range after Stealth Rock and two Seismic Tosses.

Usage Tips
========

You must be very careful when using Dugtrio as it is incredibly frail and will fall to even some resisted attacks if its Focus Sash is broken. This set should be used exclusively for revenge killing and should never switch in manually, except on a double switch. It makes an excellent check to Blissey as it takes at minimum three Seismic Tosses to KO, so Dugtrio can hit her hard with Reversal.

Team Options
========

Dugtrio excels as removing opponents weak to Ground- and Fighting-type moves, so any Pokemon that like those removed appreciate its support. Bulky Water-types in particular make good teammates because Dugtrio can remove Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Cacturne that can usually set up on them. Dugtrio also appreciates a spinner or Defogger so its Focus Sash can stay intact.

Other Options
########

A Life Orb set can be used for late-game cleaning, but it is generally outclassed by more powerful Pokemon with similar Speed. Toxic can be used to break down walls, but any damage at all done to Dugtrio will severely cripple it for the rest of the time it is alive. A Substitute + Liechi Berry set can be used, but it can be hard to get into Berry range because of Dugtrio's frailty (though its high Speed stat is very useful). It should be noted, however, that a +1 Reversal can OHKO Blissey.

Checks & Counters
########

**Pokemon That Can Escape From Arena Trap**: Flying-types, Ghost-types, and Levitate users are the only Pokemon capable of switching out of Arena Trap, so they can switch out to a more suitable counter.

**Bulky Grass- and Water-types**: Bulky Grass- and Water-types can usually survive a hit from Dugtrio and OHKO back with their super effective STAB moves.
