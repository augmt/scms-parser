Overview
########

Azelf is regarded as one of the best suicide leads in the tier, due to its massive offensive and supportive options, great offensive stats. Azelf even has a good boosting move in Nasty Plot, letting it function as a powerful special sweeper. However, it is easy for Azelf to do its job, and it provides good results when used right. However, Azelf is not without its faults; its poor defenses and bad defensive typing make it fold to nearly any attack and also leave it vulnerable to the powerful Dark-types in the tier, such as Hydreigon and Mega Houndoom. It also faces competition from Aerodactyl as a suicide lead. Overall, Azelf is a threat that should not be overlooked in the metagame.

Suicide Lead
########
name: Suicide Lead
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Flamethrower / Knock Off
move 4: Explosion
ability: Levitate
item: Focus Sash
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Jolly

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is the primary purpose of this set, letting Pokemon such as Roserade and Nidoking achieve the OHKOs or 2HKOs needed to clean and provide offensive pressure. Taunt prevents slower leads such as Donphan from setting up Stealth Rock, and deters Smeargle and Galvantula from using Spore or setting up Sticky Web, respectively. Knock Off provides utility early game and can cripple a good portion of the metagame. Flamethrower is used specifically for Forretress, who can otherwise cause problems for this set. Explosion is for after Azelf has done its job and allows a safe switch into an offensive Pokemon to put pressure on the opposing side, as well as stopping spinners or defoggers from removing entry hazards.

Set Details
========

The given EVs maximize Azelf's Speed while letting it do as much damage as possible with Knock Off and Explosion. Focus Sash is used to guarantee that Azelf can set up Stealth Rock, and then use Explosion. Azelf can also use Knock Off before it uses Explosion if it's necessary. A Naive nature can be used if running Flamethrower.

Usage Tips
========

Azelf should almost always used as a lead, unless it is threatened by Fake Out leads or common scarfers, but even then it should still be used early-game. The first move should be to either use Knock Off or set up Stealth Rock, depending on what is on the opponent is leading with. Taunt can be used if other suicide leads like Smeargle or Galvantula are sent out. After Azelf has taken a hit and used either of these moves, Explosion should be used unless a Ghost-type is on the field, in which case you should use Knock Off. This can remove at least one Pokemon, and make it easier for Pokemon like Hydreigon to break through teams. It is important to note that this set should not lead against fast Taunters such as Sableye, or Fake Out users such as Ambipom.


Team Options
========

This set should be used on hyper offense teams with common Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon, who barely miss the OHKO on Pokemon with decent physical or special bulk such as Mega Houndoom without Stealth Rock, and with Pokemon that can provide offensive pressure. Mega Houndoom can KO or revenge kill Ghost-types who try to switch in on Azelf as it uses Explosion. Finally, offensive Fighting-types that have a high Speed stat such as Infernape and Mienshao are good partners due to their great wallbreaking capabilities.

Dual Screens
#########
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Light Screen
move 2: Reflect
move 3: Taunt / Stealth Rock / Knock Off
move 4: Explosion
ability: Levitate
item: Light Clay
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Light Screen and Reflect are obvious, as Azelf's blazing Speed lets it set up both screens quickly. The third moveslot has many options: Taunt lets it cripple other set-up Pokemon, Stealth Rock lets it support the team, and Knock Off provides utility. Explosion deals lots of damage while ensuring a safe switch in and avoiding a potential Defog.

Set Details
========

The EVs are standard, maximizing Attack and Speed in order to get the job done. Light Clay maximizes the amount of turns the screens stay up.

Usage Tips
========

Depending on which Pokemon you're facing, you should set up the appropriate screen to take less damage from their attacks. As soon as both screens are up, Azelf should use Explosion to deal a good chunk of damage to most Pokemon, and allows a safe switch into a wallbreaker or sweeper. If Ghost-types are on the field, however, Azelf should use Knock Off instead of Explosion, so it can set up screens later if needed.

Team Options
========

Dual Screens support is best used with Pokemon who enjoy an easier time setting up, such as Mega Houndoom, Porygon-Z, and Mega Absol, since most setup sweepers don't need more than five turns to start preparing for a sweep. Electric types such as Mega Manectric and Raikou are good for taking care of Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl, who both check this set, with the Infiltrator ability and a higher Speed stat, respectively.

Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Fire Blast / Thunderbolt / Shadow Ball
move 4: Dazzling Gleam
ability: Levitate
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Nasty Plot boosts Azelf's Special Attack to towering levels, making it very dangerous when coupled with its high Speed. Psyshock is the STAB move of choice, having decent coverage and hitting Florges for massive damage. Fire Blast hits Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Forretress for massive damage. Thunderbolt lets it muscle through bulky Water-types that aren't part Ground-type. Shadow Ball is for Victini, a common switch-in to Azelf. Dazzling Gleam prevents it from getting completely walled by Dark-types like Mega Houndoom and Hydreigon.

Set Details
========

The EVs and Timid nature let it outspeed as many threats as it can while doing as much damage as possible. Life Orb maximizes the damage output.

Usage Tips
========

Depending on the coverage move in the last slot, Azelf appreciates having bulky Steel-types removed if using Thunderbolt, and Water-types such as Vaporeon and Suicune removed if using Fire Blast. As such, it shouldn't attempt a sweep until these Pokemon are removed. Azelf should also be setting up when common Choice Scarf users are removed.

Team Options
========

Nasty Plot Azelf enjoys entry hazard support from hazard setters such as Froslass and Forretress, which help get it past Pokemon with Focus Sashes. Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Infernape also make good partners for Azelf as they take care of Dark-types such as Krookodile and Umbreon. Paralysis support is also beneficial for Azelf, letting it outspeed most scarfers trying to revenge kill, so Jirachi and Blissey make for good partners. Azelf also appreciates Pokemon that can break through Umbreon, such as Nidoking with Megahorn. Azelf should also be paired with Pokemon that want special walls out of the way, like Mega Houndoom and Hydreigon.


Other Options
########

Choice sets are an option, although they aren't as viable since Azelf hates being locked into one move. For instance, a Choice Scarf lets it outspeed every other common user of Choice Scarf in the tier and makes a decent late-game cleaner, whereas Choice Specs and Choice Band provide raw power. Substitute can be used on the Nasty Plot set since Azelf forces a lot of switches; however, it is forced to give up a coverage move for this. Grass Knot can be used to KO bulky waters that are part Ground-type, such as Swampert. A mixed set is viable, thanks to Azelf's expansive movepool and equally strong mixed offenses. Expert Belt can be used with this to bluff a Focus Sash, Light Clay, or Choice item.

Checks and Counters
########

**Dark-types** The biggest stops to Azelf are Dark-types, such as Mega Houndoom, Hydreigon, and Mega Absol, who can put the hit it for super effective damage with their STAB moves.

**Porygon2** Porygon2 can take most hits with ease; however, it must be wary of getting its Eviolite knocked off.

**Fast Taunt users** Fast users of Taunt, in particular Sableye and Mega Aerodactyl, stop the suicide and dual screen sets in their tracks as Azelf can't reliably damage them, and both are immune or resistant to Explosion.
