Overview
########

When taking a look at Azelf, its impressive base 125 Attack and Special Attack next to an excellent base 115 Speed are sure to stand out. Taking this into mind when considering its expansive movepool, Azelf has quite a bit of flexibility, having moves such as Stealth Rock, Knock Off, Reflect, Light Screen, and Nasty Plot in its arsenal. Despite Azelf's frailness due to its poor defenses, the tools it has at its disposal allow it to function as a reliable setter of entry hazards or dual screens, or as a sweeper with Nasty Plot, making it a good choice for offensive teams.

Suicide Lead
########
name: Suicide Lead
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Flamethrower / Knock Off
move 4: Explosion
ability: Levitate
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Naive

Moves
========

Stealth Rock allows Azelf to support its team by weakening opposing Pokemon for its teammates. Taunt keeps opposing Pokemon from using their own entry hazards, status moves, or setup moves, ensuring that slower leads fail to set up against Azelf. Flamethrower dispatches Steel-types, primarily Forretress, which otherwise gives this set trouble if it lacks Flamethrower due to Forretress's ability to clear Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin or break Azelf's Focus Sash with Volt Switch. On the other hand, Knock Off can let Azelf support its team early-game by removing items while allowing it to hit Ghost-types that may switch in to block Explosion, such as Chandelure. Explosion allows Azelf to prevent opposing Pokemon from using Rapid Spin or Defog once it has used Stealth Rock, giving a teammate a free switch while dealing respectable damage to most Pokemon. Fire Blast can be used over Flamethrower for its extra power, though its imperfect accuracy can occasionally backfire.

Set Details
========

Focus Sash is essential on a lead, as it ensures that Azelf can set Stealth Rock even against faster Pokemon. The given EVs and nature allow Azelf to be as fast as possible, outpacing a decent portion of the tier, while giving Explosion and Knock Off as much power as possible. If Flamethrower is chosen, a Naive nature is preferred in order to not hinder Azelf's Special Attack. If Fire Blast is chosen, a spread of 82 Atk / 168 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naive nature can be used in order to reliably 2HKO Mega Aggron while still allowing Explosion to hit fairly hard.

Usage Tips
========

Because this set is designated as a lead, it's best to always send Azelf out first to either set up Stealth Rock or use Knock Off on the first turn based on what the opponent leads with. Use Taunt only if the opposing Pokemon is capable of setting its own entry hazards in order to keep them off your side. Once Azelf has done its job of setting up Stealth Rock, go out with a bang by using Explosion to get a teammate in safely afterwards. Be wary of opposing Fake Out and Choice Scarf users, especially if they have access to U-turn, as both can break Azelf's Focus Sash, with the latter going to a faster Pokemon to finish it off quickly. Be wary of faster Pokemon that may carry Taunt, such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl, as they can both hinder Azelf by keeping it from using Stealth Rock.

Team Options
========

This set is meant to be used only for offensive teams, so pair it with Pokemon such as Nidoking, Alakazam, Beedrill, Hydreigon, Lucario, Darmanitan, and Mienshao, as they are all capable of providing heavy offensive pressure and appreciate Stealth Rock being present on the opposing side. Ghost-types such as Trevenant, Jellicent, and Chandelure can spinblock, keeping Stealth Rock from being removed by Rapid Spin users. Fast Taunt users such as Crobat, Mega Aerodactyl, Tornadus, and Whimsicott can keep opposing Pokemon from using Defog to remove Stealth Rock as well.


Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Dazzling Gleam / Taunt
ability: Levitate
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Nasty Plot allows Azelf to boost its Special Attack and attempt to sweep, dealing serious damage to most of the tier after a single boost. Psyshock gets a STAB boost while hitting specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Florges on their weaker Defense stat, allowing Azelf to tear through them uninterrupted after a boost. Fire Blast allows Azelf to take out Steel-types that would otherwise be hard stops to it, such as Mega Aggron and Forretress. Dazzling Gleam allows Azelf to more reliably take out Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Krookodile, and it is Azelf's only means of breaking through Umbreon after a boost, though bear in mind a +2 Fire Blast can dispose of every Dark-type in the tier barring Hydreigon and Umbreon. Taunt can be used if Dark-types aren't as much of a concern, as it allows Azelf to both support its team by preventing entry hazards and status moves, as well as hinder defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola, Hippowdon, Porygon2, and Vaporeon, which may try to inflict status or phaze Azelf after it has set up. Moves such as Energy Ball, Shadow Ball, and Thunderbolt can be used if your team needs more coverage against specific threats that can be more quickly dealt with after a boost, though the moves listed can 2HKO the majority of the tier at +2 at the very least.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature maximizes Azelf's sweeping potential, making it as fast and as strong as possible. Life Orb is necessary to give Azelf as much power as it can get in order to sweep and break through defensive Pokemon after setting up with Nasty Plot.

Usage Tips
========

Azelf is frail and can be worn down by Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil, so it will generally have only one opportunity to set up Nasty Plot while it is healthy. Preserve Azelf wisely until the chance to set up is presented. To keep Azelf from being revenge killed easily, ensure that faster Pokemon, Choice Scarf users, and Pokemon that rely on priority moves, namely Sucker Punch, are eliminated before attempting to sweep. Although Dazzling Gleam does allow Azelf to beat Hydreigon one-on-one, it is a common user of Choice Scarf, so make sure it isn't holding the item before trying to use Dazzling Gleam on it, otherwise Azelf will simply be outsped and KOed.

Team Options
========

Entry hazards are vastly appreciated for helping Azelf to sweep, so pair it with Stealth Rock users such as Mega Aggron, Forretress, Hippowdon, Nidoqueen, or Swampert. Similarly, Spikes users such as Chesnaught, Forretress, Froslass, and Roserade are also beneficial partners. Choice Scarf users of your own, such as Infernape, Mienshao, and Hydreigon, can deal with Pokemon faster than Azelf as well as some opposing Choice Scarf users. Strong attackers such as Darmanitan, Krookodile, Nidoking, and Roserade can soften up defensive Pokemon to give Azelf an easier time sweeping later in the match. If Taunt is chosen over Dazzling Gleam, Pokemon such as Machamp, Life Orb Mienshao, and Calm Mind Florges can be used to deal with Hydreigon and Umbreon more easily.

Dual Screens
########
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Light Screen
move 2: Reflect
move 3: Taunt / Stealth Rock / Knock Off
move 4: Explosion / U-turn
ability: Levitate
item: Light Clay
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Dual screens bolster the defenses of Azelf's team for several turns, allowing it to support its teammates by making them harder to take down. Taunt can be used to keep opposing Pokemon from using their own entry hazards, status, or setup moves, while Stealth Rock allows Azelf to take an all-purpose supportive role by also setting entry hazards for its team to take advantage of. Knock Off can be used to offer some early-game utility by removing items as well as hitting Ghost-types that may try to switch in on Explosion, which itself lets Azelf deal a large chunk of damage while blocking Defog or Rapid Spin, giving a teammate a free turn to switch in. However, U-turn can be used as a safer alternative to Explosion, allowing Azelf to bring in a partner while preserving Azelf to set up screens again later in the match.

Set Details
========

HP is maximized to give Azelf enough bulk to safely set up both screens reliably, while a Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment let Azelf set up as quickly as possible. Light Clay causes Light Screen and Reflect to last for 8 turns instead of 5, giving a sweeper ample time to safely set up and sweep. This set faces a bit of competition from Espeon, which boasts access to the ability Magic Bounce, though it is noteworthy that Azelf has better Speed, slightly better physical bulk, and access to Stealth Rock and Explosion for free momentum while preserving Light Screen and Reflect.

Usage Tips
========

Set up the appropriate screen depending on which Pokemon Azelf is up against; Reflect when facing a physical attacker, and Light Screen when facing a special attacker. Once both screens are up, use Explosion or U-turn to safely bring in a wallbreaker or a sweeper to put pressure on the opposing Pokemon. While this set is best used as a lead, it can also be used during the early- or mid-game if Azelf's support isn't required immediately. This allows for more conservative play until a sweeper's checks have been weakened enough that it can take full advantage of Azelf's support. Beware of Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl, as they are the only Defog users faster than Azelf, which means they can quickly remove its screens while also having access to Taunt to keep Azelf from setting up. Crobat's Infiltrator ability lets it outright ignore Reflect, while Mega Aerodactyl can threaten Azelf with Pursuit.

Team Options
========

Nearly every setup sweeper appreciates having dual screens to allow them to set up more easily; Mega Absol, Lucario, Salamence, and Suicune are just a few examples. Offensive Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Abomasnow, Rotom-H, and Nidoking can apply offensive pressure to Defog users that aim to blow your screens away. Fast Taunt users such as Mega Aerodactyl, Crobat, Tornadus, and Whimsicott can also stop Pokemon from using Defog, allowing you to keep your screens up.


Other Options
########

Azelf's movepool is nothing short of expansive, boasting many options for it to take advantage of, though the viability of some are questionable. For instance, an offensive set utilizing Stealth Rock and three attacks such as Psyshock, Fire Blast, and Dazzling Gleam / Energy Ball can be used if an offensive Stealth Rock user is required. An all-out attacking set with Life Orb and four attacks can also be used, with the coverage moves being tailored to what Azelf's team needs additional coverage against. A set using Choice Band, Choice Specs, or Choice Scarf can be used in conjunction with Trick to allow Azelf to play as a wallbreaker or revenge killer that can cripple defensive Pokemon by giving them a Choice item. Rain Dance or Sunny Day can be used on the lead set to tailor Azelf to the needs of a weather team, further supporting its partners with the respective weather move. Lastly, a full physical attacking set can be used thanks to Azelf's base 125 Attack stat and access to moves such as Zen Headbutt, Knock Off, U-turn, Explosion, Drain Punch, and the elemental punches.


Checks & Counters
########

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster threats such as Crobat, Noivern, Mega Aerodactyl, Alakazam, and Pokemon holding a Choice Scarf can easily outpace Azelf and KO it with ease due to its frailness, making it difficult both for the Nasty Plot set to sweep and for the lead set to do much more than set up Stealth Rock. This can also apply to base 115 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Absol, Mega Houndoom, and Cinccino, against which Azelf has to risk losing a Speed tie.

**Dark-types**: Dark-type Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Krookodile, Honchkrow, Mega Absol, and Umbreon can switch in on Psyshock and threaten to KO Azelf, especially if it lacks Dazzling Gleam. Krookodile and Honchkrow also have access to Pursuit to ensure Azelf cannot safely escape once they have been brought in. Mega Absol's Magic Bounce ability also means the lead set will ultimately lose one-on-one against it, being forced to either switch out and give Mega Absol a free turn, or immediately use Explosion, forgoing the use of Stealth Rock altogether. While Umbreon is slower than Azelf, it threatens to OHKO Azelf with Foul Play, while Umbreon itself is only 2HKOed by a +2 Dazzling Gleam after Stealth Rock.

**Priority Users**: Pokemon with access to priority moves, such as Toxicroak, Lucario, Entei, Mega Absol, Honchkrow, and Arcanine, can quickly pick off Azelf after it has been weakened, stopping it before it can act. Mega Absol, Honchkrow, and Toxicroak are especially bothersome, as they all carry Sucker Punch and can quickly OHKO Azelf.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Empoleon, Forretress, and Mega Aggron can all switch in on Psyshock and can give Azelf problems in some way. Empoleon can survive a boosted Fire Blast from the Nasty Plot set while being able to use Defog to get rid of Stealth Rock and dual screens after Azelf has fainted. Forretress can break Azelf's Focus Sash with Volt Switch or even Rapid Spin as Azelf uses Stealth Rock, getting a teammate in safely or ridding its side of entry hazards. Gyro Ball also deals serious damage to Azelf due to the major Speed difference between the two. While Mega Aggron is KOed by a +2 Fire Blast, it can set up its own Stealth Rock, phaze Azelf out, or threaten to KO it with Heavy Slam.

**Taunt Users**: Opposing Taunt users, such as Crobat, Mega Aerodactyl, Whimsicott, and Tornadus, can outpace Azelf and keep the lead and dual screens sets from using their respective setup moves, forcing Azelf to switch out or use a less favorable move.

**Strong Attacks**: Azelf is frail to the point that even most neutral STAB hits will deal serious damage to it, making it hard for it to stand up to abuse from the majority of the offensive Pokemon in the tier, as well as even bulkier or defensive ones, such as Suicune, Florges, and Snorlax.
