Overview
########

Granbull manages to work well on Underused teams solely because it possesses the rare but great Fairy typing, as it beats the ever-present Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-types. Additionally, with decent Defense and Attack, along with access to a great defensive ability in Intimidate, it's not hard to imagine why Granbull is a solid and steady Pokemon. With a good movepool that includes Earthquake, Play Rough, Heal Bell, and Thunder Wave, among others, Granbull can be quite versatile as either an offensively based Pokemon, or play a defensively based support role. A few things hinder Granbull's usefulness, however. With low Special Defense, Granbull is very susceptible to the many specially based Pokemon in the tier, especially Poison-types such as Roserade. It also has a very low Speed stat, and not being able to outspeed walls is detrimental. Overall, given the right support, as well as prediction and proper utilization, Granbull can work well on any team.

RestTalk
########
name: RestTalk
move 1: Play Rough
move 2: Heal Bell
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
ability: Intimidate
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def
nature: Impish

Moves
========

This Granbull set is a physically defensive wall based on cleric support. Play Rough is a solid STAB move for Granbull, and it provides a way to beat many physical Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-types in the tier. Heal Bell allows Granbull to cure itself and its teammates of status ailments, which is very valuable in a tier where status can make or break any Pokemon. Lastly, Rest is used as a source of recovery when Granbull is running low on health, which is great for allowing longevity without depending on Wishes and Leftovers, while Sleep Talk is used to keep Granbull useful while it's asleep, and, with a chance of Sleep Talking a Heal Bell, it can wake itself up.

Set Details
========

With 252 EVs invested in Defense and HP, Granbull's defensive capabilities are maximized, along with Intimidate and an Impish nature. 4 Attack EVs are used to boost Granbull's best stat. This allows it to OHKO anything it is trying to beat, including Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-types. Lastly, Leftovers is used as the item of choice to give Granbull a steady source of recovery each turn.

Usage Tips
========

There are a few key things to note when using Granbull. It can always switch into Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-types, such as Hydreigon, Flygon, and Mienshao. Always switch out from special attackers, however, as they pose a huge threat to Granbull. Rest should be used when Granbull is running low on HP, and Sleep Talk should only be used when it is safe to do so. Finally, Heal Bell support should be used when Granbull has a good type matchup, so it can be used against any Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-types.

Team Options
========

Granbull makes an excellent partner to many Pokemon, especially Pokemon on stall teams, but it also needs a bit of support for itself. It provides Heal Bell support, so Pokemon susceptible to status can rely on it. Nidoking makes for a good teammate, as it can beat Steel- and Poison-types. Other Ground-types such as Krookodile and Hippowdon work as well. Psychic-types such as Jirachi and Alakazam work well with Granbull. Granbull can beat pesky Dark-types with ease, while Psychic-types can beat Poison-types such as Roserade that pose a threat. Lastly, Pokemon fearing threats such as Mienshao and Hydreigon can allow Granbull to pick them off for it.

Bulky Attacker
########
name: Bulky Attacker
move 1: Play Rough
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Thunder Wave
move 4: Heal Bell
ability: Intimidate
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

This Granbull set is much more offensively based than the RestTalk set. Play Rough allows Granbull to hit a huge portion of the tier in Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-types. Notable examples include Scrafty, Mienshao, Hydreigon, Noivern, Honchkrow, Krookodile, Absol, Flygon, and Machamp. Earthquake provides great coverage with Play Rough, hitting Fire-, Steel-, Rock-, and Electric-types. Notable examples that Earthquake hits include Infernape, Lucario, Houndoom, Chandelure, Empoleon, and Raikou, among others. Thunder Wave allows Granbull to cripple any Pokemon trying to switch in, as well as crippling faster Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl. Finally, Heal Bell allows Granbull to cure itself and/or its teammates of any status problems, which is very handy.

Set Details
========

With 252 EVs in HP, along with Intimidate, Granbull's defensive presence is bolstered. 252 Attack EVs are used to boost its best stat. This allows it to OHKO anything it is trying to beat, including Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-types. An Adamant nature is used to raise its best stat, Attack, while lowering its least needed one, Special Attack. Lastly, Leftovers is used to give Granbull a steady source of recovery.

Usage Tips
========

Granbull can always switch into Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-types such as Mienshao, Scrafty, Umbreon, Hydreigon, and Flygon. Always switch out from special attackers, however, as they are huge threats to Granbull. If you are predicting a switch, go for Thunder Wave to cripple the incoming Pokemon. Lastly, Heal Bell support should be used when Granbull has a good matchup, such as against Mienshao.

Team Options
========

Wish users help Granbull immensely. Umbreon, in particular, forms a good core with Granbull, as it provides great team support in the forms of Heal Bell and Wish. Granbull also covers Umbreon's Fighting-type weakness well. Granbull provides Heal Bell support, so Pokemon weak to status can rely on it. Nidoking is a good teammate, as it can beat Steel-types and some Poison-types. Other Ground-types such as Krookodile also help. Psychic-types such as Jirachi and Alakazam work well with Granbull, since Granbull can beat pesky Dark-types with ease, while Psychic-types can beat Poison-types such as Roserade that pose a threat to Granbull.

Other Options
########

Granbull has a large number of other considerations, though they are not nearly as useful as its main set moves. A Bulk Up set can be used, but its Special Defense is far too low to work effectively. Choice Band can be used, but Granbull's offensive coverage is quite limited. Assault Vest is a useful item on Granbull, as it boosts its Special Defense nicely, but, once again, its offensive movepool is too shallow to pull it off. A SubPunch set can be used to some success. All of the elemental punches have their uses on Granbull: Thunder Punch hits most of the bulky Water-types in the tier, Ice Punch hits Flying- and Grass-type Pokemon, while Fire Punch allows Granbull to hit one of its main counters, Steel-types. Stone Edge can be used, but it does not provide enough coverage most of the time. Crunch is useful in some situations against Ghost- and Psychic-types, but Granbull usually doesn't have the room to run it. Outrage can be used as a high Base Power move, but is generally unreliable. A Quick Feet and Toxic Orb set can be used, as the Toxic Orb provides the status to raise both Granbull's Speed and the power of Facade. Lastly, Protect is a viable option to use to gain a bit of extra health each turn, but Granbull usually cannot find the room to fit it into its moveset.

Checks & Counters
########

**Poison-types**: Poison-types such as Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Amoonguss, Weezing, and Crobat all pose a threat to Granbull with their type advantages.

**Steel-types**: Mega Aggron, Magneton, Metagross, and Jirachi all deal with Granbull well with their type advantages, and, for the most part, do not mind Intimidate.

**Rotom-H**: Rotom-H resists all of Granbull's attacks, is immune to Thunder Wave, and can either easily KO it with Overheat or Thunderbolt, or simply burn Granbull and wear it down.

**Hard Hitting Special Attackers**: Shaymin, Chandelure, and Suicune can all OHKO Granbull with a powerful STAB move, as Granbull's Special Defense is so low. Additionally, Suicune can Rest off a Thunder Wave.
