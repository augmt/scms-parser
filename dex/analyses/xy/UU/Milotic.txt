Overview
########
Milotic's excellent special bulk, Marvel Scale, and much greater offensive presence, as well as Recover, give it a niche over other bulky Water-types in the tier (although Quagsire does get Recover too), and it has greater Speed than most other bulky Water-types. Additionally, its pure Water typing leaves Milotic with few weaknesses and grants it some useful resistances to boot. However, while not terrible, Milotic's physical bulk isn't particularly amazing, and to top it off, it faces plenty of competition for a teamslot from Pokemon such as Swampert, Suicune, Quagsire, and Vaporeon. Despite Milotic's greater offensive presence and access to Marvel Scale and Haze, one of the aforementioned Pokemon is generally a better choice.

Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Scald
move 2: Recover
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Haze / Dragon Tail
ability: Marvel Scale
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========
Scald is a STAB attack that can shut down physical attackers with its burn chance. Recover lets Milotic stall for burn damage and restore health lost from taking attacks. Ice Beam is a coverage attack that hits Grass-types trying to switch in on Milotic, and nails targets such as Flygon and Noivern. Haze stops Milotic from being setup bait. It has an advantage over Dragon Tail in that it negates the stat boosts of a foe behind a Substitute. Dragon Tail is an alternative option for the fourth moveslot. It lets Milotic check setup sweepers by phazing them, removing any stat boosts and racking up entry hazard damage. While it does have the advantage of not being stopped by Taunt, unlike Haze, opting for Dragon Tail renders Milotic unable to check boosting sweepers behind a Substitute. Toxic is a possibility for the fourth moveslot, as it lets Milotic screw over any walls that might switch into it, and Milotic can stall for poison damage with Recover.

Set Details
========
248 HP EVs reduce passive damage taken, and this combined with 252 Defense EVs maximizes Milotic's physical bulk. The remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to slightly even out Milotic's overall bulk. A Bold nature provides a further increase in Milotic's physical bulk. Leftovers is the chosen item for the passive recovery it provides. Marvel Scale bolsters Milotic's Defense to great levels when it finds itself on the receiving end of a move such as Toxic or Will-O-Wisp.

Usage Tips
========
Milotic should be brought in to sponge a predicted physical attack (within its capabilities) and restore any significant amount of health lost from doing so with Recover. Dragon Tail and Haze should be used to nullify boosts acquired by opponents trying to set up in Milotic's face. Though the Defense boost from Marvel Scale might be an enticing prospect, status only serves to wear Milotic down and hinder its longevity in the long run, so Milotic should not be used to absorb status. One shouldn't overestimate Milotic's bulk, as its naturally middling Defense means that it is somewhat limited in terms of what it can switch into. For example, Milotic should not be switching into something like a High Jump Kick from Mienshao or a Close Combat from Lucario.

Team Options
========
Milotic works best on defensively oriented teams that dislike sweepers and hard hitters. It appreciates support from allies such as Roserade and Darmanitan that can take on the Grass-types that it despises. Milotic is best used alongside a special wall capable of tanking Electric- and Grass-type hits. Examples of these include Snorlax and Umbreon. Cleric support cures Milotic of status, preserving its longevity. An example of a cleric that pairs well with Milotic is Umbreon, whose bulk means that it is generally capable of staying in against attackers with a type advantage over Milotic. Entry hazard support is useful in conjunction with Dragon Tail variants of Milotic, as it gradually wears opponents down when they are dragged into the field.

Other Options
########
A specially defensive set lets Milotic take hits from special attackers such as Chandelure with greater ease, though choosing to invest in Special Defense detracts from Milotic's physical bulk and therefore restricts its ability to check physically offensive threats such as Darmanitan. Milotic can try an offensively inclined set with Life Orb and Competitive, though there are Water-types better at playing an offensive role, such as Suicune, which boasts access to Calm Mind; and Starmie, which has far greater Speed and coverage. Refresh lets Milotic shrug off status of its own accord, though it's difficult to find the moveslot needed. Dragon Pulse has good neutral coverage with Scald and hits Kingdra for super effective damage, though Ice Beam's coverage is preferable. Milotic can try a RestTalk set that takes advantage of its ability, though Suicune does a better job in such a role due to its access to Calm Mind. Although weak, Hidden Power Grass lets Milotic nail the likes of Quagsire and Gastrodon. Finally, Hypnosis can incapacitate a foe, but its unreliability means that it isn't worth the moveslot.

Checks & Counters
########
**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Roserade, Shaymin and Virizion have the Special Defense to tank Ice Beams coming off Milotic's uninvested Special Attack and can smack Milotic hard with their STAB attacks. Roserade and Shaymin do particularly well against Milotic, as Natural Cure means that they can shrug off an untimely burn from Scald.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Raikou and Mega Ampharos inflict great amounts of damage on Milotic with their STAB attacks and can gain momentum with Volt Switch (and in Raikou's case, Calm Mind) as they force Milotic out. Dragon Tail Milotic is total setup bait for Substitute + Calm Mind variants of Raikou.

**Stallbreakers**: Pokemon such as Crobat and Sableye can ruin Milotic by crippling it with status and using Taunt to stop it from recovering. However, both of these Pokemon dislike being burned by Scald.

**Toxicroak**: An immunity to Scald grants Toxicroak switch-in opportunities against Milotic. While it cannot directly use Milotic as setup bait, Toxicroak can hit Milotic pretty hard and get the opportunity to set up with Swords Dance should Milotic switch out.

**Snorlax**: Snorlax has the bulk to sponge anything that Milotic can throw at it. Additionally, RestTalk variants aren't deterred by a burn.
