Overview
########

Mega Camerupt has great offensive and defensive power, which allows it to function as a powerful wallbreaker. It has a very useful ability in Sheer Force, which boosts any of Camerupt's attacks with a secondary effect, such as Fire Blast and Earth Power. Furthermore, it has a good STAB combination in Fire + Ground, which hits almost any type combination for neutral damage. However, Camerupt does not have a very wide movepool. It also has a bad defensive typing that leaves Camerupt with a 4x weakness to common Water-type attacks. Mega Camerupt is also extremely slow for an offensive attacker, making it quite easy to revenge kill. It isn't very hard to wear down Mega Camerupt, as it lacks reliable recovery.

Moves
========

Fire Blast is a very powerful STAB attack, and its power is further boosted by Sheer Force. Earth Power is a secondary STAB attack with great coverage alongside Fire Blast and decent power, and is also boosted by Sheer Force. Ancient Power is boosted by Sheer Force and hits Flying-types for super effective damage, most notably Mega Aerodactyl and Noivern. Hidden Power Grass can be used in the fourth slot to catch Swampert, Quagsire, and Gastrodon on the switch. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical attackers by halving their Attack stat.

Set Details
========

Solid Rock, Camerupt's ability before Mega Evolving, helps it take super effective hits better if an opponent predicts the switch. Sheer Force, Mega Camerupt's ability, gives a great power boost to Camerupt's attacks with a secondary effect. Cameruptite allows Camerupt to Mega Evolve into Mega Camerupt. Max HP and Special Attack investment help Mega Camerupt take hits better and hit as hard as possible. A Modest nature gives another boost to Camerupt's great Special Attack. If Camerupt is used on a Trick Room team, make sure to use a Quiet nature.

Usage Tips
========

This Camerupt fits best on bulky offense teams because of its ability to take hits and hit opponents back quite hard with a STAB attack. Make sure to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, because Mega Camerupt will get a huge boost in its offensive stats as well as its defensive stats. Try to predict when an opposing check or counter might come in; for example, if you predict a Swampert to come in, make sure to go for Hidden Power Grass or Will-O-Wisp, instead of hitting it with Fire Blast. Switch out of threatening Water-types, because their STAB attacks will most likely OHKO Mega Camerupt. Ground-types are threatening too as they outspeed and beat Camerupt with a STAB attack. Mega Camerupt can switch into predicted Volt Switches and other Electric-type moves to force opposing Pokemon to switch out in most situations and get off a lot of damage on the opponent's next switch-in. Bringing Mega Camerupt in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is good, too, as it cannot recover any damage taken by switching in normally without healing support.

Team Options
========

Trick Room support from Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Cofagrigus is especially great, because then Mega Camerupt will usually move first. Pokemon that can switch into Water-types for Camerupt and beat them, such as Roserade and Shaymin, make for good partners. Pokemon that can reliably beat Ground-types that threaten Camerupt, such as Chesnaught and Suicune, are excellent teammates as well. Wish support from Pokemon such as Blissey and Florges is really good for Camerupt, as it lacks its own form of reliable recovery. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Forretress is nice, too, as this will give Mega Camerupt an easier time wallbreaking. Furthermore, Pokemon that can remove entry hazards such as Crobat and Tentacruel are good partners, as Mega Camerupt cannot recover from chip damage taken. Slow U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Forretress are great for Mega Camerupt because it cannot recover damage taken while switching in. Lastly, special attackers that appreciate Mega Camerupt plowing through their checks and counters, such as Shaymin and Raikou, are good partners.

Other Options
########

Stealth Rock breaks Focus Sashes and wears foes down so Camerupt and allies can KO enemies easier, but because of Camerupt's low Speed, entry hazard setting is better done by other Pokemon such as Nidoqueen. Roar phazes out opponents, but Camerupt doesn't have a slot available to use it, as it will lose out on an important coverage move. Explosion is another usable option when Camerupt is about to faint as it deals great damage, but wastes a powerful Mega Pokemon if used too soon. Iron Head hits Fairy-types such as Florges and Aromatisse, but doesn't have good coverage and has no other relevant targets. Toxic can be used to wear down foes turn after turn, but Camerupt isn't a good user of it because of the lack of reliable recovery. A RestTalk set is Mega Camerupt's only option for recovery, but leaves it with only two coverage options, which it cannot afford.

Checks & Counters
########

**Blissey**: Blissey is the only specially defensive Pokemon that can take on Mega Camerupt rather well, as it is only 3HKOed by Fire Blast and can Toxic Camerupt and stall it out.

**Water-types**: Water-types such as Suicune, Swampert, Mega Sharpedo, and Tentacruel can OHKO Camerupt easily with one of their STAB attacks, but have trouble switching into it.

**Ground-types**: Ground-types such as Krookodile and Nidoking can easily beat Camerupt with a Ground-type STAB attack.
