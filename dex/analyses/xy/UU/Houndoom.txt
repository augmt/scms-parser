Overview
########

Houndoom has fallen from grace, as the metagame has been unkind to it, especially with the rise of Mega Aerodactyl and Feraligatr, coupled with the prevalence of Hydreigon. However, it doesn't make Houndoom any less of a threat, as it still has an amazing Special Attack stat and a good Speed stat. It also has access to the coveted Nasty Plot, which makes it a very deadly sweeper, while its Mega Evolution's ability Solar Power makes it an amazing wallbreaker in the sun. It has a lot of support options in its arsenal but can't utilize a majority of them. Houndoom also has a unique Dark / Fire typing, which allows it to resist both of Chandelure's STAB types as well as only take neutral damage from Fairy-type attacks in spite of its Dark typing.

Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Fire Blast / Flamethrower
move 3: Dark Pulse
move 4: Taunt / Destiny Bond / Hidden Power Grass
ability: Flash Fire
item: Houndoominite
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Nasty Plot boosts Houndoom's Special Attack by two stages, making it a deadly sweeper. Fire Blast hits hard, especially after a Flash Fire boost, but has a chance to miss. Flamethrower doesn't have a miss chance but instead lacks the raw power of Fire Blast, causing it to miss out on crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as an OHKO on Kyurem after one layer of Spikes and a 2HKO on Florges after factoring in Protect. Dark Pulse is a very consistent secondary STAB move that also has a chance to cause the foe to flinch. Taunt gives Houndoom a means to beat Pokemon that use status to cripple Houndoom, such as Thunder Wave Porygon2 and Toxic Alomomola. Destiny Bond allows Houndoom to take down the opposing Pokemon upon being KOed. Hidden Power Grass is an option if the team has problems against Seismitoad, Swampert, or Rhyperior.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs are used to augment Houndoom's sweeping potential. The leftover 4 EVs are put into Special Defense to ensure Download Porygon2 and Porygon-Z don't get a Special Attack boost from switching in on Mega Houndoom. Should Taunt be chosen as the move for the fourth slot, an EV spread of 40 HP / 216 SpA / 252 Spe should be used instead, as it allows Houndoom to survive three Seismic Tosses from Blissey. Flash Fire allows Houndoom to gain a damage boost to its Fire-type attacks as well as gain a Fire-type immunity prior to Mega Evolving. A Timid nature is used to ensure Houndoom can outspeed threats quicker than positive-natured base 100s after Mega Evolving.

Usage Tips
========

Houndoom shouldn't try to set up Nasty Plot early-game, as most of its checks and counters would still be healthy then. Houndoom should instead try to weaken its defensive checks that lack reliable recovery, namely Swampert and Rhyperior. Houndoom should always attempt to get a Flash Fire boost prior to Mega Evolving, as it makes Houndoom much more threatening. Mega Houndoom should also take advantage of Knock Off as an opportunity.

Team Options
========

Houndoom appreciates VoltTurn partners to be able to have a free switch; Rotom-C does this role exceptionally well due to its ability to take Ground- and Water-type attacks aimed at Houndoom while Houndoom is able to take Fire-type attacks aimed at Rotom-C. Shaymin is another exceptional Houndoom partner, as it not only serves as a wallbreaker but also has access to the coveted Healing Wish, which allows you to have another chance of sweeping with Houndoom should it get weakened during the first attempt. Houndoom is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, making entry hazard removal a necessity. Entry hazard removers such as Crobat and Tentacruel fill this role exceptionally well. Entry hazard setters such as Froslass and Nidoqueen also make for great teammates, as Houndoom has a much easier time sweeping with entry hazards on the foes' side of the field. Forretress is an outstanding Houndoom teammate, as it fulfills the role of Rapid Spinner, entry hazard setter, and Volt Switch user all at the same time. Wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Heracross and Choice Specs Hydreigon, make for good teammates, as they weaken walls and allow Houndoom to sweep more easily. Houndoom lures in special walls, such as Snorlax and Blissey; Pokemon that can take advantage of this, such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Swords Dance Lucario, make for good partners.

SunnyDoom
########
name: SunnyDoom
move 1: Sunny Day
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Dark Pulse
move 4: Solar Beam
ability: Flash Fire
item: Houndoominite
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Sunny Day activates Mega Houndoom's Solar Power, making it a dangerous wallbreaker. Fire Blast is Houndoom's go-to wallbreaking move, sporting a 371 Base Power after accounting for Solar Power, sun, and STAB. Dark Pulse is the most consistent special Dark-type move, making it ideal for use on Houndoom. Solar Beam allows Houndoom to hit Water-types, such as Seismitoad and Suicune, as well as Rock-types, namely Rhyperior, for super effective damage and doesn't require a charge turn in the sun.

Set Details
========

252 EVs are put into both Speed and Special Attack to maximize Houndoom's wallbreaking ability. The four remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to ensure Download Porygon2 and Porygon-Z don't get a Special Attack boost against Mega Houndoom. A Timid nature is used to ensure Houndoom can outspeed everything up to +1 Adamant Tyrantrum and positive-natured Tornadus.

Usage Tips
========

Houndoom should always attempt to gain a Flash Fire boost, as it makes Fire Blast go from powerful to deadly in the sun. Houndoom can easily use Knock Off as an opportunity to switch in after Mega Evolving. Houndoom should try to wallbreak early-game, as it softens up most of its defensive checks easily and dents a lot of defensive cores.

Team Options
========

Houndoom's wallbreaking ability is appreciated by wallbreakers, cleaners, and sweepers alike. Respective examples of all three are Choice Specs Shaymin, Speed Boost Yanmega, and Nasty Plot Lucario. Wallbreakers appreciate it because wallbreaking cores can dismantle defensive teams with ease. Cleaners and sweepers appreciate it because it makes their job that much easier. Sun sweepers, such as Solar Power Heliolisk and Chlorophyll Shiftry, make for good teammates, as they can take advantage of the sun Houndoom sets. Houndoom doesn't have the best bulk, so switching in on hits is hard at times. VoltTurn partners mitigate this problem, making them good teammates for Houndoom. Rotom-C is an exceptionally good VoltTurn partner due to its ability to form a wallbreaking core with Houndoom while also resisting Ground- and Water-type moves aimed at Houndoom. Defog users and Rapid Spin users, such as Gligar and Donphan, make for great Houndoom partners because Houndoom is easily worn down by entry hazards. Houndoom can wallbreak much more easily after entry hazards have been set, making entry hazard setters, such as Roserade and Chesnaught, good teammates. Forretress and Mega Aerodactyl are exceptionally good Houndoom teammates, as they can both remove and set entry hazards. Pokemon that can take advantage of the fact that Houndoom lures in special walls, such as Mienshao and Infernape, make for good teammates.

Other Options
########

Houndoom has access to Pursuit, which can be used to trap Chandelure, but it doesn't seem to find space to fit it into any set. A Nasty Plot set that uses Flame Charge in the last slot is an option, but it tends to find very few setup opportunities. Super Fang is an option to be able to halve the health of walls that tend to switch into Houndoom, but like Pursuit, it can't seem to fit into any set. Will-O-Wisp is an option to cripple physical attackers, primarily Mega Aerodactyl, that tend to switch into Houndoom. Sludge Bomb can be used in the fourth slot of the Nasty Plot set, but a neutral Fire Blast does just as much damage as a super effective Sludge Bomb.


Checks & Counters
########

**Special Walls**: Special walls such as Blissey and Snorlax can easily take any boosted hit from Houndoom, and can stall out Sunny Day variants.

**Fighting-type Priority**: Fighting-type priority moves, such as Vacuum Wave and Mach Punch, can KO Houndoom before it can do anything.

**Hydreigon**: Hydreigon can always beat Houndoom one-on-one as well as switch into most of its moves easily.

**Revenge Killers**: Choice Scarf users, such as Mienshao and Salamence, outspeed Houndoom and can easily KO with a STAB move. Pokemon that naturally outspeed Houndoom, such as Alakazam and Crobat, also fit in this category. Lastly, Dugtrio outspeeds Houndoom, traps it, and OHKOes it with Earthquake.

**Mega Aerodactyl**: Mega Aerodactyl outspeeds Houndoom, can switch in on any neutral hit or support move, and OHKOes it with Stone Edge.
