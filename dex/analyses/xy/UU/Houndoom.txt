Overview
########

Houndoom was blessed with a Mega Evolution this generation, gaining a great base 115 Speed and base 140 Special Attack, while also getting improved mixed bulk. Houndoom also has good STAB options in Fire Blast and Dark Pulse, hitting most of the UU tier neutrally. Thanks to Houndoom's great Special Attack and access to Nasty Plot, Houndoom is an excellent set up sweeper. Houndoom also has great utility before Mega Evolving, as its ability, Flash Fire, lets it switch in freely on Fire-type attacks. Base 115 Speed allows Mega Houndoom to outspeed key threats such as Galvantula, Froslass, Cobalion, Infernape, and Mienshao, while also Speed tying with Starmie, Raikou, Azelf, and Mega Absol. Mega Houndoom is therefore one of the fastest Pokemon in UU after Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl. Houndoom is also a great sun sweeper thanks to its ability, Solar Power, which boosts its Special Attack by 50% under sunlight, but at the cost of 12.5% recoil each turn. However, Houndoom also has its problems. Its typing leaves it open to many common attacks, such as Fighting-, Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type moves, while also making it weak to Stealth Rock. Another problem with Mega Houndoom is that it also takes the one and only Mega Evolution slot on your team. Houndoom also has to deal with a not-too-great base 95 Speed before Mega Evolving.

Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Fire Blast / Flamethrower
move 3: Dark Pulse
move 4: Flame Charge / Destiny Bond / Substitute
ability: Flash Fire
item: Houndoominite
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Nasty Plot boosts Houndoom's Special Attack to scary levels, and Houndoom also gets many opportunities to set it up thanks to its ability to force a lot of switches. Fire Blast is a very powerful Fire-type STAB move which hits extremely hard, especially with a Nasty Plot boost. Flamethrower is an option if the lacking accuracy of Fire Blast is troublesome. Dark Pulse is a strong Dark-type STAB move that also has a chance of flinching the opponent. Flame Charge is used to boost Houndoom's Speed by 1 stage and to prevent Choice Scarf users from easily revenge killing Houndoom. Destiny Bond is a nice last-ditch move that is useful in some situations, like when Houndoom is weakened and can't do much to the opponent. Substitute can also be used and is a excellent move on Houndoom as it forces a lot of switches, and can get therefore a get a free Substitute. Substitute also allows Houndoom to set up Nasty Plot on Blissey. Hidden Power Grass can be used to OHKO a slightly weakened Gastrodon and Rhyperior, both of which resist Fire and are neutral to Dark-type moves. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple special wall switch-ins that also are physical attackers, such as Snorlax.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread is used to maximize Houndoom's Speed and damage output, giving Houndoom the ability to outspeed threats such as Galvantula, Froslass, Cobalion, and also Infernape and Mienshao that lack Choice Scarf after Mega Evolving. Houndoomite is, of course, mandatory, as regular Houndoom isn't too great, and can't outspeed those threats. A Modest nature is an option over Timid, as the extra Speed is not too important thanks to Flame Charge. Houndoom can also use 40 EVs in HP instead of Speed in combination with Taunt, as it allows Houndoom to beat Blissey without having to rely on Destiny Bond by avoiding the 3HKO from Seismic Toss, as well as avoiding Thunder Wave.

Usage Tips
========

Before Mega Evolving, Houndoom can be used to absorb Fire-type moves thanks to Flash Fire, but once Mega Evolved, it is more useful as a set up sweeper. Thanks to its base 115 Speed and base 140 Special Attack, Houndoom can also come in and revenge kill most offensive Pokemon that are not equipped with Choice Scarf or have priority moves.

Team Options
========

Teammates that can deal with Snorlax and Blissey are deeply appreciated by Houndoom. Powerful Fighting-types such as Scrafty, Mienshao, Infernape, and Lucario can all easily deal with Snorlax and Blissey, OHKOing them with their Fighting-type STAB moves. Bulky Water-types are a problem for Houndoom; as such, powerful Electric- and Grass-types are recommended, such as Raikou, Galvantula, Celebi, Shaymin, Roserade, and Rotom-C. Spikes setters are also recommended to take advantage of all the switches Houndoom forces for the opposing team; good teammates here are Roserade, Forretress, and Chesnaught. Chesnaught and Roserade are great teammates, as not only do they set up Spikes, they can also help Houndoom with bulky Water- and Ground-type Pokemon, and Chesnaught can 2HKO Blissey and Snorlax with STAB Hammer Arm. Hydreigon walls Houndoom thanks to its Dragon / Dark typing, resisting all of Houndoom's moves, while also being able to OHKO Houndoom with Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock. Something to deal with Hydreigon is therefore strongly appreciated, Florges is a good option for this job. Florges can also freely switch in against Fighting-types with Choice Scarf, such as Mienshao and Infernape.

Sunny Day
########
name: Sunny Day
move 1: Sunny Day
move 2: Fire Blast / Flamethrower
move 3: Dark Pulse
move 4: Solar Beam
ability: Flash Fire
item: Houndoominite
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Sunny Day allows Houndoom to take advantage of its ability, Solar Power, and boosts Fire-type moves. Fire Blast is a powerful Fire-type STAB move and is boosted by sun, giving it immense power. Flamethrower can be used if you prefer accurate moves. Dark Pulse is Houndoom's Dark-type STAB move. Solar Beam requires no charging in intense sunlight and gives Houndoom great Grass-type coverage, hitting Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types which Houndoom struggles against for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

252 EVs in Special Attack and 252 EVs in Speed are used to maximize Houndoom's offensive presence, allowing it to hit most threats hard. A Timid nature is used to outspeed key threats such as Galvantula, Froslass, Cobalion, and also Infernape and Mienshao without Choice Scarf. Houndoomite allows Houndoom to Mega Evolve into Mega Houndoom, giving it the ability Solar Power instead of Flash Fire which normal Houndoom has. Solar Power boosts Houndoom's Special Attack by 50%, but unfortunately it has recoil, meaning Houndoom loses 12.5% of its HP each turn.

Usage Tips
========

Due to the lack of Nasty Plot to boost Houndoom's Special Attack on this set, getting entry hazards up quickly is very important to help ensure certain KOs. Although this set can be used to pick off foes throughout the game, it is better used as an late-game cleaner once everything are a bit weakened. This set works excellent as a lure for Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Gastrodon, which might not expect a Houndoom set with Sunny Day. Sunny Day also means Water-type attacks only deal neutral damage to Houndoom, while boosting its Fire-type moves by 50%.

Team Options
========

Hazards are very important for this set, as it gives Houndoom the ability to KO certain threats. Good hazard setters are Forretress, Roserade, Chesnaught, and Froslass. Another Sunny Day setter with Heat Rock and either Memento or Explosion is also very appreciated, and can give Houndoom a free switch-in. Florges is also strongly recommended as a teammate as it can easily deal with Hydreigon, who walls Houndoom and OHKOes it after Stealth Rock, but also Fighting-types with Choice Scarf, such as Mienshao and Infernape, who also are a big problem for Hydreigon. Something to deal with Snorlax and Blissey is also very important; powerful Fighting-types such as Scrafty, Mienshao, Infernape, and Lucario are therefore deeply appreciated by Houndoom.

Other Options
########

Sludge Bomb can be used to hit Fairy-types for super effective damage and hits very hard after one Nasty Plot boost. Taunt can be used to avoid status moves such as Thunder Wave or stop the opponent from using healing moves such as Wish and Recover. Overheat can be used on the Sunny Day set instead of Fire Blast for extreme power, but is rarely recommended as the Special Attack drop forces Houndoom to switch out.

Checks & Counters
########

**Hydreigon**: Hydreigon is a great check for Houndoom, resisting both of Houndoom's STAB moves and being able to OHKO with Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Blastoise, Suicune, Tentacruel, Alomomola, and Gastrodon are all a pain for Houndoom to deal with, unless Houndoom is using the Sunny Day set with Solar Beam.

**Special Walls**: Special walls such as Snorlax, Blissey, and Florges can all tank Houndoom's unboosted hits. Snorlax and Blissey are able to avoid the 2HKO from Fire Blast even after a Nasty Plot boost.

**Ground-types**: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Choice Scarf Flygon, Krookodile, Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Rhyperior can all OHKO Houndoom with their Ground-type STAB moves. However, none of them can switch in safely after Houndoom has used Nasty Plot.

**Mega Aerodactyl**: Mega Aerodactyl not only outspeeds Houndoom thanks to its enormous base 150 Speed, it can also easily OHKO Houndoom with STAB Stone Edge.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types that often use Choice Scarf, such as Mienshao and Infernape, outspeed Houndoom and can easily OHKO it with their Fighting-type STAB moves. However, Houndoom can use Flame Charge on a predicted switch to help it not be outsped.
