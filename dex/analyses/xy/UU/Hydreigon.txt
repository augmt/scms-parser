Overview
########

Hydreigon can utilize its amazing offensive stats and STAB moves to wreak havoc, while its giant movepool takes care of its few would-be counters. The buff to the Dark-type also helped immensely because there are now fewer Pokemon that resist Hydreigon's STAB Dark-type moves.

However, Fairy-types, which Hydreigon is 4x weak to, limit its capabilities, so it has even more weaknesses besides the common attacking types, Fighting and Bug. Its Speed can sometimes also be underwhelming, being outsped by the many Pokemon that have base 100 Speed and higher; many of the Pokemon in that Speed tier, such as Infernape and Mienshao, are able to KO it. However, if you play Hydreigon to its strengths, it can be one of the deadliest Pokemon in the tier.


Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Iron Tail / Roost
move 4: Superpower / Roost
ability: Levitate
item: Life Orb
evs: 56 Atk / 200 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Hasty

Moves
========

Slap a Life Orb on Hydreigon, and Draco Meteor becomes a nuke that will decimate everything that's not a Fairy-type, a Steel-type, or Blissey. Dark Pulse hits Jirachi if it switches into Draco Meteor and it does a good chunk to Mega Aggron as well. Iron Tail and Superpower are coverage moves to hit Fairy-types and Blissey, respectively. Roost is an alternative if you want Hydreigon to have recovery and don't need the coverage move as much because you have the threats covered.


Set Details
========

The Attack EVs should only be used if Hydreigon is running Superpower so it can 2HKO Blissey after Stealth Rock damage, but if it's not using Superpower, feel free to shove the EVs into Special Attack. Maximum Speed investment with a Naive nature allows Hydreigon to outspeed Haxorus before a boost, and the rest of the EVs are pumped in Special Attack to hit as hard as possible with its STAB moves. A Hasty nature can be used to allow Hydreigon to take special hits slightly better, but a Naive nature is preferred for taking priority moves.

Usage Tips
========

This Hydreigon set excels at punching holes in the opposing team. It appreciates a U-turn or Volt Switch user that can safely bring it in to launch a big hit, and a pivot such as Jirachi that it can fall back to when it is forced out. This set is usually best used on more offensive teams, because it provides a lot of important resistances to Psychic, Dark, Fire, Electric, and Water as an offensive Pokemon. Most of the time it will be spamming Draco Meteor, but if the opponent has a solid counter to the Choice Scarf set, which most people expect, such as Blissey or Florges, try not to reveal the item and lure them out so Hydreigon can hit them hard with Superpower or Iron Tail respectively.

Team Options
========

Jirachi is a good partner, as it can bring in Hydreigon safely with a U-turn and it can beat the Fairies it struggles against. Darmanitan can beat Hydreigon's enemies and pivot with U-turn as well, but has a harder time coming in. Florges switches into Bug-, Fighting-, and Dragon-type moves and can pass Wishes and heal status to keep Hydreigon healthy.


Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Fire Blast / Dragon Pulse
move 4: U-turn
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Choice Scarf Hydreigon has a powerful STAB Draco Meteor coming from a base 125 Special Attack, which allows it to revenge kill a variety of threats. Dark Pulse is a secondary STAB move that is more reliable and hits Psychic-types. Fire Blast is the preferred option in the third slot to hit Lucario and other Steel-types, but Dragon Pulse is a more reliable secondary Dragon-type STAB move. U-turn is a very important move, as it allows Hydreigon to gain momentum when special walls and Fairies switch in.

Set Details
========

The spread is standard for a special Choice Scarf user; maximum Speed and Special Attack investment. Timid is the preferred nature because you want to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible and Speed tie with opposing Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Modest gives Hydreigon a nice power boost and allows it to KO Nidoking after Stealth Rock damage.


Usage Tips
========

Choice Scarf Hydreigon can be used on any type of team as a revenge killer because of its great typing, both offensively and defensively. There is honestly no drawback to using it on your team. Early-game, it should be used to scout and wear down the opposing team with U-turn and dropping a Draco Meteor or two, but during late-game, Hydreigon shines, being able to clean a weakened team with its powerful STAB moves.

Team Options
========

Hydreigon is the easiest Pokemon to make a U-turn core with, so Crobat, Jirachi, and Darmanitan all work. They also help Hydreigon take out Fairies, which completely wall it. Although Fairies are Hydreigon's biggest enemy, they are also great partners. They resist Dragon-, Bug-, and Fighting-type moves, which Hydreigon is weak to, so it doesn't have to worry about opposing Hydreigon, faster U-turn users, and Choice Scarf Mienshao. Froslass, Roserade, and Nidoqueen are useful for setting up hazards that weaken the opposing team enough so Hydreigon can get the KOs much more easily.


Other Options
########

Hydreigon can utilize Choice Specs to make the most of its great Special Attack stat, but being locked into Dragon- and Dark-type moves isn't the greatest thing in a metagame where Fairies run rampant. With the combination of Scope Lens and Focus Energy, Hydreigon can use a similar set to the infamous Critdra. It can opt for some interesting support moves such as Toxic, Taunt, Tailwind, and Thunder Wave, but it's usually better off using strong attacks. Choice Band Hydreigon can catch its usual counters off-guard by hitting much harder on the physical side.


Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Florges, Granbull, and Aromatisse can all switch into Hydreigon's STAB moves with their excellent bulk. Granbull completely walls Hydreigon, as it can use Intimidate to weaken Iron Tail from the mixed set.

**Fighting-types**: Choice Scarf Mienshao can revenge kill any kind of Hydreigon. Assault Vest Machamp can switch into Choice Scarf Hydreigon and hit it with Dynamic Punch or Close Combat, while Lucario can switch once into a scarfed Draco Meteor or Dark Pulse once and set up or use Close Combat.

**Special Walls**: Blissey and Umbreon easily wall the Choice Scarf set because of their high Special Defense and HP stat. They have to be careful around the mixed set, however, as one well-timed Superpower could spell doom for them.
