Overview
########

Mega Blastoise easily proves itself as a top-tier wallbreaker that demolishes unprepared teams. Mega Launcher is a fantastic ability that gives Mega Blastoise more reliable pseudo-STAB options. Incredible 79 / 120 / 115 defensive stats turn Mega Blastoise into the perfect bulky wallbreaker, and an excellent base 135 Special Attack makes it viable as an offensive spinner, capable of working on any kind of team. Even when opting for an alternative defensive Rapid Spin set, Mega Blastoise's excellent base 135 Special Attack still hits 306 with no investment. Unfortunately, lack of reliable recovery makes it status bait and hinders its longevity.


Offensive Spinner
########
name: Offensive Spinner
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Scald / Hydro Pump
move 3: Dark Pulse
move 4: Ice Beam / Dragon Pulse / Aura Sphere
ability: Rain Dish
item: Blastoisinite
evs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Rapid Spin is for clearing entry hazards on your side of the field. Scald applies defensive pressure to the opponent's team with its 30% chance to burn, further hindering the opponent's opportunities to set up entry hazards. Hydro Pump is a good option for extra power, but it is slightly unreliable due to only having 80% accuracy. Dark Pulse provides Mega Blastoise with some decent Mega Launcher-boosted coverage and makes for near-perfect neutral coverage in conjunction with Blastoise's STAB move. The last moveslot is based on the needs of the team. Ice Beam and Dragon Pulse are generally superior options for dealing with the many Dragon- and Flying-types in UU. Aura Sphere is a decent Mega Launcher-boosted option for Dark- and Steel-types, though it is generally outclassed by the other coverage moves.

Set Details
========

This set maximizes Mega Blastoise's Special Attack in order to take on a wide variety of frail attackers and walls. Mega Launcher grants Mega Blastoise's Dark Pulse, Dragon Pulse, and Aura Sphere a 1.5x boost. Blastoise's lack of passive recovery means status, especially Toxic, is a problem. Maximum HP investment extends Mega Blastoise's longevity. An alternative spread to hit Speed benchmarks of 210 or 242 can be used to outspeed Machamp, Gligar, and defensive Suicune, or Honchkrow and uninvested base 100s, respectively.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Blastoise has two main roles. The first is to use Rapin Spin and keep hazards off the field and the second is to wallbreak. Though Mega Blastoise can be used somewhat effectively as an anti-lead, it is always wise to keep it around for the long haul due to its precious access to Rapid Spin. It is a great option for both offensive and defensive teams due to its dual Rapid Spinning and wallbreaking capabilities. Lastly, it is important to note that Mega Blastoise is not very effective against the top special walls, such as Blissey, Florges, and Umbreon.

Team Options
========

Mega Blastoise can work on both offensive and defensive teams, but it is best used with cleric support from Pokemon such as Roserade and Florges. Mega Blastoise also appreciates Wish support from Florges, Blissey, or Umbreon, as all three can sponge Electric- and Grass-type special attacks. As with most wallbreakers, Mega Blastoise appreciates U-turn and Volt Switch support that can help retain momentum for optimal wallbreaking. Pokemon such as Gligar and Raikou make good teammates in this respect; Gligar can use U-turn, set up Stealth Rock, and offer an Electric-type immunity, while Raikou provides a fast and powerful Volt Switch and also resists Electric-type attacks. Lastly, this set appreciates entry hazard support for increased wallbreaking potential. Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Azelf make good teammates for this reason.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Scald / Hydro Pump
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Aura Sphere
move 4: Ice Beam / Dragon Pulse
ability: Rain Dish
item: Blastoisinite
evs: 56 HP / 252 SpA / 200 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Scald applies defensive pressure to the opponent's team with its 30% chance to burn. Hydro Pump's power is good for wallbreaking beyond that of STAB Scald, but it is slightly unreliable due to only 80% accuracy. Dark Pulse is a fantastic coverage move, offering Mega Blastoise near-perfect neutral coverage alongside Scald or Hydro Pump. Ice Beam is a great option for dealing with the many Dragon- and Flying-types in UU, and Aura Sphere is a decent coverage option for Dark- and Steel- types. Dragon Pulse can be useful if you find that Aura Sphere or Ice Beam provides redundant coverage.

Set Details
========

Maximize Mega Blastoise's Special Attack investment in order to take on a wide variety of frail attackers and walls. Mega Launcher grants Mega Blastoise's Dark Pulse, Dragon Pulse, and Aura Sphere a 1.5x boost. Lack of passive recovery means status, especially Toxic, is a problem. 200 Speed EVs allow Mega Blastoise to outspeed Honchkrow and bulky Celebi, as well as any uninvested base 100s. Furthermore, with Sticky Web support, Mega Blastoise outspeeds anything that is base 115 Speed or under. This set should only be used when your team already has Rapid Spin or Defog Support. Mega Blastoise's Speed EVs can be tweaked to outspeed base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Gligar and Adamant maximum Speed Choice Band Machamp. In this case, hitting 210 Speed is ideal.


Usage Tips
========

If Mega Blastoise's teammates are able to control entry hazards without relying on Mega Blastoise's access to Rapid Spin, it is able to gain a moveslot for an extra coverage move, turning it into dedicated special wallbreaker. Mega Blastoise's task is to wallbreak, stallbreak, and rip apart frail attackers attempting to work around Mega Blastoise's bulk. Mega Blatoise is excellent against bulky Ground-type leads such as Hippowdon and Donphan, but it is not very effective against the top specially defensive walls such as Blissey, Florges, and Umbreon.

Team Options
========

Use Mega Blastoise alongside Pokemon with Heal Bell / Aromatherapy support such as Roserade and Florges. Mega Blastoise also appreciates Wish support from Florges, Blissey, or Umbreon, as all three can sponge Electric- and Grass-type special attacks. As with most wallbreakers, Mega Blastoise appreciates teammates with U-turn and Volt Switch. Pokemon such as Gligar and Raikou make good teammates in this respect; Gligar can use U-turn, set up Stealth Rock, and offer an Electric-type immunity, while Raikou provides a fast and powerful Volt Switch and also resists Electric-type attacks. Galvantula is a decent option for Sticky Web support, giving this set more opportunities to wallbreak against faster bulkier threats. Tailwind support is another way that this set can shine. Hitting 255 speed allows Mega Blastoise to outspeed Choice Scarf Mienshao under Tailwind. Lastly, this set appreciates entry hazard support for increased wallbreaking potential. Physical wallbreakers also help Mega Blastoise get past specially defensive walls. Ultimately, Mega Blastoise works best on bulky offensive or balanced teams



Other Options
########

Mega Blastoise can use a defensive Rapid Spin set with an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature and the EVs can be altered to give Mega Blastoise some special bulk. For instance, an alternative spread of 252 HP / 176 Def / 80 SpD with a Bold nature can be used in order to hit jump points, gaining a bonus point in Mega Blastoise's defensive stat. For the offensive Rapid Spin set, Mega Blastoise can opt to use Roar or Toxic instead of Ice Beam or Dragon Pulse for increased defensive pressure against Wish users such as Florges, Vaporeon, and Blissey. Water Spout is an interesting attacking option, especially when Sticky Web is set up. More importantly, however, Water Spout only hits as weakly as Scald after Mega Blastoise goes lower than 55% health. Regular Blastoise can use a defensive set with Leftovers and a spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature as it did in BW; however, this set is largely outclassed by Mega Blastoise.


Checks & Counters
########

**Electric-types**: Raikou and Mega Ampharos are two major threats to Mega Blastoise, despite Mega Ampharos's weaknesses to Dragon Pulse and Ice Beam. Furthermore, many Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Porygon2 will sometimes carry Thunderbolt in order to prepare for Mega Blastoise.

**Grass-types**: Shaymin and Roserade are two main threats that force Mega Blastoise to switch out, as Mega Blastoise does not like being hit by powerful STAB Grass-type moves.

**Special Walls**: Florges, Blissey, Umbreon, and Vaporeon all prevent Mega Blastoise from wallbreaking effectively; Wish and Protect work around Mega Blastoise very well.

**Wallbreakers**: Physical wallbreakers such as Choice Band Machamp and Krookodile can deal major damage to Mega Blastoise on the switch or during one-on-one situations. Machamp will sometimes Speed creep Mega Blastoise as well.
