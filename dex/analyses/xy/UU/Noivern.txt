Moves

Usage Tips
========

Noivern is best sent in on switches that help retain momentum. Choice Specs Noivern is not like Choice Specs Hydreigon in that it can simply spam Draco Meteor. Rather, Noivern shines with its wallbreaking abilities when it is used as a cleanup sweeper or opportunistic stallbreaker. Do not use this Noivern as a lead. Instead, use it opportunistically as a mid-game wallbreaker or end-game sweeper. This set also finds niche viability on rain teams, due to 100% accurate Hurricanes.

Team Options
========

This set pairs fantastically with Wish + Baton Pass Vaporeon, as well as bulky U-turn and Volt Switch users, as they create opporunities for Noivern to wallbreak. Jirachi also helps with the Fairy-types that plague Noivern's existence. Coincidentally, Florges and Whimsicott are good teammates that can prevent Choice Scarf Hydreigon from doing significant damage to your team. Chandelure can help as a spinblocker and provides an answer to Steel-types that Noivern generally struggles with. Additionally, Noivern appreciates Rapid Spin or Defog support.

name: Taunt + Roost
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Flamethrower / Air Slash
move 3: Taunt
move 4: Roost
ability: Infiltrator
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Air Slash is a reliable STAB move with a 30% chance to flinch. Taunt prevents entry hazards from being set up on your side of the field. It also takes some pressure off prediction when dealing with setup sweepers such as Crocune. Roost is for added longevity.

Set Details
========

The EV spread provides offensive pressure against entry hazard stackers and status users. Leftovers provides passive recovery and is a good option alongside Roost. Life Orb is another option for harder-hitting STAB attacks, scoring some extra 2HKOs on Roserade and Shaymin, and scoring OHKOs on Pokemon such as Absol or Machamp. Infiltrator completely voids the usefulness of the opposing Pokemon's Substitute.

Usage Tips
========

This set serves as a reasonable anti-lead, as it checks Azelf and other common leads. It is effective against Forretress, non-Choice Scarf Jirachi, and other entry hazard stackers. Noivern appreciates Pokemon that help retain momentum, giving it the opportunity to wallbreak. Despite its effective role as an anti-lead, it can be saved as a late-game sweeper.

Team Options
========

Chandelure can help as a spinblocker and provides an answer to the Steel-types that Noivern generally struggles with. Further, Noivern appreciates Rapid Spin or Defog support. Noivern apreciates entry hazards on the opposing end of the field too, though, as it forces a lot of switches, so Rapid Spin support is preferred.


Other Options
########

One can opt for a bulkier spread, focusing more on HP as opposed to Special Attack. In this instance, make sure Noivern is always left with an odd HP number (such as 351), in order to switch in on Stealth Rock as many times as possible. Focus Blast is an option against Steel-types, but is generally inferior to Flamethrower due to its unreliable accuracy. Boomburst is a reliable powerful non-STAB move for the Choice Specs set. Expert Belt offers a little bit more power against Steel-type switch-ins, and it also provides a Choice item bluff. Draco Plate is another option that is useful for bluffing a Choice item while hitting 20% harder off the bat. Super Fang is another option for the Taunt + Roost set, allowing Noivern to surprise common switch-ins such as Florges or Blissey.


Checks & Counters
