Overview
########

Generation VI brought yet another Dragon / Flying type, which has comfortably found a place in UU. With very high Speed, decent Special Attack, great coverage, and powerful STABs, Noivern is a great addition to most hyper offensive teams. It has access to STAB Draco Meteor and Hurricane, which hit like a truck, as well as the less powerful but more reliable Dragon Pulse and Air Slash; the latter's flinch chance can be taken advantage of thanks to Noivern's high Speed. Noivern scares out Mienshao and can deal respectable damage to a multitude of other Pokemon with its great coverage. However, Noivern does not come without its flaws. It's weak to Stealth Rock, arguably the most common entry hazard in the game, and is quite frail. Noivern's most powerful STAB move, Draco Meteor, halves its Special Attack stat after use, meaning that it's almost forced to switch out after using it. Aside from these flaws, Noivern has definitely found, and deserves, a spot in the UU tier.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Air Slash / Hurricane
move 3: Switcheroo / U-turn
move 4: Flamethrower / Focus Blast
ability: Infiltrator
item: Choice Specs
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is Noivern's main STAB move, capable of dealing an insane amount of damage with Choice Specs. Air Slash is Noivern's secondary STAB move; it is much less powerful than Draco Meteor but comes with almost no drawbacks and a chance to flinch. Hurricane can be used as an alternative to Air Slash for more power and the chance to confuse, but it comes at the cost of accuracy. Switcheroo can be used to cripple Pokemon that don't appreciate Choice Specs or are setting up. U-turn is an alternative to Switcheroo to provide momentum for your team. Flamethrower is a reliable move that provides coverage, particularly against Steel-types, which otherwise wall Noivern. Focus Blast can be used instead of Flamethrower, as it is more powerful and deals super effective damage to Rock-types as well as Ice-types, but it has unreliable accuracy. It also hits Umbreon and Porygon2 super effectively, both of which otherwise wall Noivern with their high Special Defense.

Set Details
========

Choice Specs is used to give Noivern's reasonable Special Attack stat a big boost and allow Noivern to deal massive damage with moves such as STAB Draco Meteor. Infiltrator is the preferred ability because it allows Noivern to hit past Substitutes as well as Light Screen and Reflect. Maximum EV investment is put into Special Attack and Speed so that Noivern can hit as hard and fast as possible, while the leftover 4 EVs are placed into Special Defense rather than HP in order to reduce damage from Stealth Rock, as well as burn or poison. A Timid nature is used to maximize Noivern's Speed.

Usage Tips
========

This set is great for picking off leftover Pokemon at the end of a battle, and it can OHKO threats such as Nidoking with Draco Meteor. Be wary of Fairy-types when using this move, as you will be locked into it; this essentially forces you to switch, as Dragon-type moves do not affect Fairy-types. It is also handy to come in on unsuspecting Pokemon hiding behind a Substitute and deal massive damage to them through the Substitute, thanks to Infiltrator. It is ideal to use Switcheroo on Pokemon that don't appreciate Choice Specs, such as Darmanitan, or Pokemon that are setting up, such as Suicune. Try and use this move only when needed, as the Choice Specs are what mainly gives Noivern its power. U-turn is ideally used on incoming threats to provide momentum and gain the upper hand for your team. However, be wary of using U-turn too much if there is Stealth Rock on your side of the field, as Noivern does not appreciate the 25% health loss when switching in. If you have used Draco Meteor, it is best to switch out straight away as the Special Attack drop leaves it crippled, so only stay in if it is absolutely necessary. Flamethrower and Focus Blast can both be used to deal super effective damage to Ice-types, and the latter to Rock-types as well. Do not rely on these all the time, as they lack STAB, and, in Focus Blast's case, are unreliable.

Team Options
========

Noivern appreciates Rapid Spin or Defog support, as both of these moves can get rid of Stealth Rock, which Noivern is weak to. Forretress is a good option, as it provides nice type synergy with Noivern, can tank physical hits rather well, creates a VoltTurn core with Noivern, and can set up its own Stealth Rock. If you decide to run U-turn, a VoltTurn core is definitely a good idea. Some viable options include the aforementioned Forretress, Raikou, and Jolteon with Volt Switch, or Mienshao and Jirachi with U-turn. Jirachi also has nice type synergy with Noivern, similar to Forretress.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Draco Meteor / Dragon Pulse
move 2: Flamethrower / Focus Blast
move 3: Taunt / Air Slash
move 4: Roost
ability: Infiltrator
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse acts as Noivern's main STAB move. Flamethrower and Focus Blast both provide great coverage and deal super effective damage to Ice-types, the latter dealing super effective damage to Rock-types, Umbreon, and Porygon2 as well. Taunt is for leads such as Azelf that will try to set up entry hazards or screens, but Air Slash can be used as an alternative. Roost heals off half of Noivern's HP, keeping it alive during the match, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and has bad defensive stats.

Set Details
========

Taunt hits sweepers that are setting up behind a Substitute. Life Orb allows Noivern to deal as much damage as possible while still being able to utilize status moves such as Roost or Taunt. Maximum investment is placed in Special Attack and Speed to increase damage output and Speed, and the rest are put into Special Defense to ensure that Porygon-Z and Porygon2's Download raises its Attack rather than Special Attack. A Timid nature is used to increase Noivern's Speed.

Usage Tips
========

Draco Meteor / Dragon Pulse and Air Slash are the main STAB moves and therefore are best used when you need to deal some solid damage. Taunt can be used to predict an incoming Florges, crippling it and not allowing it to heal its teammates as well as somewhat crippling itself. Taunt is also great against leads such as Azelf, as it prevents them from setting up entry hazards. Flamethrower and Focus Blast are best used against Ice-types and Rock-types, respectively. Both of these moves are non-STAB, and Focus Blast has unreliable accuracy, so be careful when using them. Roost can heal off damage that Noivern has received throughout the match, and is best used when Noivern forces a switch.

Team Options
========

Rapid Spin or Defog support gets rid of Stealth Rock, allowing Noivern to switch in more often. However, this may not be necessary, as Noivern can use Taunt to prevent opposing Pokemon from setting up entry hazards. Noivern is a big lure to Florges, so Roserade, as well as most other Poison-types, work great with Noivern, as they can deal super effective damage to Florges and other Fairy-types.

Other Options
########

Tailwind support can be used to aid other team members, doubling their Speed. Unfortunately Tailwind only lasts for four turns, meaning that you don't have much time to set up and then sweep with the support that Tailwind provides. Noivern can also phaze opponents with Whirlwind, removing anything that decides to set up, making sure that your team won't get swept. Boomburst can be used on the Choice Specs set, as it is a reliable move with no drawbacks and 140 Base Power that can hit Fairy-types reasonably hard. However, it is non-STAB and its ability to hit through Substitutes is useless, as Noivern already has Infiltrator. Super Fang is usable because it hits Fairy-types, but it's risky to use it with Choice Specs, and Noivern already has a severe case of four-moveslot syndrome.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types in general check Noivern with their Dragon immunity; in particular, Florges can easily tank Noivern's attacks with its superb special bulk and hit back with a super effective STAB move.

**Specially Defensive Tanks**: Pokemon with high Special Defense and access to reliable recovery, such as Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2, can tank even a super effective Focus Blast and hit back. Porygon2 even carries Ice Beam to hit Noivern for 4x super effective damage.

**Bulky Steel-types**: Bulky Steel-types such as Assault Vest Metagross or specially defensive Jirachi can tank even a super effective Flamethrower and hit back hard. Jirachi can deal super effective damage with Ice Punch or cripple Noivern with Thunder Wave. Metagross can also deal heavy damage with Ice Punch or Meteor Mash.
