Overview
########

Despite being an offensive Pokemon that is very slow and frail, Cacturne can be fairly useful in the tier. The biggest reason for this is because Cacturne gets Water Absorb, which helps checks the common Water-types that are in the tier. Cacturne doesn't have the best movepool, but it has access to Swords Dance, which help with damage output, and Sucker Punch which really helps mitigate Cacturne's base 55 speed.

Moves
=======

For Cacturne to be effective it needs to run its main STAB moves, which are Seed Bomb and Sucker Punch. Seed Bomb is just reliable while Sucker Punch really helps Cacturne out against faster Pokemon as Cacturne only has base 55 Speed and will die to any moderately powerful, non resisted, attack. Swords Dance is used to boost Cacturne's damage output. The last slot can be used for a Fighting-type move, like Low Kick or Drain Punch, or Substitute.

Set Details
========

Cacturne really needs all the Attack and Speed it can get, so 252 EVs in both stats is almost necessary. Water Absorb should always be the ability of choice as it is the reason Cacturne is viable. As for items, it depends on what you need. Focus Sash can be used if you really need that fail safe that allows Cacturne to get off one free hit or one free Swords Dance. Life Orb can be used for extra damage output. Finally, Leftovers can be used on the Substitute set for recovery.

Usage Tips
========

The main reason to use Cacturne is to check Water-types, such as Vaporeon and Suicune. Cacturne can't really take any non resisted hit well, so when using it be very wary of what you switch it into. Suicune, one of the things Cacturne counters, can run Ice Beam which will KO Cacturne. Faster Substitute users can be a bit dangerous as they can play around Cacturne's Sucker Punch and finish it off safely behind a Substitute.

Team Options
========

Anything that appreciates dead Water-types, such as Victini, Darmanitan, Aerodactyl, Sharpedo, and Mega Houndoom, because as previously mentioned, Cacturne is very efficient in eliminating bulky Water-types.

Other Options
########

Cacturne doesn't have too many other options that will keep it being a viable Pokemon. Poison Jab can be used to hit Fairy-types for super-effective damage, Spikes can be used just for hazards sake, and Destiny Bond can be used to net a surprise kill on something slower.

Checks & Counters
########

**Faster opponents**: Anything that can outspeed Cacturne and survive a Sucker Punch can usually finish it off.

**Crobat**: Crobat can outspeed and KO Cacturne with a STAB Brave Bird, but can be OHKOed by a +2 Sucker Punch.

**Trevenant and Gourgeist**: Though weak to Sucker Punch, Trevenant and Gourgeist resist Cacturne's Grass-type STAB move, are immune to its Fighting-type coverage move, and can play around Sucker Punch by using Substitute.

**Chandelure**: Chandelure resists Seed Bomb and is immune to Cacturne's Fighting-type coverage move, but must be careful of Sucker Punch if it is not using a Substitute or Will-O-Wisp set.

**Honchkrow**: Honchkrow resists Cacturne's STAB moves, and can OHKO back with Brave Bird.

**Nidoqueen**: A bulky Nidoqueen can take anything Cacturne can throw at it and OHKO back with Sludge Wave.
