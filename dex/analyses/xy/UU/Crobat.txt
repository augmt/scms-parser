Overview
########

Crobat's unique combination of stats, typing, and movepool make it an interesting Pokemon in UU. By virtue of its decent bulk, Speed, and Attack, Crobat is arguably the best check to Fighting- and Grass-type Pokemon in UU, having enough bulk and a good typing to take any of their STAB moves and the Speed and Attack to strike back. It has a great movepool, including access to Defog, Taunt, U-turn, Roost, and STAB moves of choice, allowing it to function as an excellent team supporter. Thanks to its amazing Speed and decent Attack stats, it can be an effective user of Choice Band for decimating offensive teams. While decent enough to get by, base 90 Attack is nothing to write home about, so Crobat's Choice Band set often isn't powerful enough to take apart defensive builds. The same goes for Crobat's bulk; while it gets the job done, don't expect Crobat to be sponging attacks all day long.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Brave Bird / Acrobatics
move 2: U-turn / Toxic / Taunt
move 3: Defog / Taunt
move 4: Roost
ability: Infiltrator
item: Black Sludge
evs: 248 HP / 60 Def / 200 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Brave Bird is a powerful, reliable STAB move that hits rather hard off the bat and OHKOes many Fighting- and Grass-types such as Mienshao, Machamp, Toxicroak, Infernape, Shaymin, Roserade, and Chesnaught, therefore completing Crobat's job of checking them. However, Acrobatics can be run without an item to take Knock Off better and by extension effectively counter Mega Beedrill. U-turn is valuable for the momentum it gains for the team, but can be omitted in favor of Toxic, which cripples walls and puts sweepers on a timer, or Taunt, which also cripples walls and can be used well in conjunction with Defog. Defog allows Crobat to clear entry hazards for your team. However, Taunt can be used on more offensive teams to keep foes from clearing away your own entry hazards with Defog and to cripple opposing walls. Finally, Roost is important in the last moveslot for reliable recovery and allowing Crobat to clear entry hazards and check Fighting- and Grass-types multiple times throughout the match.
Set Details
========

The given HP EVs maximize Crobat's HP while rounding down damage taken from Stealth Rock. 200 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature are enough to outspeed Noivern, but Crobat also outspeeds other threats such as Mega Pidgeot and non-Mega Alakazam. The rest of the EVs are placed in Defense to check physical Fighting-types and Mega Beedrill better. Sky Plate can be used with 252 EVs in Attack to have more offensive presence and can be useful on more offensively based teams. If countering Mega Beedrill is a priority, then no item and Acrobatics can be used to take less damage from its Knock Off. Infiltrator is the ability of choice to hit Pokemon that are behind a Substitute, but Inner Focus can be used to avoid being flinched by Jirachi.

Usage Tips
========

This Crobat set serves as a check to the Fighting- and Grass-types in UU and controls entry hazards in the process, be it through Taunt or Defog. If using a variant with Defog, try to bring Crobat in on a Fighting- or Grass-type and Defog on the switch or gain momentum with U-turn. If using Taunt, bringing Crobat in against the opponent's Defogger or entry hazard setter via U-turn, Volt Switch, or a double switch is the best way to keep the foe from doing its respective job. Finally, Crobat can stallbreak to an extent by crippling foes with Taunt.
Team Options
========

Crobat fits well on balance, offense, and bulky offense teams that require entry hazard control or a check to Fighting- and Grass-types. Variants of Crobat carrying Taunt fit well on offensive teams, as they can keep your entry hazards on the field by using Taunt to prevent the foe from Defogging and can also be useful in keeping foes from setting entry hazards of their own. Crobat utilizing Defog works very well on balanced and bulky offense teams for its ability to clear away entry hazards multiple times throughout the course of the match. In terms of specific teammates, Swampert is notable for its good defensive synergy with Crobat, with Swampert taking on Rock- and Electric-types and Crobat beating Grass-types and Guts-using Fighting-types, such as Machamp. Also, Crobat has good use in a core consisting of Crobat, Jirachi, and a Dragon-type, often Hydreigon or Mega Ampharos, for their notable defensive synergy and ability to check multiple threats.

BRAVE BAT
########
name: BRAVE BAT
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Cross Poison / Defog
move 4: Defog / Sleep Talk
ability: Infiltrator
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Brave Bird is a strong and reliable STAB move that is easy to spam and is useful for smashing offensive teams and cleaning late-game. U-turn is valuable for gaining momentum and wearing down Crobat's counters over the course of the match, especially when boosted by Choice Band. Cross Poison is a secondary STAB move that hits Electric- and Fairy-types slightly harder than Brave Bird does, and it has only a chance to OHKO Florges after Stealth Rock. Because of this, it can be omitted in favor of Defog for clearing entry hazards. Finally, the last moveslot is a toss-up between Defog, which can clear entry hazards for Crobat's team in a pinch, and Sleep Talk, which allows Crobat to absorb sleep-inducing moves.

Set Details
========

Full investment in Attack and Speed along with a Jolly nature maximizes Crobat's capabilities as a cleaner, revenge killer, and hard-hitter against offensive teams. Choice Band allows Crobat to punch major holes in offensive teams and deal heavy damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist its powerful Brave Bird. Infiltrator helps Crobat hurt users of Substitute such as Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune and Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure.
Usage Tips
========

This set serves as a check to Fighting- and Grass-types because of its great defensive typing and STAB Brave Bird. It also does heavy damage to offensive teams thanks to its great Speed and strength with Choice Band equipped. It also takes care of common of Substitute-using setup sweepers with the exception of Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi.

Team Options
========

Swampert is a good partner for Crobat thanks to their great defensive synergy together and the fact that it can set up Stealth Rock for Crobat, making Crobat's job of punching holes in the opponent's team easier. In return, Crobat can take care of troublesome Grass-types such as Shaymin, Roserade, and Chesnaught. Dugtrio also makes for a good partner for its ability to trap and KO Electric-, Rock-, and Steel-types that trouble Crobat.

Other Options
########

A set utilizing Choice Scarf can be used as a very specialized late-game cleaner, as it outpaces all relevant Choice Scarf users, allows Crobat to use an Adamant nature, and grants 80 extra EVs that can be placed in HP, a godsend for a late-game cleaner using recoil moves. Hypnosis can be used to put a foe to sleep but is hard to fit onto a set and isn't very reliable. A specially based set utilizing Nasty Plot to be a setup sweeper can be used, but it forgoes one of Crobat's main attractions in its ability to quickly fire off a powerful Brave Bird, and a special Crobat requires setup to deal significant damage. Whirlwind can be used on the support set to deal with setup sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage but is rather hard to fit onto a set over Crobat's other options. Finally, Haze can be used to stop setup sweepers, but Defog, Taunt, U-turn, and Toxic are better options for Crobat.

Checks & Counters
########

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Raikou, Mega Ampharos, and Rotom-H resist Brave Bird and can OHKO Crobat with a STAB Thunderbolt.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Jirachi, Mega Aggron, Forretress, and Empoleon resist Brave Bird and can do whatever they like against Crobat, be it set up entry hazards, remove them, or attack.

**Mega Aerodactyl**: Mega Aerodactyl outspeeds Crobat and can take any of Crobat's attacks and then use Taunt to prevent Crobat from using Defog, set up Stealth Rock, use Defog itself, or KO Crobat with Stone Edge.
