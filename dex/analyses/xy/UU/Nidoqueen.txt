Overview
########

With the power provided by combination of Sheer Force and Life Orb as well as fantastic coverage, Nidoqueen can act as an outstanding wallbreaker. In addition, Nidoqueen has good bulk with a typing that grants her a great set of resistances and an immunity to Electric and two common status moves, Toxic and Thunder Wave. To complement her offensive attributes, Nidoqueen has access to useful utility moves, such as Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes, and Roar. However, Nidoqueen's poor Speed and lack of reliable recovery leave her prone to being easily worn down.

Offensive Entry Hazard Setter
########
name: Offensive Entry Hazard Setter
move 1: Earth Power
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Stealth Rock / Toxic Spikes
move 4: Sludge Wave / Toxic Spikes
ability: Sheer Force
item: Life Orb
evs: 40 HP / 252 SpA / 216 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Earth Power is Nidoqueen's primary STAB move and is able to OHKO or 2HKO a large portion of the tier. Ice Beam has great coverage in tandem with Earth Power and leaves only a select few Pokemon that resist both moves. These two moves are particularly great for pressuring common Defog and Rapid Spin users, such as Crobat, Gligar, Empoleon, Forretress, and Donphan. Stealth Rock pressures opposing teams by punishing switches, but Toxic Spikes, which aid in wearing down bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Vaporeon, can be used instead if one of Nidoqueen's teammates already carries Stealth Rock. Sludge Wave is Nidoqueen's second STAB attack that works particularly well for damaging Fairy-types such as Florges as well as Rotom-H, which resists Ice Beam and is immune to Earth Power. Nidoqueen has access to many other moves that can be used to hit specific foes. Examples of moves that Nidoqueen can use in the last slot are Thunderbolt to hit bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Alomomola, and Mega Blastoise and Fire Blast to hit Bronzong.

Set Details
========

252 EVs are used in Special Attack with a Modest nature to enable Nidoqueen to hit as hard as possible. Sheer Force negates Life Orb recoil, giving a 1.69x boost to Nidoqueen's moves at the cost of their secondary effect. The given Speed investment allows Nidoqueen to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow and Pokemon with uninvested base 100 and lower Speed, such as Tentacruel and Defensive Arcanine. The rest of the EVs are placed into HP to add to Nidoqueen's already-impressive bulk. EVs may be moved from Speed to HP in order for Nidoqueen to take hits better; for example, 180 HP / 252 SpA / 76 Spe can be used to outspeed uninvested Suicune and Gligar while taking attacks from Mienshao and Lucario much more easily.

Usage Tips
========

Nidoqueen can easily use her great offensive presence and many resistances to find opportunities to set up entry hazards. When attacking, prediction is key, as many opponents will try to pivot their Pokemon around Nidoqueen's moves. When the opponent does have a Pokemon that can safely take any of Nidoqueen's hits, such as Umbreon or Bronzong, Nidoqueen should take advantage of the obvious switch to set up entry hazards or double switch.

Team Options
========

Nidoqueen appreciates the support of wallbreakers that can remove the special walls that she cannot defeat. Machamp is a particularly great partner that can easily remove Pokemon such as Umbreon, Blissey, and Snorlax. Choice Scarf Hydreigon is another good partner that has good offensive synergy with Nidoqueen, checking certain offensive threats such as Krookodile and Shaymin while a mixed Life Orb set helps to break past special walls. Both of the aforementioned Pokemon appreciate Nidoqueen's ability to remove Fairy-types. On balanced teams, Nidoqueen appreciates Wish support, as she is prone to getting worn down by Pokemon such as Mienshao and Crobat.


Defensive Entry Hazard Setter
########
name: Defensive Entry Hazard Setter
move 1: Stealth Rock / Toxic Spikes
move 2: Roar
move 3: Ice Beam / Flamethrower
move 4: Earth Power / Flamethrower
ability: Sheer Force
item: Black Sludge
evs: 248 HP / 240 Def / 20 SpA
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Stealth Rock wears enemies down by cutting into their health upon switching, but if one of Nidoqueen's teammates already carries Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes can be used instead. Roar allows Nidoqueen to phaze foes and rack up residual damage from the entry hazards she has set. Ice Beam and Earth Power have good coverage together, pressuring many of the tier's hazard removers and hitting hard even without Special Attack investment. Flamethrower can be used over either attack to KO Forretress, which can otherwise spin away Nidoqueen's entry hazards rather easily. Earthquake can be used over Earth Power with a Relaxed nature to OHKO Mega Beedrill.

Set Details
========

The given HP and Defense EVs significantly boost Nidoqueen's physical defense and allow her to take most physical hits with ease. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack to allow Nidoqueen to hit opposing offensive Pokemon marginally harder. Black Sludge restores Nidoqueen's health passively and is her only form of recovery.

Usage Tips
========

This set works best on balanced and stall teams as a check to Fighting-, Fairy-, and Electric-types. Nidoqueen can use her impressive bulk to set up entry hazards against physical attackers such as Mienshao, Crobat, and Mega Beedrill. After Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes have been set up, Nidoqueen should use Roar to rack up residual damage on switch-ins and possibly give herself a favorable matchup.

Team Options
========

Teammates such as Mega Ampharos and Kyurem that put pressure on Defog users work well with Nidoqueen. In addition, spinblockers help ensure that Nidoqueen's entry hazards remain on the field. Nidoqueen is prone to getting worn down, so she greatly appreciates Wish support. Blissey can full heal Nidoqueen with her Wishes and help with some of the powerful special attackers that trouble Nidoqueen. Other phazing Pokemon can make full use of the entry hazards Nidoqueen sets. Whirlwind Snorlax is an example that has great defensive synergy with Nidoqueen.

Other Options
########

Nidoqueen has access to Focus Blast, which, after being boosted by Sheer Force and Life Orb, can deal severe damage to many of her switch-ins, such as Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2. Nidoqueen can also use Taunt, which prevents defensive Pokemon from recovering and slower Defog users from clearing her entry hazards. Dragon Tail is an alternate form of phazing, but is very weak and relatively inaccurate; it also cannot phaze Protect users with Dragon Tail, so Roar is usually the better option. A physical or mixed set is possible, but Nidoking is usually better for this role due to its higher base Attack.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dedicated Special Walls**: Blissey, Snorlax, Porygon2, Umbreon, specially defensive Cresselia, and specially defensive Vaporeon all give Nidoqueen trouble, as they avoid taking significant damage from any of her moves.

**Calm Mind Users**: Pokemon such as Calm Mind Cresselia and CroCune can use offensive variants of Nidoqueen as setup fodder, although they must be careful not to get phazed.

**Bronzong**: Unless she runs Fire Blast, Nidoqueen cannot touch Bronzong and will get worn down by Gyro Ball or Earthquake.

**Ground- and Water-types**: Strong Ground- and Water-types such as Krookodile and offensive Suicune can outspeed and KO Nidoqueen.
