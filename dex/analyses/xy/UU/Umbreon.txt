Overview
########

Umbreon was widely recognized as being the best pure special wall in BW UU, and while it now faces competition from Florges for that role, it's still arguably the best at what it does. Its nice defensive typing leaves it with only three weaknesses&mdash;all of which are covered by a single type, Poison&mdash;and gives it a Psyshock immunity. Amazing overall bulk and access to STAB Foul Play, Heal Bell, and recovery options in Wish and Moonlight all combine to allow it to wall nearly every single special attacker in UU.

That said, Umbreon is weak to the second most common attacking type in the tier (Fighting), and given its status as a pure wall, it is very vulnerable to Taunt and prone to getting set up on. However, even with those shortcomings Umbreon helps shape the tier merely by existing, a feat few Pokemon can claim.

Special Wall
########
name: Special Wall
move 1: Foul Play
move 2: Wish / Moonlight
move 3: Protect / Toxic
move 4: Heal Bell / Toxic
ability: Synchronize
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

STAB Foul Play puts the opponent in a tough spot by forcing them to pick between switching in a physical attacker that gets maimed by it or a special attacker that will most likely get walled. Wish allows Umbreon to heal itself and its teammates, while Moonlight is a less reliable option (due to Sand Stream's presence in the tier) that frees up the Protect moveslot and doesn't take two turns to work. Protect is a move you should only use if you opt for Wish over Moonlight, but it does have the utility of scouting for the ever-present Choice Fighting-types that roam UU. Heal Bell relieves Umbreon and its teammates of status conditions and works fantastically with Synchronize, allowing Umbreon to act as a very effective status deterrent and sponge. Toxic will allow Umbreon to beat, or at least cripple, special attackers it normally couldn't harm, such as Hydreigon, which Umbreon walls, but can't damage, and Mega Houndoom, which uses Umbreon lacking Toxic as setup bait.

Set Details
========

The given EVs and nature maximize Umbreon's Special Defense. It may seem odd to use Calm over Careful with a physical attack on the set, but since Foul Play uses the opposing Pokemon's Attack stat, you might as well minimize confusion and and opposing Foul Play damage on Umbreon. Leftovers is used to allow Umbreon to gradually recover its HP so it doesn't need to waste a turn doing so as often.

Usage Tips
========

In general, you'll want to switch Umbreon in on anything it walls and use its Wish as a pivot move to get your next Pokemon in more easily, with it using Protect to heal itself whenever necessary. Umbreon also learns Baton Pass and can use it as a U-turn of sorts, allowing it to maintain momentum much more easily. It's also worth noting that Wish and Moonlight are not mutually exclusive; they can be used together to allow Umbreon to choose when it wants to heal itself or its teammate on any given turn, without having to resort to Protect.

Team Options
========

Generally speaking, Umbreon will fit best on stall and balance teams, as they appreciate the support it brings. Poison-types such as Nidoqueen, Crobat, and Qwilfish work extremely well with Umbreon as they cover all of its weaknesses; as a result, they are also far more likely to receive Wish support. Victini works similarly, resisting two of Umbreon's weaknesses and being neutral to the third.

Other Options
########

Umbreon doesn't have much in the way of other options that hasn't already been covered. Curse can be used on a set with Payback instead of Foul Play and a Careful nature to sweep by itself, and Umbreon can even pass it along using Baton Pass. Taunt is also an option for Umbreon to be more of a nuisance to stall and very defensive balance teams, but its low Speed stat will prevent it from being of much use versus any other team style.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types** Mienshao (especially those with Regenerator), Machamp, Scrafty, Virizion, Toxicroak, and Cobalion are all big threats to Umbreon, as they can switch in with relative ease and threaten to set up on it or straight-up KO it.

**Calm Mind Users** Suicune and Slowking (if Umbreon lacks Toxic) use it as setup bait; this is especially dangerous if your team relies on Umbreon to stop every opposing special attacker. Raikou also wins if Umbreon switches in on it as it uses Calm Mind, as it can boost two more times and then proceed to 2HKO with Thunderbolt.

**Mega Houndoom** Mega Houndoom takes next to nothing from Foul Play and can 2HKO Umbreon at +4.

**Taunt** Much like every non-Aromatisse wall, Umbreon is extremely vulnerable to Taunt.

**Bug-types** Escavalier, though it takes massive damage from Foul Play, can threaten a KO with Megahorn as well. Venomoth and Vivillon can set up Quiver Dance on Umbreon freely, much like Calm Mind users.

**Fairy-types** Florges is the main one seen in UU, but more niche Pokemon such as Granbull, Aromatisse, and Slurpuff are also big threats. It's worth noting, however, that should Slurpuff choose to Belly Drum on Umbreon, it risks getting OHKOed by Foul Play.
