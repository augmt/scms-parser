Overview
########

There is a high dependency on Wish + Baton Pass users in the UnderUsed tier, and Umbreon's incredible 95 / 110 / 130 bulk makes it ideal for not only Wish + Baton Pass support, but cleric support as well. Umbreon's Dark typing is good for taking on many offensive and defensive types. Due to its bulk and access to Wish + Baton Pass, Umbreon pairs well with offensive pivots for effective core building, and thus it can be used on almost any type of team. Although Umbreon can be setup fodder, Foul Play is effective against offensive teams, which adds to Umbreon's viability, as not everyone prepares for Umbreon when teambuilding.

move 1: Wish
move 2: Protect / Moonlight

move 4: Foul Play
ability: Synchronize
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD

Moves
========

Wish is a reliable recovery move for Umbreon and its teammates. Protect ensures that Wish succeeds while allowing Umbreon to scout for common Choice item users such as Hydreigon and Mienshao and gain more Leftovers recovery. Moonlight eases the prediction of Wish, and provides Umbreon with more reliable recovery. Baton Pass allows Umbreon to easily pass a Wish to a teammate, while Heal Bell provides cleric support, allowing for more aggressive plays. The choice between Baton Pass and Heal Bell is dependent on the nature of your team; teams that already have Pokemon able to provide cleric support will appreciate Umbreon running Baton Pass in order to regain or generate momentum. Foul Play is a reliable move that causes a lot of damage to many of the physical attackers in the tier.

Set Details
========

A Calm nature alongside the listed EV spread maximizes Umbreon's special bulk. Synchronize is a useful ability alongside Heal Bell, providing Umbreon with opportunities to cause some chaos against the opponent's team while supporting your own. Leftovers provides passive recovery and increased longevity.

Usage Tips
========

Use Umbreon with the knowledge that almost all non-super effective hits are irrelevant thanks to its reliable recovery. Umbreon is best used to sponge a variety of high-powered hits in order to provide excellent team support. Umbreon is better against Choice-locked Pokemon as opposed to setup Pokemon; for example, Choice Specs Raikou is a better matchup for Umbreon then Substitute + Calm Mind. Wish + Baton Pass Umbreon functions similarly to Wish + Baton Pass Vaporeon, sacrificing the extra HP in the Wish for more immediate bulk. Foul Play alongside Wish + Protect allows Umbreon to be self-reliant in certain situations.


Team Options
========

Umbreon functions well alongside Pokemon such as Crobat or Gligar, as they can take on some of its Fighting-type counters and provide utility and pivot support with Defog and U-turn, respectively. Umbreon works well alongside Swampert, as most Taunt users, such as Aerodactyl, Krookodile, and Crobat, are frail or fear Swampert's typing. Umbreon appreciates Rapid Spin and Defog support, as this makes its job a little easier. Baton Pass also gives Umbreon the ability to slow pass into powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Band Machamp, Choice Band Krookodile, and Choice Specs Yanmega.


Other Options
########

Toxic is another option instead of Foul Play or Protect in order to apply defensive pressure against bulky teams. A player can choose to play with the Baton Pass set's EV spread to make it more physically defensive; however, always maximize Umbreon's base stats by running a Calm nature. In the case where you opt for a defensive spread, running 252 HP / 156 Def / 100 SpD is most beneficial to Umbreon's utility potential. Lastly, Inner Focus is an interesting ability that keeps Choice Scarf Jirachi and other flinch users at bay, letting Umbreon counter with Foul Play or set up a Wish or Baton Pass.


Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types** Umbreon struggles immensely against Mienshao, Machamp, and Pokemon with Fighting-type moves such as Superpower Absol. Choice Band wallbreakers also prevent Umbreon from successfully setting up Wish + Baton Pass.

**Taunt Users** Taunt shuts Umbreon down, which gives the opponent opportunities to retain momentum.

**Trick Users** An optimally timed Trick by a Jirachi or Chandelure can cripple Umbreon by preventing it from using its utility-based moves.

**Bulky Setup Sweepers** Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune, Calm Mind Florges, and Curselax are amongst the few reliable setup sweepers that can set up on Umbreon.
