Overview
########

Ever since its release, Suicune has consistently remained a threat, and it's not hard to see why. Suicune's combination of amazing defensive stats and defensive typing allows it to function as one of the premier walls in the UnderUsed tier. Because of this, Suicune is an easy check to almost every physical attacker in the tier. To top off Suicune's great defensive stats, Suicune's ability Pressure helps it PP stall on defensive sets. However, Suicune is not only limited to performing defense roles, as its access to Calm Mind allows it to utilize its Special Attack stat offensively. Suicune's access to Calm Mind is significant due to the fact that its natural bulk makes it incredibly easy to set up, and Suicune is usually able to set up on different playstyles depending on the set it utilizes. However, Suicune has a mediocre Special Attack stat, and it usually only does major damage when boosted by Calm Mind. Furthermore, Suicune's Speed stat, while good, leaves it outsped by key threats such as Hydreigon.

CroCune
########
name: CroCune
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Scald
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA
nature: Bold

Moves
========

This set uses Suicune's great defensive capabilities and access to Calm Mind to allow it to function as a boosting wall. Calm Mind boosts Suicune's Special stats, augmenting its special bulk as well as boosting its power. Scald is Suicune's main STAB attack, and deals decent damage after a Calm Mind with a respectable chance to inflict a burn. Rest and Sleep Talk work hand in hand, providing Suicune with reliable recovery. This also allows Suicune to still boost while asleep, or use Scald to deal damage to the opponent. If Suicune is being used neither to stay in the entire match nor boost, you can opt for Roar over Calm Mind to stop setup sweepers in their tracks and rack up hazard damage. However, Scald will have an underwhelming damage output and Suicune will not be as effective in pressuring the opponent.

Set Details
========

As Suicune will be boosting its Special Defense with Calm Mind, maximum Defense investment is used to make Suicune physically bulky as well. A Bold nature further boosts Defense. Leftovers is the preferred item, as it provides passive recovery each turn. Pressure is the chosen ability, as it is the only ability Suicune has access to, and it allows Suicune to effectively PP stall. More Speed investment is an option to creep up on uninvested foes such as defensive Rotom-H, but losing bulk is generally bad.

Usage Tips
========

Suicune should be used as a win condition. Because of this, it should only begin to set up when its checks and counters, such as Roserade and Toxicroak, have been removed from play. Early-game, Suicune can also spread burns using Scald. Rest should be used when Suicune is weakened, and keep in mind that Suicune sleeping lasts only three turns, so do use caution when using Sleep Talk. Suicune should also set up on Pokemon that can't do much to it, such as Cloyster and Darmanitan. This Suicune set is relatively easy to use; just begin using Calm Mind and attack with Scald.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can remove Suicune's checks and counters make great partners. Alakazam is a good option in particular because it can easily take out Roserade and can beat Toxicroak lacking Sucker Punch. Suicune's Special Attack isn't anything spectacular; for this reason, hazard support is a must for Suicune to score KOs more easily. Roserade is a good partner for Suicune; it has great type synergy, eliminates Water-types, absorbs Toxic Spikes, and can set up Toxic Spikes to cripple special walls. Wallbreakers can soften up the opponent enough for Suicune to finish them off. Life Orb Darmanitan can wallbreak against Blissey and Florges, and has relatively good synergy with Suicune.

Substitute + Calm Mind
########
name: Substitute + Calm Mind
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Calm Mind
move 3: Scald
move 4: Ice Beam
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers
evs: 112 HP / 252 SpA / 144 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Due to the multitude of switches Suicune forces because of its bulk and typing, Substitute is a very viable option, as it allows Suicune to set up safely and can be used on the switch. Calm Mind boosts Suicune's special stats, and allows it to start doing significant damage. Scald is a STAB attack that has a decent chance to burn. Ice Beam provides coverage against Grass-types and overall has good synergy with Scald. Hydro Pump is an option for those who want that extra oomph, but the low PP and chance to miss make it a mediocre option.

Set Details
========

Leftovers provides passive recovery and somewhat mitigates the health loss from Substitute. 252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximize Suicune's special offensive capability. 148 Speed EVs are used to outpace Adamant Honchkrow. The remaining EVs are put into bulk to allow Suicune to take hits better. However, a more defensive spread of 252 HP / 112 Def / 144 Spe is viable for more defensively oriented teams, while still outpacing Adamant Honchkrow. This spread would utilize a Bold nature.

Usage Tips
========

Suicune should set up Substitute on the switches it forces, particularly against Pokemon that can't do much to it such as uninvested physical attackers, or against Ground- and Rock-types. Suicune can also set up against support Pokemon that can't break through it, such as Umbreon and Gligar. Suicune should set up only when its checks and counters, such as Blissey, have been removed from play, as it otherwise is easily stopped in its tracks. Suicune should be used as a win condition. However, even after a boost, Suicune still lacks the power to OHKO all of its opponents. As such, this set should be used late-game where all the opposing Pokemon are weakened enough for Suicune to finish them off after setting up.

Team Options
========

Roserade is one of the best partners that could be used in tandem with this set. Roserade absorbs Toxic Spikes, which are a huge problem for Suicune, as they wear it down. Roserade also has great synergy with Suicune and can clear out opposing Water-types that give it trouble; moreover, it can also set its own Toxic Spikes, which pressures special walls and lets Suicune have an easier time beating them. Wallbreakers are great partners for weakening opponents enough for Suicune to finish them off with ease. Darmanitan has great synergy with Suicune and has no trouble beating both Blissey and Florges, while Swords Dance Mega Abomasnow is an option for beating opposing Suicune and Jellicent as well as the aforementioned Blissey and Florges. Once again, due to Suicune's mediocre power, entry hazard support is great for weakening the opponent enough for Suicune to finish them off. Azelf can use Stealth Rock and U-turn out, while Nidoqueen can use Stealth Rock and has good synergy with Suicune.

Offensive Calm Mind
########
name: Offensive Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Tailwind / Hidden Power Grass
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers
evs: 200 HP / 252 SpA / 56 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

This set takes a more offensive approach and relies on Suicune's natural bulk to set up. Calm Mind allows Suicune to boost its Special Attack and Special Defense by both one stage. Hydro Pump is used over Scald for the added power, although Scald still is an option if you prefer the chance to burn. However, the power drop is very noticeable. Ice Beam is used for striking Grass-types, which would otherwise be a pain for Suicune. The last slot is based on preference. Tailwind doubles Suicune's Speed so it can freely invest in HP. However, if Suicune's team struggles with opposing Water-types, Hidden Power Grass is the best option for the last slot, as it hits them for good damage after a boost from Calm Mind.

Set Details
========

Pressure is used because it is the only ability to which Suicune has access. The given Speed EVs allow Suicune to outrun Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Alakazam under Tailwind, but more investment is an option to outspeed specific Choice Scarf users. The HP investment allows Suicune to set up with ease. 252 EVs are dumped into Special Attack to maximize Suicune's offensive capability. A Modest nature boosts Special Attack even further. Leftovers is the best item for Suicune, as it provides passive recovery and stops Suicune from getting worn down too quickly. If you'd rather more power, a Life Orb is an option to get that extra oomph when attacking. However, this neglects Suicune's great bulk and allows it to get worn down more quicly. A faster spread is viable for sets not running Tailwind; however, the lack of bulk makes it harder to set up.

Usage Tips
========

Suicune is able to utilize its natural bulk to set up in front of opposing Pokemon that don't pack a super effective attack against it. However, Suicune best sets up Calm Mind in front of Pokemon that absolutely cannot do anything to it, such as Umbreon. Suicune should also set up strictly when all of its checks and counters have been removed from play, because even after multiple boosts, Suicune still fails to break through special walls such as Blissey. Suicune also best sets up mid- to late-game, as early-game, it is susceptible to priority and being worn down, whereas late-game it can finish off every opponent that doesn't counter it.

Team Options
========

Azelf is an ideal partner for this set. It can set up dual screens to ensure that Suicune can set up safely, set up Stealth Rock as Suicune can be a bit lacking in power, and use Explosion to ensure Suicune gets in safely. Forretress is able to set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes, and it has a slow Volt Switch to bring Suicune in safely. Mega Ampharos has amazing type synergy with Suicune, and it also is able bring Suicune in with a slow Volt Switch. Roserade, like always, makes for a great partner. It removes Toxic Spikes, which would otherwise cripple Suicune, can set its own Toxic Spikes to pressure special walls, and has good synergy with Suicune.

Other Options
########

Unfortunately, Suicune has barely anything in its arsenal that it can viably use. Toxic is an option to cripple special walls, something that Suicune struggles with. However, this would take up a moveslot, and Suicune needs everything that it uses. Hidden Power Electric is an option to hit Empoleon while retaining coverage on most other Water-types, but it still remains an inferior option, as Hidden Power Grass is almost always better in terms of coverage. Mirror Coat is a fun, surprising option that takes advantage of Suicune's bulk to score KOs. Lastly, Suicune can use Extrasensory to hit Tentacruel and Machamp for better damage.

Checks & Counters
########

**Water immune Pokemon**: Suicune heavily relies on its Water-type STAB moves to do damage, especially on its CroCune set, where its only source of damage is Scald. Thus, Pokemon immune to Water such as Toxicroak and Gastrodon are very problematic to Suicune, as they can either attack or set up on it. Suicune's offensive Calm Mind set doesn't threaten most Water-immune Pokemon, as it will be relying on using a boosted non-STAB Ice Beam to do damage, which Pokemon such as Gastrodon can sponge easily. Specially defensive Jellicent in particular is a problem due to its Water immunity and ability to sponge literally any attack from Suicune bar Hidden Power Grass.

**Grass-types**: Most Grass-types are an easy stop to Suicune's CroCune set, as it relies on only Scald to do damage, which Grass-types resist. Roserade in particular is a good stop to Suicune, as even after it has boosted multiple times with Calm Mind, it is able to withstand a hit due its high Special Defense. In return, Roserade can use Suicune as setup fodder for Spikes, attack it with a Grass-type STAB move, or stall it out with Leech Seed. Shaymin and Celebi are also able to use their STAB moves to break through Suicune. All Grass-types, however, are put at risk by the offensive Calm Mind set, which can easily dent them with Ice Beam after a boost.

**Special Walls**: Suicune can't touch any special walls due to its average Special Attack. Blissey in particular is Suicune's biggest threat in terms of special walls, as it can sponge a +6 Scald on any given set and effectively stall it out with Soft-Boiled. However, Suicune will always be able to PP stall Blissey with the CroCune set due to Pressure and PP saving with Rest.

**Phazing**: Phazing moves such as Roar and Dragon Tail are a relevant threat to Suicune because it is reliant on Calm Mind boosts on the CroCune set to be able to do any sort of damage and sponge special hits. They are a problem for offensive Calm Mind sets because they ruin Suicune's offensive momentum and remove its boosts. Pokemon such as Slowking and Goodra can phaze Suicune out with Dragon Tail.
