Overview
########

Swampert has reasonable 100 / 90 / 90 bulk which makes it an ideal defensive wall alongside its unique Water / Ground typing, which gives it one weakness, while sporting several resistances and one immunity. Swampert is one of the few Pokemon that stops Fire-type wallbreakers such as Darmanitan and Entei cold. Unfortunately, a 4x weakness to Grass-type moves makes it susceptible to easy OHKOs should one mispredict; however, Swampert's strengths far exceed any potential weaknesses. Access to Stealth Rock and Roar makes Swampert an ideal entry hazard shuffler. Furthermore, Swampert's Mega Evolution has access to Swift Swim and has base 110 / 110 defenses as well as base 150 Attack, making it an ideal rain sweeper. After using Rain Dance, Mega Swampert's Speed is doubled and alongside its huge base 150 Attack allows it to be an effective wallbreaker. However, the downside is that Mega Swampert suffers from a lack of any sort of reliable recovery, making it susceptible to being whittled down.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Scald
move 4: Roar / Toxic / Protect
ability: Torrent / Damp
item: Leftovers
evs: 240 HP / 16 Atk / 252 Def
nature: Relaxed

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is used for racking up entry hazard damage, while Earthquake is a powerful STAB option even with little investment. Scald is a secondary STAB option with a 30% chance to burn, increasing Swampert's utility. Roar allows Swampert to phaze, with an added benefit of accumulating Stealth Rock damage. Toxic allows Swampert to spread status around, contributing to wallbreaking and sweeping, and Protect allows Swampert to scout against Choiced Pokemon.

Set Details
========

The EV spread allows Swampert to take on most non-Choice Band attackers and set up Stealth Rock, while also hitting a Leftovers number. Leftovers is used for passive recovery and overall longevity. Torrent should be the primary option, as it lets Swampert score extra 2HKOs with Scald once it activates. Damp can be used to prevent the rare Self-Destruct or Explosion. Swampert can also use a specially defensive set, with an EV spread of 240 HP / 16 Atk / 252 SpD and a Sassy nature.

Usage Tips
========

Swampert should be used as a defensive wall and entry hazard shuffler. Swampert acts as a decent lead, as it can take on frail Choice Scarf leads such as Darmanitan as well as Nidoking and Mega Absol and can usually dominate most offensive Pokemon when it has the type advantage. Mixed attacking options mean Swampert can take on burn-inflicting Pokemon such as defensive Arcanine and Choice Band Entei.

Team Options
========

Swampert is useful on stall, semi-stall, and balance cores. As such, it partners well with specially defensive Wish users and clerics such as Blissey, Umbreon, and Florges, as they keep Swampert healthy and extend its walling potential. Swampert also partners well with offensive pivots and other U-turn users such as Crobat and Darmanitan which can pivot into Swampert when their matchups are unfavourable. Swampert provides reliable wall support to the plethora of Pokemon, including Florges, Jirachi, Machamp, and Shaymin, to name a few, that need a defensive check against Fire-type wallbreakers. Swampert appreciates both offensive and defensive Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Cofagrigus for spinblocking support and for taking defensive pressure off of it by better absorbing Normal- and Fighting-type moves, which are very common. Chandelure in particular can also absorb Fire-type moves via its Flash Fire ability.

Rain Sweeper
########
name: Rain Sweeper
move 1: Rain Dance
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Ice Punch / Superpower / Stealth Rock
ability: Damp
item: Swampertite
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Rain Dance activates Swift Swim, allowing Mega Swampert to outspeed the entire unboosted tier. Waterfall is a primary STAB option that receives a 1.5x boost due to rain and has a 20% flinch rate, which partners well with Swift Swim's Speed boost and provides more wallbreaking opportunities. Earthquake is an effective STAB option against most Pokemon that either resist or are immune to Water-type attacks. Ice Punch is used to hit Grass- and Flying-types. Superpower is used to hit common Normal- and Dark-types, including Snorlax, Hydreigon, Blissey, and Umbreon. Stealth Rock can be used in order to assist in wallbreaking, as the foe will lose health upon each switch-in.

Set Details
========

An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs allow Mega Swampert to hit as hard as possible and 252 Speed EVs ensure that Mega Swampert outspeeds the entire non-Choice Scarfed tier as well as any Pokemon under base 100 Speed that uses Choice Scarf. Swift Swim doubles Mega Swampert's Speed after a Rain Dance. A Jolly nature can be used in order to outspeed almost all Choice Scarf users in the tier.

Usage Tips
========

The first thing Mega Swampert should do is set up Rain Dance in order to optimize its wallbreaking potential. Use it as an early-game wallbreaker or late-game sweeper. Avoid using Mega Swampert as a lead; a bad matchup may take away momentum from your team. Lastly, Mega Swampert is very useful alongside balance and bulky offense playstyles but is not very effective against stall, despite its wallbreaking potential.

Team Options
========

Mega Swampert partners well with Pokemon that appreciate rain support, such as Toxicroak or a variety of Hurricane users. Tornadus can set up Rain Dance effectively, setting up Swampert for late-game sweeps. Mega Swampert's Rain Dance aids Swift Swim sweepers such as Kingdra or Ludicolo. Mega Swampert appreciates Wish and cleric support from Pokemon such as Florges or Umbreon. Due to its lack of recovery, Mega Swampert appreciates Rapid Spin support from Forretress or Kabutops. Alternatively, Defog support from Pokemon such as Crobat or Gligar along with U-turn can also be effective in creating wallbreaking opportunities for Mega Swampert.

Stealth Rock Megapert
########
name: Stealth Rock Megapert
move 1: Stealth Rock

move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Ice Punch / Superpower
ability: Damp
item: Swampertite
evs: 212 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Spe

Moves

Superpower is used to hit common Normal- and Dark-types, including Snorlax, Hydreigon, Blissey, and Umbreon, as well as Abomasnow.

Set Details
========

212 HP EVs alongside Mega Swampert's 110 / 110 defenses increase this set's potential to tank hits. 252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Mega Swampert to be an effective wallbreaker and 44 Speed EVs allow Mega Swampert to outspeed base 65 speed Pokemon prior to Mega Evolution and Florges after Mega Evolution.

Usage Tips
========

This set combines the utility of Swampert's good defensive typing and bulk with the prowess of its strong offensive typing and huge Attack. Mega Swampert can be used as a lead, as it can take on frail Choice Scarf leads such as Darmanitan. Swampert can take on frail threats such as Nidoking and Mega Absol in one-on-one situations, and it can usually dominate most offensive and balanced Pokemon when it has the type advantage in said one-on-one situations. Mega Swampert's STAB coverage means it can take on a variety of Pokemon such as Poison-, Ground-, Rock-, and Fire-types.


Team Options
========

This Mega Swampert set partners well with specially defensive Wish users and clerics such as Blissey, Umbreon, and Florges, as they keep Mega Swampert healthy and extend its wallbreaking potential. Swampert also partners well with offensive pivots and other U-turn users such as Crobat and Darmanitan which can pivot into Mega Swampert when their matchups are unfavourable.

Chandelure in particular can also absorb Fire-type moves via its Flash Fire ability.

Other Options
########

A Choice Band set is a viable option, and some Speed EVs can be used to hit certain Speed tiers. Assault Vest can also be used to some effect. Mega Swampert can utilize a bulky RestTalk set for a reliable means of recovery. A specially bulky mono-attacking Curse + RestTalk set is another option. Curse with three attacks or Curse with two attacks and Rest are also alternatives.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Shaymin, Roserade, and Chesnaught all pose significant problems to Swampert, as they outspeed the defensive sets and can OHKO or 2HKO with a Grass-type STAB move.

**Toxic**: Common Toxic users such as Crobat and Umbreon can help the opponent's team whittle down Swampert. Toxic Spikes also poses a problem for this reason.

**Wallbreakers**: Choice Band Machamp and Choice Scarf Mienshao 2HKO the defensive set, while Hydreigon and Mega Blastoise cause Swampert serious problems due to their superb wallbreaking capabilities.

**Bulky Water-types**: No Swampert set will be able to break through CroCune or Alomomola. Rocky Helmet Alomomola will trouble the rain sweeper set by causing damage every time Swampert uses a contact move such as Waterfall or Ice Punch.
