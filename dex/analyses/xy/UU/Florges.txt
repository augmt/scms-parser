Overview
########

With an excellent defensive typing, a great set of resistances, reliable recovery in Synthesis and Wish, and a solid supporting movepool, Florges is a staple in the UU tier. Boasting solid defensive stats, albeit a rather poor base Defense, Florges also has an often-overlooked Special Attack stat and a good offensive STAB move in Moonblast. However, Florges grants a free switch to several threatening Pokemon such as various Steel- and Fire-types. It is also setup fodder for many common setup sweepers and often falls victim to common stallbreaking tactics such as Trick and Taunt. In addition, Florges's abilities have no use in the singles format.

Defensive Support
########
name: Defensive Support
move 1: Wish
move 2: Protect / Synthesis
move 3: Moonblast
move 4: Aromatherapy / Toxic
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 232 Def / 24 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Florges is a decent Wish passer and is usually able to reliably heal itself and its teammates with Wish. Protect enables Florges to safely receive its own Wish unless Florges gets phazed by Roar or Whirlwind; it is also important for scouting movesets and Choiced attackers and grants Florges additional Leftovers recovery. Synthesis can be used over Protect to reliably restore Florges's own health against phazers such as Swampert. Moonblast is reasonably strong coming off Florges's naturally high Special Attack and is able to OHKO several offensive Pokemon, such as Hydreigon, Mega Absol, and Mienshao. Aromatherapy removes status from Florges and its teammates, while Toxic can be used instead to wear down Fire-type switch-ins and bulkier Pokemon. However, many of Florges's switch-ins are immune to Toxic because of their typing, such as Bronzong and Nidoqueen, or can heal themselves of status, such as Blissey and opposing Florges.

Set Details
========

The given EVs significantly boost Florges's Defense, allowing it to take physical Fighting- and Dark-type attacks well. The Special Defense investment and a Calm nature are used to retain Florges's massive special bulk; alternatively, maximum investment in Defense with a Bold nature can be used to answer to Pokemon such as Krookodile and Haxorus more easily. Leftovers lets Florges heal passively without relying on Wish and works well in tandem with Protect. Neither of Florges's abilities is useful, so either one can be used.

Usage Tips
========

Protect should be used to scout Choiced Pokemon or possibly threatening coverage moves such as Iron Tail on Hydreigon. However, Florges must be wary of Pokemon that can take advantage of the free turn granted by Protect by boosting or using Substitute. If Synthesis is preferred, it should always be used instead of Wish to heal Florges itself.

Team Options
========

This Florges set works best on balanced teams and can make up part of the defensive backbone that these teams require. Pokemon that can check Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types work well as partners; bulky Water-types can fulfill this role effectively. Swampert in particular is a great teammate as it has great defensive synergy with Florges, provides Stealth Rock, and can phaze setup sweepers that Florges hates, such as CurseLax, while Florges supports Swampert in return with Wish and Aromatherapy. Krookodile is another great teammate that can beat many foes that threaten Florges, such as Nidoqueen and Roserade. Mega Aggron can also support Florges with Stealth Rock and phazing while standing up to threats such as Crobat and Mega Beedrill.

Defensive Calm Mind
########
name: Defensive Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Moonblast
move 3: Synthesis
move 4: Aromatherapy
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Calm Mind boosts Florges's Special Attack and Special Defense, letting it eventually break down special walls while also becoming extremely difficult to take down with special attacks. Moonblast is the set's only attack and has a good offensive typing and respectable power with STAB. Synthesis is used to immediately restore half of Florges's HP. Finally, Aromatherapy heals Florges of status and makes Florges extremely hard for defensively oriented teams to take down; it also provides useful cleric support for the rest of Florges's team.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment in Defense and HP along with a Bold nature allows Florges to easily take attacks from the likes of Mienshao, Krookodile, and Crobat; no EVs need to be placed into Special Defense because it will be boosted by Calm Mind. Thus, Florges is very difficult to revenge kill after it sets up thanks to its heavy investment in Defense coupled with its boosted Special Defense. Leftovers provides Florges with passive healing as it boosts, allowing it to use Synthesis less frequently.

Usage Tips
========

This set fits well on bulky offensive teams as a check to various attackers as well as an excellent win condition against stall, which struggles to take Florges down without a setup sweeper of its own, such as CroCune. Florges should not attempt to play around Pokemon such as Toxic Blissey and defensive Arcanine, which can both wear Florges down easily with repeated statuses and attacks, forcing Florges to use up its limited Aromatherapy and Synthesis PP. Instead, Florges should set up on non-boosting special attackers, such as Mega Blastoise and even slower variants of Life Orb Nidoqueen, as well as passive Pokemon, such as Gligar, Vaporeon, and even Gyro Ball Forretress. However, Florges struggles against most opposing setup sweepers, such as CroCune, Calm Mind Cresselia, and CurseLax, and should not attempt to beat them one-on-one.

Team Options
========

Florges needs most Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types weakened or removed before it can set up safely. Krookodile is an excellent partner, as it can trap Bronzong and check Poison-types such as Roserade and Toxicroak, while appreciating Florges's ability to switch into Fighting-types. Swampert is also a great partner, as it can set up Stealth Rock to pressure opposing Fire-types, check Fire- and Steel-types, and phaze opposing setup sweepers that can beat Florges. Toxic Spikes is a great option to pair with Florges that forces opposing Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Arcanine to recover frequently, granting Florges more setup opportunities.

Other Options
########

Florges has access to a decent coverage move in Psychic, which can defeat Poison-types such as Nidoqueen and Roserade and can deal considerable damage to Fire-types. Florges also has access to Energy Ball to hit Water- and Ground-types harder or can use Hidden Power Fire to deal decent damage to Steel-types barring Empoleon, especially Forretress, which commonly uses Florges's presence on the field to set up entry hazards.

With a naturally high Special Attack, Florges can run an offensive Calm Mind set with two or three attacks. However, its low Speed and poor uninvested physical bulk prevent this set from being too effective. Florges can use a Choice Scarf to get surprise KOs on faster Pokemon such as Crobat and Infernape; a Modest nature should be used over a Timid nature on such a set, as the latter doesn't let Florges outspeed anything relevant. Florges can also run Choice Specs with the aforementioned coverage moves to deal major damage to most switch-ins.

Checks & Counters
########

**Pokemon that Resist Fairy**: Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types can take advantage of common Florges sets and immediately threaten it out. Notable Pokemon that have little to fear are Roserade, Nidoking, Mega Beedrill, Entei, Darmanitan, Empoleon, and Mega Aggron.

**Strong Physical Attackers**: Even with maximum investment in Defense, Florges still struggles to switch into many neutral physical attacks, such as those from Choice Band Krookodile and Life Orb Infernape.

**Boosting Pokemon**: RestTalk Pokemon such as Snorlax and Suicune can use Florges as setup fodder, as even Calm Mind variants fail to beat them. Nasty Plot users such as Mega Houndoom, Porygon-Z, and Azelf can all beat support Florges.

**Taunt**: Support Florges cannot perform its role against Taunt users and Calm Mind Florges also falls to some common Taunt users, such as Crobat.

**Phazing**: Phazers such as Swampert and Mega Aggron prevent Wish Florges from passing its Wishes to the desired recipient and Calm Mind Florges from setting up freely. In particular, Sand Stream Hippowdon can phaze Florges while also lowering Synthesis's recovery with its ability.
