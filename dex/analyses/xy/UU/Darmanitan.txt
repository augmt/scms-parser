Overview
########

Darmanitan is almost the definition of a hard-hitting Fire-type, sporting an impressive base 140 Attack alongside a Sheer Force-boosted STAB Flare Blitz. To augment its sheer power, it has a solid base 95 Speed, putting it above many Pokemon in UU. Its ability Sheer Force is also useful, boosting the power of not only Flare Blitz, but also useful coverage moves such as Rock Slide. Darmanitan also has some great options for coverage, including Superpower and Earthquake. Sadly, Darmanitan has subpar bulk and no access to recovery moves. As if that weren't enough, its best STAB move, Flare Blitz, further limits its bulk due to its heavy recoil effect.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Flare Blitz
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Earthquake / Superpower
ability: Sheer Force
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Flare Blitz is Darmanitan's most powerful STAB move, hitting most Pokemon in the tier for heavy damage, especially when boosted by Sheer Force. Rock Slide is a valuable coverage move that is also boosted by Sheer Force, primarily hitting other Fire-types and Mega Aerodactyl. U-turn is useful for gaining momentum, giving a free switch for whatever Pokemon the opponent sends in. Earthquake is recommended in the last slot for hitting Poison-, Steel-, Fire-, and Electric-types super effectively, but Superpower can be used, as it hits Normal- and Dark-types super effectively while retaining coverage against Rhyperior, but it misses out on coverage against Poison- and Electric-types such as Nidoqueen and Mega Ampharos, respectively.

Set Details
========

The given Attack and Speed EVs maximize Darmanitan's cleaning and revenge killing capabilities. The remaining 4 EVs are invested in Special Defense to give Porygon-Z and Porygon2 an Attack boost from Download instead of a Special Attack boost. Sheer Force increases the power of Darmanitan's moves that have secondary effects, including Flare Blitz and Rock Slide. Choice Scarf is used alongside a Jolly nature in order to outspeed threats such as Mega Beedrill, Mega Sceptile, and Mega Aerodactyl.

Usage Tips
========

Darmanitan is best used as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner. In the early-game, Darmanitan should be spamming U-turn to wear down its counters and gain momentum to clean more easily in the late-game. You should try to avoid locking Darmanitan into Flare Blitz if the opponent has a Choice Scarf Hydreigon, as it will be able to come in and retaliate with a powerful STAB Draco Meteor. Also, try to avoid using Flare Blitz too much, as the recoil will quickly wear Darmanitan down.

Team Options
========

A spinner or Defogger makes for a good partner for Darmanitan, as it is weak to Stealth Rock, which will quickly wear it down in conjunction with Flare Blitz recoil. Tentacruel and Mega Blastoise make for good partners, as Darmanitan can beat Grass-types for them and Mega Blastoise and Tentacruel can take on Fire-types; Blastoise can also beat Ground-types, which makes Darmanitan's job easier. Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Forretress can provide Stealth Rock support to help Darmanitan clean in the late-game more easily. Pokemon that can take on Rhyperior and bulky Water-types make for good teammates, as they otherwise wall Darmanitan. Grass-types such as Shaymin and Roserade make for good teammates in this right, and they can absorb status thanks to Natural Cure. Roserade can provide entry hazard support in the form of Toxic Spikes and Spikes. Finally, Pokemon that can handle faster Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and Mienshao are appreciated. Fairy-types such as Aromatisse and Florges can handle them well.

Wallbreaker
########
name: Wallbreaker
move 1: Flare Blitz
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Earthquake / Superpower
move 4: U-turn / Superpower
ability: Sheer Force
item: Choice Band / Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Flare Blitz is Darmanitan's most powerful STAB move that is further boosted by Sheer Force. Rock Slide gets excellent coverage alongside Flare Blitz, notably hitting other Fire-types super effectively, and it receives the boost from Sheer Force. U-turn is used to give a free switch to a teammate if the foe switches out, therefore gaining momentum, or to switch out of a foe Darmanitan can't beat. Earthquake is useful to hit Rhyperior and Steel-, Fire-, Poison-, and Electric-types, especially Mega Ampharos, super effectively. Superpower, however, can be used, as it also hits Rhyperior and Steel-types, as well as Normal- and Dark-types such as Snorlax and Umbreon, respectively. Though it has higher Base Power, remember that Superpower also lowers Darmanitan's Attack and Defense.

Set Details
========

252 Attack and Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature maximize Darmanitan's wallbreaking power and Speed. The remaining 4 EVs are placed in Special Defense to force an Attack boost on Porygon-Z and Porygon2 instead of a more threatening Special Attack boost. Sheer Force increases the power of moves with secondary effects by 30%, boosting Flare Blitz and Rock Slide. A Jolly nature is chosen over an Adamant nature to outspeed Pokemon such as Roserade, Krookodile, and Entei. The item choice is up to personal preference: Life Orb allows Darmanitan to switch moves at the cost of a little power and recoil from moves not boosted by Sheer Force (U-turn, Earthquake, and Superpower), but Choice Band grants more power and no recoil at the cost of not being able to switch moves.

Usage Tips
========

Darmanitan can try to bluff the Choice Scarf set to lure in a Pokemon and KO it with a boosted move, but you must be careful to reveal the item at the right time. Try to bring Darmanitan in off of a U-turn, Volt Switch, or fainted teammate, as Darmanitan is used as a revenge killer and likes to save its HP for when it's using Flare Blitz. Be wary of the amount of recoil Darmanitan takes when using Flare Blitz, as the damage will quickly wear it down, especially if you failed to keep Stealth Rock and other entry hazards off of the field.

Team Options
========

A spinner or Defogger is helpful to clear the field of entry hazards so Darmanitan won't be worn down as easily, especially because its most powerful STAB move has recoil. Tentacruel and Blastoise are good in this role, as they can clear entry hazards and break down Ground-, Rock-, and Fire-types, which are a nuisance to Darmanitan. Crobat also makes for a good partner in that it can clear entry hazards with Defog and form a U-turn core with Darmanitan. Grass-types such as Roserade and Shaymin make for good partners for their ability to take on bulky Water-types and Rhyperior. Pokemon such as Hydreigon appreciate the wallbreaking power Darmanitan brings, especially against Fairy-types such as Florges and Aromatisse. That said, Florges and Aromatisse make for good partners due to their ability to take on Hydreigon, one of Darmanitan's best offensive checks.

Other Options
########

Fire Punch is an option over Flare Blitz to avoid taking recoil damage, but it is much weaker than Flare Blitz and takes away much of Darmanitan's wallbreaking power. Zen Headbutt is an option to hit Fighting- and Poison-types hard without taking recoil damage, but it actually deals less damage than a STAB Flare Blitz and has redundant coverage. It is, however, boosted by Sheer Force. A Belly Drum set with Substitute and Salac Berry can be used to try to sweep, but it requires far too much support to be used effectively.

Checks & Counters
########

**Defensive Walls**: Some defensively oriented Pokemon such as Suicune, Rhyperior, and Swampert avoid 2HKOs from any of Darmanitan's moves and can KO it. Hippowdon and Vaporeon can also tank a Flare Blitz and KO back, although they do not want to switch into a Choice Band Flare Blitz.

**Arcanine**: Physically defensive Arcanine can capably switch into any of Darmanitan's moves and heal off the damage with Morning Sun, although it must be wary of switching into a Rock Slide or Earthquake, especially when Stealth Rock has been set up.

**Entry Hazards**: Stealth Rock will wear down Darmanitan significantly, as it takes around 25% every time it switches into them. Spikes also wear Darmanitan down quickly, as it is grounded.

**Revenge Killers**: Faster attackers, as well as strong priority move users, can limit Darmanitan's wallbreaking and sweeping capabilities. Those include Hydreigon, Mega Aerodactyl, Mienshao, and Entei.
