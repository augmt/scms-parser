Overview
########

In accordance with its mob boss appearance, Honchkrow is an intimidating offensive Pokemon. Powerful moves such as Brave Bird backed by a high base 125 Attack give it enough power to do some serious damage to most opponents. Access to powerful priority in STAB Sucker Punch allows Honchkrow to deal heavy damage to the Pokemon that outspeed it. What sets Honchkrow apart from most other offensive Pokemon, however, is the ability Moxie. Honchkrow becomes a fearsome late game sweeper, because it gets an Attack boost after each foe it takes down.

Although it has many good qualities, the murderous crow is not perfect. It has lackluster bulk, meaning that it will go down pretty easily to attacks that are super effective or STAB boosted. Its base 71 Speed is pretty poor for an offensive Pokemon, and it can easily be outpaced and outmatched by defensive Pokemon who can bypass the unreliable Sucker Punch with status moves. Honchkrow also loses massive amounts of HP through secondary damage, finding its sweeps cut short by Brave Bird and Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock damage. Nevertheless, Honchkrow's positives are too much to pass up despite its flaws. Honchkrow has the capacity to rip through teams and should definitely be kept in mind when teambuilding.

Standard
########
name: Murderkrow
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Sucker Punch
move 3: Roost / Pursuit
move 4: Pursuit / Substitute / Superpower
ability: Moxie
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

This is Honchkrow's standard set. Brave Bird is the main move being spammed on this set due to its sheer power and the coverage that Flying-type STAB has. Sucker Punch is used for priority, dealing massive damage to the faster Pokemon who come in to revenge kill Honchkrow. Roost is used to mitigate the damage taken from recoil and Stealth Rock. While it may seem odd to have recovery on such a frail Pokemon, the threat of Sucker Punch often forces opponents to use a non-attacking move, giving Honchkrow a chance to use Roost. Pursuit works well with Moxie, allowing Honchkrow to grab the Attack boost from Pokemon that are trying to switch out. Substitute gives Honchkrow a way of blocking status moves from bulkier Pokemon, although it is best run with Roost due to the recoil damage that this set takes. Lastly, Superpower can be used for coverage, hitting the Steel- and Rock-types that resist Flying-type moves.

Set Details
========

Attack and Speed are fully EV'ed because Honchkrow has no use investing in bulk. Max Speed allows Honchkrow to outspeed uninvested base 100 Speed Pokemon. An Adamant nature is preferred due to the higher damage output, but Jolly can be used to net some surprise kills.

Usage Tips
========

Honchkrow should usually be coming in late game, when it's capable of gaining a Moxie boost. A teammate can be sacrificed to weaken opposing Pokemon and give Honchkrow a safe switch-in to get an easy Moxie boost and start the sweep.

Team Options
========

Due to its Stealth Rock weakness, Honchkrow greatly appreciates teammates that can keep Stealth Rock off of the field such as Empoleon, Crobat, and Mega Blastoise. Honchkrow also appreciates hazards of its own, such as Spikes support from Pokemon such as Froslass and Roserade. As Honchkrow can find it difficult to come in, slow Pokemon with Volt Switch and U-turn such as Forretress and defensive Jirachi are good partners as well. Wallbreakers such as Hydreigon and Nidoking can weaken bulky opponents, giving Honchkrow a better chance of breaking through the opposing team for the sweep.

Other Options
########

Honchkrow can run a Choice Scarf set consisting of Brave Bird, Night Slash, Pursuit, and Superpower.  While it may seem like the Choice Scarf would give Honchkrow an easier time sweeping, the lack of power is noticeable, and Honchkrow performs much better when it can switch moves. On the standard set, there are a few extra moves that are usable. Taunt can be used to cripple most walls, and Hidden Power Grass can be used to take out Swampert without any boosts. Other moves like Tailwind and Thunder Wave can be used to support the team, though Honchkrow is much better off trying to sweep. A Choice Band set hits very hard, but it is easily revenge killed and doesn't hit hard enough to justify its use.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fast Dark-type Resists**: Faster Pokemon that resist Dark-type moves, such as Hydreigon and Cobalion can all take a boosted Sucker Punch and KO back.

**Bulky Flying-type Resists**: Very bulky Pokemon that resist Flying-type attacks such as Mega Aggron and Rhyperior can also survive Sucker Punch and KO. Specifically, Mega Aerodactyl is able to stall out Brave Bird and Sucker Punch with Roost, though it must watch out for Superpower.

**Fast Substitute Users**: Faster users of Substitute such as Chandelure, Raikou, and Jirachi can all take advantage of Sucker Punch to get up a free Substitute and deal damage.
