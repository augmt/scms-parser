Overview
########

Beedrill shines in the UU metagame thanks to its Mega Evolution, which, by way of amazing Attack and Speed stats and Adaptability, grants it the strongest U-turn in the tier, letting it pummel offensive and defensive teams alike. It can grab offensive momentum with very little trouble thanks to the aforementioned qualities, which makes it one of the best offensive Pokemon in the tier. However, Beedrill has a somewhat shallow movepool aside from its STAB attacks, and it only has access to Knock Off and Drill Run as offensive coverage moves. It also has pitiful defensive stats, as well as a mediocre defensive typing. It also is forced to run Protect so that it can Mega Evolve and get the Speed boost without taking damage, as its Speed before Mega Evolving is decent at best. Despite these flaws, Beedrill is still a fantastic Pokemon, and it should always be considered when making an offensive team.

Moves
========

U-turn is Beedrill's main STAB move, as it nets Beedrill offensive momentum with little trouble and is useful to get some chip damage. Protect is used so that Beedrill can get the Speed boost from Mega Evolving without taking any damage and is also useful to scout for foes' movesets and potential Choice items. Poison Jab is Beedrill's strongest attack, as well as its main Poison-type STAB attack, and it has a fairly high chance to poison the target, which works well in conjunction with Protect to rack up damage on the foe while scouting for its moveset. Knock Off hits Ghost-types such as Chandelure for super effective damage and also cripples Pokemon reliant on their item. Drill Run is mainly used for coverage, as it hits Poison- and Steel-types that resist Beedrill's STAB attacks, such as Tentacruel, Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Lucario, for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

A standard EV spread is used to max out Beedrill's offensive prowess, with the remaining EVs in Defense so it can maintain an odd HP number. A Jolly nature is used so Beedrill can Speed tie with other base 145 Speed Pokemon, such as Mega Sceptile and opposing Beedrill. An Adamant nature can be used instead to give Beedrill a little more extra power.

Usage Tips
========

Protect should be used the first turn Beedrill is sent out if the opposing Pokemon is faster, as it lets Beedrill safely Mega Evolve and attain the Speed boost without taking damage, scouting the foe's moveset in the process. Although it has poor defensive stats, Beedrill's decent defensive typing gives it 4x resistances it can use to switch in. However, some powerful physical moves such as Mienshao's Reckless High Jump Kick have a shot at 2HKOing it, although Beedrill can use Protect to scout and potentially make Mienshao take crash damage. Beedrill can grab momentum with little trouble thanks to its strong U-turn and high Speed stat, so pairing it with entry hazard users is a good idea. Keeping entry hazards off your side of the field is appreciated, as Beedrill will be switching out more than often due to U-turn, and it can be KOed by priority users after Stealth Rock damage.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support is appreciated, as Beedrill can force out a good portion of the tier and grab offensive momentum easily with U-turn. As such, entry hazard setters such as Swampert, Roserade, Froslass, and Chesnaught are good partners for Beedrill. Spikes in particular also works well with Beedrill, as it weakens most of Beedrill's grounded checks. Entry hazard removers also work well with Beedrill, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and will be switching in and out very often, so Empoleon, Donphan, and Gligar, the latter forming a nice momentum core with Beedrill, are good partners for it. Other U-turn and Volt Switch users, such as Crobat, work like a charm when paired up with Beedrill, as they can pivot out to Beedrill with little trouble and keep up offensive momentum.

Other Options
########

X-Scissor can be used over U-turn if you feel that keeping up offensive momentum is not necessary, as it hits for more damage. Swords Dance can be used to boost Beedrill's attack immensely, but Beedrill usually does not have the room to run this and finds it difficult to set up. If it does manage to set up, it can still get revenge killed easily by priority and Choice Scarf users, so running Swords Dance is not usually worth the loss of coverage.

Checks & Counters
########

**Stealth Rock**: As Beedrill uses U-turn often, it generally does not stay in for long periods of time. Passive damage from Stealth Rock wears down Beedrill quickly and pressures it to stay off the field.

**Choice Scarf Users and Faster Pokemon**: Because Beedrill has a very high Speed stat, Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and Darmanitan can take it on. It should be noted, however, that Beedrill outspeeds Choice Scarf users that aren't above base 80 Speed. Mega Aerodactyl outspeeds Mega Beedrill and OHKOes it with its STAB attacks.

**Priority Attacks**: Beedrill's pitiful defenses make it extremely susceptible to priority, such as Lucario and Entei's Extreme Speed and Fletchinder's Acrobatics.

**Bulky Steel-types**: Due to their huge physical bulk and defensive typing, Mega Aggron, Doublade, and Forretress scoff at all of Beedrill's attacks and can OHKO it with their Steel-type STAB attacks. However, Doublade doesn't like having its Eviolite Knocked Off.

**Bulky Pokemon that resist Beedrill's STAB attacks**: Pokemon that can tank Beedrill's STAB attacks and recover the damage, such as Gligar and Crobat, make for good answers to Beedrill and are a pain for Beedrill to face. Tentacruel also resists both STAB moves and has decent Defense, but is vulnerable to Drill Run and gets worn down fairly easily.

**Physical Walls**: Pokemon with high physical bulk like Alomomola and Suicune can tank Beedrill's STAB attacks and heal off the damage taken with Wish and Rest, respectively, while forcing Beedrill out due to the chance of a Scald burn.
