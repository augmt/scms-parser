Overview
########

Mega Aerodactyl boasts incredibly high Speed, being one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier. Tough Claws is a great ability to increase the power of Mega Aerodactyl's contact moves, such as Aerial Ace, Aqua Tail, and Fire Fang, a boost that is backed by a solid Attack stat. Aerodactyl also has a great support movepool including Taunt, Defog, Stealth Rock, and reliable recovery in Roost, alongside a respectable defensive typing. Unfortunately, Aerodactyl struggles to do everything at once and somewhat faces four-moveslot syndrome. Aerodactyl also suffers from a Stealth Rock weakness, which is detrimental for a Defog user. Overall, Aerodactyl is a very strong and versatile threat that has many positive qualities to take advantage of.

Offensive Support
########
name: Offensive Support
move 1: Defog / Taunt
move 2: Roost
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Aqua Tail / Aerial Ace
ability: Pressure
item: Aerodactylite
evs: 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Defog is a great support move for offensive teams that removes all entry hazards from both sides of the field. Alternatively, Taunt can be used to prevent opposing entry hazards as well as status or recovery moves from defensive Pokemon. Roost provides reliable recovery. Stone Edge crushes Fire- and Flying-types, which Aerodactyl can pivot into, and is Aerodactyl's strongest STAB move. Aqua Tail is preferred in the last moveslot to hit Ground-types such as Donphan, Hippowdon, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen. This is helpful for a Defog user because it deals heavy damage to most common Stealth Rock users. Aerial Ace is an option if your team has trouble with bulky Grass-types, particularly Chesnaught. Stealth Rock can be used if you cannot fit it on another Pokemon on your team, and it is best used alongside Taunt to beat opposing Stealth Rock users such as Azelf.

Set Details
========

216 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Aerodactyl to outspeed Jolly Mega Beedrill, Timid Mega Sceptile, and base 115 Speed Pokemon, such as Azelf, before Mega Evolving. Mega Aerodactyl can outspeed +1 neutral-natured base 85 Speed Pokemon, such as Kingdra. Maximum Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible. The ability chosen is not very important, but Pressure can be somewhat useful before Mega Evolving.

Usage Tips
========

Aerodactyl should use its high Speed and power to act as a great revenge killer against Pokemon such as Roserade and Chandelure, giving it free turns to attack a foe, clear away entry hazards with Defog, or use Roost. Aerodactyl should aim to keep entry hazards off your side of the field and stay healthy with Roost before starting to attack. If you predict the opponent to switch to a Ground-type or Chesnaught on a Stone Edge, it is best to hit the incoming foe with the appropriate coverage move. Aerodactyl should use Roost against foes that cannot 2HKO it or to scout out a foe's set. Lastly, Aerodactyl should stay away from all forms of status, as they all significantly hinder its offensive capabilities.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate entry hazard removal, such as Yanmega, Darmanitan, and Honchkrow, make for good partners. These Pokemon also share some similar checks and counters with Aerodactyl, which is helpful because they can give each other an easier time by wearing such Pokemon down. Grass-types, such as Shaymin and Roserade, are good teammates to handle the bulky Water- and Ground-types that Aerodactyl struggles with, such as Swampert, Suicune, and Hippowdon. Bulky entry hazard setters such as defensive Roserade and Forretress are helpful to reset entry hazards if need be. Aerodactyl generally provides enough team support and doesn't need much in return.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: UU All-Out Attacker
move 1: Hone Claws / Roost
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: Aqua Tail / Aerial Ace
move 4: Aerial Ace / Roost
ability: Pressure
item: Aerodactylite
evs: 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Hone Claws boosts Aerodactyl's Attack and accuracy, allowing it to punch significant holes in the opponent's team. Stone Edge is a strong STAB move that appreciates the accuracy boost from Hone Claws. Aqua Tail is a great coverage move that is boosted by Tough Claws and hits Ground-types such as Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Donphan, and Hippowdon. Aerial Ace is a secondary STAB move that hits bulky Grass-types, particularly Chesnaught. If your team can handle Chesnaught or would prefer having more coverage moves over the boost from Hone Claws, Roost can be used in place of either of those moves. Lastly, Crunch can be used to hit Psychic-types such as Jirachi and Bronzong for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

216 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Mega Aerodactyl to outspeed Jolly Mega Beedrill and Timid Mega Sceptile. Pressure is the only ability that has some use before Mega Evolving, as draining an opposing Pokemon's PP can be helpful occasionally.

Usage Tips
========

This set functions best as a late-game cleaner, so Aerodactyl should be preserved as long as possible. Aerodactyl should also utilize its high Speed to revenge kill weaker foes such as Roserade and Chandelure. It should switch into a weak resisted attack or a Ground-type move to get off an attack or boost with Hone Claws. Aerodactyl should only boost with Hone Claws once any possible Choice Scarf users or physical walls have been removed.

Team Options
========

Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Darmanitan and Life Orb Mienshao are great partners, as they share similar checks and counters with Aerodactyl and can weaken them to give it an easier time sweeping. Rapid Spin support from Pokemon as Forretress is helpful to alleviate Aerodactyl's weakness to Stealth Rock. Defog users such as Empoleon and Crobat are also good partners for this reason, but Aerodactyl prefers Rapid Spin support because it keeps entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field. Spikes support from Roserade or Forretress is very helpful as most of Aerodactyl's checks and counters are grounded. Roserade is also a great partner because it pressures the bulky Water- and Ground-types that trouble Aerodactyl.

Other Options
########

Pursuit traps Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Jirachi, Alakazam, Celebi, and Chandelure on the switch and prevents frail attackers such as Dugtrio from switching out. Aerodactyl can use a suicide lead set with a Focus Sash and a moveset such as Taunt, Stealth Rock, Stone Edge, Aerial Ace, and Fire Blast. Other coverage moves, such as Ice Fang, Iron Head, Thunder Fang, and Double-Edge, can be used, but they don't hit many notable targets that the listed moves don't.

Checks & Counters
########

**Physical Walls**: Even with a boost from the rare Hone Claws, Aerodactyl struggles to break through physically bulky Pokemon, such as Hippowdon, Swampert, Alomomola, and Suicune. Hippowdon easily handles any Aerodactyl lacking Aqua Tail.

**Bulky Attackers**: Pokemon with solid bulk and no weakness to Rock- or Flying-type moves can check Aerodactyl. Mega Blastoise, Mega Ampharos, Nidoqueen, and Metagross are all good for this role because they can all take at least one super effective coverage move.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Mega Aerodactyl is fast, but that doesn't stop Choice Scarf users from outspeeding it. Choice Scarf variants of Jirachi, Hydreigon, and Mienshao can all outspeed and revenge kill Aerodactyl after some prior damage.

**Stealth Rock**: Stealth Rock limits the amount of times Mega Aerodactyl can switch in. It helps that Swampert and Hippowdon, two of the most reliable Stealth Rock users in UU, also handle Aerodactyl well; Swampert can threaten Mega Aerodactyl with STAB Scald, and Hippowdon can either hit a Roosting Mega Aerodactyl with Earthquake or put a timer on it with Toxic.
