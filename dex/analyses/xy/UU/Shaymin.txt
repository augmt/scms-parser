Overview
########

Shaymin is one of the most threatening specially offensive Pokemon in the tier. Its signature STAB attack Seed Flare sports a solid 40% chance to halve Special Defense, allowing it to potentially break through would-be checks and counters. Shaymin also has solid stats across the board, with good bulk and access to an important Speed tier at base 100. Its useful resistances to Ground- and Water-type attacks give it plenty of opportunities to switch in against the numerous bulky Pokemon in the tier. However, Seed Flare's low PP and accuracy can be its downfall, and when it doesn't get lucky with Special Defense drops, Shaymin's average base 100 Special Attack does not do it any favors.

Moves
========

Shaymin's signature attack Seed Flare is a powerful STAB move that can allow Shaymin to break past would-be switch-ins such as Florges and Umbreon with a little luck thanks to its amazing side effect. Earth Power provides useful coverage on many types that resist Seed Flare, especially Fire-types such as Entei. Alternatively, Dazzling Gleam can be used to surprise OHKO Hydreigon and Noivern as well as 2HKO offensive Salamence (it even has a chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock damage), but it leaves Shaymin very susceptible to bulky Steel-types. While Air Slash hits all Grass-types super effectively, it has very low Base Power, which makes Psychic the preferred option most of the times, as it provides coverage on Crobat as well as Roserade and Chesnaught. Synthesis heals Shaymin for 50% of its HP at will, although the low PP can be an issue. Rest may seem like a better option, as it heals Shaymin fully and pairs nicely with Natural Cure, but it relinquishes momentum, forcing Shaymin to hard switch out. Healing Wish can be hard to fit on a set but provides fantastic utility, fully recovering another Pokemon once Shaymin has done its job.

Set Details
========

The listed spread gives Shaymin as much Speed and power as possible. A Timid nature is needed to Speed tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon and outspeed the likes of Darmanitan and Entei. Life Orb is required to help Shaymin wallbreak, as it is rather weak without a boosting item, and the recoil can be offset thanks to its reliable recovery anyway.

Usage Tips
========

The many bulky Water- and Ground-types that populate the tier, such as Suicune and Hippowdon, respectively, give Shaymin plenty of opportunities to switch in and attack. Seed Flare's low PP and chance to miss can make it an easy move to exploit, so try not to spam it recklessly. However, be aware that going for the 40% chance of a Special Defense drop is often the best way to snowball past would-be checks such as Florges.

Team Options
========

Any Pokemon that appreciates the removal of bulky Water- and Ground-types makes for a good offensive partner to Shaymin; in particular, Darmanitan can bring in Shaymin safely with U-turn, and Krookodile can Pursuit trap problematic Pokemon such as Bronzong and to an extent Crobat. Life Orb Shaymin struggles to get past extremely specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey, so it should be partnered with Pokemon that can either lure and beat them, such as Life Orb mixed Infernape and Hydreigon, or set up on them, such as Cresselia. In addition, Life Orb Shaymin makes really good use of entry hazard support, as it can force a lot of switches with its great coverage and Seed Flare's secondary effect. Stealth Rock in particular hurts most of Shaymin's offensive checks, and Shaymin pairs well with the setters in the tier, most of which appreciate the removal of bulky Water-types in return. Also, as Shaymin dislikes bulky Steel-types, Pokemon such as Entei and Chandelure are useful for removing them.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Seed Flare
move 2: Dazzling Gleam / Earth Power
move 3: Psychic / Air Slash
move 4: Healing Wish / Energy Ball
ability: Natural Cure
item: Choice Specs
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Shaymin's main STAB attack, Seed Flare, becomes very scary with the power of Choice Specs backing it up, and decently bulky Pokemon that resist Grass such as Hydreigon, Rotom-H, and Mega Pidgeot fall into 2HKO range (even Hydreigon gets 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage). Earth Power hits most Pokemon that resist Grass-type attacks super effectively, but it is a much more risky move when Shaymin is locked into it, as it can give away easy setup opportunities. Dazzling Gleam hits Hydreigon, Kyurem, Salamence, and Noivern super effectively. Air Slash hits Grass-types super effectively, but Psychic OHKOes Crobat with Stealth Rock on the field, as well as hitting both Roserade and Chesnaught hard, making it the superior option. Healing Wish is a fantastic support move that Shaymin actually has room for on a Choiced set, giving it the opportunity to fully heal another Pokemon once it has done its job. While Healing Wish is one of the main selling points of this set, Energy Ball is a safe, reliable STAB move with no PP issue that Shaymin can make good use of as well, should your team not require Healing Wish support.

Set Details
========

The listed spread gives Shaymin as much Speed and power as possible. Although it might be tempting to run a Modest nature on a Choice Specs set, Shaymin outspeeding Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Darmanitan is usually more important than the increase in damage output that still doesn't allow it to threaten the likes of Blissey. Choice Specs Shaymin packs a hefty punch but is essentially locked out of its great coverage options, exacerbating Seed Flare's PP issue.

Usage Tips
========

Because of its lack of a recovery move, Choice Specs Shaymin can be worn down very quickly by Scald burns or simply switching into resisted moves. As a result, prediction is key when using this set, especially if entry hazards are on your side of the field, as Shaymin only gets so many chances to come in and wallbreak. Shaymin's coverage moves, while useful, are also rather weak and easy to take advantage of, so they should be used with caution. Don't hesitate to make full use of Healing Wish, as Shaymin's decent bulk will only carry it so far anyway without recovery.

Team Options
========

Choice Specs Shaymin is best used on very offensive teams, which appreciate its high damage output and can put to good use the utility of Healing Wish and in return usually provide the entry hazards Shaymin requires to OHKO some Pokemon such as Crobat or Entei. Threatening setup sweepers that synergize well with Shaymin such as Haxorus and Calm Mind variants of Suicune can do their own wallbreaking with Healing Wish support. Because Choice items lock the user into a move, having a decent switch-in to common Shaymin answers such as Crobat is required should you predict wrong. Pokemon that can handle bulky Steel-types, such as Entei and Darmanitan, are helpful too.

Leech Seed
########
name: Leech Seed
move 1: Leech Seed
move 2: Seed Flare
move 3: Psychic / Air Slash
move 4: Substitute / Protect
ability: Natural Cure
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Leech Seed allows Shaymin to wear down special walls such as Blissey and Florges while also keeping it healthy. Seed Flare is Shaymin's most powerful STAB move and is very threatening once Shaymin is behind a Substitute, although it should be noted that the drop in power due to Leftovers is very noticeable. The choice between Air Slash and Psychic is complicated by the fact that while Air Slash provides insurance against the Grass-types that are unaffected by Leech Seed, Crobat is an even more important target because it can hit through Substitutes. However, some Grass-types, namely Roserade and Chesnaught, are hit super effectively by Psychic as well. Substitute can be used to ease predictions and protect Shaymin from status while allowing Shaymin to stall out Pokemon with Leech Seed. Protect is a decent alternative that doesn't cut Shaymin's health. It should be noted that Earth Power can also be used as the coverage move of choice, as it is much more suited to deal with the offensive checks to this set, namely Fire-types.

Set Details
========

Leftovers is used to let Shaymin get enough residual healing alongside Leech Seed to be able to continuously make Substitutes as well as have more longevity in general. The use of an offensive spread is required to keep the benefits of Shaymin's important Speed tier as well as to make up for its average base 100 Special Attack. Going for a more bulky spread is possible but not recommended, as Shaymin then lacks any offensive presence against offensive teams; moreover, 101 HP Substitutes are unneeded when the only common user of Seismic Toss in the tier is Blissey.

Usage Tips
========

Using Leech Seed as often as possible is key for this set, as keeping Shaymin healthy is a priority and it will wear down the opponent's team . Once it has Leech Seed a Pokemon, Shaymin can repeatedly use Substitute to wear it down without losing any health or wear it down more quickly with Seed Flare. Against more offensive teams, using Substitute while forcing out a Pokemon can make Shaymin extremely hard to deal with as long as it can get a little luck when using Seed Flare.

Team Options
========

This particular Shaymin set forces a lot of switches and as a result works best with entry hazard support. Many Stealth Rock setters such as Krookodile, Gligar, and Mega Aerodactyl benefit in return from the removal of bulky Water-types. A special mention is given to Toxic Spikes, as they add to the residual damage of Leech Seed. In particular, Nidoqueen has decent synergy with Shaymin and thrives when special walls are worn down.

Other Options
########

A Choice Scarf set with Healing Wish can be used, especially because Shaymin is faster than Hydreigon, but without a boosting item Shaymin isn't very strong and Seed Flare should not be used as a revenge killing tool due to its bad accuracy. A physical set consisting of Swords Dance / Seed Bomb / Return / Synthesis with Life Orb can be used to surprise Shaymin's traditional counters, as Blissey, Goodra, and specially defensive Celebi are all 2HKOed by +2 Return, but it is very matchup-reliant and overall not as reliable as Shaymin's other sets. Shaymin has access to Tailwind, which it could run on a set as an alternative to Healing Wish. Hidden Power Fire can be a useful coverage option should you want a lure for Forretress and Escavalier. A defensive Aromatherapy set is an interesting option to support the team, but lack of other supporting options makes it a lesser choice.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dedicated Special Walls**: Blissey isn't fazed by any of Shaymin's attacking moves unless Shaymin gets two Special Defense drops, at which point it has a chance to be 2HKOed. However, it has to be wary of the Leech Seed set, which can stall it out, and must be played with caution around the Choice Specs set. Goodra is a special case, as its ability Sap Sipper makes it immune to Seed Flare and Leech Seed and due to its great special bulk it takes a pittance from Shaymin's coverage moves.

**Bulky Grass-types**: Specially defensive Roserade and Amoonguss take little damage from any of Shaymin's moves besides Psychic and Air Slash. Also, both Roserade and Amoonguss threaten it directly with STAB Sludge Bomb.

**Bulky Steel-types**: Specially defensive Forretress and Bronzong are either only 4HKOed by or immune to Earth Power, Shaymin's only coverage on Steel-types besides the rare Hidden Power Fire, but have no recovery of their own and can only threaten back Synthesis Shaymin with the combination of Gyro Ball and Toxic, or simply by setting up entry hazards.

**Flying-types**: Faster Flying-types such as Mega Pidgeot, Crobat, and Salamence make for good checks to Shaymin, as they can Roost off damage or force Shaymin out with their powerful STAB moves. However, Crobat and Salamence cannot switch into Psychic and Dazzling Gleam, respectively.

**Fire-types**: Most Fire-types either faster than Shaymin or unaffected by Earth Power, such as Infernape, Rotom-H, Choice Scarf Chandelure, and Choice Scarf Darmanitan, can switch into Shaymin with caution or simply revenge kill it, but they will be worn down quickly by Stealth Rock.
