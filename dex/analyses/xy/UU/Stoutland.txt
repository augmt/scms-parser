Overview
########

Stoutland is one of the best sand sweepers in the UU tier thanks to its ability Sand Rush, which gives it blistering Speed under a sandstorm. Combine this with its excellent base 110 Attack, great coverage options, and a powerful STAB Return, and you have an amazing revenge killer and late-game cleaner. It also has surprisingly good bulk, enabling it to take a hit or two if it needs to. Unfortunately, Stoutland is entirely dependent on the sand, which if absent leaves it outsped by most threats. Nonetheless, Stoutland can make a great addition to any team given the right support, and is definitely a threat to be reckoned with.

Dog Rush
########
name: Dog Rush
move 1: Return
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Fire Fang
move 4: Superpower / Pursuit / Wild Charge
ability: Sand Rush
item: Choice Band / Life Orb
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

Moves
========

Stoutland's STAB Return is very powerful and hits a large portion of the metagame for heavy damage. Crunch hits Ghost-types that are immune to Return, as well as being super effective against Metagross and Jirachi. Fire Fang is useful to hit Forretress, which otherwise walls Stoutland, while also hitting other Steel-types. In the fourth moveslot, Stoutland can run Superpower to hit Steel-, Dark-, and Rock-types, but be wary of the stat drops that occur. Pursuit can be quite handy to successfully revenge kill Victini after a V-create, along with other Psychic- and Ghost-types that feel threatened by Stoutland's presence. Wild Charge is also a nice choice to hit bulky Water-types like Mega Blastoise and Milotic harder than its other coverage moves.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread enables Stoutland to outspeed everything up to Choice Scarf Mienshao while it's in the sand, as well as maximizing its offensive potential. An Adamant nature is used to give Stoutland a bit more power; while a Jolly nature can be used, the extra Speed is usually unnecessary unless Choice Scarf Infernape is feared. Sand Rush doubles Stoutland's Speed in the sand. Choice Band is the preferred item as it lets Stoutland break through walls like Suicune after some prior damage, but Life Orb can be used if switching moves is preferable at the cost of some power.

Usage Tips
========

Stoutland is not very effective outside of the sand, so it should only be used on sand teams. Use it as a revenge killer that can also clean up late-game with Return. Stoutland shouldn't be taking too many hits, but it can come in on a neutral hit once or twice.

Team Options
========

Hippowdon is a must for Stoutland because it is the only Pokemon in UU with the ability Sand Stream. A Will-O-Wisp absorber like Infernape is useful to take on Pokemon such as Sableye that threaten to burn Stoutland with Will-O-Wisp. It fits better on more offensively oriented teams so it can take advantage of its role as a revenge killer. Pokemon like Rhyperior and Gastrodon fit well because they are immune to the sand that Hippowdon summons. Choice Band Stoutland appreciates bulkier teammates such as Florges, as they can take on Fighting-type Pokemon amongst others.

Other Options
########

Play Rough can be used to hit Sableye and Fighting-types such as Machamp, but it is usually a mediocre coverage option otherwise. A bulky Intimidate set may seem like an interesting option, but Stoutland lacks the support moves to effectively pull this off and is outclassed by other Pokemon in this role. A boosting set with Howl can be used, but it is unwise to waste turns boosting when the duration of sand is limited. Retaliate can make Stoutland a pure revenge killer, but deals pathetic damage if an ally didn't faint the previous turn and it keeps Stoutland confined to one role. Silk Scarf is an nice option to bluff a Choice Band and power up Return and Retaliate, but Stoutland's coverage moves will then deal an underwhelming amount of damage.

Checks & Counters
########

**Hippowdon**: Physically defensive Hippowdon can take any attack from Stoutland and stall it out with Slack Off, Toxic, and Earthquake.

**Mega Aggron**: Mega Aggron takes a pitiful amount of damage from even Superpower and can retaliate with Thunder Wave or Heavy Slam.

**Sableye**: Sableye can take a Crunch or Wild Charge from Stoutland and burn it with a priority Will-O-Wisp.

**Infernape**: Infernape is the only relevant Choice Scarf user that can outspeed and OHKO Adamant Stoutland in the sand.

**Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types**: If Stoutland is running Choice Band, Steel-, Rock-, and Ghost-types such as Jirachi, Rhyperior, and Chandelure stop it from abusing Return; however, they can be hit super effectively on a predicted switch-in.

**Priority**: Powerful priority from Pokemon such as Entei, Honchkrow, and Infernape can deal considerable damage to Stoutland, especially the latter as it can hit Stoutland with a super effective Mach Punch. Special sets from Infernape and Lucario can also hit Stoutland with Vacuum Wave.

**Opposing Weather**: Opposing weather can make Stoutland's role much more difficult. Abomasnow is the only Pokemon in UU that can summon a different weather immediately, but other Pokemon like Sunny Day Houndoom can manually change the weather and reduce Stoutland's effectiveness.
