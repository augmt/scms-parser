Overview
########

Galvantula is an interesting Pokemon. It has a unique Bug / Electric typing, can abuse a 91% accurate Thunder with its ability Compound Eyes, and is the fastest Sticky Web user in the entire game. It also possesses a decent base 97 Special Attack, as well as two great STAB moves in the form of Bug Buzz and Thunder. It also hits all Defoggers and Magic Bouncers for super effective damage, which makes it very hard to remove Sticky Web. However, it is not without its flaws. It is very frail, with bad 70/60/60 defenses, and faces competition from Shuckle, which also has access to Sticky Web as well as Stealth Rock and Sturdy, meaning it can pretty much guarantee an entry hazard set up. Nevertheless, Galvantula stands out as an offensive Sticky Web setter.

Moves
========

Sticky Web provides the amazing utility of slowing down grounded opponents that switch in, and it is the most important move on the set. Thunder is a powerful STAB that has 91% accuracy with Compound Eyes as well as a 30% paralysis chance. Bug Buzz is a secondary STAB move that hits most targets which resist Thunder. Thunder Wave is a good option to use in the fourth slot as it can cripple Pokemon immune to Sticky Web or those which are fast enough to ignore the Speed drop, as well as Pokemon that use Speed-boosting moves, such as Cloyster. Energy Ball is also another option that hits Swampert and Ground-types in general super effectively. Volt Switch can also be used to do some damage and pivot out.

Set Details
========

252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature maximizes Galvantula's Speed, allowing it to almost always outspeed opposing leads. 252 Special Attack EVs are used to allow Galvantula to hit hard with STAB Thunder and Bug Buzz. The 4 Special Defense EVs give Porygon2 and Porygon-Z an Attack boost from Download. A Focus Sash is necessary to guarantee setting up Sticky Web. Compound Eyes is needed to boost Galvantula's Thunder accuracy to 91%.

Usage Tips
========

Unless Galvantula is facing a Prankster Taunt user, or if it can OHKO the opposing lead, Sticky Web is always the best move to be used first. Thunder, Bug Buzz, and (if applicable) Energy Ball should all be used to cause damage after Sticky Web has been set up. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple opposing threats, while Volt Switch should be used to build momentum and pivot out.

Team Options
========

Pokemon with relatively average Speed such as Porygon-Z or Kyurem can opt to not run a Choice Scarf and benefit from Sticky Web's Speed drop on the opposing team. The best Pokemon to benefit from this are Nidoking, Choice Band Flygon, Honchkrow, and non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Ghost-types are also great teammates as they can block Rapid Spin.

Other Options
########

Galvantula doesn't have an expansive movepool. Choice Specs is an option as it can hit very hard with STAB Thunder and Bug Buzz, and it can still set up Sticky Web and switch out afterwards. Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ice are also viable options for more coverage, but they are relatively weak. Life Orb can be used to switch moves and still have increased power, but Galvantula relies on Focus Sash to set up Sticky Web. Giga Drain can be used instead of Energy Ball, but without STAB it won't do enough damage to OHKO Swampert. Lastly, Sucker Punch can be used for a form of priority.

Checks & Counters
########

**Taunt** Prankster Taunt users, such as Whimsicott and Sableye, shut down Galvantula's only niche. Azelf also naturally outspeeds with Taunt, but hates taking a Bug Buzz.

**Entry Hazard Removal** If Galvantula isn't switched in, Defoggers such as Empoleon and Aerodactyl basically make it dead weight on a team, so they are a huge threat to it.

**Choice Scarf Users** Choice Scarf Darmanitan or Flygon can 2HKO Galvantula quickly. Most Choice Scarf users can also threaten with a STAB move, as Galvantula is very frail.

**Multi-hit moves** Multi-hit moves from Pokemon such as Cloyster can potentially OHKO Galvantula after it sets up Sticky Web, which prevents it from attacking after setting up the entry hazard.
