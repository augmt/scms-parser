Overview
########

Weezing is a defensive behemoth with a great defensive typing that includes five resistances, as well as an immunity to Ground-type moves, Spikes, and Sticky Web thanks to Levitate. It is a great stop to many physical attackers and almost every Fighting-type in the tier, especially Mienshao. Furthermore, Weezing has access to a fair support movepool that includes moves such as Pain Split, Will-O-Wisp, Toxic Spikes, and Clear Smog.

Sadly, it isn't all great for Weezing. Weezing has an extremely poor Speed stat, which means that it will be outsped by most opposing Pokemon. Weezing also has an abysmal Special Defense stat, making it easy to force out with strong special attackers. To make matters worse, Weezing has no reliable recovery, making support from other teammates a necessity. Even with all of these downfalls, Weezing is definitely a defensive force to be reckoned with and should be considered when looking for a wall.

Defensive Wall
########
name: Defensive Wall
move 1: Will-O-Wisp
move 2: Pain Split
move 3: Sludge Bomb / Fire Blast
move 4: Toxic Spikes / Fire Blast
ability: Levitate
item: Black Sludge
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA

Moves
========

Due to Weezing's defensive nature, Will-O-Wisp is necessary for dealing residual damage and crippling most physical attackers with a burn. If used right, Pain Split can restore modest amounts of health while chipping away at opposing Pokemon. Sludge Bomb is Weezing's best STAB move and has a helpful 30% chance of poisoning its targets. Fire Blast is a great way to catch Steel-types on the switch-in and also deals a nice chunk of damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it. Toxic Spikes is a great choice for Weezing, as it is usually able to find the time to set them up and is a great way of rendering cleric support useless most of the time.

Set Details
========

Full investment in HP and Defense with a Bold nature maximizes Weezing's bulk and allows it to take a lot of hits from most physical attackers in the tier. The 4 extra EVs are put into Special Attack to dish out more damage with Sludge Bomb and Fire Blast. Black Sludge is the preferred item on Weezing, but with Knock Off spam prevalent in the tier, Rocky Helmet is another viable option to get a bit more damage off before Weezing loses its item.

Usage Tips
========

Even though walling Mienshao is the biggest reasons for using Weezing, it still walls a variety of physical attackers, so try to send Weezing out against Pokemon like Flygon and Mega Aggron and watch it do its work. Use Pain Split whenever Weezing's HP gets low. Weezing should use Will-O-Wisp whenever it gets the chance to, but it needs to keep an eye out for Pokemon that benefit from a burn such as Guts Machamp and Flash Fire Houndoom. Try to predict Steel-type switch-ins and nail them with Fire Blast, as it deals a marvelous amount of damage, having a chance of 2HKOing the likes of Metagross and Jirachi after Stealth Rock damage. Sludge Bomb's 30% chance to poison is very useful, especially on Pokemon that are immune to Will-O-Wisp or Fire Blast. If the opponent has a grounded Poison-type, don't bother setting up Toxic Spikes.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can take special attacks for Weezing are much-appreciated. Wish support can help Weezing last much longer than it would without it and is almost necessary. Florges, Umbreon, and Vaporeon are good examples of Wish passers. Setup sweepers and special walls benefit from having their counters crippled by Will-O-Wisp. Teams that have trouble with Fighting-types can almost always find a spot for Weezing. Stall teams and stall Pokemon in general enjoy Toxic Spikes support in order to get as much residual damage as possible. Pokemon that can counter Rapid Spin users and Defog users such as Sableye and Milotic fit with Weezing well as they discourage them from getting rid of Weezing's Toxic Spikes. Umbreon and Weezing make a wonderful defensive core as they cover each others' weaknesses perfectly. Umbreon can tank the special attacks that Weezing can't while providing the Wish support that Weezing needs.

Other Options
########

Weezing has some nice options like Explosion to hurt special walls that would come in on it, but sacrificing your wall to get damage off on a Pokemon usually isn't the best choice. Weezing has a very diverse supportive movepool that can be utilized well. Memento can provide a teammate with a setup opportunity, but losing your wall is not always beneficial and is quite a risky option. Haze can be used on Pokemon that might try to set up on Weezing after getting burned. Clear Smog works just like Haze except that it can't be Taunted. However, it doesn't affect Steel-types and doesn't hit through Substitutes. Toxic and Protect can be used to Toxic stall opposing Pokemon, but is generally outclassed and Weezing lacks reliable recovery, which is needed to use this strategy well. Taunt is a decent option on Weezing, but considering how slow it is, it usually won't be able to use Taunt effectively. A ChestoRest set can be used instead of Pain Split, but Weezing loses out on much-needed Black Sludge recovery and inevitably loses in long turn battles. A Stockpile set is an interesting option, but is mediocre at best due to its lack of reliable recovery. A RestTalk set is a decent option on Weezing as it allows it to deal with offensive Roserade and works well with cleric support.

Checks and Counters
########

**Psychic-types**: Weezing's only weakness is to Psychic-type moves, so most Psychic-type Pokemon can severely dent or outright OHKO Weezing. Azelf, Jirachi, and Metagross can launch powerful STAB Psychic-type moves and can take a Fire Blast or two.

**Special Attackers**: Due to Weezing's almost non-existent Special Defense stat, most special attackers can dish out huge amounts of damage on it and easily force Weezing out. Examples include Chandelure, Nidoking, Porygon-Z, and Empoleon.

**Powerful Wallbreakers**: Even with Weezing's defensive capabilities, extremely strong wallbreakers such as Life Orb Darmanitan and Choice Band Victini can break through Weezing's defenses with their strong STAB moves.

**Taunt Users**: Pokemon with Taunt can render Weezing useless and force it to switch out. Mega Aerodactyl, Azelf, and Crobat can easily do this with nothing to fear.

**Spinners and Defog Users**: Popular spinners and Defog users can easily threaten Weezing by removing Toxic Spikes and hitting back hard. Mega Blastoise can spin away Toxic Spikes and proceed to hit Weezing with a powerful Water Pulse. Empoleon can remove Toxic Spikes with Defog and threaten to OHKO Weezing with a STAB Hydro Pump.
