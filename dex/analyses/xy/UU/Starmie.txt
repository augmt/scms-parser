Overview
########
Starmie boasts an excellent Speed stat that outpaces the majority of the UU metagame, which when backed by a fantastic movepool and a decent Special Attack stat, makes Starmie very hard to safely switch into. These qualities allow Starmie to fulfill its primary job as a reliable spinner, as well as a plethora of roles such as an offensive wallbreaker, revenge killer, and defensive supporter; this is augmented by helpful abilities in Analytic and Natural Cure.

However, while Starmie can certainly dish out plenty of damage, it struggles to cope with much in return, even when its bulk is invested in. Its secondary Psychic typing leaves it weak to common Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, particularly the ubiquitous Knock Off. In addition, its weakness to U-turn and Volt Switch can allow the opponent to gain momentum with common faster Pokemon or Choice Scarf users such as Victini. While Starmie is indeed powerful, the UU tier is littered with extremely bulky Pokemon such as Blissey and Umbreon that make it less effective. Moreover, Starmie cannot cover all the threats it would like to with only four moves. Nevertheless, Starmie is a stellar offensive Rapid Spinner that will rarely disappoint.

Offensive Rapid Spin
###########
name: Offensive Rapid Spin
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Psyshock / Thunderbolt
move 3: Ice Beam / Signal Beam
move 4: Rapid Spin
ability: Analytic / Natural Cure
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
An Analytic-boosted Hydro Pump is tremendously powerful, making it the STAB move of choice, particularly when keeping Starmie's wallbreaking role in mind. Psyshock provides a secondary STAB attack that deals with Fighting-types such as Toxicroak and Machamp, and targets specially bulky Pokemon that can stomach a Hydro Pump, notably Florges and Roserade; however Thunderbolt is handy to strike bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Mega Blastoise super effectively. Grass- and Dragon-types are hit hardest by Ice Beam; Trevenant, Hydreigon, and Celebi are important targets. However, Signal Beam offers a useful way to hit Slowking, Celebi, and Hydreigon, and should be used in tandem with Psyshock if chosen. In the fourth slot, Rapid Spin is imperative to remove all entry hazards and support hazard-weak teammates. If desired, Recover could be used over a coverage move, but Starmie rarely finds a chance to use it.

Set Details
========
The EV spread is quite standard, emphasizing power and Speed. A Timid nature is vital in order to outrun Mienshao, and Speed tie with Mega Houndoom, Raikou, and Azelf. Analytic is preferred to provide greater wallbreaking power by taking advantage of the many switches Starmie forces, though Natural Cure is handy to cure status, especially paralysis, and allow Starmie to act as a status sponge in a pinch. The choice between Life Orb and Leftovers is a case of power versus longevity. Life Orb works exceptionally well with Analytic, though Leftovers lets Starmie avoid being worn down too quickly.

Usage Tips
========
This Starmie set can fulfill several roles if needed. Its main job is to keep hazards off its side of the field while maintaining a strong offensive presence. As such, using Rapid Spin whenever necessary is generally ideal, but sometimes it is best to simply pound away at the opponent's team with Analytic-boosted attacks during the early stages of a game, especially if Starmie is healthy enough to come back in later to get off a spin, or the opponent has a healthy spinblocker. Remember that Starmie's great Speed makes it a handy revenge killer; exploit this as much as possible, but avoid letting Starmie be worn down too much if it still needs to spin away hazards. In a similar vein, Starmie should be preserved as much as is prudent if the opposing entry hazard setter is still healthy, lest its efforts be in vain.

Team Options
========
Generally, Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards such as Darmanitan, Victini, and Honchkrow are good choices for teammates as Starmie can remove Stealth Rock and break down opposing walls. Fire-types in general work well, as they're weak to Stealth Rock and can smash bulky Grass-types, while Starmie can punish the likes of Rhyperior and Swampert. Mega Aerodactyl is similarly effective. Abomasnow has nice type synergy with Starmie, taking Electric- and Grass-type moves, while Starmie can take Fire- and Fighting-type moves in return. Late game sweepers such as Choice Scarf Krookodile appreciate Starmie's wallbreaking potential, as well as the removal of Sticky Web.

Choice Specs
##########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Hydro Pump / Scald
move 2: Psyshock / Thunderbolt
move 3: Trick
move 4: Ice Beam / Rapid Spin
ability: Analytic
item: Choice Specs
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
With Choice Specs and Analytic, Hydro Pump is insanely strong, severely denting anything that doesn't resist it or isn't a dedicated special wall. Scald is also quite strong, trading in sheer power for accuracy and a nice burn chance. Fighting-types are hit hardest by STAB Psyshock, while Water-types such as Suicune are smacked by Thunderbolt. Trick is a handy tool that can cripple an opposing Pokemon, especially defensive ones. Ice Beam hits Dragon- and Grass-types that resist Starmie's Water-type moves, notably Hydreigon and Trevenant, while Rapid Spin can be useful on occasions when clearing hazards is more important than damage.

Set Details
========
The combination of Choice Specs and Analytic is the perfect recipe for a potent wallbreaker. This set uses very straightforward EVs, maximizing damage output and Speed. While a Modest nature may seem tempting to patch up Starmie's mediocre Special Attack, Timid is the better nature, as quite a lot of Pokemon sit at the base 115 Speed stat, such as Azelf and Mega Houndoom, so Starmie needs to, at the worst, Speed tie with them.

Usage Tips
========
There are less complexities involved with this set compared to other variants of Starmie. Simply use Starmie's great coverage and power to blast open the opposing team. As with any Choiced Pokemon, choose the move carefully to avoid being fodder, for example being locked into Hydro Pump against a Toxicroak, or Psyshock if the opponent has a Dark-type Pursuit user. Likewise, Trick should also be used carefully. Generally, it is best to use it if Starmie is low on HP or has already broken down opposing Pokemon, though a well-timed Trick early in the game can sometimes prove even more dangerous, crippling the likes of Blissey and Umbreon.

Team Options
========
Pokemon that appreciate walls being broken down or crippled are excellent teammates. Toxicroak loves Starmie's ability to smash bulky Ground-types. Similarly, Victini can threaten Blissey and specially defensive Jirachi, two Pokemon that easily handle Starmie. Fighting-types such as Mienshao are also great choices, as they can defeat common Dark-types. Rotom-H and Mega Ampharos can often bring Starmie safely into battle with Volt Switch; they also have excellent type synergy, resisting Grass- and Electric-type moves.

Bulky Rapid Spin
#########
name: Bulky Rapid Spin
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Scald
move 3: Psyshock / Ice Beam / Thunderbolt
move 4: Recover
ability: Natural Cure
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Rapid Spin is the most important move on this set, removing troublesome entry hazards. Scald is similarly crucial as it is a must-have for any defensive Water-type for its ability to inflict a burn on opposing Pokemon. Psyshock provides a solid STAB option that punishes Fighting-types and targets specially defensive Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Florges. Dragon- and Grass-types are handled by Ice Beam; Trevenant and Hydreigon are particularly relevant targets, while Thunderbolt is Starmie's best option against bulky Water-types such as Mega Blastoise. Recover helps Starmie hang around as long as possible in order to consistently spin away entry hazards throughout the match.

Set Details
========
This Starmie set focuses on durability, so HP investment and Leftovers are used. Speed is still extremely important in such a fast-paced metagame, however, making maximum investment and a Timid nature necessary. Natural Cure is ideal, allowing Starmie to shrug off problematic status and act as a status sponge for the team.

Usage Tips
========
Clearing entry hazards is the name of the game for this set; everything else is secondary. As such, it is imperative to keep Starmie healthy for as long as the opposing entry hazard setter is alive. The slight addition in bulk afforded by the HP investment means that Starmie can be switched into some resisted attacks, though strong neutral or super effective moves should be avoided as Starmie is still not overly bulky. Bear in mind that without any Special Attack investment this set is woefully weak, so burns from Scald are Starmie's best bet at wearing down the opposing team, with coverage moves used only when necessary. Similarly, Starmie's lack of offensive pressure makes it far easier to block its Rapid Spin with a spinblocker, so focus on wearing down Ghost-types first.

Team Options
========
Balanced or defensively-inclined teams are the ideal environment for this set. As a general rule, any Pokemon weak to some form of entry hazards make for good teammates. Fire-types such as Arcanine and Victini appreciate the removal of Stealth Rock and roast Grass-types which trouble Starmie. Ferroseed or Abomasnow can complete this Fire / Water / Grass core very effectively, handling Grass- and Electric-type attacks. Spinblockers can be troublesome for this set, so Dark-types work nicely as partners. Mega Absol is particularly good, as once it has Mega Evolved it can form a decent anti-hazard core. Opposing Dark-types can be threatened by Fighting-type teammates, making the likes of Chesnaught and Scrafty solid choices.

Choice Scarf
#########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam / Dazzling Gleam
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Trick
ability: Analytic
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Choice Scarf Starmie is quite weak, so Hydro Pump is nearly always a better option over Scald or Surf, despite the reliability of the latter two. Ice Beam covers Grass- and Dragon-types such as Roserade and Noivern that seek to switch in on a resisted Water-type attack, and Dazzling Gleam also targets these Dragon-types, though it is more for revenge killing all variants of Hydreigon, a common threat. Thunderbolt rounds out the coverage moves, threatening Water-types such as Mega Blastoise and Empoleon. In the final moveslot, Trick is a handy move that cripples defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Florges. While not listed, Psyshock is viable as a secondary STAB attack, though being locked into a relatively weak Psychic-type move can often be unwise. Rapid Spin could also potentially be useful to speedily clear away entry hazards in a pinch.

Set Details
========
The EV spread is very standard for a Choice Scarf user, with Speed and Special Attack emphasized. Analytic is the preferred ability to take advantage of the switches that Starmie forces.

Usage Tips
========
This set is first and foremost a revenge killer which uses Starmie's high Speed to defeat common Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and Krookodile, as well as naturally faster threats, namely Mega Aerodactyl, Crobat, and Noivern. Trick is a great tool but must be used carefully lest Starmie waste its item. Trick shouldn't be used if your opponent has one of the aforementioned threats unless your team has them covered. Defensive Pokemon such as Florges are perfect targets to cripple with Trick. As is the case with any Choiced Pokemon, be cautious of locking Starmie into a potentially ineffectual move and offering up a free setup opportunity to the opponent. In the latter stages of a match, this set can occasionally become a decent win condition, cleaning up the opposing team with the appropriate move.

Team Options
========
This set doesn't have too many particularly important partners, as it slots in well on a wide variety of teams. Slower wallbreakers and sweepers such as Nidoking and Honchkrow appreciate Starmie's ability to take out faster threats, while Starmie can exploit the holes punched by these Pokemon. Bulky pivots are good choices as they can switch in after Starmie has revenge killed a Pokemon and has been subsequently forced out. Rotom-H and Mega Ampharos are nice examples as they can take Electric- and Grass-type moves with relative ease. Fighting- and Fairy-types such as Mienshao and Florges threaten Dark-types that seek to trap Starmie with Pursuit, or transcend its Speed with Sucker Punch.

Other Options
########
Starmie's expansive movepool contains several curious options. A dual screens set is usable, but it is almost always a waste of Starmie's offensive potential. Thunder Wave is an excellent utility move, though Starmie struggles enough as it is to find room for all its coverage moves. Starmie can also turn the tables on its counters through Reflect Type, though again it is hard to find room for it. Gravity is another unusual move that can allow Starmie to fire off much more powerful coverage moves such as Blizzard and Thunder. A Modest nature may look attractive to boost Starmie's often lacking Special Attack, but the base 115 Speed tier is far too crowded for Starmie to afford giving it up.

Checks & Counters
########
**Special Walls**: Dedicated special walls such as Blissey are the best answers for Starmie, avoiding the 2HKO from Life Orb Analytic variants and healing off the damage. Snorlax and the extremely bulky Porygon2 also fall into this category. Umbreon takes a pittance from anything Starmie can throw at it and strikes back with Foul Play. Goodra's massive special bulk allows it to shrug off even a super effective Ice Beam and deal heavy damage in return with its Dragon-type STAB attacks. Florges can take any special hit, though it is considerably dented by Psyshock. All of these Pokemon have to be wary of Trick, though.

**Bulky Water-types**: Suicune, Empoleon, and Milotic are not 2HKOed by a Life Orb Thunderbolt, though they must be wary of Choice Specs variants. Mega Blastoise can easily KO Starmie in a 1v1 situation, or if it manages to switch in on a Water-type move, but it takes heavy damage from Thunderbolt. Gastrodon is immune to Water-type moves and can stomach and Ice Beam or Psyshock fairly comfortably.

**Bulky Grass-types**: Celebi stands out as a decent check, fearing only an Analytic Choice Specs Ice Beam. Ferroseed works even more effectively, easily taking any single attack and retaliating with super effective Grass-type attacks.

**Faster Pokemon**: Naturally faster threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Crobat, and Noivern can revenge kill Starmie, as well as common Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Honchkrow and Victini. However, all of these Pokemon are beaten by Choice Scarf variants.

**Bulky Spinblockers**: While the likes of Jellicent, Sableye, and Trevenant cannot strictly counter Starmie, as they are 2HKOed by the appropriate move, they can stop Starmie from removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin, forcing it and potentially its teammates to take more entry hazard damage.

**Priority**: Due to Starmie's poor defensive typing and lackluster defensive stats, it can be picked off by strong priority attacks, particularly Sucker Punch. Absol and Honchkrow are good examples, with Toxicroak and Cacturne being especially effective as they are immune to Starmie's Water-type STAB moves.
