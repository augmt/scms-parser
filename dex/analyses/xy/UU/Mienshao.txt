Overview
########

Mienshao has been a staple of the UnderUsed metagame since its creation and is the best Fighting-type Pokemon in the tier. The reasons for this are Mienshao's combination of high Attack and Speed, great offensive movepool, and two fantastic abilities in Regenerator and Reckless. The latter makes High Jump Kick, its main STAB attack, the strongest Fighting-type move in the tier, and this is also the reason why Mienshao is the most threatening Choice Scarf user in the current metagame. However, Mienshao is not by any means a flawless Pokemon. Its defensive stats are below average, greatly limiting the amount of times Mienshao is able to switch in. Also, High Jump Kick's recoil damage and imperfect accuracy means there's always a risk when you use it, and this does not go well with Mienshao's reliance on that move.


Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: High Jump Kick
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Stone Edge
ability: Reckless / Regenerator
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

High Jump Kick is Mienshao's main method of doing damage. When combined with Reckless, it is capable of OHKOing Pokemon such as offensive Flygon, Darmanitan, Haxorus, and Mega Aerodactyl most of the time. U-turn is used to gain momentum and does chip damage to Pokemon trying to stop Mienshao, especially Psychic-types such as Cresselia. Knock Off hits Ghost-type Pokemon for good damage, making them think twice before trying to switch into a predicted High Jump Kick, and additionally, it cripples Pokemon that rely on their items. Stone Edge is exclusively for Crobat, as it has a chance of OHKOing after Stealth Rock damage, which is important because Crobat is one of the most common switch-ins to Mienshao. Poison Jab can be used over Stone Edge to hit Fairy-types, but most of them avoid the 2HKO and getting locked into a Poison-type move puts Mienshao in a bad spot.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Mienshao's Speed and power. The 4 Special Defense EVs prevent Pokemon with Download from getting a Special Attack boost. A Jolly nature is needed to outspeed other Choice Scarf users, such as Jirachi, Darmanitan, and Hydreigon. The preferred ability on this set is Reckless because it makes High Jump Kick significantly stronger, turning lots of 2HKOs into OHKOs. However, Regenerator allows Mienshao to use High Jump Kick without having to worry much about Ghost-types or misses, because it can just switch out to regain some health.

Usage Tips
========

Ghost-type Pokemon stop Mienshao from using High Jump Kick freely, so their mere presence on the opponent's team is threatening. For that reason, using Knock Off and U-turn early on is advised. Choice Scarf Mienshao is stronger than most Choice Scarf users, but it struggles to break through dedicated physical walls such as Hippowdon and Chesnaught, so it has to be used mainly as a revenge killer or as a late-game cleaner. Mienshao's subpar bulk really limits its ability to switch in directly into most Pokemon and it's threatened by anything it can't OHKO, so be aware of its limitations.

Team Options
========

Mienshao appreciates entry hazard support, because it helps wear down the opponent's team. Krookodile works well as a Stealth Rock setter because it traps Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon that threaten Mienshao. Roserade is great as a Spikes setter because it threatens Hippowdon and can use Water- and Fairy-types to set up. Strong special attackers, such as Choice Specs Chandelure and Life Orb Hydreigon, are good partners because they can deal with physical walls switching into Mienshao's U-turn. Strong Volt Switch users, such as Mega Ampharos and Choice Specs Rotom-H, are great teammates, as not only do they threaten physical walls, but they can also form a VoltTurn core with Mienshao. Lastly, Mienshao greatly appreciates Pursuit support to remove or wear down Ghost- and Psychic-types; the previously mentioned Krookodile, Mega Absol, and Mega Aerodactyl are examples of Pokemon that can do this.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: High Jump Kick
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Poison Jab / Stone Edge / Fake Out
ability: Regenerator / Reckless
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

High Jump Kick is Mienshao's strongest STAB move, and it allows this set to OHKO or 2HKO everything but the sturdiest physical walls or Pokemon that resist or are immune to Fighting-type moves. Knock Off gives Mienshao great neutral coverage and is Mienshao's strongest move against Ghost- and Psychic-types; it also cripples Pokemon that rely on their items. U-turn is great to keep momentum and hits Psychic-type Pokemon decently hard, especially Celebi. Poison Jab hits Fairy-type Pokemon, allowing Mienshao to OHKO Whimsicott, as well as 2HKO Florges and Aromatisse. Stone Edge hits Crobat, which otherwise completely walls this set. Fake Out is a usable priority move, but it's mostly used for free damage.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are used to take advantage of Mienshao's best stats. The 4 leftover EVs don't have much use, so they are dumped into Special Defense to not give a Special Attack boost to the uncommon Choice Scarf Download Porygon-Z. A Jolly nature is needed to outspeed threatening Pokemon such as Pidgeot before it Mega Evolves, Hydreigon, Shaymin, Haxorus, and Mega Glalie. This set needs Life Orb to boost Mienshao's power, and unlike a Choice Band, this item gives Mienshao the ability to fully take advantage of its movepool. Regenerator is the preferred ability because it makes using High Jump Kick less risky, helps with Life Orb recoil, and works amazingly well with U-turn. Reckless is an option because it allows Mienshao to 2HKO everything in the tier that doesn't resist its moves, including bulky physical walls such as Hippowdon and Suicune, but it makes Mienshao significantly easier to wear down and turns High Jump Kick into a high-risk move.

Usage Tips
========

Mienshao shouldn't mindlessly use High Jump Kick as long as there's a Ghost-type Pokemon on the opposite team, but it can play around most of them thanks to its Speed, coverage moves, and Regenerator. Without Reckless, Mienshao will struggle with breaking through healthy physically defensive walls, but they can be worn down with the combination of U-turn and Knock Off. Mienshao's poor bulk means it has problems directly switching into attacks, but with Regenerator it's possible to switch into relatively weak attacks to threaten the foe without being worn down too much.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support is recommended because it helps Mienshao wear down its counters and checks. Both Krookodile and Roserade can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes, respectively, and have good offensive synergy with Mienshao. Crobat gives this set issues, so using a Pokemon that deals with it, such as Mega Aerodactyl, is advised. Pokemon that can take advantage of Mienshao using U-turn against some of its counters are good partners, for example Shaymin and Chandelure. Volt Switch users, such as Mega Ampharos and Rotom-H, also work well with Mienshao's ability to gain momentum with U-turn. Mienshao's ability to wear down physical walls helps Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Haxorus and Mega Absol break through the opponent's team, making them great teammates.

SubPass
########
name: SubPass
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: High Jump Kick
move 4: Stone Edge / Knock Off / Swords Dance
ability: Regenerator
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Mienshao's ability to force switches and make the foe use Protect gives it plenty of chances to set up a Substitute. Mienshao's high Speed allows it to use Baton Pass to pass Substitutes to its teammates that can take advantage of them. High Jump Kick is its strongest STAB move and it allows this set to be more than just a support Pokemon. Stone Edge is for Crobat, which is the biggest threat to this set with its high Speed and Infiltrator. Knock Off allows Mienshao to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types for good damage and cripple Pokemon that rely on their item. Swords Dance can help Mienshao to either work as a wallbreaker or pass +2 Attack boosts to its teammates; however, due to its poor bulk it is very unlikely that Mienshao will be able to pass a boost and a Substitute at the same time.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Mienshao's Attack and Speed stats. The 4 Special Defense EVs are not important, but they stop Download users from getting a Special Attack boost. A Jolly nature is required to outspeed important threats such as Shaymin, Hydreigon, and Haxorus. Life Orb boosts Mienshao's power and helps it bluff a different set. Regenerator is the only ability that should be used with this set because without it, Mienshao would be worn down easily by Substitute and Life Orb damage.

Usage Tips
========

Surprise is key when using this set. Don't set up recklessly, and using Mienshao's attacking moves early on is advised, unless there's a clear chance to use Substitute. Some Pokemon, such as Umbreon and Blissey, rely on Protect to scout Mienshao, so use this in your favor. Using Baton Pass without setting up can be used to gain momentum or recover health with Regenerator.


Team Options
========

Crobat is this set's biggest problem, so Pokemon that can handle it consistently, such as Mega Ampharos and Mega Aerodactyl, are good teammates. Pokemon that can take advantage of Mienshao's most common switch-ins are a must; for example, Roserade and Chandelure deal with Fairy-type Pokemon, Mega Absol threatens Ghost- and Psychic-types, and Celebi and Shaymin help against Hippowdon and bulky Water-types.

Other Options
########

A set with Swords Dance and 3 attack moves can be used to make Mienshao a fearsome wallbreaker; however, setting up is quite difficult and it doesn't need a boost to threaten the foe. Jump Kick and Drain Punch are decent secondary STAB moves, which can be used to alleviate Mienshao's reliance on High Jump Kick. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge on any set, but it doesn't guarantee the OHKO against Crobat after Stealth Rock damage. Bulk Up and Calm Mind can be used on the Substitute set, but even with those moves it won't be able to set up and pass a Substitute without being forced out.

Choice Band can be used to allow Mienshao to 2HKO virtually the entire tier. However, that item does not go well with High Jump Kick's drawbacks.

Because Mienshao has a respectable base 95 Special Attack, it can pull off a usable mixed set with Hidden Power Ice to 2HKO Gligar, but this Pokemon is fairly uncommon in the UnderUsed tier.

Checks & Counters
########

**Physically Defensive Walls**: Mienshao struggles to 2HKO Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Chesnaught, and physically defensive Arcanine without Life Orb. However, if it is running that item, they can be beaten after some previous damage.

**Ghost-type Pokemon**: Ghost-type Pokemon are immune to High Jump Kick and their mere presence on the opposing team is a threat to Mienshao. Knock Off helps against most of them, but Spiritomb doesn't fear any move and Doublade is capable of surviving two Life Orb-boosted hits after Stealth Rock damage.

**Poison-type Pokemon**: Poison-types resist High Jump Kick and U-turn, while Knock Off does neutral damage to most of them. Defensive Nidoqueen isn't 3HKOed by any combination of Mienshao's moves. Crobat 4x resists Fighting and Bug, and it only fears Stone Edge.

**Fairy-type Pokemon**: Fairies resist Mienshao's STAB moves and U-turn, and they only fear Poison Jab. Granbull deserves a special mention because it is not 2HKOed by Poison Jab thanks to Intimidate.

**Faster Pokemon**: Mienshao's subpar bulk means that most Pokemon faster than it can easily revenge kill it.

**Protect and Spiky Shield**: Protect and Spiky Shield prevent Mienshao from using High Jump Kick. Life Orb sets can play around them with good predictions, but the Choice Scarf set completely loses momentum.
