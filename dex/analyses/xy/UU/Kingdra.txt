Overview
########

Back in Generation V, Kingdra was, as its name suggested, one of the kings of UU. Though Kingdra is not as strong as it was in B/W, it is still a powerful and versatile threat, as it has few weaknesses and the ability to double its Speed. Kingdra also received a couple of new toys such as the ability to produce a Sniper-boosted critical hit after one turn of setting up. This, when combined with the already existing Dragon Dance and rain sweeper sets makes Kingdra a very diverse Pokemon, and one that is difficult to counter. Unfortunately, Kingdra is far from perfect, as even at +1 Speed it is revenge killed by every other Choice Scarf Dragon-type in the tier, meaning setting up can be difficult. Also, because of the Fairy-type, Kingdra's Dragon STAB is not nearly as spammable as it was, and using Outrage is very risky. Nevertheless, Kingdra is still a powerful threat that can fill many different roles on a team.

Critdra
############
name: Critdra
move 1: Focus Energy
move 2: Draco Meteor
move 3: Waterfall / Hydro Pump
move 4: Agility
ability: Sniper
item: Scope Lens
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Rash

Moves
=========

Ever since XY changed the critical hit mechanics, this has been Kingdra's new flagship set. While it lacks the Speed and sweeping capabilities of Kingdra's rain and Dragon Dance sets, it more than makes up for this with its wallbreaking ability. The reason for this is Focus Energy, the key move of this set. The reason for this is because after Kingdra sets Focus Energy up, its critical hit percentage combined with Scope Lens produces a guaranteed critical hit on every attack. This boost, in combination with Sniper, makes Draco Meteor an absolutely devastating attack, easily 2HKOing the likes of Umbreon and specially defensive Forretress. Waterfall is the best choice for a secondary STAB, as it can hit Florges on its lower Physical Defense. The last move is Agility, as a Pokemon this powerful has no need for coverage moves. So, if you ever get two turns to set up, a Focus Energy with an Agility can lead to an easy sweep if your opponent lacks a special wall.

Set Details
=========

With the 1.5x boost it gives to critical hits, Sniper is the obvious choice for an ability here, as without it the set is much less functional and quite unviable. Alongside this boost, 252 EVs are put into Special Attack, to further boost the power of Draco Meteor. The rest are put into Speed, to Speed tie with neutral base 85s, such as opposing Critdra and Nidoking. And while a Naive nature would help with outrunning these threats, Rash is necessary, as that is what gives Draco Meteor and Waterfall that extra push that they need to finish off threats.

Usage Tips
=========

This Kingdra set places a lot of emphasis on proper prediction, because firing off a Draco Meteor into a Fairy-type and getting forced out is exactly what you don't want, as you just wasted two perfectly good turns. This is also true with Dragon-type resists, albeit less so because Kingdra 2HKOes most of them. Another thing you have to keep in mind when you use Critdra is that, even though you invested 252 EVs and a positive nature into Special Attack, Kingdra still only has a base 95 Special Attack, meaning that Draco Meteors that are not critical hits will do fairly middling damage. Also, before Agility, Kingdra's base Speed of 85 is outsped by many things, including every single Dragon-type in the tier.

Team Options
==========

Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi is an excellent partner for Kingdra, as it can come in and get a free Substitute on the Fairy-types that Kingdra lures in. Other Steel-types such as Cobalion or Metagross can come in for free, and attempt to threaten the remainder of the opponent's team. Entry hazards are also a big help for something such as Kingdra, giving it the extra help it needs to take down dedicated special walls such as Umbreon, Slowking, and Florges. Therefore, Forretress and Froslass are good as they not only cover the Fairy-type weakness but also have the ability to lay down Spikes (and Stealth Rock in Forretress's case).

Mixed Rain Sweeper
############
name: Mixed Rain Sweeper
move 1: Rain Dance
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Draco Meteor
move 4: Waterfall
ability: Swift Swim
item: Life Orb
evs: 60 Atk / 252 SpA / 196 Spe
nature: Mild

Moves
=========

This is the set that made Kingdra a top tier threat in Generations IV and V. The main move on this set is Rain Dance, which in combination with Swift Swim, doubles Kingdra's Speed. This means that one move turns Kingdra from a slightly slow attacker into an extremely threatening sweeper. In the rain, STAB Hydro Pumps absolutely tear foes apart, dealing immense damage even to dedicated walls. Draco Meteor is a good choice for secondary STAB, hitting Water-type resists with a strong 130 Base Power STAB attack. The last slot goes to Waterfall, which provides a 100% accurate rain-boosted STAB attack that hits special walls on the physical side.

Set Details
=========

The EVs are chosen to outpace Scarf Mienshao in rain, along with other base 105 Speed Choice Scarf users. The remainder are poured into Special Attack, with the leftovers put into Attack to boost the power of Waterfall. A Mild Nature is also chosen, because Kingdra has no need for more Speed and the special attacking side is more important than the physical side.

Usage Tips
=========

While setting up rain is usually Kingdra's first priority when running this set, preserving health is often very important, so taking out a weakened slower threat with an attacking move is usually preferable to setting up rain, because taking the hit in return is often worse, especially considering Kingdra has no Leftovers. You always have the choice to predict the opponent's switch and set up rain, but this can be dangerous. Also, when in rain, Hydro Pump is your most damaging attack, but also your least accurate, so Waterfall is recommended if the power is not needed.

Team Options
==========

Grass- and Electric-types are good partners, because this Kingdra's biggest threats are bulky Water-types which are specially defensive enough to take Draco Meteors. Therefore, strong threats that hit those for super effective damage, such as Shaymin, are effective teammates. Specially defensive Florges is lured in by Kingdra as well, giving things like Substitute + Swords Dance Cobalion a chance to come in and start setting up. Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi works just as well. Also, just like the last set, good team utility from entry hazards is very helpful, but even more so for a dedicated sweeper like this Kingdra. Team utility can also come in the form of rain setters, as this can save the turn of setting up.

Dragon Dance
############
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Outrage
move 4: Substitute / Iron Head
ability: Sniper
item: Leftovers / Lum Berry
evs: 24 HP / 252 Atk / 232 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
=========

Unlike the last two sets which were focused on hitting on the special side, this one is fully physical. The reason for this is Dragon Dance, a boosting move that not only buffs Kingdra's Speed, but also its physical attack. If a Dragon Dance is set up on the switch, Kingdra has the possibility to tear through the enemy team. STAB Waterfall after a Dragon Dance is a very powerful move, and it also has the added benefit of being able to flinch the opponent. Outrage is also a strong STAB move, with greater power at the cost of locking yourself in. The last move is a toss-up. Substitute is the most common choice, as it provides security and is a great move to use on a predicted switch. However, Iron Head is another very viable choice, as it 2HKOes Florges and also sports good 30% flinch odds.

Set Details
=========

Leftovers are generally the best item for this set, as they not only help recover health lost from Substitutes, but also give much more survivability in general. However, Lum Berry is also a good choice on the Dragon Dance + 3 Attacks set, as it gives Kingdra more setup opportunities and makes Outrage confusion less of a problem. Unless you are using a rain team, Sniper is given the nod over Swift Swim to boost the damage from potential critical hits. The EVs are chosen to maximize Attack, with an Adamant nature used to boost Attack further. Speed is boosted to the point where you can outspeed Base 108s at +1, with the remaining EVs dumped into HP.

Usage Tips
=========

Substitute, if you have it, is usually the best choice if you are predicting a switch, or if you donâ€™t think the opponent can break it, as it gives a free opportunity to setup without fear of critical hits, status, or super effective hits. Behind a Substitute, choosing whether or not to use Dragon Dance can be difficult. For example, if the opponent has a Choice Scarfed Hydreigon waiting in the wings, using Dragon Dance is pretty futile because you'll still be forced out or KOed. So, in a situation like this, 2 Waterfalls are better than Dragon Dance + Waterfall. Also, KOing something slower while behind a Substitute is preferable to letting your Substitute die for a Dragon Dance, as you can either set up or threaten the following switch-in while behind a Sub.

Team Options
==========

Just like most Kingdra sets, this benefits greatly from entry hazards, as it often lacks the power, even with STAB and a Dragon Dance boost, to break through bulky attackers or walls. Sticky Web is also a big asset, as this slows down grounded Scarfers to the point where they can be outsped at +1, which is a huge help if going for a sweep. Another helpful team option is to have something like Calm Mind Jirachi or Nasty Plot Celebi to set up on and threaten physical walls Dragon Dance Kingdra will certainly bait out, such as Tangrowth. Also, Steel-types are good defensive partners, as they resist Kingdra's Fairy- and Dragon-type weaknesses.

Other Options
############

A Choice Specs set can be quite a powerful cleaner, but it requires rain support to be at all effective. Rest with a Chesto Berry can be put on the Dragon Dance set, but this can be risky as you lose the safety provided by a Substitute or the coverage of Iron Head. An offensive Dragon Dance set with 3 Attacks and Life Orb is possible, and can hit much harder than the Substitute + Dragon Dance set at the cost of survivability. A completely special Rain Dance set is possible, but the extra coverage move is not worth being walled by specially bulky Pokemon such as Umbreon. Finally, a support set is possible, with Scald to cripple physical attackers. However, Kingdra's low base HP and defenses are problematic, even with investment.

Checks & Counters
#############

**Florges**: Florges is a full stop for many of Kingdra's sets, being able to survive any special hit or unboosted physical hit and OHKO back with Moonblast. The Dragon-type immunity also helps Florges heavily.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types such as Suicune can take hits and phaze out Kingdra, but Dragon-type STAB attacks can dent these walls.

**Dedicated Special Walls**: Specially based sets are shut down by Blissey, Umbreon, and Porygon2, as even Rain-boosted Hydro Pump cannot kill these Pokemon easily.

**Scarfed Dragons**: Choice Scarf Flygon and Hydreigon can also act as checks, as they outspeed all Kingdra sets under +2 Speed, so they can easily force out or KO Kingdra.
