Overview
########

Jolteon is the glass cannon that once roamed the tier above UU but has now made its home in the tier below it. Raikou's departure to OU failed to give Jolteon a chance to shine, as its frailty makes it unable to fill the gap Raikou left. Its amazing Speed stat, however, gives it a saving grace. It also has decent Special Attack, allowing it to function well as a special attacker within the tier. Unfortunately for Jolteon, the rise of Heliolisk gives it very stiff competition. Jolteon lacks the coverage moves Heliolisk thrives on as well as the Water-type immunity Heliolisk gains via Dry Skin, which Jolteon barely makes up for with its Electric-type immunity from Volt Absorb.

Moves
========

Volt Switch allows Jolteon to gain momentum by having switch initiative against the various special walls that tend to switch into Jolteon, while also gaining a STAB boost. Thunderbolt is used for a stronger STAB move that hits harder than Volt Switch and allows Jolteon to serve as a better Suicune check. Hidden Power Ice gives Jolteon near-perfect neutral coverage. Hidden Power Grass, on the other hand, allows Jolteon to hit Swampert, Seismitoad, and Rhyperior hard due to their quadruple weakness to Grass-type attacks. Shadow Ball gives Jolteon neutral coverage against Rotom-H as well as super effective coverage against Chandelure and Reuniclus, among others. Meanwhile, Signal Beam allows Jolteon to hit Dark-types for super effective damage as well as Grass-types harder than Hidden Power Ice does.

Set Details
========

Choice Specs maximizes Jolteon's Special Attack, making it a deadly late-game sweeper. A Life Orb doesn't give as big of a boost as Choice Specs does but allows Jolteon to switch up moves. The Speed and Special Attack EVs are maximized to ensure Jolteon has an easier time doing its job. A Timid nature is used to make full use of Jolteon's amazing Speed.

Usage Tips
========

Jolteon is best used as a late-game sweeper and revenge killer. It should be sent in against frail Pokemon that it outspeeds, such as Alakazam and Cloyster, and either KO them or gain momentum with Volt Switch. Jolteon should also try to prevent Volt Switch users from gaining momentum by switching into a predicted Volt Switch.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support is imperative to an effective Jolteon sweep, making entry hazard setters such as Nidoqueen and Roserade good partners. VoltTurn partners are highly appreciated for their ability to form VoltTurn cores with Jolteon; examples include Hydreigon and Cobalion, among others. Forretress gets a special mention for its ability to do both roles previously mentioned as good Jolteon partners. Sweepers and wallbreakers make amazing partners to each other. In light of this, wallbreakers such as Choice Band Darmanitan and Choice Specs Kyurem make great Jolteon teammates. Bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Mega Blastoise, make for good teammates as well, as they are able to take on a majority of the Ground-types that Jolteon struggles with.

Other Options
########

Jolteon could potentially run a decent Substitute + Petaya Berry set, but it is usually better off just going with the standard set holding a Life Orb. Jolteon has access to Baton Pass. Unfortunately, though, Jolteon's only notable boosting moves are Curse and Work Up, both of which aren't too good on Jolteon. Jolteon has access to a plethora of support moves ranging from Wish to Thunder Wave, but despite this, it is unable to successfully utilize a successful support set, as it's far too frail. Jolteon could also hold a Choice Scarf to make it the fastest user of the item in the tier, but then it loses out on the power boost from Life Orb or Choice Specs.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ground-types**: Ground-types can only be taken out depending on which Hidden Power Jolteon decides to use, and if Jolteon doesn't OHKO the Ground-type with said Hidden Power, Jolteon is OHKOed in return by a super effective STAB move. Hippowdon deserves a special mention for being able to take any Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power from Jolteon easily if it is running a specially defensive spread.

**Special Walls**: Special walls such as Blissey and Florges easily take anything Jolteon can throw at them and retaliate.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Pokemon that commonly hold a Choice Scarf, such as Mienshao and Hydreigon, easily outspeed Jolteon and OHKO with a STAB move.

**Priority**: Priority moves, such as Extreme Speed and Sucker Punch, easily KO Jolteon due to its low Defense stat.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types&mdash;Shaymin and Tangrowth to name a few&mdash;resist Jolteon's STAB moves and can usually take at least one Signal Beam or Hidden Power Ice and retaliate with a powerful Grass-type STAB move.
