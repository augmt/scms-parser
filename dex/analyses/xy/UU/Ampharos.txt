Overview
########

With the transition to XY, Ampharos got a very helpful new Mega Evolution. When it Mega Evolves, it turns into a great bulky wall and gains a secondary Dragon typing to compliment its Electric STAB. Mega Ampharos is also one of the best counters to Electric-types in the whole tier. It has an amazing base 165 Special Attack stat along with respectable 90 / 105 / 110 bulk. It can run a variety of sets, including offensive or defensive, and can learn Heal Bell, allowing it to support the team as well. However, Ampharos does have some faults. When it Mega-Evolves, it gains three new weaknesses to Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-types. Also, it has no reliable recovery outside of Rest, which definitely shortens its lifespan on the field. Lastly, it is extremely slow with base 45 Speed. However, this can be looked over, as it allows Mega Ampharos to utilize very slow Volt Switches, which makes it easier to pivot out into a favorable matchup. Overall, Mega Ampharos is an amazing Pokemon if used correctly, and is a great tank that can fit well into any team.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Dragon Pulse
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Volt Switch / Heal Bell
ability: Static 
item: Ampharosite
evs: 132 HP / 252 SpA / 124 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Thunderbolt is Mega Ampharos's main STAB move. Dragon Pulse is Mega Ampharos's secondary STAB move and hits Electric- and Ground-types that resist Thunderbolt. Focus Blast provides necessary coverage against Steel-, Rock-, Normal-, and Dark-types. Because Mega Ampharos is extremely slow, Volt Switch can be used to do damage and pivot out into a favorable matchup. Heal Bell can also be used instead of Volt Switch for the utility of getting rid of status conditions for the team.

Set Details
========

132 EVs in HP give Mega Ampharos some bulk to take most neutral and resisted attacks. 252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximize Mega Ampharos's Special Attack, making Mega Ampharos hit like a truck. 124 Speed EVs allow Mega Ampharos to outspeed base 60s, which would otherwise be a big problem for Mega Ampharos, especially Swampert. Static is the preferred ability before Mega Evolving, as you can switch Ampharos into a Electric-, Water-, Fire-, Grass-, Steel-, or Flying-type contact attack and have a high chance to paralyze the opponent. After Mega Evolving, Ampharos's ability will always be Mold Breaker.

Usage Tips
========

It is best to use Volt Switch is when there is a predicted switch on the opposing side, so Ampharos can do some damage and switch out into a Pokemon that counters the opposing one. Because Mega Ampharos is also ridiculously slow, Volt Switch can be used after the opponent attacks to pivot out into a more favorable matchup. Volt Switch is also very useful early-to-mid-game, allowing Mega Ampharos to switch out into a good counter or check against opposing leads. Volt Switch also brings out frail sweepers unscathed, who can then proceed to sweep or break down the opposing team. If Heal Bell is preferred over Volt Switch, it is better used on a predicted switch if your team has status ailments. Mega Ampharos is a great pivot early- or mid-game, but isn't as amazing late-game due to its low Speed. It is best to switch into resisted attacks in order to preserve Mega Ampharos's health as much as possible.

Team Options
========

Most Trick Room setters work wonders with this set, as with 0 Speed IVs, Mega Ampharos is slow enough "outspeed" most Pokemon under Trick Room. Slowking is a great Trick Room setter, as it resists Ice and can take special Dragon hits. Tailwind users can work, too. Wish passers such as Umbreon and Florges make great teammates, as Ampharos does not have any reliable recovery. U-turn users such as Mienshao make great teammates, as they form a VoltTurn core. Jirachi and Mega Ampharos make a solid core, as Jirachi can heal Mega Ampharos with Wish while Mega Ampharos relieves status for its teammates.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Volt Switch
move 4: Dragon Pulse
ability: Static 
item: Ampharosite
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpA
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Rest and Sleep Talk work hand-in-hand, providing Ampharos with somewhat reliable recovery to take on big threats. Mega Ampharos will usually be slower than the opponent, so Volt Switch can be used to pivot out into a favorable matchup. Dragon Pulse covers Electric- and Ground-types and generally hits very hard. Heal Bell can replace Dragon Pulse in the last slot, as it provides the utility of getting status conditions off the team. However, forgoing Dragon Pulse leaves Ampharos open to Electric- and Ground-types.

Set Details
========

Full investment in HP and Defense with a Bold nature allows Mega Ampharos to tank physical hits well while minimizing entry hazard damage. Static is the preferred ability before Mega Evolving due to the fact that it grants Mega Ampharos a chance to paralyze the foe when switching into any resisted physical attack. This is changed when it Mega Evolves, as the Ability is then changed to Mold Breaker. A specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 252 SpD / 8 SpA is viable to tank special attacks better, but Ampharos already has good Special Defense without investment, and forgoing Defense investment leaves Ampharos prone to physical attackers.

Usage Tips
========

Volt Switch and Dragon Pulse should be the only two moves used until Mega Ampharos needs to heal up with Rest. Rest should be used when Mega Ampharos's health is low or if it has been inflicted with a status condition. This makes this set a great counter to Electric-types. One good thing about this set is that  Ampharos can pivot into a sleep inducer to absorb the sleep and benefit from it by using Sleep Talk. Lastly, this set counters Fire-types and puts significant pressure on Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon.

Team Options
========

Suicune works great with this set, as it can tank almost any hit that might threaten Mega Ampharos. Pokemon such as specially defensive Slowking, Florges, and Umbreon also fill this role. Mega Ampharos is a complete stop to Honchkrow, so Pokemon that enjoy Honchkrow being removed from play make great partners, including Slowking, Starmie, and Toxicroak.

Agility
########
name: Agility
move 1: Agility
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Dragon Pulse
move 4: Focus Blast
ability: Static
item: Ampharosite
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Agility doubles Mega Ampharos's Speed in one turn, allowing Mega Ampharos to take down Pokemon it couldn't normally outspeed. Thunderbolt and Dragon Pulse are the main STAB moves, and Focus Blast provides key coverage against a lot of Pokemon.

Set Details
========

252 Speed EVs maximize Mega Ampharos's Speed in order to start sweeping after a boost. 252 Special Attack EVs along with a Modest nature maximizes Mega Ampharos's Special Attack to bestow upon Ampharos the power necessary in order to sweep. Static is the preferred ability before Mega Evolving as it allows Ampharos to switch into a resisted physical attack and have a good chance to paralyze the opponent. The ability when Mega-Evolved will always be Mold Breaker.

Usage Tips
========

This set should be used first and foremost as a late-game sweeper. Thunderbolt should always be used unless it is resisted or another one of the three attacks can hit super effectively. It is best to use Agility on a predicted switch, as this allows Ampharos to begin sweeping without having taken any damage.

Team Options
========

Vaporeon makes a great partner, as it can take any special attack like a tank and can take the Ice-type moves that trouble Mega Ampharos. Vaporeon is also a good Wish passer for Mega Ampharos. In return, Mega Ampharos can take Grass- and Electric-type moves for Vaporeon. Florges can fulfill the same role as Vaporeon and has good defensive synergy with Mega Ampharos, as it can take Dragon-type moves for Mega Ampharos, and in return, Mega Ampharos can take Steel-type attacks aimed at Florges. Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Mienshao and Victini are greatly appreciated, as they get rid of pesky walls, giving Mega Ampharos an easier time sweeping. Mixed Victini can also work, as it gets rid of Florges with V-create and Swampert with Grass Knot.

Other Options
########

Mega Ampharos can use lesser-looked-at moves such as Signal Beam and Power Gem, but Mega Ampharos has better coverage with the All-Out Attacker set. Cotton Guard can be used on a stall set to boost Defense by 3 stages, but it is not recommended due to Mega Ampharos's tendency to switch often, and it takes up a precious moveslot. Mega Ampharos can also make use of either Thunder Wave or Toxic to spread status ailments.

Checks & Counters
########

**Status** Mega Ampharos relies heavily on its bulk to stay on the field, so a Toxic or a burn will put a timer on Mega Ampharos's longevity, and it can only get rid of this by risking a moveslot for either Rest or Heal Bell.

**Special Walls** Snorlax can wall Mega Ampharos even if it packs Focus Blast due to its high special bulk and HP, and can retaliate with Earthquake. Most special walls that aren't weak to Ampharos's STAB moves or have reliable recovery such as Celebi, Hippowdon, Florges, and Umbreon are a huge pain for Mega Ampharos.

**Faster Physical Attackers** If Mega Ampharos isn't running a physically defensive set, most physical attackers can greatly hurt or OHKO Mega Ampharos, such as Infernape, Flygon, and Mienshao.

**Super Effective STAB Moves** Pokemon such as Nidoking, Kyurem, Hydreigon, and Krookodile that wield super effective STAB moves can outspeed and OHKO or severely dent Mega Ampharos.
