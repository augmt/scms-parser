Overview
########

Not even a drop to RU can deter Zoroark from doing what it does best, causing mischief and tricking its opponents with its signature ability, Illusion. Illusion allows Zoroark to masquerade as teammates available in the party until it's directly damaged, which causes Zoroark to be revealed. This gives Zoroark a great niche for psyching opponents out and hit-and-run attacks. In addition to its ability, Zoroark comes with amazing Attack, Special Attack, and Speed. Zoroark's access to Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, as well as a fairly large variety of moves, give it another layer of unpredictability as opponents will be questioning whether it is a physical, special, or even mixed attacker. However, even with the access to several boosting moves, Zoroark is overshadowed by Mega Absol, which’s a physical attacker, and Mega Houndoom, which’s a special attacker. Zoroark also suffers from its low defenses which cause it to be hard to preserve in battle. Although Illusion can disguise Zoroark as its teammate, it can still be easily identified if entry hazards are set. The residual damage causes opponents to notice the difference in HP between Zoroark and the Pokemon it copies. This also makes it harder for Zoroark to remain effective mid- and late-game as its disguises can be figured out. Poor planning will result in Zoroark getting KOed as well. Zoroark also struggles against three common weaknesses; Bug-, Fighting-, and Fairy-types should all be avoided.

Mixed Attacker
########
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Knock Off
move 2: Flamethrower
move 3: Grass Knot
move 4: Sucker Punch
ability: Illusion
item: Life Orb
evs: 196 Atk / 96 SpA / 216 Spe
nature: Naive

Moves
========

With investment in both Attack and Special Attack, Zoroark can utilize Knock Off for great damage against opponents as well as getting rid of Choice items, Berries, and Assault Vests. Flamethrower gives Zoroark coverage against Bug- and Steel-types such as Forretress and Aggron. Grass Knot can OHKO Mega Blastoise, Swampert, and 2HKO Suicune. Lastly, Sucker Punch is Zoroark's priority move which allows it to take out weaker Pokemon and also outspeed faster opponents.

Set Details
========

With a spread of 196 Atk / 96 SpA / 216 Spe, it is easy for Zoroark to KO specially defensive Swampert or Rhyperior with a simple Grass Knot. A Hasty nature maximizes Zoroark's Speed. Furthermore, Life Orb allows Zoroark to dish out more damage against foes but at the cost of some recoil.

Usage Tips
========

Zoroark works best as a hit-and-run mixed attacker. It can work well as a revenge killer or can come in on a weakened Pokemon and finish it off with a Sucker Punch. It's best to have Zoroark disguised as teammates that can use Flamethrower and Knock Off, as this ensures that Zoroark can trick its opponents with Illusion. It's recommended that you plan ahead and organize teammates during the team preview according to what you want to masquerade Zoroark as. Determining what Pokemon goes first and what Pokemon goes last makes a difference in the battle to trick opponents.

Team Options
========

Synergy is needed for Zoroark to be disguised well. Use moves that other teammates would use, such as disguising as a Fire-type such as Infernape that could use Fire Blast. Its also good to have Fighting-type teammates such as Mienshao and Infernape to be disguised as, because if the opponent attempts to attack them with Psychic-type moves, Zoroark can easily switch in for free. Having bulky teammates to take hits such as Florges are great to help Zoroark's longevity. Spinners are also necessary partners for Zoroark to prevent entry hazard damage. Mega Blastoise is a great partner for spinning away hazards, as are Forretress and Donphan.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Dark Pulse / Night Daze
move 2: Focus Blast
move 3: Flamethrower
move 4: Trick
item: Choice Specs
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Dark Pulse gives Zoroark great neutral coverage and a 20% chance to flinch opponents, making it useful to prevent opponents from getting possible hits. It's also a great move to use while disguised as a Pokemon such as Lucario or Mega Blastoise. Alternatively, Night Daze can be used over Dark Pulse, sacrificing 5% accuracy for more power and a 40% chance to lower the opponent's accuracy. Bear in mind that while Night Daze is stronger, it is Zoroark's signature move, which might cause opponents to see through Illusion. Flamethrower gives Zoroark coverage against Bug- and Steel-types, taking Aggron and Forretress out quickly. Focus Blast is for coverage against Dark- and Steel-types such as Aggron and Houndoom. Additionally, Trick can be used to cripple walls such as Blissey and free Zoroark of its Choice Specs

Set Details
========

Zoroark's Speed and Special Attack are boosted to allow it to revenge kill weaker opponents. A Timid nature boosts Zoroark's Speed to edge out any Choice Scarf users or fast Pokemon. Choice Specs allows Zoroark to demolish its competition with strong special attacks. U-turn can be considered in case Zoroark is dealing with bulky opponents such as Blissey or Florges that completely wall it. In addition to U-turn, Grass Knot can also be used to OHKO Rhyperior, Swampert, and deal significant damage to Mega Blastoise and Suicune.

Usage Tips
========

Zoroark can lead well, but might be harder to use later if it's damaged, giving away Illusion. Later, you can Trick the Choice Specs off to mess opponents up if you want Zoroark to utilize all its moves. It's best to not have Zoroark switch in on an attack as this will most likely KO it or damage it, severely ruining its deception. In regards to Trick, it is usually best used on an entry hazard setter or a sweeper as it leaves them stuck with one move. Tricking a Pokemon that is setting up will usually mess the opponent up. Make sure to plan ahead of time and lay out the team for Zoroark to determine which team members it becomes.

Team Options
========

Special walls such as Florges can tank hits and protect Zoroark from Fairy- and Fighting-types. Spinners such as Donphan and Forretress are also necessary to remove any entry hazards to prevent Zoroark from being exposed. Blastoise is a great team member for Zoroark because of its spinning capabilities and strong defenses. It's also best to have different Pokemon to masquerade as, having a variety of teammates allows Zoroark to blend in well. Zoroark can pretend to be an Infernape, as both of them can use Focus Blast. If the opponent switches, you can predict what they will use to counter the Illusion with another move. Chandelure is also a great partner to have; both Zoroark and it can use Flamethrower. Chandelure's typing means opponents will not likely use Fighting-type attacks against a Zoroark disguised as it.

Other Options
########

Zoroark can work as an anti-lead as well because of its access to Memento, Counter, and a Focus Sash. Zoroark can take a hit with Counter, and hang on with its Focus Sash. After this, Zoroark can either use Sucker Punch or go straight for Memento, which leaves the opponents Pokemon as set up bait. Zoroark can also Taunt entry hazard setters or Taunt users themselves, allowing Zoroark's team to set up. Zoroark can also use Choice Band for a physical set. Choice Band lets Zoroark hit like a truck, allowing it to break walls. In addition, Zoroark can also run a Choice Scarf to outspeed faster opponents such as Mienshao, Infernape, and Cobalion. Alternatively, it can also run Swords Dance as a physical sweeper with Knock Off, Return, Low Kick, and Sucker Punch. This Zoroark can take out special walls such as Blissey and can also take out other Pokemon with frail defenses as well however this set is outclassed by Mega Absol, so its worth taking into account. Zoroark can also run Nasty Plot, with Flamethrower, Focus Blast, and Dark Pulse as a special set up sweeper as well. However as with the Swords Dance set, it is also overshadowed by Mega Houndoom which is faster and has stronger stats with a Nasty Plot boost.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Florges and Aromatisse are deadly against Zoroark. Florges can essentially wall Zoroark, and Zoroark can't harm Florges because of Florges's resistance to Dark-type moves and its great bulk. Aromatisse can wall Zoroark to a lesser extent.

**Priority Moves**: Priority is Zoroark's worst nightmare, as getting hit causes Illusion to fail. Mach Punch, Bullet Punch, and Sucker Punch should all be avoided; Mach Punch is even more dangerous and should be avoided at all costs. Hitmonlee and Infernape can 2HKO a physically defensive Zoroark with Mach Punch.

**Bulky Pokemon**: Blastoise can take Zoroark on, thanks to its bulk. Blissey is also a huge problem because of its resilient Special Defense. Because Zoroark is a faster paced Pokemon, it has a hard time dealing with slower, bulkier opponents that can Toxic stall.

**Fighting-types**: Cobalion and Choice Scarf Mienshao have no problem taking out Zoroark as they outspeed it. Infernape can also take Zoroark out with relative ease. Machamp can tank a hit from Zoroark and OHKO with Dynamic Punch.

**Entry Hazards **: Entry hazards such as Stealth Rock will cause opponents to catch onto Illusion, as a Zoroark disguised as a Flying-type won't take double damage like it's supposed to. Forretress is a great entry hazard user, and Donphan can work as well. Toxic Spikes can give away a Zoroark completely; Illusion can't always trick people the way it's supposed to, so paying attention to the battle can give away Zoroark.
