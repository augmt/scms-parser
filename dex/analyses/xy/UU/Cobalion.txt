 Overview
########

Much like a Swiss Army knife, Cobalion is very diverse, being able run a variety of possible movesets to accomplish a number of different roles, ranging from a setup sweeper to a mixed attacker to an offensive supporter with access to Stealth Rock. Being a Steel / Fighting type, it is able to beat special walls like Blissey, Umbreon, and Florges one-on-one with its STAB moves alone, providing great support for teammates that need them removed. With a reliable Steel-type STAB move in Iron Head, Cobalion is among the few Fighting-types able to reliably deal with Fairy-types such as Granbull, Florges, and Aromatisse, while its typing also renders it one of the few Steel-types that still resists Dark-type moves, making it a solid offensive check to threats such as Hydreigon and Honchkrow. This is in tandem with its ability, Justified, which gives it a free +1 Attack boost when hit with a Dark-type move. With a great base 108 Speed stat, it outpaces the majority of the metagame, tying with Infernape, Galvantula, and Virizion. This, coupled with resistances to common priority moves such as Sucker Punch, Extreme Speed, and Bullet Punch, makes it harder to revenge kill by priority users such as Toxicroak, Lucario, and Machamp.

Of course, as every Pokemon has its own shortcomings, Cobalion has to deal with average base 90 offenses in both Attack and Special Attack; while this can allow it to function as a mixed attacker, it will fail to do respectable damage overall without any boosts. Despite its great base 129 Defense, which allows it to take even some super effective physical hits, its base 72 Special Defense leaves it susceptible to most special attacks, and it is hampered by extremely common weaknesses to Fire-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves. In spite of these notable flaws, however, its versatility, complemented by its great Speed stat, can make Cobalion a worthwhile pick to be considered for your team.



Utility
########
name: Utility
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Volt Switch / Taunt / Magnet Rise
move 3: Close Combat
move 4: Iron Head
ability: Justified
item: Leftovers / Expert Belt
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Naive

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is the focus of this set, enabling Cobalion to support its team by being one of the fastest offensive users of the move. Volt Switch can be used to gain momentum while dealing respectable damage to Pokemon such as Alomomola and Suicune, while Taunt allows Cobalion to prevent opposing Pokemon from using their own hazards or status moves. Magnet Rise allows Cobalion to hinder Pokemon that rely on Ground-type moves to beat it, such as Donphan, Nidoqueen, and Hippowdon, allowing it to stay in against them safely. Close Combat is Cobalion's strongest STAB move and its primary source of damage. Iron Head is Cobalion's secondary STAB move, which gains decent neutral coverage, allowing it to take out Fairy-types like Florges and Aromatisse. Toxic or Thunder Wave can also be used in the second moveslot as a way to spread status and further annoy the opponent, as most defensive checks hate being poisoned, while faster offensive checks hate paralysis. Sacred Sword can be used as an alternative to Close Combat if you find the stat drops to be unappealing, though it is drastically weak in comparison. Stone Edge can also be used in the second moveslot for more coverage, most notably hitting Chandelure super effectively, as well as Flying-types that resist Close Combat.

Set Details
========

The EVs and nature maximize Attack and Speed, allowing this set to play as a fast support Pokemon, being able to get its own entry hazards up and gain momentum or keep the opponent from getting theirs up. On top of this, it still maintains offensive presence, as it is able to deal serious damage to Pokemon such as Honchkrow, Florges, and Mienshao. However, unlike other fast offensive hazard setters, such as Azelf and Infernapem which are often used as suicide leads, Cobalion is able to still support its team later in a match, re-setting Stealth Rock if needed. Leftovers gives useful passive recovery to Cobalion, while Expert Belt allows it to deal extra damage to targets weak to its moves. Life Orb is also a viable choice to add as much power as possible, especially if running Volt Switch or Stone Edge, though the recoil slowly wears Cobalion down. If Volt Switch is chosen, a Naive nature can be used to maintain its decent Special Attack stat while still maximizing Speed. If offensive presence isn't an absolute must, a spread of 248 HP / 28 Atk / 232 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used to still outrun Mienshao while maximizing bulk, with the remaining EVs being placed into Attack.

Usage Tips
========

Since this set's main job is to be a fast Stealth Rock setter, using the move early will help your team greatly. Cobalion's great Speed and offensive presence also allow it to function decently as a cleaner late-game, if the opponent's team has been weakened enough. For faster Stealth Rock leads that Cobalion can't outspeed and use Taunt on, such as Azelf and Aerodactyl, it's best to use Volt Switch and bring in the appropriate check to these Pokemon, as Cobalion can take a hit even if they should attack. Most Pokemon susceptible to Taunt are slower than Cobalion, so take advantage of this. However, don't use the move on Pokemon Cobalion can't beat one-on-one, such as Hippowdon, unless you can accurately predict them to use a status move. If Volt Switch is being run, Cobalion will play more as a hit-and-run attacker, getting its team an advantage by using Volt Switch to get its teammates in after setting up Stealth Rock. Justified gives Cobalion a free Attack boost when hit by a Dark-type move, allowing Cobalion to punish the opponent for using common moves such as Knock Off, Dark Pulse, and Sucker Punch. Unless it's absolutely needed, try not to use Close Combat if Cobalion is likely to take a hit afterward; the stat drops ensure it's likely to lose a large chunk of HP if attacked, possibly being KOed afterward.

Team Options
========

Most special sweepers, such as Raikou, Porygon-Z, Vivillon, Hydreigon, and Shaymin appreciate special walls such as Blissey, Umbreon, and Florges dealt with, so they pair well with Cobalion, as it not only deals with these Pokemon, but it sets up Stealth Rock to help them sweep. Offensive Pokemon such as Honchkrow, Victini, Nasty Plot Azelf, Mega Houndoom, and Cloyster all benefit from the Stealth Rock support Cobalion offers, and can deal with Pokemon that give Cobalion trouble, such as Suicune and Chandelure. Pokemon that cover Cobalion's weaknesses, such as Alomomola, Cresselia, Suicune, Flygon, and Hydreigon, sync well with it. Since it can check Honchkrow and Hydreigon handily, Pokemon that have issues with them, such as Swampert and Chandelure, also work with Cobalion.


Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Close Combat
move 3: Iron Head
move 4: Stone Edge / Substitute / Magnet Rise
ability: Justified
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance allows Cobalion to boost its average Attack stat to incredibly high levels, in hopes of getting a sweep. Close Combat and Iron Head are necessary, being its STAB moves and attaining respectable neutral coverage overall. Stone Edge rounds out its coverage by hitting the few things that resist its STAB moves, such as Tentacruel, Victini, and Chandelure. Substitute, however, can be used to allow Cobalion to dodge status and possibly gain extra setup turns, becoming even harder to revenge kill. Zen Headbutt can be used to deal more damage to Poison-types such as Tentacruel, Nidoqueen, and Toxicroak. Magnet Rise can be used to let Cobalion set up on Pokemon that rely on Ground-type moves to hit it, such as Flygon, Hippowdon, Donphan, Krookodile, Metagross, Escavalier, and Gligar. Lastly, Rock Polish can be used in the third or fourth moveslots to form a double boosting set that becomes incredibly hard to revenge kill once set up.

Set Details
========

This set is very straightforward; Cobalion can set up Swords Dance and attempt to sweep. Though it isn't a wallbreaker itself, it is still strong enough that it can put dents in the opponent's team where needed throughout the match, mainly against frail offensive Pokemon. Attack and Speed are maximized, as with a Jolly nature, it can outrun the majority of the tier. Lum Berry is preferred to allow Cobalion it to set up safely one time against status moves. Life Orb, however, gives Cobalion the extra power needed to muscle through teams after a Swords Dance. If power is still needed and Life Orb recoil is a worry, Expert Belt can be used instead, as it goes nicely with Cobalion's excellent coverage. Salac Berry can be used in conjunction with Substitute, in a similar vein to Rock Polish, as this allows Cobalion to become a deadly game-finishing sweeper once it sets up. Leftovers can also be used on a set with Substitute, extending its longevity with passive recovery and allowing the move to be used more times.

Usage Tips
========

Despite its great base 108 Speed, Choice Scarf users need to be identified and eliminated before attempting to sweep, as they can revenge kill Cobalion in a pinch, averting any possible sweep in the process. Cobalion's typing offers it a few setup opportunities, particularly against Choice-locked or slower Pokemon using Dark-type moves, as this gives it a free boost from Justified. This set is best used late-game when going for a sweep, as Cobalion doesn't have the raw power to bowl through teams before setting up. Even walls that are 2HKOed at +2 can still pose a problem for Cobalion if they haven't been weakened enough. Even though Lum Berry acts as a one-time insurance against status moves, be sure that Cobalion is able to take out the opposing Pokemon after a boost, because otherwise you will have wasted an entire turn, Cobalion's item, and possibly Cobalion itself by hopelessly trying to set up.

Team Options
========

Since this set is aiming to sweep, partners that can support it by removing its checks and applying entry hazards make good partners. Roserade, Chesnaught, Cacturne, Shaymin, Raikou, and Mega Ampharos can easily deal with bulky Water-types for Cobalion, while the former three can also lay Spikes to wear down the opponent's team. Dark-types such as Mega Absol, Hydreigon, and Mega Houndoom can deal with Ghost- and Psychic-types that give Cobalion trouble sweeping, such as Cofagrigus, Sableye, Victini, and Cresselia. Wallbreakers such as mixed Life Orb Metagross, Victini, and Choice Band Krookodile can weaken defensive Pokemon to help Cobalion sweep. Even though Cobalion may be a designated sweeper for your team, special sweepers such as Raikou, Mega Houndoom, and Porygon-Z appreciate Cobalion's ability to easily remove Blissey, Umbreon, and Florges for them, while Dragon Dance Haxorus and Kingdra appreciate Fairy-types removed. Sticky Web support from Galvantula allows Cobalion to deal with grounded Pokemon that would outspeed it, such as Mega Houndoom, Raikou, and Starmie, as well as Choice Scarf users such as Darmanitan, Infernape, and Mienshao, plowing through them uninterrupted after setting up a Swords Dance.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Focus Blast
move 3: Flash Cannon
move 4: Hidden Power Ghost / Substitute
ability: Justified
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Calm Mind allows Cobalion to boost its Special Attack and Special Defense stats. After a boost, Cobalion can catch a number of Pokemon off-guard, as it is typically expected to be using a physical set. The boost also patches up its weaker Special Defense, making it a bit more durable on both sides, considering its great Defense stat. Focus Blast is Cobalion's strongest special Fighting-type STAB move, able to inflict serious damage after a boost. Its shaky accuracy can be undesirable, but it is a necessity for this set to have. Flash Cannon allows Cobalion to gain decent neutral coverage when paired with Focus Blast, and is essential in allowing it to break through Florges; however, a few boosts will be needed to do so due to Florges's vast special bulk. Hidden Power Ghost is the preferred option for the last moveslot, since with it, Cobalion can break through Pokemon that resist both its STAB moves, such as Victini, Chandelure, and Jellicent. Substitute, however, can be used to avoid status from the Pokemon it sets up on. After a few boosts from Calm Mind, Cobalion's Substitutes will be able to stand against weaker special attacks, such as Tentacruel's Scald.

Set Details
========

Special Attack and Speed are maximized to make the most out of Cobalion's stats offensively, allowing it to outpace the majority of the metagame. Life Orb is preferred as it allows Cobalion to sweep more easily, as it needs all the power it can get. However, Leftovers is still beneficial for longevity, since Cobalion can be worn down while setting up, especially if it chooses to run Substitute. Unlike Swords Dance, Calm Mind usually requires a few more turns of setup before going for a sweep, so the passive recovery may come in handy. If you want extra power without taking extra damage from Life Orb's recoil, Expert Belt is a viable choice, going well in tandem with Cobalion's coverage. Hidden Power Ghost also benefits from Life Orb or Expert Belt, as both boost its low Base Power.

Usage Tips
========

The surprise factor this set brings plays a big role in its success, since Cobalion is often presumed to be running a physical set. Revealing its moves too early will compromise the surprise factor, making it easier for the opponent to prepare for. Due to its reliance on multiple turns of setup, Cobalion won't be in an absolute position to sweep until later on in a match. This set is best executed when setting up against specially-based defensive Pokemon that typically expect to check Cobalion, such as Cofagrigus, Jellicent, Alomomola, and Tentacruel, since they have a harder time taking it down with their attacks after a boost. Be wary of burns from these Pokemon, however, as they can still wear Cobalion down, though this won't completely stop it from sweeping, unlike its physical sets. Pokemon threatened by Cobalion's STAB moves, as well as slower frail Pokemon who are threatened enough to be forced out can also be used to open up a turn for a free Calm Mind. Specially-based offensive Pokemon lacking a super effective move, such as Porygon-Z, Raikou, and Roserade, can be used as setup fodder, but most of the time they will leave Cobalion weakened enough to be revenge killed. Lastly, most Choice Scarf users are able to outspeed and revenge kill Cobalion due to its common weaknesses. Try to remove them as quickly as possible before attempting to sweep.

Team Options
========

This set relies more heavily on entry hazard support to assist its sweeping power compared to the Swords Dance set, so Stealth Rock support from Swampert, Hippowdon, Nidoqueen, or Mega Aggron is vital. Spikes from Froslass, Chesnaught, Roserade, Forretress, or Qwilfish are also much appreciated. Nidoqueen as well as the latter three Spikes users also have access to Toxic Spikes, which reduces the staying power of defensive Pokemon that wish to outlast Cobalion, allowing it to put more pressure on them as it sets up. Sticky Web support from Galvantula allows Cobalion to deal with faster grounded Pokemon who could otherwise outspeed and deny it from sweeping. Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Victini, Honchkrow, Hydreigon, and mixed Infernape are able to wear the opposing team down to allow Cobalion to sweep more easily against defensive Pokemon. Since Cobalion will not be used much until a solid chance for setup is found, partners that cover its weaknesses to Fire-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves are essential. Pokemon such as Alomomola, Swampert, Rotom-H, Crobat, Flygon, and Hydreigon synergize nicely with Cobalion's typing, taking most of the pressure off it.

Other Options
########

Cobalion's movepool is very spacious, giving it a lot of options and combinations to work with; however, not all are too viable. A mixed set with Work Up can be used, as Close Combat, Stone Edge, Iron Head or Flash Cannon, and a Hidden Power of choice allow Cobalion to function as a lure to beat specific defensive checks while exerting offensive pressure. A set with Rock Polish and 3 attacks can be used to cover as many Pokemon as possible while being difficult to revenge kill, but its average offensive stats make this hard to take full advantage of, especially against defensive Pokemon. Hone Claws allows Cobalion to raise its Attack while boosting the accuracy of moves such as Focus Blast and Stone Edge, but it does little else that Swords Dance can't accomplish. A Choice Band or Choice Scarf can be used as they both offer some surprise factor, though Cobalion is mostly outclassed by Mienshao and Krookodile as a user of either item. Cobalion's movepool also offers niche offensive moves, such as Quick Attack, Bounce, X-Scissor, and Aerial Ace, though none of them offer much over its general coverage options. It also has access to niche support moves such as Roar, Reflect, Safeguard, Block, and Sandstorm, though these are difficult to fit onto a set.

Checks & Counters
########

**Physical Walls**: Physical walls such as Chesnaught, defensive Arcanine, defensive Mega Ampharos, and even Mega Aggron can switch into Cobalion even as it uses Swords Dance and deal serious damage to it, possibly scoring a KO. All of them are much more susceptible to being KOed by the Calm Mind set, however.

**Bulky Water-types**: Starmie, Tentacruel, Jellicent, Suicune, Swampert, Mega Blastoise, and Alomomola are all able to check Cobalion easily due to having the bulk to survive any hit and threaten Cobalion with a Scald burn. The former three also resist both its STAB moves, making them hard for even the Calm Mind set to break through, with Starmie being able to outspeed and KO Cobalion, Tentacruel having access to Haze to deny a sweep, and Jellicent being beaten only by a combination of Hidden Power Ghost + Substitute on the Calm Mind set. Suicune is also able to set up alongside the Calm Mind set, eventually coming out on top by stalling Focus Blast out of PP.

**Ground-types**: Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Gligar, Nidoqueen, and Donphan are bulky enough to switch into Cobalion and threaten it with their super effective Ground-type STAB moves. However, they will lose to Cobalion if it runs Magnet Rise + Swords Dance, though Hippowdon is still able to phaze it out with Whirlwind. With a Life Orb, the Calm Mind set is able to boost once and 2HKO each of these Pokemon barring specially defensive Hippowdon while surviving Earthquake, though prior damage will be needed against Nidoqueen, otherwise it will simply KO Cobalion with Earth Power after taking a +1 Flash Cannon.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types such as Sableye, Cofagrigus, and Trevenant are immune to Cobalion's Fighting-type STAB moves and can switch freely on them, threatening to burn Cobalion with Will-O-Wisp. Cofagrigus and Trevenant lose to the Calm Mind set if Hidden Power Ghost and Substitute are used together, while Sableye manages to win against all sets with a combination of Prankster Taunt + Will-O-Wisp + Recover.

**Psychic-types**: Psychic-types such as Azelf, Reuniclus, and Cresselia resist Cobalion's Fighting-type STAB moves, allowing them to switch in on it with ease. Azelf is capable of outspeeding and beating Cobalion with Fire Blast, while Cresselia and Reuniclus are bulky enough to switch in and set up either Calm Mind or Trick Room, winning even against Cobalion's Calm Mind set thanks to Psyshock.

**Faster Pokemon**: Pokemon that naturally outspeed Cobalion, such as Mega Houndoom, Starmie, Noivern, and Crobat, as well as Choice Scarf users such as Mienshao, Darmanitan, Flygon, Krookodile, and Chandelure, are all able to outrun Cobalion and revenge kill it easily, since most of them carry a super effective move or are able to deal enough damage to pick it off after it has been weakened.

**Sticky Web**: Sticky Web reduces Cobalion's Speed, making it easy for any offensive Pokemon to outspeed and threaten Cobalion with the appropriate move. Sticky Web also negates the boost obtained from Salac Berry if it is used on the Swords Dance set, allowing Cobalion to still be revenge killed once Salac Berry is used up.
