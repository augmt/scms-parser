Overview
########

Goodra's incredible Special Defense allows it to serve as an effective special tank while still being able to dish out decent damage thanks to its base 100 Attack and 110 Special Attack stats. Its useful defensive typing and ability Sap Sipper back up Goodra's natural bulk, giving it three resistances and one immunity. Goodra has great coverage options; fortunately, Goodra also has the stat distribution to run both physically and specially oriented sets. However, its mediocre Defense stat combined with a lack of reliable recovery outside of Rest gives it stiff competition in its roles when compared to other Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Noivern, both of which have greater Speed and reliable recovery in Roost.


Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Earthquake / Fire Punch
move 3: Power Whip
move 4: Iron Tail
ability: Sap Sipper
item: Choice Band
evs: 212 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Spe
nature: Adamant


Moves
========

Outrage is Goodra's main STAB attack and hits extremely hard in combination of Goodra's decent Attack and a Choice Band; however, it should only be used freely once Steel- and Fairy-type Pokemon have been KOed. Earthquake hits the Steel-types that resist Goodra's STAB, such as Mega Aggron. Fire Punch is another option to hit Whimsicott and Forretress, which are not damaged badly by Goodra's other attacks, for more reliable damage. Superpower is an option to hit Blissey and Mega Aggron more powerfully; however, the Attack and Defense drops can be problematic. Power Whip provides good coverage against bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Alomomola, Swampert and Suicune, hitting them for super effective damage. Iron Tail hits Fairy-type Pokemon such as Florges and Aromatisse which are immune to Goodra's STAB moves.


Set Details
========

Choice Band gives Goodra a massive Attack stat, letting it hit incredibly hard with all of its attacks. Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature allows Goodra to dish out a lot of damage from its physical attacks. 44 Speed EVs allow Goodra to outspeed uninvested 85 base Speed Pokemon such as Gligar, Suicune, and Cresselia. Sap Sipper gives Goodra an immunity to Grass-type attacks as well as a free Attack boost upon switching into one. An alternate EV spread of 72 HP / 252 Atk / 184 Spe can be used to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow and OHKO it with Outrage. The remaining EVs are placed into HP, allowing Goodra to tank hits more efficiently.


Usage Tips
========

Goodra can freely switch into Grass-type attacks to get a free Attack boost, which, in tandem with Choice Band, makes Goodra an incredibly fearsome wallbreaker with the power to break down even the sturdiest of physical walls. Goodra also works as a great switch-in to special Water- and Electric-type attacks thanks to its phenomenal special bulk and good defensive typing.


Team Options
========

Mega Blastoise is a great teammate that can lure in common Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon and attacks, while also providing entry hazard support with Rapid Spin. Mega Aggron can provide a switch-in to physical attacks that Goodra might have problems tanking, while also providing Stealth Rock support. Fairy-type Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Florges are free switch ins to the Dragon-type attacks targeted at Goodra. Alomomola is a good teammate to Goodra, as it can lure Grass-type attacks to activate Goodra's Sap Sipper and provides Wish support if Goodra gets low on HP. Fast revenge killers such as Mienshao and Krookodile can beat faster threats that Goodra would be too slow to deal with.


Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Sludge Bomb
move 4: Thunderbolt / Muddy Water
ability: Sap Sipper
item: Choice Specs
evs: 212 HP / 252 SpA / 44 Spe
nature: Modest


Moves
========

Draco Meteor is Goodra's main STAB and hits with monstrous power in combination with Goodra's decent Special Attack and Choice Specs. Fire Blast hits Steel-types such as Forretress, which resist Goodra's STAB moves. Sludge Bomb hits Fairy-type Pokemon such as Florges and Aromatisse, which are immune to Goodra's STAB moves, for super effective damage. Thunderbolt hits bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Empoleon, and Suicune, while Muddy Water can be used to hit Ground- and Fire-type Pokemon such as Krookodile and Chandelure for super effective damage.


Set Details
========

Choice Specs gives Goodra a massive Special Attack stat, letting it hit as hard as possible in combination with a Modest nature and maximum Special Attack EVs. 44 Speed EVs allow Goodra to outspeed uninvested base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Gligar, Suicune and Cresselia. Sap Sipper is the ability of choice, giving Goodra an immunity to all Grass-type attacks. An alternate EV spread of 72 HP / 252 SpA / 184 Spe can be utilized to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow and OHKO it with Draco Meteor. The remaining EVs are placed into Goodra's HP stat to help back up its natural bulk, thus allowing it to take incoming attacks better.


Usage Tips
========

Goodra's phenomenal special bulk makes it a fantastic pivot into special attacks, and Goodra's strong offensive presence allows it to hit whatever switches in decently hard. Goodra likes to switch into Pokemom it can handle extremely easily, such as Shaymin and Chandelure. Be wary of staying in against strong physical attacks, as Goodra's mediocre Defense leaves it extremely vulnerable to strong physical attacks.


Team Options
========

Alomomola is a fantastic teammate that can not only pass Wishes to Goodra but can also switch in on physical attacks that Goodra would have trouble tanking. Similarly, Goodra can switch in on threatening special hits, such as Shaymin's Seed Flare, that Alomomola does not like to stay in against. Swampert can provide Stealth Rock support to help wear down foes for Goodra, while also providing good type synergy. Florges and Aromatisse are good partners as well, as they can provide cleric support and Goodra cannot recover HP on its own. Mega Aggron not only has fantastic physical bulk but can also provide Stealth Rock support.


Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Draco Meteor / Dragon Pulse
move 2: Fire Blast / Flamethrower
move 3: Sludge Bomb
move 4: Dragon Tail / Thunderbolt / Muddy Water
ability: Sap Sipper
item: Assault Vest
evs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpD
nature: Modest


Moves
========

Draco Meteor is Goodra's most powerful STAB attack, and it hits like a truck even without a boosting item. However, this attack lowers Goodra's Special Attack by two stages, and has a 10% change of missing. Dragon Pulse is an option, providing less power than Draco Meteor but not having the nasty side effects that come along with it. Fire Blast hits Steel types, such as Mega Aggron, Forretress and Mega Steelix, which resist Goodra's main STAB move, for super effective damage. Flamethrower can be used over this for perfect accuracy but less power. Thunderbolt hits bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Alomomola and Empoleon for super effective damage and provides unresisted coverage with Fire and Dragon. Dragon Tail is useful for phazing opposing Pokemon that might attempt to set up. Sludge Bomb hits Fairy-type Pokemon such as Florges and Aromatisse which are immune to Goodra's main STAB move, while Muddy Water hits bulky Ground- and Water-type Pokemon. Ice Beam can be used to hit Gligar, while Power Whip is mainly used to hit Swampert.


Set Details
========

An Assault Vest boosts Goodra's already high natural Special Defense to extraordinary levels, taking even certain super effective hits incredibly well. Sap Sipper is the ability of choice, giving Goodra a free switch into Grass-type attacks and boosting Dragon Tail's power. Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature lets Goodra hit as hard as possible. 248 HP EVs boost Goodra's good natural bulk, while reducing residual damage.


Usage Tips
========

Goodra has free reign to switch into the majority of special attacks, taking most of them fantastically well, which makes it a fantastic pivot into special attackers such as Mega Pidgeot and Shaymin; take this advantage to hit whatever switches in extremely hard with one of Goodra's attacks. Be extremely wary about attempting to stay in against physical attacks, as even with investment into bulk, Goodra's mediocre Defense leaves much to be desired.


Team Options
========

Alomomola can switch freely in to most physical attacks aimed at Goodra while also giving Wish support. Goodra can also switch into a plethora special attacks that might threaten Alomomola. Swampert not only provides fantastic type synergy with Goodra, but it can also lay down Stealth Rock to help it wear down its foes. Florges and Aromatisse can provide Wish support as well, as Goodra can get worn down easily throughout the battle. Mega Aggron has phenomenal physical Defense, being able to comfortably switch into many physical hits that threaten Goodra. It can also provide Stealth Rock support so Goodra has an easier time wearing down its foes.


Other Options
########

Curse can boost Goodra's Attack and Defense at the cost of losing Speed upon use. Rain Dance and Hydration provides support for dedicated Rain teams, and it allows Goodra to freely abuse Rest. Toxic cripples common switch-ins such as Florges, Blissey, Suicune, Swampert, and Alomomola. Gooey can help against offensive teams, however, due to Goodra's mediocre Defense, it will often struggle staying in against strong physical attacks.


Checks & Counters
########

**Special Walls**: Assault Vest Goodra has a very difficult time getting past special walls if it does not carry Superpower. Even then, Superpower damage is easily mitigated with reliable recovery. They have to be wary of the Choice Band set, however.

**Physical Attackers**: Pokemon such as Mienshao and Machamp do a large portion of damage to Goodra. Choice Band Infernape will OHKO Goodra with the help of Stealth Rock damage. Pokemon such as Mega Swampert have an easy time getting past the Assault Vest set.

**Status**: Common Toxic users such as Tentacruel pose a risk to Goodra, preventing it from remaining for the long haul. Scald and Will-O-Wisp users also threaten Goodra to slowly whittle down its HP.

**Fairy-types**: Fairy types threaten Goodra with their STAB moves and prevent its Choice Band set from using its most powerful attack.
