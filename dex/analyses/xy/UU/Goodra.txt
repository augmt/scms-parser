Overview
########

Goodra's monstrous 150 base Special Defense and 90 base HP help it excel at taking special attacks; it can also hit quite hard with its base 110 Special Attack. Goodra also has access to a wide movepool that allows it to break through many threats. Its ability, Sap Sipper, adds an immunity to Grass-type moves like Giga Drain and Sleep Powder. However, one downside of using Goodra is that it's outsped by all other Dragon-type Pokemon in the tier, making it easy to revenge kill. Also, Goodra lacks a more reliable recovery option other than Rest.

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is a STAB move that has tremendous power and is Goodra's main move. However, you can't spam Draco Meteor, as it drops Goodra's Special Attack by 2 stages, weakening all of its special moves. Fire Blast has high Base Power and grants coverage against Steel-type Pokemon, such as Forretress and Jirachi, that are otherwise eager to switch in. Sludge Bomb covers Goodra's weakness to Fairy-types a bit, and can also spread poison. Dragon Tail is a good phazing move that does a decent amount of damage and stops most special threats from setting up. Thunderbolt also has great Base Power and grants coverage against Water- and Flying-type Pokemon. Power Whip hits Ground-type Pokemon such as Swampert and Quagsire harder.

Set Details
========

Sap Sipper is chosen over Gooey because it grants Goodra an immunity to Grass-type moves, as well as an Attack boost. Assault Vest allows Goodra to tank any unboosted special hit in any matchup. 252 EVs invested in Special Attack and a Modest Nature ensure that Goodra hits as hard as it can. The EVs invested in HP and Defense augment Goodra's terrifying bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Switch Goodra in when a specially based Pokemon, such as Roserade and Milotic, is on the field, as it can tank their hits and strike back with a super effective move. Another good time to switch in Goodra is when the opposing special threat, such as Suicune, is boosting their stats, because it can force switches by using Dragon Tail. Goodra is a good switch-in to Grass-types, as their STAB moves do no damage and boost Goodra's Dragon Tail.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can easily switch into physical Dragon-type attackers, such as Forretress and Granbull, will work as well; Goodra really can't stand up to these Pokemon. Entry hazard setters, such as Swampert and Roserade, are excellent, as Goodra can easily phaze with Dragon Tail. low Volt Switch or U-turn users will help Goodra too, as they grant Goodra a safe switch in, allowing it to launch a powerful attack next turn.

Other Options
########

Running both Rest and Sleep Talk gives Goodra recovery and can be used in combination with Dragon Tail, as Sleep Talk can use Dragon Tail without negative priority. Thunder offers the same coverage as Thunderbolt, but with higher base power, more chance to paralyze, and less accuracy. The same option exists with Flamethrower; it has less power than Fire Blast but is more accurate. Ice Beam or Blizzard can be used as additional coverage, but they are mostly redundant. Sludge Wave, on the other hand, has more power than Sludge Bomb, but less chance to poison. Dragon Pulse can be chosen over Draco Meteor; it has less power, but is more dependable and doesn't cripple Goodra with the Special Attack drop after. A physical Choice Band set is decent, as Goodra has good base Attack and a good movepool for it, but Goodra's special sets are generally better. Choice Specs is also a decent option, but being locked into one move is generally unreliable. Curse is an option to boost Goodra's Attack and Defense, but it isn't really worth it because the Speed drop makes Goodra more vulnerable against slow, offensive attackers. Gooey is an option to slow down physical attackers, or Hydration can be used on a Rain team in conjuction with Rest.


Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Fairy types** Fairy-types such as Florges can easily stall Goodra out, or just threaten it directly with a Fairy-type move.

**Special walls** Special walls, such as Blissey, tank Goodra's hits and can stall it out.

**Strong physical attackers** Strong, physical attackers with an advantage over Goodra such as Haxorus, Krookodile, and Mienshao can easily get rid of it. The same applies for special moves that target Goodra's Defense, such as Alakazam's Psyshock.
