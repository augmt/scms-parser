Overview
########

Empoleon makes for an excellent choice in UU, mainly for its valuable defensive typing and movepool. Empoleon's typing grants it many useful resistances, including resistances to Rock-, Flying-, Fairy-, Bug-, and Dragon-type moves. Empoleon also has an excellent movepool, including Defog and Stealth Rock, allowing it to clear and set up entry hazards with the same set. Its decent Special Attack and access to Roar keeps Empoleon from being setup bait for threatening sweepers. Sadly, it can't check Fire-types as well as other bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune can, as it is neutral to Fire-type attacks thanks to its secondary Steel typing. Also, Empoleon is worn down fairly quickly due to its lack of recovery, so repeated attacks will eventually bring it down. It is also held back by its weaknesses to Electric-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves.

Moves
========

Stealth Rock wears down foes when they switch in and is extremely helpful for many sweepers to acquire crucial KOs. Also, it is relatively easy for Empoleon to set up thanks to its great defensive typing. Defog clears entry hazards from your side of the field to help your own Pokemon stick around longer. Toxic is useful for breaking down Pokemon, especially opposing bulky Water-types, and puts sweepers on a timer. Protect allows Empoleon to scout the foe's move if they are carrying a Choice item and switch into the appropriate teammate and allows Empoleon to get a free turn of Leftovers recovery. Scald is a decently powerful STAB move that carries a useful 30% chance to burn the foe, pressuring physical attackers that like to switch in. Roar is recommended in the last slot to clear away boosts from Pokemon such as Calm Mind Reuniclus and Suicune, but it can also be spammed to rack up entry hazard damage. Ice Beam, however, can hit Pokemon such as Roseade, Shaymin, Hydreigon, Haxorus, and Salamence hard. Finally, Knock Off can cripple switch-ins to Empoleon by removing their item.

Set Details
========

Maximum EV investment in Special Defense alongside a Calm nature allows Empoleon to tank as many special attacks as possible. Leftovers is the recommended item for the passive recovery it provides, keeping Empoleon from being worn down too quickly. 248 HP EVs are used to minimize damage taken from entry hazards. A physically defensive EV spread can be used to take on Pokemon such as Mega Absol, Mega Aerodactyl, Darmanitan, and Entei better. Finally, EVs can be invested in Special Attack to carry a larger offensive presence.

Usage Tips
========

Empoleon can switch into resisted hits from opposing Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Florges and force them out thanks to its great defensive typing. With these forced switches, Empoleon can set up Stealth Rock or clear entry hazards with Defog. If possible, try to use Defog before Stealth Rock so you don't clear your own entry hazards unless you absolutely need to have entry hazards removed.

Team Options
========

Wish and cleric support from Pokemon such as Florges, Aromatisse, Blissey, and Umbreon is helpful to keep Empoleon alive longer, as it has no reliable recovery, but keep in mind that Blissey and Umbreon compound Empoleon's weakness to Fighting-type moves. Wallbreakers and sweepers that appreciate Stealth Rock support from Empoleon make for good teammates. Also, Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards removed, such as Yanmega, Aerodactyl, and Entei, make for good partners. Finally, Pokemon that appreciate Empoleon's ability to switch into their weaknesses and force the foe out, such as Heracross, Hydreigon, Rotom-H, and Noivern, make for good partners.

Other Options
########

Empoleon's Agility + Substitute + Petaya Berry set from past generations can be used to try to sweep late-game, but specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey, Umbreon, and Florges make it difficult. Also, a Life Orb + three attacks + Agility set can be used for late-game cleaning, but it lacks even more power than the SubPetaya set. A three attacks + Stealth Rock or Defog set can be used for offensive support. Grass Knot can be used to hit opposing Water-types, especially Swampert. Flash Cannon can be used as Empoleon's STAB move to hit Fairy-types harder, but Empoleon already handles them fairly well and the burn chance from Scald is usually more valuable. A Choice Specs set can be used as a wallbreaker, but Empoleon is rather slow and doesn't hit special walls hard enough. Finally, a physical Defiant set can be used to pressure Defoggers and set up with Swords Dance, also opening access to Empoleon's good physical movepool.

Checks & Counters
########

**Specially Bulky Pokemon**: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Umbreon and Blissey can stall out Empoleon with residual damage from Seismic Toss or Foul Play, and they all can get rid of a burn from Scald with Natural Cure or Heal Bell.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Heracross, Machamp, and Mienshao threaten Empoleon with their STAB moves but do not appreciate a burn from Scald. However, Guts Heracross and Machamp can gain an Attack boost from a burn, making them significantly more threatening. Mienshao must be wary of Protect, which will cause it to damage itself using High Jump Kick.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Mega Ampharos and Rotom-C can easily 2HKO Emploeon despite its high Special Defense. Ampharos and Rotom-C also have the advantage of resisting Scald, but neither enjoys Toxic, though Mega Ampharos does have the option of running Rest or Heal Bell.

**Ground-types**: While they cannot switch in safely because of Scald, Ground-types such as Nidoqueen or Krookodile are a massive pain for Empoleon.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Roserade, Amoonguss, and Shaymin resist Scald, and most can heal off a Toxic with Natural Cure. Roserade can wear Empoleon down with repeated Giga Drains or Leaf Storms and set up entry hazards against variants lacking Defog, Amoonguss puts Empoleon to sleep with Spore, and Shaymin can hit Empoleon for super effective damage with Earth Power.
