Overview
########

Lucario makes its mark in UU as one of the best sweepers in the tier, which is shown through its great offensive movepool and access to both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, making it a very potent sweeper, and its access to both physical and special priority, making it hard to revenge kill. It also has a great ability in Justified, which lets it take advantage of Dark-type moves, such as Mega Absol's Knock Off. However, Lucario has poor defenses, which make it hard for it to take nearly any hit; in some cases, it can even get 2HKOed by a resisted hit, despite its good set of resistances. Lucario has weaknesses to many common attacking types, particularly Fire, Fighting, and Ground, and its Speed stat, while by no means bad, is somewhat underwhelming, although this is slightly mitigated by Lucario's access to priority. Lucario also needs to set up in order to deal a lot of damage.


Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Close Combat
move 3: Extreme Speed / Bullet Punch
move 4: Ice Punch / Bullet Punch / Earthquake / Crunch
ability: Justified
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Swords Dance lets Lucario boost its Attack, setting it up for a sweep. Close Combat serves as a Fighting-type STAB attack that has good coverage and is very powerful when boosted, hitting Pokemon such as Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Empoleon, and is very powerful when boosted. Extreme Speed lets Lucario outprioritize all opposing priority, even from Pokemon that are faster than it, and it also gives Lucario a good option to hit common Choice Scarf users or Pokemon that are naturally faster than it. Bullet Punch is a weaker alternative, despite its STAB boost, but is significant in that it serves as a priority move that can beat the likes of Mega Aerodactyl, which is a common check to Lucario, as it resists Extreme Speed. Ice Punch hits the likes of Gligar, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen, while Earthquake hits the latter two Pokemon and Fire-types, particularly Chandelure, and Crunch hits Ghost-types. Iron Tail can also be used in the last moveslot to hit Fairy-types, such as Aromatisse and Florges, considering Bullet Punch may not do enough to KO them, even when boosted.

Set Details
========

An Adamant nature is used to maximize Lucario's Attack; a Jolly nature is not used, considering Lucario has access to Extreme Speed and Bullet Punch, but it can be used to outspeed certain Pokemon, such as Timid Chandelure, Modest Kyurem, and Adamant Krookodile. The given EV spread is used to give Lucario as much Attack and Speed as possible. Life Orb is used to increase Lucario's Attack stat to massive levels, making it easier for Lucario to sweep, especially against offensive teams.

Usage Tips
========

Lucario has somewhat of a hard time setting up due to its poor defenses, so it should usually come in on predicted switches or on weak attacks that it can tank and take advantage of, such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon's Dark Pulse. Lucario should be trying to sweep late-game, when most of its common checks and counters are either removed or weakened to a point where Lucario can KO them at +2.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can bring Lucario in safely through Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Mega Ampharos, Crobat, and Forretress, make for good partners, as they can get Lucario on the field for a potential sweep without risking it taking any damage. Lucario loves entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Swampert, Froslass, Nidoqueen, and Roserade, as they whittle down the opposing Pokemon and make it easier for Lucario to sweep. Pokemon that can check Mega Aerodactyl, which beats all variants of Lucario not carrying Bullet Punch, are also good partners, as Mega Aerodactyl is one of the few Pokemon that can check it reliably. Swampert gets a special mention, as it checks Mega Aerodactyl easily while setting up Stealth Rock for Lucario.

Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Aura Sphere
move 3: Flash Cannon
move 4: Vacuum Wave / Dark Pulse
ability: Steadfast
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Nasty Plot boosts Lucario's already great Special Attack to huge levels, preparing it for a sweep. Aura Sphere serves as Lucario's Fighting-type STAB, having good coverage in the metagame and, unlike Close Combat on the physical set, has no drawbacks but less power. Flash Cannon is Lucario's Steel-type STAB move, and is generally used to pound the Fairy-types that resist Lucario's other moves, such as Florges and Aromatisse. Vacuum Wave is used as Lucario's priority attack, which gets STAB and does a good amount of damage when boosted by Nasty Plot. Dark Pulse hits Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Cresselia and Chandelure, respectively.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature is used to let Lucario outspeed as many Pokemon as it can, while a Modest nature gives it more power; it should be noted that Vacuum Wave should be used if running a Modest nature, while Dark Pulse should be used if running a Timid nature. The given EV spread is used to maximize Lucario's Special Attack and Speed. Life Orb is used to give Lucario a significant power boost.

Usage Tips
========

Lucario has a hard time getting on the field due to its poor defenses, so it should be brought in with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn, or after a teammate goes down. It can force out a large portion of the tier, so it should be setting up while forcing a Pokemon out.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can set up entry hazards, such as Nidoqueen, Froslass, and Swampert, are great partners for Lucario. Stealth Rock support in particular is appreciated, as it wears down Fire- and Flying-types, both of which Lucario hates. Pokemon that can bring Lucario in safely via Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Mega Ampharos and Gligar, are also appreciated. Mega Ampharos gets a special mention, as it is a great check to Crobat, which is annoying for this set. Wallbreakers, such as Life Orb Hydreigon, are also good partners for Lucario, as they break down certain special walls.


Other Options
########

Lucario can utilize both Choice Band and Choice Specs to take advantage of its massive offensive stats without being forced to boost in order to do a good chunk of damage, but Lucario despises being locked into one move. Agility can be used to patch up Lucario's slightly underwhelming Speed stat and let it forgo priority for another coverage move, but Lucario much prefers a power boost.


Checks & Counters
########

**Faster Pokemon**: Pokemon that naturally outspeed Lucario and resist Extreme Speed, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Cobalion, are good answers to Lucario, as they can tank a +2 Extreme Speed and potentially KO it; however, Mega Aerodactyl must be wary of Bullet Punch, and Cobalion has to be careful of a boosted Vacuum Wave.

**Chandelure**: Chandelure resists most of Lucario's moves, barring Crunch and Earthquake, and can retaliate with a STAB Fire-type attack; a Choice Scarf variant of Chandelure doesn't even need to worry about the Crunch or Earthquake, provided it can get in safely.

**Physical Walls**: Pokemon that have a large Defense stat can take Lucario on, particularly Gligar, Hippowdon, and Cresselia. However, they can all be KOed by a boosted coverage move, and the latter can't do too much damage to Lucario in return.
