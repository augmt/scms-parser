Overview
########

Xatu is often overlooked as a Psychic-type Pokemon in the UU tier. However, it stands out among most of them, thanks to its access to the rare Magic Bounce ability, allowing it to deflect most non-damaging moves for its own use. It also has decent Speed and Special Attack, as well as access to U-turn to keep the momentum. Xatu even has reliable recovery in Roost. However, Xatu has a bad defensive typing and faces stiff competition from many Psychic-types in the tier, such as Azelf, which sports much higher offensive stats, and Cresselia, which has superior bulk.

Moves
========

Psychic is Xatu's primary STAB attack, hitting the Fighting- and Poison-types that fill the tier for super effective damage. Night Shade can be used instead of Psychic to deal consistent damage, and it usually breaks Substitutes. U-turn provides valuable momentum for the team and allows Xatu to escape dangerous Pokemon. The third moveslot is a toss-up. Thunder Wave is the preferred choice, supporting your team's sweepers as well as crippling Choice Scarf users and offensive threats such as Darmanitan and Mienshao. Toxic, however, lets Xatu put a timer on walls or dangerous sweepers. Lastly, Roost allows Xatu to heal off damage it may have taken, improving its longevity.

Set Details
========

The given EVs maximize Xatu's special bulk, allowing it to check many special attackers in the tier such as Shaymin and Roserade. Leftovers gives Xatu a form of passive recovery. Magic Bounce is the only reason to use Xatu, as it deflects non-damaging moves. A physically defensive set can be used to check many physical attackers in the tier, but Xatu's bad defensive typing makes it hard to do so. A Calm nature is used because it further increases Xatu's special bulk. Even though it lowers U-turn's power, the damage is irrelevant as it is mainly used for momentum. It also helps against Foul Play users such as Umbreon, though they still do a lot of damage to Xatu.

Usage Tips
========

If you predict that your opponent will use a status move, switch into Xatu to deflect it. Use Thunder Wave or Toxic whenever given an opportunity, as it allows Xatu to cripple many Pokemon in the tier. Lastly, use Roost sparingly, as against stall-based teams, it will be a very important move. However, be careful about using a status move if you see Machamp, as it may have the ability Guts.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that create VoltTurn cores such as Raikou and Rotom-H make great partners. Rotom-H in particular has excellent type synergy with Xatu. Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards off the field such as Yanmega, Chandelure, and Darmanitan make good partners. Pokemon such as Swampert and Blastoise that can take care of Rhyperior, a hard counter to Xatu, make good partners. Grass-type Pokemon such as Roserade and Shaymin also make great partners, taking the Electric-type moves aimed at Xatu, even though they share the same Ice-type weakness.

Other Options
########

Xatu can use Wish, but it won't be passing huge Wishes due to its low HP stat. It also has to run Protect if it wants to heal itself. Feather Dance is a cool option, allowing Xatu to lower the opponent's Attack. Reflect and Light Screen can be used, though it is highly outclassed by Azelf and Cresselia in that regard. Tailwind can be used to speed up slower Pokemon, but Thunder Wave is usually a better option. Lastly, Foul Play can be used to punish physical sweepers that try to set up, but has little use apart from that. An offensive set can also be used, but is outclassed again by Azelf and Sigilyph, which sport higher Speed and Special Attack, and in Sigilyph's case, Magic Guard.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dark-types**: Dark-types such as Krookodile and Hydreigon can force Xatu out with their STAB attacks. Mega Absol in particular can use Xatu as setup fodder, as it fears none of the status moves that Xatu carries thanks to its own Magic Bounce, and only fears U-turn.

**Rock-types**: Rock-types such as Rhyperior and Mega Aerodactyl can deal a lot of damage to Xatu with their Rock-type STAB moves, and Rhyperior is immune to Thunder Wave.

**Nidoqueen and Nidoking**: Nidoqueen and Nidoking can check Xatu because they are immune to both Toxic and Thunder Wave and can hit back super effectively with Ice Beam, though they have to be wary of Psychic.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Rotom-H and Raikou are immune to Thunder Wave and can KO Xatu with their powerful STAB attacks. Both can also use Volt Switch to keep momentum, while the latter can use Substitute and set up on Xatu.
