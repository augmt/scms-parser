Overview
########

Nidoking is one of the foremost special wallbreakers of the UnderUsed tier, able to OHKO many frail threats that don't resist its moves with the help of Stealth Rock and 2HKO a huge portion of the metagame bar special sponges such as Blissey, Umbreon, Vaporeon, Cresselia, Porygon2, and Rotom-H. Unfortunately, Nidoking hits a poor Speed tier, making it easily revenge killed. Nidoking also faces stiff competition from its bulkier counterpart, Nidoqueen, which hits harder with a Modest nature; however, Nidoking is not to be underestimated, as it is not frail enough to be taken down by any resisted move, and it can dish out serious damage in return.

Usage Tips
========
