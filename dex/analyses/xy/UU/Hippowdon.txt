Overview
########

Hippowdon is one of UU's best physical walls. It acts as a great check to a multitude of offensive threats, such as Darmanitan and Mega Beedrill. Thanks to its great bulk, it's also a good user of Stealth Rock. Hippowdon also resists Stealth Rock, so it's not worn down too easily by entry hazards, and it has reliable recovery in Slack Off. However, its low Speed can be a problem, as it is easily outpaced by many Pokemon.

Physical Wall
########
name: Physical Wall
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Slack Off
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Ice Fang / Whirlwind / Toxic
ability: Sand Stream
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Hippowdon's great bulk makes it a great user of Stealth Rock, as it can come in many times in a match to set it up. Slack Off is a must on Hippowdon, keeping it healthy so that it can consistently switch in on Pokemon that it walls. Earthquake is a reliable STAB move that can hit surprisingly hard coming off Hippowdon's decent Attack stat even without investment. Ice Fang hits Flying-type Pokemon and Levitate users, which are immune to Earthquake, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Salamence, and Hydreigon, while also catching Grass-types on the switch. Whirlwind phazes sweepers that try to use Hippowdon as setup bait. Toxic is another option to rack up residual damage in tandem with sandstorm damage. You can also opt to run Rock Slide to hit Rotom-H, but it is generally not worth it, as Rotom-H can easily cripple Hippowdon with either Trick or Will-O-Wisp.

Set Details
========

252 HP EVs and 252 Defense EVs along with an Impish nature maximize Hippowdon's good physical bulk. Sand Stream allows Hippowdon to wear down the opponent's Pokemon while also weakening recovery moves that rely on the weather, such as Morning Sun. Sandstorm damage can also be combined with Toxic damage and entry hazards to whittle down at the foe's HP. Sand Force can be used instead if the effects of Sand Stream are not beneficial to the rest of your team. Leftovers gives Hippowdon passive recovery, allowing it to avoid possible 2HKOs.

Usage Tips
========

Try to set up Stealth Rock early in the game to wear down the opponent's Pokemon. Use Hippowdon to wear down opposing Pokemon through the combination of Toxic and sandstorm damage. Slack Off should be used whenever Hippowdon is low on health to keep it healthy enough to check physical attackers multiple times throughout the game. Even though Hippowdon is a very sturdy physical wall, it does not enjoy taking repeated strong neutral hits such as Mienshao's High Jump Kick, so know its limits.

Team Options
========

Hippowdon likes teammates that can take care of strong special attackers. It also enjoys cleric support, as it has no way of getting rid of crippling status effects such as poison and burn. This makes Blissey a very good partner. Hippowdon also appreciates teammates that can switch into Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks repeatedly, such as Tentacruel, which can also spin away entry hazards. Flying-type Pokemon such as Crobat are also good teammates, as Hippowdon can easily tank the Rock- and Electric-type moves that they are weak to. However, they share an Ice-type weakness, so watch out for Pokemon that carry Ice-type coverage moves. Chesnaught and Roserade are also great partners for Hippowdon. Chesnaught can set up Spikes, while Roserade can set up Toxic Spikes, forming a great entry hazard stacking core with Hippowdon. Both of them can also repeatedly take Grass- and Water-type attacks for Hippowdon, but they all must be wary of Ice-type moves.

Special Wall
########
name: Special Wall
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Slack Off
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Ice Fang / Whirlwind / Toxic
ability: Sand Stream
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Hippowdon is a great Stealth Rock setter due to its reliable recovery in Slack Off and its good natural bulk. Slack Off keeps Hippowdon healthy throughout the match. Earthquake is a strong STAB move that can do decent damage even without Attack investment, while Ice Fang hits Flying-type Pokemon such as Crobat, as well as Hydreigon and Roserade. Whirlwind racks up residual damage if entry hazards are up and phazes setup sweepers. Toxic can be used with Sand Stream to wear down bulky walls such as Porygon2. Rock Slide is another option to hit Flying-types such as Mega Aerodactyl; however, Ice Fang does the same thing while also hitting Grass-types on the switch.

Set Details
========

252 HP and 252 Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature maximize Hippowdon's special bulk. Leftovers is the best item, as it gives Hippowdon passive recovery, stopping it from being worn down too easily. Sand Stream is the preferred ability to wear down opposing Pokemon, as well as weakening recovery moves that rely on the weather, such as Moonlight. Sand Force can be used instead if the effects of sandstorm are detrimental to your team.

Usage Tips
========

Use Hippowdon's good bulk to set up Stealth Rock throughout the match. Try to keep Hippowdon healthy at all times by using Slack Off whenever it's health gets low, or else it will be prone to being worn down. Hippowdon is great at tanking hits, so use it to wear down the opposing team through residual damage. Specially defensive Hippowdon can check many powerful special attackers, such as Hydreigon, Alakazam, Mega Ampharos, mixed Infernape, and Mega Pidgeot â€” Pokemon that physically defensive Hippowdon cannot even hope to switch into. Hippowdon has excellent physical bulk even when uninvested, so with the Special Defense EVs, Hippowdon becomes a great mixed wall. However, it loses the ability to counter particularly powerful physical attackers, such as Life Orb Mienshao, due to its lack of Defense investment. Keep in mind that even if Hippowdon is running a specially defensive spread, it still has trouble switching in on very powerful special wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Chandelure.

Team Options
========

Bulky Water-types such as Suicune can take Water- and Ice-type attacks for Hippowdon. Stoutland appreciates sand support, which turns it into a powerful and fast physical attacker. Chesnaught forms an entry hazard stacking core with Hippowdon, as well as being able to tank Water- and Grass-type attacks. Roserade can set up Toxic Spikes, while also taking Water- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Hippodown. However, both Chesnaught and Roserade share an Ice weakness with Hippowdon, so you must be wary of Ice-type attacks.

Other Options
########

Smooth Rock can be used over Leftovers, giving Stoutland more time under the sand to attack. Stone Edge does more damage to Flying-type Pokemon, and it will not miss against Mega Pidgeot due to No Guard. Curse allows Hippowdon to work as a decent win condition.

Checks & Counters
########

**Water-types**: Most Water-types, such as Mega Blastoise and Suicune, can easily force out Hippowdon with their respective STAB moves, while Hippowdon cannot do anything back in return. However, Mega Blastoise must be wary of being crippled by Toxic.

**Grass-types**: Common Grass-types such as Shaymin can easily switch in on Hippowdon and retaliate with their STAB moves. Shaymin doesn't care about Toxic, due to Natural Cure, and can OHKO back with Seed Flare.

**Status**: Hippowdon can be worn down by Toxic to the point that a powerful physical attacker can muscle past it.

**Flying-types and Levitate Users**: Hippowdon usually relies on Earthquake to beat its targets, and this can sometimes give Pokemon such as Mega Pidgeot, Hydreigon, and Tornadus free switches. Most of them do not fear a non-STAB Rock Slide or Ice Fang and can easily threaten Hippowdon back with their respective STAB moves.
