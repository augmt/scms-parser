Overview
########

Hippowdon has established itself as one of UU's best walls for a number of reasons. The first is its great 108 / 118 / 72 bulk, which allows Hippowdon to run effective physical and mixed defensive sets. Its Ground typing further aids Hippowdon, as it allows it to stomach Rock- and Electric-type attacks with ease. Hippowdon also has access to great support moves, most notably Stealth Rock and Whirlwind, which allow it to effectively wear down at the opponent in conjunction with Sand Stream. It also has access to reliable recovery in the form of Slack Off, making it very hard to KO. Unfortunately, Hippowdon does have some flaws, particularly its low Speed, which means it will always have to take an attack before being able to do anything. Its Ground typing is also a mixed blessing; while it provides some helpful resistances, it also has some nasty weaknesses to common attacking types such as Water, Grass, and Ice. Finally, while Hippowdon's bulk is good, it can still have trouble switching into powerful wallbreakers such as Choice Band Victini.

Physically Defensive
###############
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Slack Off
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Rock Slide / Toxic / Whirlwind
ability: Sand Stream / Sand Force
item: Leftovers / Smooth Rock
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is the first move of this set, as with Hippowdon's great natural bulk, it is one of the most durable and reliable Stealth Rock setters in the tier. Slack Off is a necessity in order to keep Hippowdon healthy throughout the course of the match. Earthquake is a reliable STAB option that actually can do a surprising amount of damage coming off Hippowdon's good Attack stat. Rock Slide is the preferred option in the last slot, as it allows Hippowdon to hit Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake such as Mega Aerodactyl for super effective damage. Toxic can be effective, however, as it can rack up a lot of residual damage when combined with Stealth Rock and sandstorm damage. Whirlwind is another option that can be used to phaze setup sweepers while racking up entry hazard damage.

Set Details
===========

Max HP and max Defense investment with an Impish nature are used to help boost Hippowdon's best defensive stat, making it a great physical wall. Leftovers is used for passive recovery, which is great on a defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon. Smooth Rock can be helpful, however, as it extends the duration of sand, allowing Pokemon such as Stoutland to their job more effectively. Sand Stream is the preferred ability, as it can wear down on the opponent while also crippling the opponent's recovery moves, such as Synthesis and Moonlight. However, if sandstorm hurts your team members' ability to recover HP, Sand Force can be used instead.

Usage Tips
==========

When using Hippowdon, the game plan is simple: Tank hits, set up Stealth Rock, and focus on wearing the opponent down through entry hazard, sand, and potential Toxic damage. Slack Off should be used often to keep Hippowdon healthy throughout the match and help it wall the opponent more effectively. It's important to know Hippowdon's limits; while it's a great physical tank, it still can't switch into powerful special attackers and physical wallbreakers such as Chandelure and Choice Band Victini.

Team Options
============

Grass-types such as Roserade and Celebi can easily take Water- and Grass-type attacks for Hippowdon, making them some of the best partners. Roserade can also help set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, allowing it to wear down the opponent more easily. Water-types such as Vaporeon and Suicune can take Ice- and Water-type attacks with ease. Jellicent can spinblock, while Mega Blastoise, Starmie, Empoleon, and Tentacruel can remove entry hazards. Tentacruel can also lay down Toxic Spikes to help further wear down the opposing team. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Umbreon, Florges, and Snorlax can take on the powerful special attackers Hippowdon dislikes. Flying-types also make good partners, as Hippowdon can take on the Rock- and Electric-type moves they hate. Crobat provides helpful Defog support, while Mega Aerodactyl receives a Special Defense boost in the sand. Sand Rush Stoutland can use Hippowdon's Sand Stream ability to achieve a large boost to its Speed, which turns it into a fast and powerful revenge killer and late-game cleaner.

Specially Defensive
###############
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Slack Off

ability: Sand Stream / Sand Force
item: Leftovers / Smooth Rock
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Hippowdon is a great Stealth Rock setter thanks to its durability and access to reliable recovery. Slack Off is used in the second slot for reliable recovery, keeping Hippowdon healthy throughout the match. Earthquake is used in the third slot as it provides a good STAB attack that can actually do decent damage to the opponent. Rock Slide is the preferred move in the last spot as it can hit Flying-type Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl. Toxic can be used, however, to cripple both set up sweepers and walls, as well as rack up a lot of residual damage along with sand and Stealth Rock. Whirlwind is another option to phaze setup sweepers and can rack up entry hazard damage.

Set Details
==========

Max HP and max Special Defense investment with a Careful nature turns Hippowdon into a great mixed defensive tank, allowing it to take both physical and special hits. Leftovers is used to help Hippowdon heal off residual damage. Smooth Rock is an option, however, to extend the duration of Sand Stream, helping Pokemon such as Stoutland effectively do their job. Sand Stream is the favored ability, as it's great for wearing down the opponent in combination with entry hazard and potential Toxic damage. It also hinders the opponent's recovery moves, such as Moonlight and Synthesis. However, if Sand Stream harms your teammates' ability to recover, then Sand Force can be used instead.

Usage Tips
==========

In general, Hippowdon should be tanking hits, setting up Stealth Rock, healing, and wearing the opponent down through residual damage. It's important to keep Hippowdon's HP as high as possible at all times, or else Hippowdon itself will get worn down. Even if Hippowdon is using a specially defensive spread, this doesn't mean it's able to take on extremely powerful special attackers. Instead, it should be used as a mixed tank that is capable of tanking moderately powerful special and physical attacks. Most notably, this set functions much better against Electric-types, as it's able to stomach their Hidden Power Ice or Grass much easier.

Team Options
=============

Grass-types such as Roserade and Celebi make excellent partners, as they can easily sponge the Water- and Grass-type moves Hippowdon hates. Roserade can also set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which in combination with Stealth Rock and Hippowdon's Sand Stream, can easily wear down the opponent. Water-types such as Vaporeon and Suicune make for great partners, as they can help tank Water- and Ice-type attacks for Hippowdon. Mega Blastoise, Starmie, Empoleon, and Tentacruel can remove entry hazards, with the latter also being able to set Toxic Spikes up. Jellicent can block Rapid Spin, making it especially helpful. Hippowdon can easily take on Rock- and Electric-type attacks, making Flying-types good partners. Crobat can remove entry hazards via Defog, while Mega Aerodactyl appreciates the Special Defense boost it receives from the sand. Choice Band Stoutland with Sand Rush loves Hippowdon's sand support, as it turns it into a powerful and fast attacker.

Other Options
############

Hippowdon actually has quite a few notable options that aren't on the set. The first is Yawn, which can both put the opponent to sleep as well as act as a pseudo-phazing move. Ice Fang is an option for hitting Ground-types such as Gligar for super effective damage. Rocky Helmet can be used to wear the opponent down even more, and with Hippowdon's access to reliable recovery, it doesn't necessarily need Leftovers. Curse and Stockpile are two boosting moves Hippowdon can use, with the former making it both bulky and powerful, while the latter makes it extremely hard to take down. However, Hippowdon tends to be outclassed by other defensive boosting sweepers such as Suicune and Slowking. A Choice Band or bulky attacking set is also plausible, as Hippowdon has a pretty good Attack stat. However, Pokemon such as Flygon and Rhyperior tend to do this better, as they both have a secondary STAB and either higher Speed or Attack.

Checks & Counters
##############

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Celebi, Shaymin, Roserade, Trevenant, and Chesnaught resist Earthquake and can hit Hippowdon with a super effective Grass-type attack. They must be careful of Toxic, however, especially Trevenant and Chesnaught, as it can cut into their longevity.

**Water-types**: Water-types such as Mega Blastoise, Starmie, Vaporeon, Suicune, and Kingdra can all hit Hippowdon with a super effective Water-type attack. If they carry Scald, they can also burn Hippowdon. They must be wary of Toxic, though, as it puts them on a timer.

**Ice-types**: Ice-types such as Kyurem and Mega Abomasnow can hit Hippowdon with super effective Ice-type attacks. However, they must be careful of both Rock Slide and Toxic, as the former hits them super effectively, while the latter slowly wears them down. They are also weak to Stealth Rock, which Hippowdon can set up.

**Wallbreakers**: Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Porygon-Z, Choice Band Mienshao, and Hydreigon are able to take out Hippowdon relatively easily. It's also worth noting that it can't switch in on most Fire-type wallbreakers like Choice Specs Chandelure, Choice Band Victini, and Choice Band Darmanitan.

**Status**: Toxic wears Hippowdon down easily, while burn causes residual damage and also weakens its attacks.

**Flying-types / Levitate**: If they're not running Rock Slide, Pokemon such as Crobat, Honchkrow, Noivern, and Rotom-H wall it. However, Toxic can wear them down and Whirlwind can force them out to rack up residual damage.
