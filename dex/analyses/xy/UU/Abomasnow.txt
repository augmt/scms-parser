Overview
########

Although Abomasnow is less useful in UU with the removal of perma-weather, it gained an awesome new Mega Evolution this generation. With great STAB moves and high attacking stats, Mega Abomasnow can hit really hard. It is the only automatic setter of hail, and thanks to Snow Warning, it is able to spam a perfectly accurate high Base Power move in Blizzard. It works very well in Trick Room due to its very low Speed, while Ice Shard is a strong priority move that can mitigate its low Speed. Mega Abomasnow is not without faults, however. Its terrible defensive typing leaves it with a total of seven weaknesses, and without Trick Room, it is very slow, rendering it vulnerable to super effective attacks.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Blizzard
move 2: Wood Hammer / Giga Drain
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Ice Shard
ability: Soundproof
item: Abomasite
evs: 8 HP / 84 Atk / 252 SpA / 164 Spe
nature: Mild

Moves
=========

Blizzard works well with Snow Warning, as it is an extremely strong and reliable STAB move that has perfect accuracy in hail. Wood Hammer is a powerful physical STAB move, though it has the downfall of having high recoil. Giga Drain is a special Grass-type STAB move that doesn't have recoil and regains HP, but it isn't as strong as Wood Hammer. Earthquake gets rid of Steel-types that would be a problem and hits Fire-types on the switch. Lastly, Ice Shard is used for priority to pick off weakened opponents.

Set Details
========

As this set is completely offensive, it has a balanced offensive spread. 8 HP EVs are to allow minimum Stealth Rock damage. 252 EVs are placed into Special Attack to boost the power of Mega Abomasnow's best and most reliable move, Blizzard. 164 EVs are placed into Speed to allow Mega Abomasnow to outspeed common base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Donphan, while the remaining EVs are dumped into Attack. 0 Speed IVs should be used if Mega Abomasnow is being used on a Trick Room team, to maximize its Speed in Trick Room. Mild is preferred over other natures as most common physical attacks destroy Mega Abomasnow anyway, and it should capitalize on its resistances to Electric, Water, and Ground. Although minor, Soundproof is the preferred ability before Mega Evolution as it allows Mega Abomasnow to switch into Exploud's Boomburst as well as any other sound moves, and hail isn't exactly beneficial for the team unless Mega Abomasnow is taking advantage of it.

Usage Tips
========

There are a few things to keep in mind when using Mega Abomasnow. It should be brought in on predicted double switches into defensively based Pokemon, such as Swampert, Alomomola, and Hippowdon. If brought in safely against something it can check, Mega Abomasnow doesn't have a lot of switch-ins against offensive teams, but it can still bust through Pokemon with its hard hitting Blizzard. It cannot do much late-game other than fire off an Ice Shard due to its bad Speed and poor defensive typing. Lastly, Abomasnow should have entry hazards removed before coming onto the field, as it doesn't appreciate residual damage whatsoever.

Team Options
========

Good Trick Room setters such as Reuniclus, Cresselia, and Bronzong are bulky enough to set up Trick Room, which makes them great teammates for Mega Abomasnow. Faster Pokemon such as Infernape and Mienshao should come in to take out Steel-type threats such as Registeel and Mega Aggron. Swampert makes for an excellent teammate, as it walls Fire-types very well for Mega Abomasnow. U-turn from teammates such as Jirachi, Hydreigon, and Mienshao help get Mega Abomasnow in and gain momentum. Finally, Rapid Spin users such as Forretress, Tentacruel, and Donphan immensely improve Mega Abomasnow's longevity and the number of times it can switch in.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Wood Hammer
move 3: Ice Shard
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Soundproof
item: Abomasite
evs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Swords Dance is the main move of the set, as it bolsters Mega Abomasnow's great Attack stat to monstrous levels. Wood Hammer is a very powerful physical STAB move, although it has huge recoil. Ice Shard is a STAB priority move that is good at finishing off faster threats such as Noivern and Hydreigon, while Earthquake hits Fire-types on the switch and OHKOes them most of the time.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs add bulk to Mega Abomasnow and allow it to switch in to Stealth Rock more times, while 252 Attack EVs with a Adamant nature max out Abomasnow's Attack. 8 Special Defense EVs are used for a little bulk and to give Porygon-Z the wrong Download boost, and, although minor, Soundproof is the preferred ability before Mega Evolution, as it allows Mega Abomasnow to switch into sound-based moves such as Bug Buzz. Hail also isn't beneficial for the team unless Mega Abomasnow is taking advantage of it.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Abomasnow only needs to worry about attacking, which is its only duty. However, it is advised to predict when a Fire-type will switch in to take the opportunity to hit them hard with Earthquake. This set should be used as a late-game sweeper, as Mega Abomasnow can pick off weakened opponents with hard-hitting moves.

Team Options
========

Mega Abomasnow appreciates team support from a myriad of different Pokemon. Infernape is an excellent partner to get rid of Steel-types such as Metagross and Jirachi with a STAB move, as Mega Abomasnow will either be crippled or KOed before it can 2HKO the troublesome Steel-types with Earthquake. Rotom-H can take any hit that Fire-types can offer and cripple Fighting-types with Will-O-Wisp. Forretress, Empoleon, Crobat, and Tentacruel provide Rapid Spin or Defog support against Stealth Rock and Spikes, which are a huge problem for Mega Abomasnow. Dugtrio makes for a good partner, as it can trap and KO troublesome Fire-types for Mega Abomasnow. Fire-types make excellent teammates, as they pressure your opponent to send in their bulky Water-types, which Mega Abomasnow beats and can set up on. Chandelure and Arcanine fill this role well, as they absorb Fire- and Fighting-type attacks well and can also beat troublesome Steel-types for Mega Abomasnow.

Other Options
########

Abomasnow is limited to very few other options. Mega Abomasnow can run a SubSeed set which was very good in BW UU, but it faces too many threats such as Darmanitan and Entei now to use it effectively. A Choice Scarf set can be used to outspeed Hydreigon, but outside of its Mega forme, Abomasnow isn't very strong. Finally, Focus Blast can be used as coverage over Earthquake, but Mega Abomasnow already fulfills its coverage needs well.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Darmanitan, Rotom-H, Entei, Infernape, and Arcanine all can outspeed Mega Abomasnow and OHKO it with a Fire-type STAB move. They must be wary of Earthquake, however.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types can cripple or KO Mega Abomasnow that lack Fighting-type teammates before it can effectively use Earthquake or any other attacks. Mega Aggron, Lucario, and Magneton can easily KO Abomasnow with a STAB move.

**Entry Hazards**: Entry hazards such as Spikes and especially Stealth Rock hurt Mega Abomasnow, as it does not appreciate the residual damage due to being inclined to switch frequently.

**Super effective STAB moves**: Mega Abomasnow's bad defensive typing leaves it susceptible to STAB Fighting-, Bug-, Flying-, Poison-, and Rock-type moves from a variety of Pokemon. Hard hits that can KO Mega Abomasnow include Machamp's Dynamic Punch, Nidoking's Sludge Wave, Crobat's Brave Bird, Mega Aerodactyl's Stone Edge and Aerial Ace, and Galvantula's Bug Buzz.
