Overview
########

Abomasnow has a great offensive typing, being able to threaten Water-types and top-tier threats such as Salamence, Mega Aerodactyl, and Crobat alike. While all these threats are faster than Abomasnow, it has a great priority move in Ice Shard, meaning it can pick off all of them fairly easily. Its typing gives it some nice resistances to Water, Ground, and Electric. It also can boost its Attack with Swords Dance quite easily, as it can force a lot of switches. Mega Abomasnow also gains a great Speed tier for Trick Room teams, as its abysmal base 30 Speed is one of the "fastest" Speed stats under Trick Room.

Unfortunately Abomasnow has one of the worst defensive typings, which gives it common weaknesses to Fire, Fighting, and Flying, and this also undermines the nice 90 / 105 / 105 bulk Mega Abomasnow has. Mega Abomasnow loses Speed, which can be great for Trick Room teams, but it isn't that great otherwise, as a lot of common UU walls, such as Umbreon, Vaporeon, Florges, and Tentacruel, outspeed and can proceed to get a free Wish off against Mega Abomasnow or threaten it with a Scald or STAB Sludge Bomb in Tentacruel's case.

Barack Aboma
########
name: Barack Aboma
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Wood Hammer / Seed Bomb
move 3: Ice Shard
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Soundproof
item: Abomasite
evs: 76 HP / 252 Atk / 180 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Swords Dance is the boosting move of choice, skyrocketing Abomasnow's Attack to a scary level. Wood Hammer is used to hit bulky Water-types hard, albeit with nasty recoil damage. Seed Bomb can be used instead if you don't like the recoil Wood Hammer brings, but you lose a lot of power. Ice Shard gives Abomasnow a powerful STAB move after Swords Dance and a form of priority. Earthquake hits the Steel-types that commonly switch into Mega Abomasnow.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack EVs are used to take advantage of Mega Abomasnow's amazing power while 180 Speed EVs allow Mega Abomasnow to outspeed Relaxed Swampert. Abomasite is obligatory so that Abomasnow can Mega Evolve. An Adamant nature allows Mega Abomasnow to hit as hard as possible, especially after a Swords Dance boost. Soundproof isn't useful on this set, but it can come in handy for setup opportunities, as it blocks sound moves such as Bug Buzz, Hyper Voice, and Boomburst.

Usage Tips
========

This set can work as both a wallbreaker and a win condition, as it hits hard initially and can proceed to overpower the opponent's team thanks to its access to Swords Dance. This set needs a ton of support to be truly effective, as its slow Speed stat and its bulk can only take it so far.

Team Options
========

This set appreciates wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Entei or Life Orb Darmanitan, to wear down Steel-types while also hitting a lot of foes for a massive amount of damage. This set really appreciates Spikes support from Pokemon such as Chesnaught or Roserade to wear down the Steel-types that commonly switch in, as Mega Abomasnow can force a lot of switches thanks to its STAB coverage. This set also appreciates entry hazard removal from Tentacruel or Crobat, as Mega Abomasnow has no reliable recovery and is susceptible to all entry hazards.

President Snow
########
name: President Snow
move 1: Blizzard
move 2: Wood Hammer / Giga Drain
move 3: Ice Shard
move 4: Earthquake / Focus Blast
ability: Soundproof
item: Abomasite
evs: 8 HP / 68 Atk / 252 SpA / 180 Spe
nature: Mild

Moves
========

Blizzard is Abomasnow's most reliable STAB move in hail and is its most powerful STAB move. Wood Hammer is used to nail special walls trying to switch into Blizzard. Giga Drain is an option, however, to have a way of recovering and still hits targets that are weak to it such as Swampert and Vaporeon pretty hard. Ice Shard gives Abomasnow a priority move that can nail a lot of faster threats that may threaten it. Earthquake is used to get around Steel-types not named Mega Aggron and Fire-types that try to switch into Abomasnow's STAB moves. Focus Blast can be used instead to hit Mega Aggron a bit harder, but it loses out on coverage against Fire-types.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack EVs are used to let Abomasnow hit as hard as it can with its most powerful STAB move, Blizzard. 180 Speed EVs allow Abomasnow to outspeed Relaxed Swampert. 8 HP EVs hit a Stealth Rock number, and the rest is dumped into Attack to let Abomasnow's other moves hit as hard as possible. Abomasite is given item, as otherwise Abomasnow cannot proceed to Mega Evolve. A Mild nature is used to boost Abomasnow's Special Attack while lowering its less important Defense, as Abomasnow's resistances are usually more specially based. Soundproof is used before Mega Evolution to avoid sound moves such as Yanmega's Bug Buzz or Exploud's Boomburst. It also allows for more hail turns for Mega Abomasnow to spam Blizzard.

Usage Tips
========

This set should be used on a bulky offensive team looking for a decent wallbreaker with priority. Abomasnow must be wary of any Pokemon faster than it that resists its priority or that it cannot afford to take a hit from, such as Entei or Darmanitan. Plan to bring this set out early- or mid-game to punch holes while softening up bulky foes.

Team Options
========

Trick Room is a great option, as Mega Abomasnow's base 30 Speed allows it to outspeed almost everything in UU under Trick Room. Slowking is a particularly good partner as it has excellent defensive synergy with Mega Abomasnow, resisting Fire, Fighting, and Steel while Mega Abomasnow resists Grass and Electric; it can also set up Trick Room multiple times thanks to its ability Regenerator and its access to Slack Off. Entei is a good partner to form a wallbreaking core and it has great offensive and defensive synergy with Abomasnow. Abomasnow appreciates entry hazard removal from the likes of Tentacruel or Crobat, as both can get rid of all entry hazards fairly easily without compounding Abomasnow's weaknesses.

Other Options
########

Substitute and Leech Seed can provide Mega Abomasnow with a way to avoid status and give it a form of recovery; it also has an Ice-type STAB move to threaten the Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed. However, Abomasnow has one of the worst defensive typings in the game and can therefore be worn down easily. A specially defensive set can be used to take advantage of Abomasnow's nice resistances to Water, Electric, and Grass; however, while Mega Abomasnow has some useful resistances, it has too many weaknesses to truly take advantage of its solid 90 / 105 / 105 bulk. Hidden Power Fire is an option on the second set specifically to hit Forretress harder than any other move Mega Abomasnow has to offer, but every other Steel-type is hit harder by Focus Blast, and Earthquake hits both Steel- and Fire-types super effectively. Grass Knot is an option to hit heavy Pokemon, such as Hippowdon, harder than Giga Drain or Wood Hammer would, but most Pokemon are hit harder by Wood Hammer, and Mega Abomasnow likes the recovery Giga Drain can provide.

Checks & Counters
########

**Stealth Rock**: Stealth Rock limits the number of times Mega Abomasnow can switch in, meaning it cannot set up or punch holes in the opposing team effectively.

**Steel-types**: Mega Aggron can tank a +2 Earthquake and proceed to cripple Mega Abomasnow with Thunder Wave, though if Mega Aggron lacks Thunder Wave, Swords Dance Mega Abomasnow can overpower it. Bronzong can also wall Abomasnow, as it is immune to Earthquake thanks to its ability, Levitate, but it has the potential to be 2HKOed by Abomasnow's +2 Wood Hammer after Stealth Rock and hail damage. Assault Vest Escavalier is another threat, as it can tank any hit from Abomasnow and has a reliable, super effective STAB move to hit Abomasnow with; however, it cannot switch into a +2 Earthquake more than once, meaning it has to stay healthy to check Mega Abomasnow. Forretress is also worn down by a +2 Earthquake, as its only form of super effective damage is Gyro Ball, which is only a 4HKO thanks to Mega Abomasnow's abysmal base 30 Speed.

**Fire-types**: Any Fire-types in UU, such as Entei and Darmanitan, resist Ice Shard and can proceed to OHKO Abomasnow with their STAB moves, but they do not like switching into Earthquake.

**Fighting-types**: Mienshao, Infernape, Heracross, and Machamp all outspeed and OHKO Mega Abomasnow. Infernape also resists both its STAB moves, but it hates Earthquake.
