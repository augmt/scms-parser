Overview
########

As a Fairy-type cleric, Aromatisse faces stiff competition for a teamslot, as Florges has greater Speed, power, and special bulk. However, Florges lacks Aromatisse's raw physical bulk and HP, which allows it to survive attacks from Choice Band Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Heracross more comfortably. Granbull is another pure Fairy-type that is able to survive the same physical onslaughts thanks to its access to Intimidate. However, it lacks Wish, making it unable to provide recovery to its teammates. Aromatisse also stands out with its unique ability in Aroma Veil, which grants immunity to Taunt and Encore. This ability comes in handy against common threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Alakazam.

However, Aromatisse has low Speed, average offensive stats, and only above-average defensive stats for a wall. As a result, it falls prey to common wallbreakers that resist Fairy-type moves, such as Choice Band Entei, Nidoqueen, and Nidoking. In addition, its reliance on Wish to recover health gives it a hard time against phazers, many of which have the bulk to take a Moonblast. Altogether, while Aromatisse does have a somewhat shallow movepool and a few glaring faults, it makes for a very viable choice as a wall on balanced and stall teams alike.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Wish
move 2: Protect
move 3: Moonblast
move 4: Aromatherapy
ability: Aroma Veil
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Wish is Aromatisse's only reliable form of recovery, and it is also able to provide good support by healing teammates. Protect guarantees the Wish is received, as well as allowing passive recovery from Leftovers and scouting Choice-locked attacks. Moonblast is used as a STAB attack that is able to OHKO Haxorus after Stealth Rock. Aromatherapy provides further team support by removing any status effects.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize physical bulk, as that's the only reason Aromatisse should be used over Florges. Leftovers gives Aromatisse some passive recovery. Aroma Veil gives Aromatisse immunity to Taunt and Encore.

Usage Tips
========

Aromatisse's resistance to Dark-, Bug-, and Fighting-type attacks lets it switch into threats such as Mega Absol, Heracross, and Mienshao. Its Dragon-type immunity allows it to check threats such as Hydreigon and Haxorus, as they are not able to use their most powerful moves, Draco Meteor and Outrage, respectively. Wish in conjunction with Protect is a means of reliable recovery for Aromatisse and its teammates, but it should be used wisely, as it could give the opponent a free turn to set up. Be wary of phazers, as they can force Aromatisse out through Protect and ruin its Wish recovery.

Team Options
========

Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert can switch into powerful Fire-types such as Entei and Darmanitan, which threaten Aromatisse. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Snorlax can reliably take hits from Poison-type special attackers such as Nidoqueen and Roserade, and in return Aromatisse can deal with Heracross and Machamp. Grounded Poison-types such as Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Amoonguss are great to soak up Toxic Spikes which Aromatisse hates switching in on. Aromatisse should be used on full stall or semi stall as Florges is better suited for balance.

Other Options
########

Thanks to Aromatisse's immunity to Taunt, it is able to make great use of the support options it has, including Trick Room and dual screens. It can also make use of Calm Mind to threaten some stall teams, although Florges is usually better for that role. Toxic can be used to cripple switch-ins, but Steel- and Poison-types are both immune to it and commonly switch into Aromatisse. Psychic can be used to nail Poison-types such as Nidoking and Crobat. Disable can be annoying for certain foes, but overall it is extremely situational.

Checks & Counters
########

**Poison-types**: Roserade, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Tentacruel can all easily switch into Moonblasts and proceed to either set up entry hazards or demolish Aromatisse with high-powered STAB Poison-type attacks.

**Fire-types**: Darmanitan, Entei, and Chandelure are easily able to switch into Aromatisse and break past its above-average defenses. Chandelure in particular can use Substitute and set up Calm Mind.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Doublade can easily come in on a resisted Moonblast and threaten Aromatisse out with a powerful Steel-type STAB move.

**Super Effective Coverage**: While Aromatisse is meant to be a solid counter to Fighting-types as well as Dragons, many of them are known to carry surprise coverage for Fairies. Notable examples of this are Iron Tail Salamence and Poison Jab Mienshao.

**Powerful Special Attackers**: Because its only viable spread in UU is a physically defensive spread, Aromatisse takes massive damage from strong special attackers such as Mega Pidgeot and Mega Blastoise.

**Bulky Setup Sweepers**: Due to its low damage output, Aromatisse is setup fodder for bulky setup attackers such as Suicune and Snorlax, which can proceed to Calm Mind or Curse up to +6 and inflict big damage.
