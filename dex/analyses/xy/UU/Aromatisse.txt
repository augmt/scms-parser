Overview
########

As a Fairy-type cleric, Aromatisse faces stiff competition for a teamslot. Florges has greater Speed, power, and special bulk. However, Florges lacks Aromatisse's raw physical bulk, which lets it survive attacks from Choice Banded Fighting-types such as Mienshao. Granbull is another pure Fairy-type that is able to survive the same physical onslaughts thanks to its access to Intimidate. However, it lacks Wish, making it unable to provide recovery to its teammates. Aromatisse also stands out with its unique ability in Aroma Veil, which grants immunity to Taunt and Encore. This ability comes in handy against common threats such as Sableye and Alakazam.

However, Aromatisse has low Speed, average offensive stats, and only above-average defensive stats for a wall. As a result, it falls prey to common wallbreakers that resist Fairy-type moves, such as Choice Band Victini, Nidoqueen, and Nidoking. In addition, its reliance on Wish to recover health gives it a hard time against phazers, many of which have the bulk to take a Moonblast. Altogether, while Aromatisse does have a somewhat shallow movepool and a few glaring faults, it makes a very viable choice as a wall on balance and stall teams alike.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Wish
move 2: Protect
move 3: Moonblast
move 4: Aromatherapy
ability: Aroma Veil
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Wish is Aromatisse's only reliable form of recovery, but it is also able to provide good support by healing teammates. Protect guarantees the recovery, as well as allowing recovery from Leftovers and scouting Choice-locked attacks. Moonblast is used as a STAB attack, and is able to OHKO Haxorus after Stealth Rock. Aromatherapy provides further team support by removing any status effects and is especially useful against Sableye, which Aromatisse hard counters.

Set Details
========

The EVs are used to maximize physical bulk, as Aromatisse's greater physical bulk is the only reason for it to be used over Florges. Leftovers gives it passive recovery. Aroma Veil grants immunity to Taunt and Encore.

Usage Tips
========

Aromatisse's resistance to Dark-, Bug-, and Fighting-type attacks lets it switch into threats such as Mega Absol and Mienshao. Its Dragon-type immunity comes in handy against Haxorus, Flygon, and Hydreigon, preventing them from using their high-powered STAB attacks. Wish and Protect are used for reliable recovery but should be used sparingly, as they could otherwise give an opponent a free turn to boost up. Be aware of phazers too, as they are able to bypass Protect and mess up Wish recovery.

Team Options
========

Bulky Water-types such as Swampert, Suicune, and Alomomola are able to check wallbreakers like Victini and Darmanitan, which otherwise plow straight through Aromatisse. Specially defensive Umbreon, Snorlax, and Blissey can take care of special attackers such as Roserade, Nidoqueen, and Nidoking. In return, Aromatisse handles Mienshao and Mega Absol. Mega Blastoise can also be used to clear entry hazards and appreciates Aromatisse's ability to both pass Wishes and deal with Sableye, the only common spinblocker that can check Mega Blastoise.

Other Options
########

Thanks to Aromatisse's immunity to Taunt, it is able to make great use of support options it has, including Trick Room and dual screens. It can also make use of Calm Mind to threaten some stall teams, although Florges is usually better for that role. Toxic can be used to cripple switch-ins, but Steel- and Poison-types are both immune to it, and commonly switch into Aromatisse. Psychic can be used to nail Poison-types such as Nidoking and Crobat. Disable can be annoying for certain opponents, but overall it is extremely situational.

Checks & Counters
########

**Poison-types**: Roserade, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Tentacruel all easily switch into Moonblasts and proceed to either set up entry hazards or demolish Aromatisse with high-powered STAB Poison-type attacks. Psychic can dent them, but doesn't OHKO.

**Fire-types**: Victini, Darmanitan, Entei, and Chandelure are easily able to switch into Aromatisse and break past its above-average defenses. Chandelure in particular can use Substitute and set up Calm Mind.

**Steel-types**: Mega Aggron easily switches in and threatens to OHKO with Heavy Slam. It can even use Roar to disrupt Aromatisse's Wish recovery, putting it in a bad position. While Aromatisse is too slow to be affected by Gyro Ball, Forretress is easily able to set up entry hazards.

**Poison Jab**: While Aromatisse is meant to be a solid counter to Fighting-types as well as Haxorus, many of them are able to carry surprise coverage in Poison Jab, which can easily 2HKO Aromatisse.
