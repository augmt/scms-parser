Overview
########

Gligar has many great qualities and can offer a lot to teams in need of a Stealth Rock setter or Defog user. It has a great defensive typing, being immune to Electric- and Ground-type moves as well as having many resistances that allow it to check important Pokemon in the tier, such as Mienshao. In addition, Gligar has a nice ability in Immunity, which prevents it from being poisoned, and great support moves such as Taunt, Knock Off, and Defog. Gligar also has a reliable recovery move in Roost to allow itself to stay healthy throughout the match. However, Gligar is not without its flaws. It has subpar offensive stats as well as a mediocre Special Defense stat. Gligar also has a quadruple weakness to Ice-type attacks and is weak to common Water-type attacks in the tier. Its reliance on Eviolite for added bulk really hurts it, as the move Knock Off has increased in popularity, greatly decreasing its effectiveness. Gligar also faces competition from other Defog users in the metagame, such as Crobat and Empoleon. Altogether, Gligar has a niche in the tier as a good physical wall and supporter and can be great if played to its strengths.

item: Eviolite

nature: Impish

Moves
========

Gligar can easily set up Stealth Rock because it forces many switches, and it should be used with the ability Immunity as it prevents Gligar from being poisoned. Defog is a nice alternative though, as it allows Gligar to support its team and remove entry hazards, but it is incompatible with Immunity. Roost provides Gligar with a reliable recovery move, healing half of its maximum HP every time it is used. Earthquake is the STAB move of choice, allowing Gligar to finish off weakened foes, while also stopping Gligar from being total setup bait. Since Gligar has almost no offensive pressure whatsoever, Toxic allows it to inflict passive damage and put a timer on deadly sweepers or walls that may be problematic. Knock Off can be also used because it lets Gligar remove items such as Eviolite or Leftovers and helps greatly against stall-based teams. Lastly, U-turn allows Gligar to provide momentum for the team.

Set Details
========

The given EVs maximize Gligar's ability to take most neutral physical attacks. Eviolite is the only item that should be considered because it boosts Gligar's already usable defenses to modest levels. An Impish nature lets Gligar to take physical hits better. Since Defog is illegal with Immunity, use Hyper Cutter when using Defog sets.

Usage Tips
========

Be careful when switching into Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mienshao. The majority of the time they will carry Knock Off, and if Eviolite is removed from Gligar, it hinders its defensive capabilities greatly, though it is still highly capable of walling the likes of Toxicroak and Mienshao. However, if they are Choice locked and you have over seventy percent HP, predicting a switch and using U-turn is a good idea, as it provides valuable momentum to the team. Try using Roost wisely, as against stall-based teams, it is a very valuable move. In addition, use Defog when needed. Since Gligar forces quite a lot of switches, use the time to remove the entry hazards on your field or set up your own Stealth Rock.

Team Options
========

Gligar fits well on balanced or stall-based teams because it is a fantastic physical wall and has access to Stealth Rock and Defog. Status support is really appreciated, as it allows Gligar to stall out the majority of the tier. Great partners for Gligar are Water-types. They can switch into the Water- and Ice-type moves aimed at Gligar, while Gligar can switch into the Electric-type moves aimed at them. Empoleon, especially, has great type synergy with Gligar. Cleric support is also very appreciated, as Gligar has no way of removing the burn status; Umbreon and Florges make fantastic partners because they both have access to Wish and can remove status with either Heal Bell or Aromatherapy, respectively.

Other Options
########

Aerial Ace allows Gligar to deal massive damage to Chesnaught although it isn't very offensively inclined and Aerial Ace isn't that strong, but it is a decent STAB attack. A Baton Pass set with Agility or Swords Dance can be used. Taunt is another nice option, as it shuts down slower Pokemon and walls. Counter is also an interesting option that can be run on Gligar for surprising physical attackers. RestTalk can also be used to get rid of status, although it's not very reliable.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Suicune, Milotic, and Vaporeon take pitiful damage from Gligar's moves and retaliate with a super effective Scald or Ice Beam.

**Special attackers**: Special attackers can direct their strong special attacks at Gligar and KO it. Pokemon such as Mismagius, Kyurem, and Starmie fall into this category.

**Taunt users**: Fast Taunt users can stop Gligar in its tracks and render it setup bait.

**Crobat**: Crobat is immune to Toxic and Earthquake, while also having access to Taunt to shut down Gligar.

**Shaymin**: Shaymin can get rid of the Toxic status thanks to Natural Cure and can threaten Gligar with a powerful Seed Flare or Hidden Power Ice.

**Roserade**: Having a higher Special Attack than Shaymin, Roserade can hit Gligar hard with its Grass-type STAB. It takes decent damage from Earthquake and is also immune to Toxic.

**Ice-type Pokemon and Moves**: Ice-type Pokemon or moves can easily force Gligar out because it has a quadruple weakness to it. Kyurem in particular can outspeed Gligar and OHKO with Ice Beam.

**Xatu**: Xatu has the ability Magic Bounce, which allows it to deflect Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Taunt for its own use.

**Porygon2**: Porygon2 takes any hit Gligar throws at it but has to be wary of Knock Off. It can also use its ability Trace to copy Immunity or KO with Ice Beam.

**Knock Off users**: Knock Off removes Gligar's Eviolite and thus permanently hinders its ability to take hits.
