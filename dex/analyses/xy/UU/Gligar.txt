Overview
########

Gligar is a great Pokemon in the UU metagame, boasting awesome 65 / 105 / 65 defenses coupled with a typing that gives Gligar immunities to Ground and Electric and resistances to common types in UU, such as Bug and Fighting. Thanks to its typing, it is also the only Flying-type in UU that isn't weak to Stealth Rock, making it a reliable Defogger, as it isn't worn down as easily as other common Defoggers in UU. It also sports an impressive support movepool with moves such as Taunt, Knock Off, U-turn, Stealth Rock, Defog, and Roost.

While it has an amazing movepool, typing, and stats, Gligar has its share of flaws. Gligar's reliance on Eviolite for its bulk means it must watch out for Knock Off, which runs rampant throughout UU. Knock Off is also a common coverage move on a lot of Fighting-types that Gligar would otherwise have no trouble switching into. Another problem Gligar has is that while it is one of the most reliable Defoggers, its preferred ability, Immunity, is illegal in conjuction with Defog. Gligar's 4x weakness to Ice can be problematic when trying to fit it onto teams. Another flaw is its poor offensive potential, meaning U-turn is almost a necessity to maintain momentum.

Standard
########
name: Standard
move 1: Roost
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Defog / Stealth Rock
move 4: U-turn / Stealth Rock
ability: Hyper Cutter / Immunity
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Roost is used for reliable recovery and to weaken the blow of an incoming Ice-type move if needed. Earthquake hits for a nice amount of damage against threats that Gligar tends to wall, such as Lucario, Darmanitan, and Entei. Gligar can reliably use Defog multiple times throughout the match thanks to Roost and U-turn. Stealth Rock can be used over Defog if the support isn't needed. U-turn allows Gligar to switch out and into an appropriate check or counter after Defogging, maintaining momentum. Stealth Rock can be used instead if you want the entry hazard support alongside Defog.

Set Details
========

This set aims to take advantage of Gligar's amazing bulk, thanks to Eviolite, and typing to reliably get rid of entry hazards multiple times throughout the match. Eviolite boosts Gligar's defensive stats by 50%, allowing it to tank many non-STAB Ice-type moves. The EV spread allows Gligar to make use of its impressive base 105 Defense stat and nice resistances to Bug and Fighting. Hyper Cutter must be used in conjunction with Defog; if Defog is not being used, then Gligar should Immunity, which is the better ability. 248 HP / 16 Def / 244 SpD is an alternate spread that is geared toward patching up Gligar's average base 65 Special Defense stat, allowing it to tank hits from the likes of Life Orb Hydreigon. An Impish nature must be used with this particular spread to allow Gligar to hit a jump point in Defense while increasing its overall bulk. This spread takes on Mega Ampharos better as well, as Dragon Pulse can only 3HKO while Gligar can 2HKO standard Mega Ampharos with Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage.

Usage Tips
========

This set should be brought in on a Fighting-type Pokemon such as Heracross or Mienshao, as both cannot stand to beat Gligar if locked into one of their STAB moves. Gligar must, however, watch out for Knock Off, which can cripple Gligar for the rest of the match. This set can also come in on a stray Thunder Wave or other Electric-type move and proceed to gain momentum via U-turn or Defog entry hazards away.

Team Options
========

Water-types are great partners for Gligar, as they can switch into the Water- and Ice-type moves, while Gligar covers Electric- and Grass-types for them. Vaporeon is a particularly good partner, as it can provide Wish support and is also immune to Water-type moves thanks to its Water Absorb ability. Special walls, such as Blissey and Umbreon, complement Gligar's natural physical bulk with their natural special bulk. Both also provide Heal Bell and Wish support, increasing Gligar's longevity. This set tends to shine on balanced teams that can afford having to cover weaknesses to Water- and Ice-type moves and need a solid Defogger that isn't weak to Electric or Rock.

Other Options
########

Swords Dance + Baton Pass is a viable strategy for Gligar, as Gligar's typing, coupled with Eviolite, allows it to take hits fairly easily, set up, pass +2 attack to a teammate. Although Gligar is bulky enough to take repeated hits, Baton Pass in itself is a niche strategy. Taunt can be used with a faster EV spread, as Gligar outspeeds a lot of walls and can easily force them out after it used Taunt. Toxic + Immunity can be used to outstall a lot of Pokemon, as with Immunity, a burn is the only status effect that can wear Gligar down, and Toxic puts the foe on a turn-by-turn timer. Knock Off cripples other walls that may switch into Gligar. Acrobatics can be used in place of Earthquake to check Swords Dance Heracross better, as it tends use Knock Off or Swords Dance when facing Gligar.

Checks & Counters
########

**Knock Off**: Knock Off is extremely common in the UU metagame, and as such, Gligar must be wary of losing its Eviolite, which highly compromises its bulk.

**Bulky Water-types**: Water-types such as Vaporeon are great switch-ins to Gligar, as they can not switch into any of Gligar's attacks, but also use their effective STAB moves with which to hit Gligar for great damage.

**Setup Sweepers**: Most setup sweepers, such as Calm Mind Reuniclus, Calm Mind Cresselia, Hone Claws Mega Aerodactyl, and Dragon Dance Salamence, can easily set up on Gligar, especially if it lacks U-turn, as Gligar has poor offensive potential. Substitute setup sweepers in particular, such as Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune, give Gligar trouble, as its U-turn cannot break their Substitutes.

**Status**: While it is immune to Thunder Wave, burns still cripple Gligar, putting it on a timer while weakening the power of its moves. Toxic can also hit non-Immunity variants of Gligar, pressuring it even more.

**Taunt**: Gligar is severly hampered by Taunt, and there are many faster Taunt users in UU, such as Krookodile, Crobat, and Mega Aerodactyl.
