Overview
########

With a great defensive typing and excellent natural bulk, Tentacruel has carved a niche for itself as one of the best utility Pokemon in the tier. Tentacruel is one of the few Pokemon in UU that has access to both Rapid Spin and Toxic Spikes, which helps it fill a spot in almost every team archetype. Tentacruel also has a great Speed tier for a utility pokemon, along with good offensive stats that give it a solid offensive presence. Unfortunately, Tentacruel's lack of recovery leaves it very prone to being worn down.

move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Toxic Spikes

move 4: Knock Off / Toxic / Sludge Bomb
ability: Liquid Ooze
item: Black Sludge
evs: 240 HP / 244 Def / 24 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Rapid Spin gets rid of entry hazards and supports its teammates. Toxic Spikes wears down the opponent's grounded Pokemon, and especially helps against bulky ones, such as Vaporeon, Chesnaught, and Swampert. Scald is a good STAB move that gives Tentacruel offensive presence and cripples physical attackers, thus complementing Tentacruel's physical bulk. Knock Off is great when paired with Toxic Spikes, as it helps by further wearing down the opponent's team and removing foe's items. Toxic helps wear down non-grounded Pokemon, which are immune to Toxic Spikes. Sludge Bomb is a secondary STAB move that helps Tentacruel beat Fairy- and Grass-types more effectively.

Set Details
========

The given EVs with a Bold nature maximize Tentacruel's physical bulk, allowing it to take on a plethora of Fire- and Fighting-types in the tier, as well as outspeeding Adamant Honchkrow. Black Sludge, Tentacruel's only method of recovery, is used over Leftovers to scare away Trick users. Liquid Ooze is the preferred ability, as it punishes Leech Seed, Giga Drain, and Drain Punch users. Liquid Ooze also allows Tentacruel to reliably beat Chesnaught, a common Spikes setter.

Usage Tips
========

Tentacruel should be brought in on weak or resisted hits to aid its team with Rapid Spin or Toxic Spikes. Even with HP and Defense investment, Tentacruel struggles with strong physical and special attacks, and as it lacks reliable recovery, it's important to keep it as healthy as possible. However, it should be brought in often if entry hazards are stacking up, as neither Tentacruel nor its teammates appreciate having to take the extra damage. In the event that Tentacruel is able to force a switch, try to set up Toxic Spikes or use Scald for a possible burn.

Team Options
========

Tentacruel appreciates Wish support; therefore, Pokemon such as Umbreon, Florges, and Aromatisse work well with it. Umbreon gets a special mention, as it has excellent synergy with Tentacruel; Tentacruel takes Fighting- and Bug-type attacks for Umbreon, while it takes Psychic-type attacks aimed at Tentacruel. Bulky Grass-types such as Shaymin work well, as they take on the Ground- and Electric-type Pokemon that give Tentacruel trouble. Pursuit trappers make for good partners, as they can trap the Psychic-types that give Tentacruel trouble. Krookodile gets a special mention here, as it can also hit the Steel- and Poison-types which are immune to Toxic&mdash;and the latter of which removes Tentacruel's Toxic Spikes. Hydreigon is a great partner for Tentacruel, as they have perfect defensive synergy together; Tentacruel resists all four of Hydreigon's weaknesses, and Hydreigon is immune to both Ground and Psychic and resists Electric. Pokemon that take advantage of Toxic Spikes are great partners for Tentacruel. Other hard-hitting Pokemon that appreciate Tentacruel's help in wearing down their grounded switch-ins, such as Mega Aerodactyl or Entei, are good partners for Tentacruel.

Other Options
########

Clear Body lets Tentacruel use Rapid Spin against Sticky Web teams without a Speed drop; however, Liquid Ooze is generally the superior option. Haze is an option to deal with setup sweepers that try to set up for free on Tentacruel. Finally, Ice Beam and Icy Wind are options to hit Dragon-types on the switch. Ice Beam hits harder, while Icy Wind offers significant utility to Tentacruel's teammates in speed control.

Checks & Counters
########

**Psychic-types**: Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Espeon take minimal damage from Scald and can threaten Tentacruel with a powerful STAB move.

**Dragon-types**: Every Dragon-type in the tier threatens Tentacruel with a strong STAB move or a boosting move, and doesn't care about Scald damage. Physical ones such as Salamence or Haxorus need a Lum Berry to avoid getting burned, though.

**Ground-types**: Most Ground-types can threaten out Tentacruel with an Earthquake. Krookodile, Nidoking, and Flygon are more dangerous as they can also outspeed Tentacruel. Swampert threatens Tentacruel and shrugs off damage from Scald.

**Electric-types**: Mega Ampharos, Heliolisk, and offensive Rotom-H threaten Tentacruel with STAB Thunderbolt and&mdash;with the exception of Rotom-H&mdash;don't care about Scald.

**Residual Damage**: Tentacruel lacks reliable recovery, so it has issues with being worn down by burn damage and other residual damage.
