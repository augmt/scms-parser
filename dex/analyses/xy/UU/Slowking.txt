Overview
########

Even though Slowking has an inferior Defense stat to Suicune, it is still a threat in UU. With the rare Water / Psychic typing shared only by Slowbro and Starmie, Slowking is offered numerous resistances to common Fire-, Fighting-, Water-, Ice-, Psychic-, and Steel-type moves. Backing these resistances are the ability Regenerator and access to the move Slack Off, both of which greatly improve Slowking's longevity, as well as solid 95/80/110 defenses. Slowking is no slouch offensively either, as it bears a respectable base 100 Special Attack and a diverse offensive movepool.

While Slowking is much more susceptible to physical attacks, especially Knock Off, than Vaporeon is, it is able to carve out its own niche in the metagame with the ability to sponge special attacks much more effectively, standing up to threats such as Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Azelf, and Noivern. This, on top of its superior movepool with exclusive access to Nasty Plot and Dragon Tail, means that Slowking is able to fulfill a utility-based role that Vaporeon can't accomplish.

Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Scald
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Dragon Tail
move 4: Ice Beam / Fire Blast
ability: Regenerator
item: Assault Vest
evs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpD
nature: Modest / Quiet

Moves
========

Scald is Slowking's primary STAB move, allowing it to spread burns while inflicting damage. Psyshock is Slowking's other STAB move, hitting specially defensive Pokemon such as Roserade and Florges on their weaker Defense stat. Dragon Tail is one of the big selling points of Slowking, as it can phaze Pokemon, hindering setup sweepers as well as possibly inflicting further damage with entry hazards. Ice Beam and Fire Blast are both able to hit the Grass-types that Slowking tends to attract. Ice Beam is generally more useful, as it is able to hit Hydreigon and other Dragon-types super effectively. Fire Blast, however, deals much more damage to Steel-types, such as Forretress, Cobalion, and Escavalier.

Set Details
========

Assault Vest boosts Slowking's excellent Special Defense to even greater heights, letting Slowking sponge a multitude of special attacks, even most of the ones it's weak to. Regenerator makes Slowking incredibly hard to wear down, restoring 33% of its HP upon switching out. The given EV spread maximizes Slowking's HP while giving it as much of an offensive presence as possible with the leftover EVs placed into Special Defense, as even without investment, Slowking's Special Defense is staggeringly high with Assault Vest equipped. However, if Slowking needs to take special attacks more easily, an alternate spread of 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 SpD can be used to maximize Special Defense while allowing Slowking to OHKO offensive Roserade with Psyshock. A Quiet nature with 12 Attack EVs can be used so that Dragon Tail is able to reliably break Kingdra's Substitutes. Focus Blast can be used in the fourth moveslot to hit Dark- and Steel-types switching in, but be wary of its shaky accuracy. Grass Knot can also be used if your team requires support against bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Mega Blastoise, though it isn't useful for much else.

Usage Tips
========

This Slowking set functions as an offensive pivot that doubles as a special tank, so it's best used when switching in on special attackers it's effectively able to check, sponging a hit, and responding with the appropriate coverage move. Pokemon such as Noivern, Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Starmie, and Porygon-Z are effectively checked by this set. Because of its ability Regenerator, switching in and out with Slowking is actually encouraged as it replenishes HP, offsetting damage taken from entry hazards, weaker or resisted attacks, and status. Thanks to Dragon Tail, Slowking is able to check most Calm Mind users in the tier and force them out. This allows it to keep them at bay, repeatedly deterring setup throughout the early- and mid-game phases. Assault Vest Slowking can even survive special attacks it's weak to in a pinch, including STAB moves from Chandelure, Roserade, Hydreigon, Rotom-H, Mega Houndoom, and Raikou, though it's not advised to let Slowking take these attacks unless Slowking is able to take out the attacker immediately afterward. For the most part, it's best to have a backup special wall to handle the aforementioned special attackers, which Slowking prefers not to deal with.

Team Options
========

Because this set is more of an offensive pivot that doubles as a special tank, backing from a specially defensive Pokemon that can handle special moves it normally doesn't want to take is helpful. Umbreon and Florges are both valuable, as they both cover some of Slowking's weaknesses. Florges is especially notable, as it can sponge Dark- and Bug-type moves for Slowking, while Slowking can check Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Chandelure for Florges. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Mega Aggron, defensive Mega Ampharos, and Arcanine can form a defensive core with Slowking to cover physical and special attacks, taking the physical moves that Slowking otherwise falls victim to. These Pokemon are also notable for their ability to take Knock Off, a move that Slowking fares poorly against. Slowking has issues breaking through Florges, even with Psyshock, and Florges can't be forced out due to its immunity to Dragon Tail; partners who can take out Florges for Slowking, such as Crobat, Nidoking, Darmanitan, and Cobalion, are much appreciated. Because Slowking is able to phaze the opponent's Pokemon with Dragon Tail, entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish, Roserade, Chesnaught, Forretress, Donphan, and Mega Aggron are suitable partners, as the support they offer helps wear down the opposing team. Other Pokemon with Regenerator, such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Mienshao, can form an annoying Regenerator core that outlasts the opponent's Pokemon through constant switching.


Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Dragon Tail
move 2: Scald
move 3: Psyshock
move 4: Slack Off
ability: Regenerator
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpA
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Dragon Tail is listed first among Slowking's moves as the ability to phaze is what makes Slowking a viable option over the other bulky Water-types in the tier. Scald and Psyshock are STAB moves, the former being able to spread burns, and the latter hitting Pokemon such as Florges and Roserade harder. Slack Off gives Slowking a reliable way to regain HP without having to switch out.

Set Details
========

The given EVs maximize Slowking's physical bulk while giving Slowking a high chance to OHKO offensive Roserade with Psyshock. With a Bold nature, Slowking is able to survive most physical hits easily, though not as well as Suicune. In exchange for lesser physical bulk, however, Slowking has an inherently good Special Defense stat that should not be overlooked; this makes it somewhat of a mixed wall to an extent. Regenerator enables Slowking to recover HP as it switches, which is essential as this is a highly defensive set that relies on having as much HP as possible in order to do its job.

Usage Tips
========

This set exchanges better physical bulk for the ability to phaze with Dragon Tail. Take advantage of the phazing support it offers by pairing Slowking with entry hazard setters to help rack up damage throughout the opponent's team. You should also use Dragon Tail to oust Pokemon trying to set up on Slowking, such as Reuniclus and Suicune. As this set takes physical hits better than any of Slowking's other sets, it allows Slowking to more effectively check physical attackers such as Darmanitan, Cobalion, Victini, Crobat, Toxicroak, and Mienshao. Despite Slowking's inherently good Special Defense stat, this set's ability to survive special attacks is poor compared to the Assault Vest set, so try not to let Slowking take them unless it is either absolutely necessary to do so, or they are resisted hits. As Slack Off allows Slowking to recover HP without switching out, take use it to wear down opposing Pokemon passively through recoil or status when applicable.

Team Options
========

Pokemon such as Cobalion, Mega Aggron, Mega Ampharos, and Chesnaught partner well with physically defensive Slowking, as they can easily switch into Knock Off for it. Chesnaught is a noteworthy partner, as a core of Chesnaught and Slowking can stand up to the majority of the physical attackers in the tier. Slowking's ability to stand up to physical attackers allows it to form a defensive core with Pokemon that can take special attacks, such as Umbreon and Florges. Entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon, Mega Aggron, Forretress, Chesnaught, and Roserade can stack entry hazards to make phazing with Dragon Tail more damaging to the opponent's team. These Pokemon also appreciate Slowking's ability to handle Fire-type moves such as V-create and Flare Blitz from Victini and Darmanitan.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Scald / Surf
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Ice Beam / Fire Blast
move 4: Trick / Focus Blast
ability: Regenerator
item: Choice Specs
evs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpD
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Scald is preferred as Slowking's Water-type STAB move, as it's capable of inflicting burns, but Surf can be used for maximum damage output. Psyshock is necessary to hit Pokemon such as Florges and Roserade on their weaker physical Defense stat. Ice Beam and Fire Blast both hit the Grass-types that check Slowking; Ice Beam also nails Hydreigon and other Dragon-types, while Fire Blast immediately dispatches Steel-types such as Forretress, Cobalion and Escavalier. Trick is preferred for the last moveslot, as crippling special walls such as Florges, Umbreon, and Snorlax can prove to be invaluable in helping Slowking or its teammates, though Focus Blast allows Slowking to deal serious damage to Dark-types switching in. Grass Knot can also be used in the fourth moveslot if your team requires more support against bulky Water-type Pokemon; with Choice Specs, it's capable of nabbing a 2HKO on Mega Blastoise, Jellicent, Suicune, and Swampert.

Set Details
========

With a Modest nature and Choice Specs, Slowking reaches the full potential of its strength. Regenerator is Slowking's best ability, giving it access to reliable recovery while dealing damage throughout a match. The EVs listed give Slowking as much bulk and power as possible.

Usage Tips
========

Be advised that this set is significantly less bulky than the Assault Vest set, so Slowking's ability to switch in and out on attacks is reduced. With Regenerator, Slowking differentiates itself from other Choice item users, as they get worn down as they switch in and out repeatedly to change attacks, while Slowking receives 33% of its HP back when it switches out. This greatly eases the punishment associated with predicting incorrectly, though bear in mind that this doesn't grant Slowking absolute freedom to use any move; Slowking, like any other Choice item user, still relies heavily on using the correct move to put pressure on the opponent. On top of this, Slowking is slow, meaning it also depends on either hitting a Pokemon switching in or taking a blow and retaliating. Due to the surprise value of Trick, it's best to use the move after revealing to the opponent that Slowking is holding Choice Specs, as special walls like Umbreon and Florges will be much more likely to switch in on Slowking in the hopes of forcing it out and getting free turns.

Team Options
========

Choice Specs Slowking's hit-and-run nature lends it to being switched in and out numerous times, so partners that can cover its weaknesses allow it to constantly switch in much more easily. Grass-types such as Roserade, Shaymin, and Amoonguss can take the Grass- and Electric-type moves aimed at Slowking. Dark-types such as Hydreigon, Umbreon, and Mega Houndoom can switch in on the Dark- and Ghost-type moves directed at Slowking; the former two also check most Electric-type attackers while all three can check most Grass-types. Pokemon that can take the Bug- and Grass-type moves aimed at Slowking such as Chandelure, Arcanine, and Crobat are appreciated, as are Ground-types like Hippowdon, Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Swampert, which can absorb the Electric-type moves that Slowking is weak to. In return, Slowking can check most of the bulky Water-type Pokemon that give these Pokemon trouble, especially if it opts to run Grass Knot.


Offensive Trick Room
########
name: Offensive Trick Room
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Scald / Surf
move 3: Focus Blast / Fire Blast
move 4: Psyshock / Nasty Plot
ability: Regenerator
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
evs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpD
nature: Quiet
ivs: 0 Spe

Moves
========

Trick Room allows Slowking to support itself and its teammates by making faster Pokemon move second for five turns. Scald is preferred over Surf for the potential burn chance it offers, but Surf can still be used to give Slowking as much power as possible. Focus Blast is the preferred choice over Fire Blast, as it has better overall coverage, hitting Dark- and most Steel-type Pokemon for super effective damage. However, Focus Blast's shaky accuracy can be off-putting, and Fire Blast allows Slowking to readily take out Grass- and Steel-type Pokemon. Ice Beam can be used in the third moveslot but Slowking gets more use out of Focus Blast and Fire Blast, as they both have better power and coverage, which is essential considering Slowking has a limited number of turns to attack after setting up Trick Room. Psyshock is Slowking's backup STAB option, allowing it to cover even more Pokemon, targeting Florges and Roserade on their weaker defensive stat. If Psyshock's additional coverage is not needed, Nasty Plot can be used to make Slowking much more threatening under Trick Room. Nasty Plot also allows Slowking to become a greater offensive threat against defensive teams that aren't adversely affected by Trick Room.

Set Details
========

With a Quiet nature and a Speed IV of 0, Slowking is as slow as possible, which allows it to outspeed nearly the entire tier under Trick Room. With maximum HP and Special Attack, Slowking gets the bulk it needs to take hits while being able to hit as hard as possible. Regenerator restores Slowking's HP as it switches out, allowing it to set up Trick Room multiple times in a match if needed. Leftovers increases Slowking's longevity by giving it passive recovery and is the recommended item when running Nasty Plot. Life Orb is still usable, as Regenerator offsets the recoil damage it causes when Slowking attacks. Life Orb also allows Slowking to hit as hard as it possibly can, and it is especially favorable if Nasty Plot is not chosen, as if so, Slowking has no other means of boosting its power. If extra bulk is required, a specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 SpD with a Sassy nature can be used, with Nasty Plot to compensate for Slowking's lesser offensive presence. Slack Off can also be used to keep Slowking healthy without the need to switch, but this means it loses offensive potential by giving up either Nasty Plot or one of its coverage options.

Usage Tips
========

Because setting Trick Room up is the primary goal of this Slowking set, use the move as soon as the opportunity presents itself; from there, Slowking can go on the offensive, turning the Speed stats of faster Pokemon against them. If Slowking is running Nasty Plot, it's preferred to use it on a weaker move or a predicted switch, followed by setting up Trick Room afterward. This allows Slowking to have as many offensive turns as possible after setting up, making it an immediate threat for the opponent. Never set Nasty Plot up after using Trick Room unless it's absolutely necessary, because this will cost Slowking a vital turn it could be using to attack. Sadly, Slowking's selection of coverage choices will always leave it walled by something, so adjust your team according to what Slowking has trouble breaking through. With Fire Blast and Psyshock, Slowking will be unable to beat Umbreon and Hydreigon. The combination of Focus Blast and Psyshock leaves Slowking walled by Celebi and Chesnaught to a lesser extent, as Chesnaught's Defense allows it to survive a Psyshock if Life Orb is not chosen. With only Scald and Fire Blast, Slowking is walled by all bulky Water-types in the tier except Swampert, as well as Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Noivern, and Mega Ampharos. With only Scald and Focus Blast, Celebi, Roserade, Noivern, and Chesnaught are able to stop Slowking short. Lastly, Jellicent, and Starmie will wall Slowking by virtue of their typing regardless of what moves Slowking chooses to run.

Team Options
========

Slowking's use of Trick Room offers great support to Pokemon who can abuse it for themselves, such as Choice Band Snorlax, Reuniclus, Escavalier, Mega Ampharos, Exploud, and Druddigon. Druddigon, Mega Ampharos, and Escavalier also have notable synergy with Slowking, each covering some of its weaknesses. Pokemon that also set Trick Room, such as Aromatisse, Cofagrigus, Porygon2, and Bronzong, are able to support Slowking as well as the rest of their team.

Other Options
########

With its king-sized movepool, Slowking has a large stock of options at its disposal. Psychic can be used instead of Psyshock to deal more damage to physically defensive Pokemon, but it does much less to Florges and Roserade. Shadow Ball can be used to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types harder but it has little other utility outside of this. Slowking can use Curse to patch up its weaker defensive stat and boost its Attack, with access to usable physical moves such as Aqua Tail, Earthquake, Drain Punch, and Zen Headbutt. However, it is outclassed as a Curse sweeper by Mega Aggron and Snorlax, and its base 75 Attack stat leaves much to be desired even after a boost. Status moves such as Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Yawn are at Slowking's disposal, though they are difficult to fit into any of its sets. Supportive moves such as Magic Coat, Sunny Day, Rain Dance, Light Screen, and Disable are also available, but once again, are difficult to fit into any of Slowking's movesets. Foul Play can see some use to badly injure some of the physical attackers switching in on Slowking, though most of them are dealt with by the appropriate coverage move. Counter can also be used to surprise a physical attacker, compensating for Slowking's weaker Defense stat, though it is very situational and prediction-reliant. Block can be used to trap defensive Pokemon that can't beat Slowking, such as Vaporeon or Florges, and possibly even stall them out with Toxic and Slack Off, but there are better ways to deal with these Pokemon. Lastly, Belly Drum is in Slowking's movepool and can be fierce in conjunction with Trick Room, but Slowking is still susceptible to Sucker Punch, and it will have difficulty setting up both moves.


Checks & Counters
########

**Physical Attackers**: Physical attackers carrying super effective moves, especially Knock Off, are threats to Slowking. The physically defensive set is an exception to an extent, but Pokemon such as Life Orb Mienshao, lygon, Victini, and Snorlax can all deal serious damage to Slowking with the correct moves. However, most physical attackers can't switch in directly due to the risk of being burned by Scald.

**Special Walls**: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Florges, Umbreon, and Assault Vest Snorlax are capable of checking Slowking and forcing it out, though all three have to be wary of switching in on Trick from the Choice Specs set. The latter two can also be dealt with by Focus Blast, and Snorlax will be severely crippled by a burn from Scald.

**Dark-types**: Dark-types such as Mega Absol, Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Honchkrow may not always be able to switch in freely on Slowking unless it uses Psyshock, but they are able to revenge kill it, forcing Slowking out with the threat of being punished by their STAB moves. Honchkrow and Krookodile are especially dangerous for Slowking to deal with, as their access to Pursuit and Moxie means that Slowking can be trapped and KOed, giving them a free +1 Attack boost in the process.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Celebi, Roserade, and Shaymin can deal serious damage to Slowking, even if it carries Assault Vest. However, they all have to be wary of Fire Blast or Ice Beam, though Celebi and Shaymin have the natural bulk needed to survive a hit and threaten Slowking back afterward.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types like Chandelure, Trevenant, and Cofagrigus hit Slowking super effectively with their Ghost-type STAB moves, though Chandelure locked into a Fire-type move allows Slowking to come in freely, Cofagrigus has to beware of being worn down by Scald burns, and Trevenant has to worry about switching in on Fire Blast or Ice Beam. Trevenant, in particular, is a big issue for Slowking once it comes in, as both of its STAB moves in Wood Hammer and Shadow Claw seriously hurt Slowking, and it can be very painful to deal with if it sets up a Substitute as Slowking switches out.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Raikou, Jolteon, Magneton, and Mega Ampharos are capable of destroying Slowking with Thunderbolt, though the Assault Vest set can stomach a blow and retaliate, and they all take a fair amount of damage switching in on any of Slowking's offensive sets. These Pokemon are all able to use Volt Switch as Slowking is forced out, gaining momentum and making the appropriate switch. Raikou is especially dangerous, as SubCM variants are able to set up for free as Slowking switches out.

**Psychic-types**: Psychic-types like Celebi, Cresselia, and bulky Starmie can switch into Slowking easily, as they don't take much from any of its attacks and have access to recovery to offset damage from Scald burns.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon, Jellicent, Mega Blastoise, and Empoleon all are able to switch in on Slowking, as they resist Scald, take little from Psyshock, and in the case of the former three, have recovery to offset burn damage, although Grass Knot deals respectable damage to all of them but Empoleon. Each of them is able to inflict Slowking with status, set up or clear entry hazards against it, or in the case of Jellicent and Mega Blastoise, hit it super effectively.
