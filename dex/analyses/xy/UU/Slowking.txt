Overview
########

As the only remaining Water / Psychic Pokemon in UU, Slowking has much to offer to the tier. Slowking fits on nearly every playstyle, as it has the potential to fill many possible roles with different sets. Its unique typing gives it an excellent set of resistances and is complemented by its great natural bulk. The ability Regenerator allows Slowking to stay healthy throughout the course of a battle and perform its role reliably. In addition, Slowking has a stellar movepool with a diverse set of boosting, attacking, and utility moves as well as guaranteed recovery in Slack Off. Its biggest flaws lie in its weaknesses to the common Dark-, Grass-, and Electric-types of the tier.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Scald
move 2: Slack Off
move 3: Dragon Tail
move 4: Calm Mind / Psyshock / Thunder Wave
ability: Regenerator
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 164 Def / 96 SpD
nature: Sassy

Moves
========

Scald is Slowking's main STAB move and is respectably strong while having a chance to burn enemies. Slack Off restores half of Slowking's health and, along with Regenerator, lets it easily stay healthy throughout a match. Dragon Tail is useful for racking up entry hazard damage on targets and preventing boosted Pokemon such as Suicune from sweeping. Defensive Slowking's fourth moveslot is variable: Calm Mind lets Slowking act as a win condition and works very well with Dragon Tail, which prevents opposing setup sweepers from boosting alongside it. Psyshock is another option that hits certain Pokemon such as Roserade and Crobat for more damage. Finally, Thunder Wave cripples some common offensive switch-ins, such as Hydreigon.

Set Details
========

With the given EV spread and nature, Slowking has great mixed bulk and is able to switch into both special attackers such as Life Orb Nidoqueen and physical attackers such as Choice Scarf Darmanitan. A Sassy nature is used over a Calm nature in order to maximize Dragon Tail's damage output. Regenerator restores 1/3 of Slowking's HP whenever it switches out, making it less reliant on using turns to Slack Off. Leftovers adds to Slowking's passive recovery. Alternatively, Slowking can use a more physically defensive spread to better handle the physical Fighting- and Fire-types of the tier.

Usage Tips
========

Defensive Slowking is best used on balanced teams with a defensive partners to fall back upon. Slowking can use its great resistances to wall certain Pokemon such as Mienshao and Darmanitan, but it must be careful of switching into U-turn. Avoid letting Slowking get burned or poisoned, as both cripple it to the point of no longer being able to switch into Pokemon. Use Dragon Tail against obvious switches that can take any of Slowking's other moves, such as Shaymin. If using Calm Mind, do not attempt to sweep until powerful Electric- and Grass-types have been removed. While Slowking can phaze RestTalk Suicune, it cannot deal with Substitute + Calm Mind variants, which set up easily on Defensive Slowking that lack Calm Mind.

Team Options
========

Slowking is crippled by burns and poison, so cleric support is greatly appreciated. Florges is an example of a cleric that has great defensive synergy with Slowking. Pokemon that can deal with strong Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon are necessary as teammates. Chesnaught makes for an excellent partner, as it can check these types while also absorbing Knock Off and setting up Spikes to take advantage of Slowking's Dragon Tail. Amoonguss forms a Regenerator core with Slowking, has good synergy, and absorbs Toxic Spikes for Slowking.

Offensive Trick Room
########
name: Offensive Trick Room
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Scald / Surf
move 3: Psyshock
move 4: Fire Blast / Ice Beam / Nasty Plot
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
evs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpD
nature: Quiet
ivs: 0 Spe

Moves
========

Trick Room lets Slowking and its slower teammates move first in battle against most other Pokemon. Scald can be used as a Water-type STAB move to attempt to cripple switch-ins such as Empoleon early in the game while also deterring physical attackers from staying in on Slowking. Surf can be used instead for more power than Scald. Psyshock is Slowking's secondary STAB move and lets Slowking deal good damage to special walls. Slowking can use a coverage move in the final slot: Fire Blast hits Steel- and Grass-types harder than other moves, while Ice Beam hits the Grass- and Dragon-types that typically give Slowking trouble. Alternatively, Nasty Plot can be used to boost Slowking's Special Attack and complements its decent natural power, letting it defeat Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Calm Mind Suicune. Slowking has access to more coverage moves, including Grass Knot and Focus Blast.

Set Details
========

Slowking's Special Attack is maximized with 252 EVs and a Quiet nature so that it can hit as hard as possible. 248 HP EVs give Slowking much-needed bulk and a favorable HP number. 0 Speed IVs combined with a Quiet nature allow Slowking to "outspeed" the entire tier under Trick Room. Leftovers increases Slowking's longevity and somewhat mitigates passive damage caused by status; on the other hand, Life Orb greatly increases Slowking's power, giving it an easier time against walls such as Vaporeon. Colbur Berry is an option to allow Slowking to reliably survive most Dark-type attacks and set up Trick Room, but this should only be used on fully offensive teams that revolve around Trick Room being set up.

Usage Tips
========

This set works well on very offensive teams, especially those that have other members that can make use of Slowking's Trick Room. However, offensive Trick Room Slowking is also a good stand-alone sweeper and win condition that doesn't need to support its teammates, especially if it carries Nasty Plot. Slowking's bulk, typing, and recovery provided by Regenerator allow it to often set up multiple times in a game. It can set up on the plethora of Pokemon that can't do much to Slowking, including Suicune, Forretress, and Arcanine. On Trick Room teams, Slowking should use Trick Room first early-game on a setup opportunity to give itself and its teammates more options the following turn. However, it should use Nasty Plot first, followed by Trick Room, when attempting to sweep or wallbreak so that it has more turns to deal damage under Trick Room.

Team Options
========

Slower Pokemon that can abuse Trick Room, such as Rhyperior, Mega Ampharos, and Snorlax, make for great partners to Slowking. In particular, Escavalier and Mega Abomasnow have great type synergy with Slowking; Slowking can stand up to the Fire- and Steel-types that give these two Pokemon trouble, while both of the two can handle Grass-types and Mega Abomasnow can check most Electric-types. Amoonguss forms a Regenerator core with Slowking, has fantastic synergy with it, and can make use of Trick Room. Entry hazard support, especially Toxic Spikes, makes it much easier for Slowking and its teammates to break down walls.

Defensive Sweeper
########
name: Defensive Sweeper
move 1: Calm Mind / Nasty Plot
move 2: Scald
move 3: Psyshock
move 4: Slack Off
ability: Regenerator
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpA
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Calm Mind boosts Slowking's Special Attack and Special Defense, while Nasty Plot is an alternate choice that boosts Slowking's Special Attack more quickly but leaves it more vulnerable to special attackers. Scald and Psyshock are Slowking's STAB moves, the former of which threatens physical attackers and the latter of which helps Slowking defeat other Calm Mind users and special walls. Slack Off lets Slowking stay healthy while it boosts.


Set Details
========

The EVs and nature maximize Slowking's Defense. No Special Defense investment is needed if it will be boosted with Calm Mind, but a mixed spread of 248 HP / 164 Def / 96 SpD with a Calm nature can be used if Nasty Plot is the boosting move of choice. Regenerator restores 33% of Slowking's HP upon switching out, allowing it to be less reliant on Slack Off. Leftovers provides Slowking with additional passive recovery and keeps it healthy in tandem with Regenerator and Slack Off.

Usage Tips
========

This set works best on balanced teams that need a win condition against opposing Calm Mind users such as Suicune and Florges. Slowking can check and set up on Fire- and Fighting-types thanks to its typing. However, it should not attempt to sweep while faster powerful attackers with super effective moves, such as Mega Ampharos, Krookodile, and Shaymin, remain healthy on the opponent's side.

Team Options
========

Slowking pairs well with Florges or Aromatisse, as Slowking checks Fire- and Steel-types while the Fairies check other special attackers and provide Slowking with cleric support. Toxic Spikes must be cleared for this set to perform its role; Roserade absorbs them, has good synergy with Slowking, and can also set up Toxic Spikes of its own. Guts Machamp can take advantage of status directed at Slowking and can check threats such as Hydreigon.

Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Scald
move 2: Psychic / Psyshock
move 3: Dragon Tail
move 4: Fire Blast / Ice Beam
ability: Regenerator
item: Assault Vest
evs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Scald is Slowking's best Water-type STAB move and is respectably powerful with a chance to burn its targets. Either Psychic or Psyshock can be used as the second STAB move; Psychic hits harder overall, while Psyshock does more damage to special walls such as Vaporeon and Blissey. Dragon Tail is a very useful move that deters foes from setting up and provides chip damage on Slowking's switch-ins. Fire Blast deals considerable damage to Steel- and Grass-types, such as Mega Aggron and Shaymin, respectively. Alternatively, Ice Beam can be used to hit Grass- and Dragon types, including Hydreigon, one of Slowking's most common switch-ins. Other possible coverage moves include Focus Blast, which hits certain special walls such as Umbreon, and Grass Knot, which hits opposing Water-types such as Swampert and Mega Blastoise.

Set Details
========

Assault Vest allows Slowking to easily tank most special attacks from the likes of Nidoqueen, Dragalge, and Mega Pidgeot. 252 EVs are placed into Special Attack with a Modest nature to allow Slowking to hit as hard as possible, complementing its respectable base 100 Special Attack. 248 EVs in HP give Slowking great bulk and a favorable HP number. The remaining 8 EVs are placed into Speed to let Slowking outspeed other base 30 Speed Pokemon, such as Snorlax, Amoonguss, and opposing Slowking. Regenerator restores 33% of Slowking's HP when it switches out, enabling it to stay relatively healthy throughout the length of a battle. A Quiet nature with the extra 8 EVs placed into Special Defense can be used in order for Dragon Tail to hit slightly harder.

Usage Tips
========

This set works well on bulky offense and functions as a pivot and a special tank while also hitting hard thanks to the investment in Special Attack. Slowking can check a large number of special attackers and can switch into those that don't have a STAB super effective move, such as Nidoqueen, Infernape, and Alakazam. In addition, it can check specially-oriented setup sweepers that lack Substitute thanks to Dragon Tail. If absolutely necessary, Slowking can tank super effective STAB moves from full health such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon's Dark Pulse, Life Orb Shaymin's Seed Flare, and Mega Ampharos's Thunderbolt.

Team Options
========

A burn or poison severely hampers Slowking's ability to check special attackers, so a status absorber or a cleric is useful. Guts Heracross works particularly well as a partner, as it absorbs status and pressures the defensive Pokemon that give Slowking trouble. Florges and Aromatisse have good synergy with Slowking, and the former can check some special attackers that give Slowking trouble, such as Mega Blastoise, Mega Ampharos, and Hydreigon. Chesnaught is a good physically defensive Pokemon to pair with Slowking; it provides Spikes to complement Slowking's Dragon Tail and can check certain Pokemon that give Slowking trouble, such as Roserade.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Surf / Scald
move 2: Psyshock / Future Sight
move 3: Fire Blast / Ice Beam
move 4: Trick
ability: Regenerator
item: Choice Specs
evs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Surf is Slowking's most powerful Water-type STAB move; Scald is nearly as powerful and has a chance to burn targets. Psyshock hits special walls such as Blissey on their weaker physical defense; Future Sight is enormously powerful and puts huge pressure on opposing switch-ins. Fire Blast and Ice Beam both hit Grass-types that can otherwise switch in easily to Slowking, but Ice Beam also hits Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Mega Ampharos for super effective damage. Trick cripples special walls that give Slowking trouble, such as Umbreon and Vaporeon. Alternate moves include Focus Blast, which deals major damage to many of Slowking's switch-ins such as Umbreon, Porygon2, and Empoleon, and Grass Knot which dents opposing Water-types, such as Suicune and Mega Blastoise.

Set Details
========

Special Attack is maximized with 252 EVs and a Modest nature to hit as hard as possible. Choice Specs enables Slowking to function as a surprisingly strong wallbreaker. 248 EVs in HP are used to make Slowking bulkier, as significant Speed investment is not necessary thanks to Slowking's dismal base Speed. The 8 remaining EVs are placed into Speed to outspeed other base 30 Speed Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Snorlax. Regenerator makes it difficult for enemies to wear Slowking down and allows it to use its resistances to switch in multiple times throughout a game.

Usage Tips
========

Choice Specs Slowking works best on bulky offense. It can serve as a check to several attackers due to its bulk and typing and proceed to fire off powerful Choice Specs-boosted attacks. Use an appropriate coverage move on Pokemon that are likely to switch in initially, such as Psyshock on Roserade or Ice Beam on Hydreigon. Use Trick to cripple walls and bulky setup sweepers, such as Umbreon and CurseLax, respectively. Follow up Future Sight by pivoting into another powerful wallbreaker that can defeat Pokemon that are likely to switch in.

Team Options
========

Slowking appreciates partners that are immune to Volt Switch, as it cannot OHKO most Electric-types and is forced out after they switch in. Mega Sceptile works well, as it checks most Electric- and Grass-types and appreciates Slowking's ability to wear down or cripple special walls. Physical wallbreakers such as Lucario and Darmanitan can break through many of Slowking's counters. Heracross has fantastic synergy with Slowking, especially if Slowking carries Future Sight, as Heracross destroys all Pokemon that can take a Choice Specs-boosted Future Sight, such as Umbreon and Empoleon. Choice Band Goodra also has great synergy with Slowking, especially with Sap Sipper, and it can defeat opposing special walls. Trick Room support can turn Choice Specs Slowking into a "fast" wallbreaker, although Slowking doesn't synergize well with most Trick Room setters.

Other Options
########

Flamethrower is a more accurate alternative to Fire Blast on offensive variants of Slowking. Defensive variants can use Counter and Foul Play, although these moves are very situational. Slowking can also use Toxic on defensive sets to cripple certain switch-ins, such as Vaporeon and Mega Blastoise. A RestTalk set with Dragon Tail and Scald is plausible, as it negates any status inflicted on Slowking. Finally, Slowking has access to Curse and physical attacks such as Aqua Tail, Zen Headbutt, Drain Punch, and Earthquake.

Checks & Counters
########

**Electric- and Grass-types**: Powerful attackers such as Heliolisk and Life Orb Shaymin force Slowking out immediately, though they must watch out for Choice Specs-boosted attacks. All Electric-types and Natural Cure Grass-types do not fear paralysis from Slowking's Defensive set. Whimsicott can switch into almost all of Slowking's moves and threaten it with a Grass move or lock it into a setup move with Encore. Mega Ampharos can take all of Slowking's attacks and keep itself healthy with Rest.

**Dark-types**: Hydreigon is one of Slowking's best answers, as it only has to fear Thunder Wave and Choice Specs Ice Beam or Focus Blast. Powerful Knock Off users such as Mega Absol and Krookodile can cripple or KO Slowking, though they have trouble switching into Scald or Trick Room.

**Status**: All Slowking variants are crippled by Toxic and severely hampered by burns. Defensive Pokemon that carry Toxic, such as Blissey, can switch into Slowking easily and inflict status on it. Toxic Spikes can cripple or put heavy pressure on Slowking.

**Empoleon**: Slowking can damage Empoleon with only the very rare Focus Blast. Empoleon can wear Slowking down with Scald and phaze Slowking with Roar if it tries to set up.
