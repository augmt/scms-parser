Overview
########

Jirachi is extremely versatile, allowing it to run a multitude of different sets. It has an excellent movepool ranging from Iron Head, which allows Jirachi to flinch foes to death thanks to Serene Grace, to Trick, which allows it to cripple walls by giving them a Choice item. It also has great all-around stats, having base 100 in every one. Sadly, Jirachi's Psychic typing leaves it weak to powerful Dark- and Ghost-type moves such as Knock Off and Shadow Ball. Also, even though Steel is an amazing defensive type, it makes Jirachi susceptible to the common Fire- and Ground-types in UU. Jirachi's base 100 attacking stats, while good, are not amazing and can limit its offensive capabilities. It also relies on Calm Mind to sweep, so it is left prone to physical attacks. However, Jirachi's sheer versatility makes it an excellent team choice in UU.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Iron Head
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Fire Punch / Ice Punch
move 4: Trick / Healing Wish
ability: Serene Grace
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Iron Head is Jirachi's main STAB move, as it is reliable and decently powerful, and if Jirachi is faster than the foe, it has a 60% chance to flinch the opponent thanks to Serene Grace. It is also the most powerful move on this set, making it the best option if you attempt to clean late-game with Jirachi. U-turn deals chip damage to the foe and allows Jirachi to switch into a counter to the opposing Pokemon, giving you momentum. Fire Punch is recommended in the third slot to hit Steel-types, which otherwise wall Jirachi, but Ice Punch can be used to hit certain Dragon-types, such as Flygon and Noivern, super effectively. Trick allows Jirachi to cripple a wall or slow Pokemon by giving it its Choice Scarf, making it difficult for the foe to successfully fulfill its role. However, Healing Wish can revitalize a weakened teammate, clearing status and bringing them to full HP before entry hazard damage is inflicted. This is especially helpful for tanks and bulky attackers without access to reliable recovery. Zen Headbutt can be used because it makes repeatedly flinching Pokemon that resist Iron Head easier, but it is hard to fit onto the set, has imperfect accuracy, and has only a 40% chance to flinch.

Set Details
========

The chosen EVs allow Jirachi to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Jolly nature is chosen over an Adamant nature to let Jirachi outspeed other common Choice Scarf users, such as Hydreigon. It also allows Jirachi to Speed tie with other base 100 Choice Scarf users, such as Victini. Choice Scarf is the chosen item as it lets Jirachi outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, making revenge killing and crippling walls with Trick easy. Serene Grace makes annoying the opponent easy and helps in flinching opposing Pokemon to death with Iron Head.

Usage Tips
========

Jirachi should be mostly used to revenge kill opposing Pokemon, as it has all-around good stats and an excellent movepool. It can also come in easily because of its plethora of resistances, resistance to Stealth Rock, and above-average bulk for a Choice Scarf user before forcing the foe out; this is a key opportunity to use U-turn to quickly switch in your counter to the opponent's switch-in and get momentum. You should remember that Jirachi has only a base 100 Attack stat, so it will not be able to KO opposing Pokemon easily.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can take advantage of what Jirachi can revenge kill make for good partners. For example, Jirachi can 2HKO Florges with Iron Head, so Pokemon that have an issue with Florges, such as Hydreigon, have an easier time handling the rest of the opponent's team. Pokemon that appreciate a free switch in from U-turn also make for good partners for Jirachi, as they can capitalize on the free turn granted by the opponent, which will most likely be forced to switch out. Bulky sweepers appreciate the recovery from Healing Wish. If not using Healing Wish, Pokemon that appreciate a wall crippled by Trick like having Jirachi as a teammate. Because Jirachi hates Fire-types, Water-types such as Swampert, Suicune, Starmie, and Vaporeon make for good partners, as they can beat Fire-types. Also, Jirachi has trouble with bulky Water-types, so Grass- and Electric-types such as Roserade, Shaymin, Raikou, and Ampharos make for good partners.

Stealth Rock
########
name: Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Fire Punch
ability: Serene Grace
item: Leftovers
evs: 16 HP / 252 Atk / 240 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is an important move for any team, dealing damage to Pokemon that switch in, and Jirachi does an excellent job setting it up. Iron Head is a reliable STAB move with a 60% chance to flinch, though it shouldn't be relied on early-game. That said, however, it can come in handy in a pinch for the Leftovers recovery it can give to Jirachi. U-turn is an amazing move that allows you to quickly gain momentum for your team. Finally, Fire Punch gives Jirachi coverage against Steel-types which otherwise wall Jirachi, specifically Forretress, other Jirachi, and Lucario.

Set Details
========

The given EVs let Jirachi have enough Speed to outspeed Hydreigon with the rest invested in Attack, to give Jirachi as much offensive presence as possible; and the EVs in HP are used to give Jirachi a little bit of extra bulk. Alternately, a spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe with an Adamant nature or 180 HP / 252 Atk / 76 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Lucario, the former prioritizing offensive presence and the latter providing a bit more bulk. A spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe can be used to outspeed Timid Nidoking. Finally, a spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used to simply maximize Jirachi's Attack and Speed. Keep in mind that Jirachi's EVs can be easily customized to take a certain attack or KO a certain threat, giving it unpredictability.

Usage Tips
========

This Jirachi set is best used as an offensive Stealth Rock setter and pivot. It has little trouble finding a chance to switch in thanks to its surplus of good resistances, including to Dragon-, Ice-, Psychic-, Grass-, Flying-, and Fairy-type moves and an immunity to Poison-type moves. It's best to try to set up Stealth Rock early-game so that Fire-types which love to come in on Jirachi, such as Chandelure and Darmanitan, can switch in far less often. Also, because of the switches Jirachi can force, it is very easy to spam U-turn for easy momentum. Additionally, the combination of U-turn and Stealth Rock can put a lot of pressure on the opponent, limiting their switches.

Team Options
========

Because of Jirachi's sheer versatility and utility, it has little trouble finding a spot on many teams. It best fits on bulky offense and balance teams where you need a Stealth Rock setter and pivot. That being said, some Pokemon especially stand out as good partners for Jirachi. Mega Ampharos and Jirachi form a good VoltTurn core together, as they have good offensive and defensive synergy bar a mutual weakness to Ground, and they can often bring each other in relatively easily. They can also remove threats for each other, with Jirachi easily handling Fairy-types and Mega Ampharos stopping Fire- and Water-types. Crobat can remove entry hazards and switch into Ground-type moves for Jirachi, while in return, Jirachi can handle Rock-types and set up Stealth Rock. In fact, for the aforementioned reasons, the combination of Jirachi, Mega Ampharos, and Crobat makes for an amazing core. Hydreigon still makes for a good partner, however, as it can switch into Fire- and Ground-type moves for Jirachi, which can come in on Fairy- and Ice-type moves with ease in return.

Substitute + Calm Mind
########
name: Substitute + Calm Mind
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Calm Mind
move 3: Psyshock
move 4: Moonblast / Energy Ball / Thunderbolt
ability: Serene Grace
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 108 Def / 148 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Substitute blocks status and makes prediction against moves such as Sucker Punch less important, easing Jirachi's setup. Substitute can also let Jirachi net an extra boost if the foe's attack doesn't break its Substitute. Calm Mind allows Jirachi to boost its special bulk while boosting its Special Attack to very high levels, even when uninvested. Psyshock is a reliable STAB move that makes it easier to win Calm Mind wars and hits special walls like Blissey on their weaker physical side. Moonblast takes priority in the fourth slot for its exceptional coverage alongside Psyshock. Energy Ball can be used in the last slot to hit Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types such as Swampert, Hippowdon, and Rhyperior super effectively, though Thunderbolt can also be used to hit Steel-types neutrally and Flying-types super effectively. That being said, Moonblast should almost always be used unless your team cannot afford to or does not run a Pokemon that can break bulky Water- and Steel-types. 

Set Details
========

The given Speed EVs and Timid nature allow Jirachi to outspeed neutral-natured, fully invested base 100 Speed Pokemon. Leftovers grant Jirachi residual recovery, allowing it to shrug off damage from entry hazards more easily and make more Substitutes over the course of the battle. Jirachi's HP is maximized to increase its overall bulk while allowing it to make 101 HP Substitutes, which is enough to be able to set up easily on Seismic Toss users. Because Jirachi does not boost its Defense when using this set, the remaining EVs are placed in Defense to give it as much physical bulk as possible.

Usage Tips
========

This Jirachi set should set up on defensive Pokemon and then sweep after a few boosts have been acquired. Try to keep a Substitute up at all times, as it eases prediction, blocks status, and in general makes setting up on defensive Pokemon easier. It should be noted that Jirachi can make 101 HP Substitutes, so it can set up a Substitute, survive a Seismic Toss from the foe, and use Calm Mind as the Substitute is broken. Use Calm Mind whenever you are given a free turn to set up for a sweep. Try to set up on Blissey and Florges, as they have a hard time damaging Jirachi. Keep in mind that this set has lots of trouble breaking Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Forretress, so make sure they are removed before setting up.

Team Options
========

Jirachi, like any sweeper, appreciates the support of Pokemon such as Forretress that can set up entry hazards to make breaking down opposing Pokemon easier. Grass-type Pokemon such as Roserade and Amoonguss have good synergy with Jirachi aside from their shared weakness to Fire-type moves, and these Pokemon can deal major damage to bulky Water-types which trouble Jirachi. Fire-types such as Infernape, Chandelure, and Darmanitan also make good partners to deal with the Steel-types that Jirachi can't touch. Bulky Water-types such as Swampert can take physical attacks and super effective Fire-type attacks aimed at Jirachi. You could opt to use all the aforementioned options and have a strong Fire / Water / Grass core to support Jirachi.

Superachi (Offensive Calm Mind)
########
name: Superachi (Offensive Calm Mind) 
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Moonblast / Flash Cannon
move 4: Energy Ball / Thunderbolt
ability: Serene Grace
item: Leftovers / Life Orb / Expert Belt
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Calm Mind allows Jirachi to quickly boost its Special Attack and Special Defense to set up for a sweep. Psyshock is a reliable STAB move that helps when trying to break through special walls, such as Blissey. It also hits Fighting- and Poison-types super effectively. Moonblast is recommended to hit Dragon- and Dark-types hard, as Psyshock already hits Florges and Aromatisse hard. However, Flash Cannon is another reliable STAB move that also breaks Florges and Aromatisse and gives Jirachi an easier time against Rock-types. Energy Ball is recommended in the last slot to hit bulky Water- and Ground-types hard, but Thunderbolt can be used instead, as it retains coverage on Water-types and but hits Flying-types such as Honchkrow instead of Ground-types, such as Swampert and Rhyperior. Thunderbolt is also useful for hitting Steel-types for neutral damage.

Set Details
========

The given EVs maximize Jirachi's Speed and Special Attack, the two most important stats for a special sweeper. A Timid nature is recommended over a Modest nature, as it allows Jirachi to outspeed as much as possible, but a Modest nature can be used if extra power is preferred. Life Orb is recommended for the extra power it grants to Jirachi. However, Leftovers can be used for extra longevity at the cost of some extra power. Finally, it is possible to use an Expert Belt, which doesn't deal recoil damage and capitalizes on Jirachi's good coverage.

Usage Tips
========

This Jirachi set functions best as a mid- or late-game sweeper after faster Pokemon are removed and foes are worn down. Set up Calm Mind as fast as you can, especially when you get a free turn on a forced switch. Try not to bring Jirachi into an attack unless absolutely necessary, as it has no form of recovery and therefore is worn down very easily, especially if using Expert Belt or Life Orb; thus, coming in from a U-turn, Volt Switch, Baton Pass, or fainted teammate is recommended. Crobat and Mega Ampharos make for good partners for this.

Team Options
========

This Jirachi set does not require much support, as it is mostly a standalone sweeper. However, like all sweepers, Jirachi loves entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Froslass. Jirachi also likes the support of wallbreakers to weaken the opposing team a bit before it attempts to sweep. Also, a Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off for Jirachi is helpful, as many users of the move can KO Jirachi with it. Jirachi also appreciates the support of a Pokemon that can bring it in for free using U-turn, Volt Switch, or Baton Pass. Crobat is a good partner for this, as Crobat and Jirachi have decent defensive synergy with each other. Mega Ampharos, especially the defensive variant, is a great example of a Pokemon that has good defensive synergy with Jirachi and can bring it in safely, though it shares a weakness with Jirachi to Ground-type moves. Finally, Jirachi likes having a Pokemon to switch in and take on Ground-type moves for it, such as Swampert or Hydreigon.

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Iron Head
move 2: Body Slam / Thunder Wave
move 3: Wish
move 4: Protect / U-turn / Stealth Rock
ability: Serene Grace
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 232 SpD / 24 Spe
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Iron Head is a reliable and decently powerful STAB move that has a 60% chance to flinch the foe thanks to Serene Grace. Body Slam deals damage, is not stopped by Taunt, and carries has a 60% chance to paralyze the foe, allowing Jirachi to use a paraflinch strategy. Thunder Wave is another, more reliable option for paralysis that can hit Ghost-types, but it misses out on hitting Ground-types and can be stopped by Taunt. Wish is an awesome move that allows Jirachi to heal itself as well as its teammates, making Jirachi a great team supporter. Protect can be used to scout the foe's moves and turn Wish into a usually (not reliable when Jirachi is faster but the foe can KO it at the health it has now) reliable recovery move. U-turn is a cool option over Protect that allows Jirachi to scout or gain momentum for its team. It is also very useful in allowing Jirachi to pass a Wish with ease. Stealth Rock is another good option if your team lacks a setter of the hazard.

Set Details
========

24 Speed EVs allow Jirachi to outspeed 252 Speed Adamant Honchkrow and cripple it with Body Slam or Thunder Wave with proper prediction. 252 HP EVs, 232 Special Defense EVs, and a Careful nature maximize Jirachi's Special Defense, allowing it to take on special attackers more easily. Leftovers provides residual recovery and improves Jirachi's ability to take hits over the course of the match. It also pairs well with Protect, which lets Jirachi stall for more recovery.

Usage Tips
========

This set works best as a special wall and annoyer. The combination of a paralysis-inducing move and Iron Head allows Jirachi to employ a paraflinch strategy, allowing it to wear down opposing Pokemon with very little effort. The paralysis also allows slower sweepers on your team to sweep more easily. Use Wish not only to improve Jirachi's longevity or restore its health in a pinch, but also to heal weakened teammates.

Team Options
========

Jirachi appreciates a Pokemon with a good Defense stat, especially if it has a Fire resistance, to take hits from physical attackers that Jirachi cannot. For this reason, Suicune and Mega Ampharos make for good partners. Jirachi also appreciates Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off for it, as Jirachi easily falls to the move. Mega Ampharos and Chesnaught are both excellent Knock Off absorbers. Also, as Jirachi is good at spreading paralysis, slow sweepers that appreciate slowed foes make for good teammates.

Mixed Attacker
########
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Iron Head
move 2: Fire Punch / Ice Punch
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Energy Ball
ability: Serene Grace
item: Expert Belt
evs: 208 Atk / 172 SpA / 148 Spe
nature: Naive

Moves
========

Iron Head is Jirachi's most reliable STAB move, also having a nifty 60% chance to flinch the foe, which can come in handy at times. Fire Punch is recommended in the second slot to hit the Steel-types that resist Iron Head hard, but you can forgo it to hit Dragon-types harder with Ice Punch. U-turn is an awesome move for Jirachi, as it can help gain momentum for your team as well as bluff a Choice Scarf set. Energy Ball hurts the bulky Water-types that Jirachi lures in, namely Swampert and Suicune, hard.

Set Details
========

The given Speed EVs and nature allow Jirachi to outspeed neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon. A Naive nature is preferred over a Hasty nature to take a little bit less damage from physical priority attacks. The Special Attack EVs ensure that Energy Ball OHKOes defensive Swampert while also dealing very heavy damage to Rhyperior, and, to a lesser extent, Vaporeon and Suicune. The rest of the EVs are placed into Attack to make the rest of Jirachi's moves stronger. A spread of 84 Atk / 172 SpA / 252 Spe can be used to Speed tie with positive natured base 100 Speed Pokemon, but the drop in Attack is noticeable. An Expert Belt is the chosen item on this set to let Jirachi bluff the Choice Scarf set and deal more damage to the foes it hits super effectively, mainly the Water-types Jirachi hits with Energy Ball.

Usage Tips
========

Try to bluff the Choice Scarf set to lure in threats to your team, such as Swampert and other bulky Water-types. This set should not be used as an all-out attacker, but rather a lure that must be timed perfectly to be effective. Do not use Energy Ball too early, as that will give away your Jirachi's set and your function as a lure; don't use Energy Ball too late either, because then Jirachi may not be able to remove opposing threats effectively.

Team Options
========

Physical attackers that appreciate Pokemon such as Swampert and Rhyperior removed appreciate the support Jirachi brings. For example, Darmanitan, Infernape, and Entei all appreciate the removal of the aforementioned threats. Also, though it is not mandatory, entry hazard support is always nice to have. Jirachi also likes a free switch in, so Mega Ampharos, Mienshao, and Crobat all make for good partners, as they can bring Jirachi in with their respective pivoting momentum-gaining moves.

Substitute + Toxic
########
name: Substitute + Toxic
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Iron Head
move 4: Fire Punch
ability: Serene Grace
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Substitute eases prediction and prevents status from reaching Jirachi. Toxic wears foes down very quickly and helps break down walls. Iron Head is a reliable STAB move with a 60% chance to flinch thanks to Serene Grace. It works very well in conjunction with Toxic, as the Toxic damage on top of the Iron Head damage on top of the foe not being able to do anything 60% of the time allows Jirachi to quickly take down walls. Fire Punch is used in the last slot to nail Steel-types, which resist Iron Head and are immune to Toxic.

Set Details
========

The given EVs and nature maximize Speed so that Jirachi can outspeed and thus flinch as much as possible; the HP are used to allow Jirachi to make 101 HP Substitutes that can't be broken by Seismic Toss. Leftovers allow Jirachi to use Substitute as much as possible as well as help it shrug off damage from entry hazards. An alternate spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used to deal more damage, but 101 HP Substitutes are usually more valuable.

Usage Tips
========

This Jirachi set is used best as a wallbreaker and annoyer. It is particularly good at taking down Blissey, which uses Seismic Toss as its main source of damage. Try to keep a Substitute up as much as possible, as it makes breaking down walls easier and eases prediction if an opposing Sucker Punch user switches in.

Team Options
========

Lots of late-game sweepers and cleaners make for good teammates because Jirachi is good at breaking down walls, which stop them from sweeping. Also, entry hazards are recommended to make breaking down walls easier, but they are not entirely necessary. If you find that keeping a Substitute up is hard, a Pokemon to absorb Knock Off is appreciated. Finally, because Umbreon and Empoleon can be huge thorns in Jirachi's side, Pokemon such as Machamp and Mienshao make good partners as they can KO Umbreon and Empoleon with their STAB moves.

Wish + Calm Mind
########
name: Wish + Calm Mind
move 1: Wish
move 2: Calm Mind
move 3: Psyshock
move 4: Moonblast / Thunderbolt / Flash Cannon
ability: Serene Grace
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 232 Def / 24 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Wish allows Jirachi to stay healthy throughout the match as well as support its teammates, and Calm Mind allows Jirachi to boost its Special Attack and Special Defense so that it can hit harder and take special attacks better. Psyshock is a reliable STAB move that also helps Jirachi win Calm Mind wars. Moonblast is recommended in the third slot to hit Dragon- and Dark-types hard, as well as having good coverage overall. Additionally, Thunderbolt can be used in the third slot as it gets good coverage with Psyshock, and Flash Cannon can be used as a secondary STAB move. Just note that if Jirachi uses Flash Cannon, it is hard to get past Steel-types and harder to beat bulky Water-types.

Set Details
========

24 Speed EVs allow Jirachi to outspeed 252 Speed Adamant Honchkrow. The rest of the EVs maximize HP and improve physical bulk. Likewise, a Bold nature is chosen to increase Defense even further. Leftovers are used to shrug off entry hazard and the occasional burn damage more easily, as well as improve Jirachi's longevity in general. An alternate spread of 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 Spe can be used to outspeed 252 Speed Adamant Toxicroak and all Honchkrow variants.

Usage Tips
========

This Jirachi set works well on stall teams, as it has a decent defensive typing, the ability to support the team with Wish, and the ability to act as a win condition late-game with Calm Mind. Use Wish to stay healthy and support the team, and use Calm Mind to boost late-game when most of Jirachi's counters are removed. Also, keep in mind that this Jirachi set is not a fast sweeper, but rather a bulky sweeper. Because of its good bulk, access to Wish, and defensive typing, Jirachi can also make for a nice pivot.

Team Options
========

Jirachi appreciates Pokemon that can remove Fire-, Ground-, Ghost-, and Dark-types, which hinder Jirachi's sweep. For this reason, Hydreigon makes for an excellent partner, as it resists all four of the aforementioned types and can hit them for heavy damage with its STAB moves. Also, bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert can remove some of these threats and have decent synergy with Jirachi. They also appreciate the Wish support Jirachi can provide. As Steel-types can stop Jirachi without much trouble, Fire-types, such as Darmanitan, and Fighting-types, such as Machamp and Mienshao, make for good partners.

Other Options
########

An offensive paraflinch set seems viable, especially on the Substitute + Toxic set, but Toxic is usually better for wearing down walls, and Jirachi has better things to do. Zen Headbutt is a decent option to make repeatedly flinching Water-, Fire-, and Electric-types easier, but it is often hard to fit on the set, has a lower chance to flinch, and has imperfect accuracy. A set with Charge Beam seems viable, but it is rather weak and far too unreliable to be effective. A set abusing Doom Desire looks intriguing at first, but the opponent can play around it rather easily. Finally, a dual screens set can be used, but it is usually done better by other Pokemon, such as Azelf.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Fire-types can KO Jirachi with their super effective STAB moves. Houndoom resists both of Jirachi's STAB moves and can retaliate with its own attacks. Chandelure, particularly the Choice Scarf set, can revenge kill Jirachi with little trouble. Infernape is naturally faster than Jirachi and can use its powerful Flare Blitzes and Fire Blasts to take down Jirachi.

**Taunt Users**: Taunt users can completely shut down the Substitute + Calm Mind and specially defensive sets, as they stop Jirachi from using Substitute, Calm Mind, Stealth Rock, and other supporting moves.

**Dark-types**: Dark-types, such as Mega Absol and Honchkrow, have super effective STAB moves against Jirachi, which are absolutely devastating to Jirachi considering the Knock Off buff and the popularity of Sucker Punch in UU. Jirachi is also weak to Pursuit, which is one of the best utility moves in the game.

**Ground-types**: Many Ground-types, such as Hippowdon and Swampert, can take on most physically based sets and retaliate with super effective STAB Earthquake.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Raikou and Mega Ampharos resist Iron Head, stop the specially defensive set because of their immunity to paralysis, and can hit back hard if wielding Choice Specs or running an offensive set, respectively. Another notable Electric-type is Rotom-H, which 4x resists Iron Head and can retaliate with Overheat or cripple Jirachi with Will-O-Wisp.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types are almost a full stop to any of Jirachi's sets not running Thunderbolt or Energy Ball. Outside of those, the only thing they fear from Jirachi is being Tricked a Choice Scarf.
