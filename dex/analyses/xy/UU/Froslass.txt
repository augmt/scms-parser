Overview
########

Froslass might seem limited to a couple of sets, but that doesn't mean she's limited in potential. She is one of the only Pokemon that can spinblock and set up Spikes at the same time, making her a great dedicated lead, and also has the necessary Speed to get her moves off before falling. Unfortunately, Froslass doesn't have everything going for her. Her typing is a double-edged sword, leaving her weak to both of Mega Houndoom's STAB moves, Pursuit, and Stealth Rock, which prevents her from coming in multiple times throughout the match. Disadvantages aside, Froslass is a powerful Pokemon in the metagame and should be considered while teambuilding

Leadlass
########
name: Leadlass
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Destiny Bond
move 4: Thunder Wave / Icy Wind
ability: Cursed Body
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Being able to use Spikes is Froslass's greatest niche in the metagame and can help wear down the opposing team over time. In order to do this efficiently, Froslass needs to use Taunt to prevent opposing Pokemon from using Defog or Taunt, setting up their own entry hazards, or setting up. Destiny Bond is also effective in tandem with Froslass's base 110 Speed and allows her to take down other Pokemon, especially Rapid Spin users, with her after Focus Sash is used up. Thunder Wave is preferred for the last move of the set because it allows her to shut down fast Pokemon trying to set up, such as Mega Houndoom, and paves the way for her own Taunt and Destiny Bond. Icy Wind is a STAB option that works similar to Thunder Wave and keeps Froslass from becoming complete Taunt bait. She can catch Taunt users coming in on a switch and then Taunt them to keep herself from being Taunted.

Set Details
========

The EVs are standard for a suicide lead with no attacking moves. If STAB Icy Wind or Shadow Ball is opted for over Thunder Wave, then the HP EVs can be moved over to Special Attack accordingly. Focus Sash guarantees that Froslass can survive to lay down at least one layer of Spikes. Timid is to maximize Speed for using Taunt and Destiny Bond. Cursed Body allows Froslass to set up an additional layer of Spikes against Choice-locked Pokemon roughly a third of the time.

Usage Tips
========

Froslass should be sent out towards, if not at, the beginning of the match to make the most out of Spikes. Don't bother with other moves unless absolutely necessary, especially when running STAB attacks. Use Destiny Bond to your advantage by playing mind tricks on your opponent and earning yourself an easy KO. You can even bluff Destiny Bond and use Spikes instead, racking up damage on the incoming switch. She's fairly useless late game, especially because Stealth Rock breaks Focus Sash, so try to send her out early. Keep in mind that Froslass, even at one HP, can still spinblock if necessary.

Team Options
========

Sweepers that can take advantage of Spikes, Taunt, and Thunder Wave make for the best partners, such as Choice Scarf Darmanitan or Sharpedo. Froslass fits easily onto hyper offensive teams in need of a suicide lead, especially ones with no space for a spinblocker.


Other Options
########

Pain Split is one viable option that lets Froslass inflict massive damage after using up Focus Sash. It also lets Froslass stick around longer if you don't want to use it as a lead. She can also run a Trick + Choice Scarf to completely shut down the likes of Crocune and other entry hazard setters. She can also set up Spikes during these turns, but this is not a viable strategy. Ice Beam or Shadow Ball can be used for reliable STABs. but the utility of Thunder Wave and Icy Wind is usually more beneficial.


Checks & Counters
########

**Blastoise**: Blastoise is a major pain for Froslass as it can use Dark Pulse to take her down, and then proceed to spin away Spikes.

**Fast Defog Users**: Pokemon that can outspeed and use Defog before Froslass can fire off a Taunt makes all of her efforts in vain.

**Pursuit**: Like most Ghost-types, Froslass can do very little when trapped by a Pursuit user.

**Fast Taunters**: Much like fast Defog users, Froslass has to watch out for the likes of Sableye, Azelf, and Mega Aerodactyl who can shut her down with Taunt.

**Multi-hit Users**: Pokemon, like Cloyster and Cinccino, can use a move that hits multiple times to break Froslass's sash and restrict her to only one layer of Spikes
