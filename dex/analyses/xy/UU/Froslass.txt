Overview
#######

Froslass is a fantastic Spiker for offensive teams, as it can block Rapid Spin and its high base 110 Speed allows it to set up at least 1 layer of Spikes in most situations. It also gets access to a plethora of support moves, such as Thunder Wave and Taunt. For these reasons, it is also a great lead. However, Froslass is an extremely frail Pokemon, as it has poor defensive stats and cannot take any decently strong attack if its Focus Sash is broken.

Moves
========

Spikes is pretty much the only reason why you would want to use Froslass. Destiny Bond allows Froslass to take down other Pokemon, especially Rapid Spin users, along with it after Focus Sash is used up. Taunt allows it to prevent slower leads from setting up their entry hazards and blocks slower Taunts. The last moveslot is a toss up between Thunder Wave and Icy Wind. Icy Wind works on a similar principle as Thunder Wave and prevents Froslass from becoming Taunt bait. Thunder Wave allows Froslass to shut down fast Pokemon as they try to set up and works well with Taunt and Destiny Bond.

Set Details
========
The preferred item for Froslass is Focus Sash, which allows it to set up at least one layer of Spikes. Timid is used so that it can maximize its Speed for using Taunt and Destiny Bond. Cursed Body allows Froslass to set up an additional layer of Spikes against Choice-locked Pokemon 30% of the time. The 252 HP EVs are used to maximize Froslass' bulk, although if Icy Wind, Ice Beam, or Shadow Ball is used over Thunder Wave, the EVs may be moved into Special Attack.

Usage Tips
========

Froslass sets up Spikes then KOes a foe with Destiny Bond or prevents Defog with Taunt and blocks Rapid Spin with its Ghost typing. Froslass should be sent out at the beginning of the match or at least close to the beginning to make the most out of Spikes. The main goal of this set is to set up as many layers of Spikes as possible, so avoid using any other moves unless absolutely required. Froslass is decently useful mid game, as it is able to revenge kill Dragons, and with its great Speed and adequate Special Attack it could pose a threat to offensive teams.

Team Options
========
Pokemon that can stop Rapid Spin and Defog users after Froslass is gone are appreciated, so Pokemon such as Chandelure and Spiritomb make for nice partners because of this. Fast Taunters such as Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat are also appreciated. Anything that takes advantage of the Spikes that Froslass sets also appreciates its support, such as Sharpedo or Lucario. Stealth Rock users such as Aerodactyl or Swampert also make for good partners.

Other Options
########

Shadow Ball and Ice Beam are alternatives for strong STAB moves over Icy Wind, although they provide less utility than Icy Wind. Pain Split can be used to give Froslass some longevity so that Froslass can gain a bit of health back. Froslass can use Pain Split on switch-ins, which gives it a tiny bit of longevity. A more offensive Spiker moveset with Spikes / Ice Shard / Ice Beam / Shadow Ball or Thunderbolt can be used for Froslass as well, allowing it to threaten more Pokemon with its increased coverage. Mental Herb is another item option for Froslass that allows it to not get affected by Taunt from Suicide Lead Aerodactyl and Azelf, and Taunt them back which prevents them from Taunting Froslass and it prevents them from setting their entry hazards up, allowing Froslass to set up Spikes relatively freely.

Checks and Counters
########

**Faster Taunt Users**: If Froslass has Thunder Wave, then a faster Taunt from Pokemon such as Azelf and Aerodactyl completely shuts it down.

**Magic Bounce**: Magic Bouncers such as Mega Absol can also beat Froslass if it doesn't run an attacking move.

**Multi-Hit Moves**: Pokemon such as Cloyster, Cinccino, and Rhyperior can easily KO Froslass with their multi-hit moves, as these attacks break its Focus Sash and KO it in one turn.
