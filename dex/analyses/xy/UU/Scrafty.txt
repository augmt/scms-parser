Overview
########

Scrafty is the most unviable Pokemon currently in the UU tier. This is mostly due to the fact that it is outclassed by every other Fighting-type in performing its roles. Nevertheless, it still has good Defense and Special Defense, albeit along with second-rate further stats, as well as a good offensive movepool with access to coverage moves ranging from Poison Jab to Ice Punch and STAB moves such as Knock Off and Drain Punch. Scrafty also has access to three good abilities, but it is unable to make optimal use of them. In addition, its typing doesn't complement its defenses whatsoever, as Dark / Fighting only has three resistances and one immunity and also has weaknesses to three common types.

Bulk Up
########
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Drain Punch
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Rest
ability: Shed Skin
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 240 SpD / 20 Spe
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Scrafty's highest stats are its defenses, making Bulk Up a good option for a setup move, as it allows Scrafty to continuously take physical hits while still increasing its Attack. Drain Punch gives Scrafty a way to damage foes and recover health at the same time. Knock Off removes the items of opposing Pokemon and has good coverage in conjunction with Drain Punch. Rest allows Scrafty to heal itself and remove any status inflicted upon it.

Set Details
========

Leftovers allows Scrafty to gain a bit of its health each turn, increasing its longevity. Shed Skin has a chance to remove status effects inflicted upon Scrafty, which is especially useful as it can cure the sleep resulting from Rest. The EVs maximize Scrafty's special bulk while allowing it to outspeed uninvested base 60s.

Usage Tips
========

Scrafty is best sent in on specially offensive Pokemon that can't break through it, such as non-Dazzling Gleam Roserade and Choice Scarf Hydreigon, so that it can set up on them. Fairy-, Flying-, and Fighting-types are immediate stops to this set, so it is essential to remove them before attempting a sweep.

Team Options
========

Scrafty's biggest problems are Fairy-types. Due to this, Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types, such as Lucario, Crobat, and Entei, make excellent partners. Flying-types are common stops to any Scrafty sweep, so removing them is mandatory. The best Pokemon to do as such are Rock-, Ice-, and Electric-types such as Mega Aerodactyl, Kyurem, and Heliolisk. Opposing Fighting-types stop Scrafty from effectively carrying out a sweep, making Flying- and Psychic-types such as Mega Pidgeot and Reuniclus astounding partners. Cloyster and Speed Boost Yanmega are fine examples of cleaners that appreciate Scrafty's ability to weaken the opposing team.

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: High Jump Kick / Drain Punch
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Poison Jab
ability: Shed Skin / Moxie / Intimidate
item: Leftovers / Life Orb / Lum Berry
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Dragon Dance boosts Scrafty's Attack and Speed by one stage, but even at +1 Speed and Attack, Scrafty still fails to outspeed or OHKO a majority of the tier. High Jump Kick has a great 130 Base Power and is boosted by STAB, although Scrafty's mediocre Attack stat doesn't allow it to hit as hard as expected. Alternatively, Drain Punch gives Scrafty the ability to recover some health while attempting a sweep, but it doesn't hit hard by any stretch of the imagination. Knock Off is a marvelous secondary STAB move that removes the item of opposing Pokemon. Poison Jab provides necessary coverage, as it hits Fairy-types super effectively.

Set Details
========

The EVs are maxed out in both Attack and Speed to maximize Scrafty's extremely low sweeping potential. The 4 leftover EVs are put into Special Defense to ensure Download Porygon-Z and Porygon2 don't get a boost to their Special Attack should they switch into Scrafty. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed Timid Tornadus after a boost as well as Modest Exploud before a boost. On the other hand, an Adamant nature boosts Scrafty's damage output, but only lets it outspeed up to uninvested base 86s before a boost and Jolly Haxorus after a boost. Scrafty should choose its ability and item depending on the moveset. Leftovers gives Scrafty passive recovery and is thus best used with either Shed Skin or Intimidate. Life Orb gives Scrafty a 30% damage boost but has recoil, so it is best used with Drain Punch, although High Jump Kick variants also appreciate the damage boost. Lum Berry grants Scrafty a one-time immunity to status, which is useful as long as Shed Skin isn't the ability of choice. Shed Skin removes status inflicted upon Scrafty, making it easier to sweep past teams that rely on status to stop setup sweepers. Moxie nabs an Attack boost with each KO Scrafty gets, making it easier for Scrafty to progressively sweep. Lastly, Intimidate allows Scrafty to lower the opposing Pokemon's Attack by one stage upon switching in, making it easier for Scrafty to set up.

Usage Tips
========

Scrafty should set up whenever possible depending on the item, ability, and moveset chosen. A prime example of this is setting up on Cofagrigus when using either Lum Berry or Shed Skin variants. Only attempt to sweep after removing Scrafty's various checks and counters.

Team Options
========

Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Entei and Choice Specs Kyurem help remove walls that deter Scrafty from sweeping. Shaymin is an amazing partner, as it not only can wallbreak but also has access to Healing Wish, which allows Scrafty more than one chance to attempt a sweep. Fairy-types are the main stop to Scrafty's limited effectiveness, making Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types such as Darmanitan, Aggron, and Nidoqueen, respectively, good partners. Mega Aerodactyl removes Flying-types as well as Fighting-types, making it a great partner. Other Pokemon that remove Fairy-, Fighting-, or Flying-types, such as Doublade, also make for great Scrafty teammates.

Other Options
########

Ice Punch allows Scrafty to hit Gligar and Salamence, among others, for super effective damage, making it an option on the Dragon Dance set. However, Poison Jab's coverage is usually superior. Iron Head can be used over Poison Jab on the Dragon Dance set for the flinch chance, but it misses out on the all-important 2HKO on Whimsicott. Zen Headbutt is another option on the Dragon Dance set for super effective coverage on a plethora of Pokemon, ranging from Crobat to Heracross. A Choice Band set can be used for an immediate damage boost, but Scrafty can't utilize the item well.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Fairy-types**: Bulky Fairy-types can OHKO Scrafty with their STAB moves and can't be OHKOed by Poison Jab even after a boost.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Heracross and Mienshao check Scrafty, as they can OHKO it with their STAB moves while Scrafty needs Zen Headbutt to be able to OHKO them.

**Fast Flying-types**: Flying-types with high Speed stats can easily outspeed Scrafty after a boost and OHKO it with their STAB moves. Examples of such Pokemon are Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat.
