Overview
########

Haxorus is a solid Pokemon, as its mono Dragon typing and decent bulk is enough to allow it to set up on a lot of Pokemon in UU such as Victini, Suicune, and Vaporeon. Its stellar base 147 Attack allows it to hit hard initially, as well as after a boost. Haxorus also has a great ability in Mold Breaker, which gives it nearly perfect coverage with Earthquake and a STAB move. It also has a wide movepool to hit certain threats super effectively.

While Haxorus has almost everything going for it, it has its fair share of flaws. Its base 97 Speed causes it to be outsped by the most common Dragon in UU, Hydreigon, which means Haxorus has to set up before it can power through Hydreigon. Although Haxorus has enough bulk to take most resisted hits, it cannot take strong neutral hits from powerful Pokemon such as Mienshao or Alakazam.

Double Dance
########
name: Double Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Dragon Dance
move 3: Outrage / Dragon Claw
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance gives Haxorus the power to wallbreak, while Dragon Dance allows Haxorus to outspeed all non-Choice Scarf Pokemon after +1. Outrage is the hardest hitting STAB move Haxorus has; however, Dragon Claw is a viable option to avoid being locked into Outrage. Earthquake gives Haxorus near perfect coverage, hitting Steel-types such as Jirachi and Metagross super effectively, while Mold Breaker bypasses the abilities of Rhyperior, Bronzong, and Mega Aggron to hit them hard. Poison Jab is another option, to hit Fairies super effectively; however, if it uses Poison Jab, Haxorus cannot do anything to Steel-types.

Set Details
========

Max Attack and Speed EVs are used to maximize Haxorus's potential as a sweeper. Lum Berry allows Haxorus to set up without having to worry about status. Life Orb, however, allows Haxorus to hit harder, especially with a boost. A Jolly nature is mandatory for Haxorus to Speed tie other Haxorus and outspeed any positive natured Pokemon below base 97 Speed.

Usage Tips
========

Haxorus's bulk is used to its advantage with this set, taking resisted hits easily so it can set up a Swords Dance or Dragon Dance. Lum Berry mitigates any stray status, garnering more set up opportunities for Haxorus. This set is able to be used throughout the whole match, using Swords Dance early to mid-game to break down walls. Dragon Dance is used mid to late-game to finish off the opponent's team. This set must watch for priority users like Lucario, as a weakened Haxorus is easily revenge killed.

Team Options
========

Forretress is an ideal partner for Haxorus as it provides entry hazard support and can easily set up on Fairy-types, such as Florges and Aromatisse. It can also spin away hazards for Haxorus while luring in Fire-type moves that Haxorus can set up on. This set appreciates dedicated wallbreakers or cleaners such as Choice Band Victini or Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Although Florges is a decent counter to Haxorus, it also makes a great partner. Florges provides Wish and Aromatherapy support, allowing Haxorus to stay healthy throughout the whole match and to continue its job. Florges also walls Hydreigon, which tends to beat Haxorus one-on-one.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Outrage / Dragon Claw
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Poison Jab
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance is the obvious setup move of choice, boosting Haxorus's already high Attack to ridiculous levels. Outrage is the hardest hitting STAB move Haxorus has; however, Dragon Claw is a viable option as it allows Haxorus to not be locked into Outrage. Earthquake hits Steel-types, which resist Haxorus's STAB move, super effectively and works well with Mold Breaker, bypassing abilities such as Solid Rock, Filter, and Levitate. Poison Jab is the next best coverage move, hitting Fairies, which resist Haxorus's STAB move, super effectively.

Set Details
========

The Attack and Speed EVs are standard. However, an alternate spread of 96 HP / 252 Atk / 160 Spe allows Haxorus to outspeed positive natured base 85 Speed Pokemon, and gives it some bulk. Lum Berry is used to avoid a potentially crippling status ailment. However, Life Orb can be used to hit harder and break down walls a lot easier. Jolly should be used to outspeed other Haxorus and anything below base 97 Speed. Adamant can be used to hit harder, but Haxorus's Speed tier is too important to give up Jolly for Adamant.

Usage Tips
========

This set is best used early to mid-game to break down walls. Its somewhat decent bulk and useful typing allows it to take Scalds and Fire-type moves. Lum Berry gives Haxorus more set up opportunities so that it can overpower the opponent. This set must watch out for faster threats like Hydreigon and Mienshao, as they can both outspeed and easily revenge kill Haxorus.

Team Options
========

Haxorus appreciates entry hazards to secure OHKOs before it sets up and to wear down the foe. Forretress is an amazing partner as it sets up both Stealth Rock and Spikes and can spin away the opponent's hazards. It can also easily set up on Fairies, as it resists Fairy-type moves. Florges is an ideal partner for Haxorus, as it provides Wish and Aromatherapy support and can tank most hits aimed at Haxorus. This set truly appreciates cleaners and revenge killers to finish off the opponent's team after Haxorus has done its job.

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Dual Chop / Outrage
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Poison Jab
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Dragon Dance is used to boost Haxorus's Attack and Speed in preparation for a sweep. Dual Chop is the best option to make sure Focus Sash Alakazam cannot take a hit and OHKO Haxorus in return after a Dragon Dance. Outrage is a viable alternative as it is Haxorus's most poweful STAB move. Earthquake hits the Steel-types that resist its STAB move and complements Mold Breaker. Poison Jab grabs the last slot, as it allows Haxorus to hit Fairies, which are immune to its STAB move, super effectively.

Set Details
========

Max Attack and Speed EVs are used. Lum Berry allows a one-time recovery from status, which provides Haxorus with many set up opportunities. Life Orb can be used for more power at the cost of less set up opportunities. Jolly is used to Speed tie other Haxorus while outspeeding positive natured Pokemon below base 97 Speed. An Adamant nature can be used to hit harder.

Usage Tips
========

This set should be used mid to late-game to clean up and finish off the opponent's team. Haxorus's natural bulk helps it take resisted hits, allowing Haxorus to set up and sweep. After setting up, Haxorus must watch for priority users, as it tends to be weakened after setting up and can be easily revenge killed.

Team Options
========

Hazard support is very beneficial to Haxorus, allowing it to secure OHKOs after a Dragon Dance. Froslass is a decent partner, as it adds offensive pressure and the ability to spinblock its own hazards. Forretress is viable, too, as it can easily set up on Fairies, which Haxorus tends to stay away from. Forretress also spins away hazards, as Haxorus is hit by all of them. Forretress also has Volt Switch, allowing it to bring Haxorus in safely after it has spun away or set up hazards. Wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Victini, make great team members as they break down walls so that Haxorus can sweep.


Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Poison Jab
move 4: Dragon Claw / Sleep Talk
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Choice Band
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Outrage is Haxorus's hardest hitting STAB move and promotes this set's role in breaking down walls. Earthquake goes in the second slot, hitting Steel-types super effectively. Poison Jab is next, hitting Fairies super effectively. Dragon Claw is a reliable, more spammable STAB move that Haxorus can use early-game, while Sleep Talk allows Haxorus to act as a sleep absorber for its team.

Set Details
========

The standard EV spread of max Attack and max Speed is used. Haxorus can wallbreak very well with its base 147 Attack and the initial +1 boost from Choice Band. Jolly is the preferred nature, as Haxorus's base 97 Speed is important; however, Adamant can be used for more power.

Usage Tips
========

With Choice Band, Haxorus becomes a great wallbreaker, but it must watch out for faster threats such as Hydreigon, Mienshao, and Victini. This set is best used early-game to break down walls and the opponent's team in general, allowing cleaners or revenge killers to finish off the opponent.

Team Options
========

Haxorus loves entry hazard support. Forretress makes a great partner, as it can set up hazards to help wear down the opponent even more. Forretress also has a slow Volt Switch that can bring Haxorus in safely. Forretress can set up on Fairies as well. Lastly, Forretress can spin away hazards, as Haxorus is susceptible to all of them. Other good teammates are Pokemon that appreciate Haxorus's ability to wallbreak. Lucario is a good fit, as Haxorus breaks down walls so Lucario can set up and sweep.

Other Options
########

Dual Chop is very viable as it has the same Base Power as Dragon Claw and allows Haxorus to beat Substitute users and Focus Sash Alakazam. However, it comes with 90% accuracy. Choice Scarf allows Haxorus to be a revenge killer with more power than any other Choice Scarf user in the tier. However, its base 97 Speed is not fast enough to compete with other common Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Flygon, and Mienshao. These Choice Scarf users not only have secondary typings, in Hydreigon and Flygon's case, but they also have access to U-turn, allowing them to gain momentum, which Haxorus cannot boast. Substitute can be a way for Haxorus to avoid status and free up its item; however, it must give up a boosting or coverage move which isn't ideal for Haxorus. Iron Tail can be used over Poison Jab to still hit Fairies and has more power at the cost of accuracy. Taunt is another move Haxorus can use to stop walls from continuously trying to status it and Pokemon trying to set up alongside it. Low Kick can be used to score an OHKO on Snorlax after a Dragon Dance, but it does not provide the coverage Haxorus's other moves can. Superpower falls in the same vein as Low Kick, but has the horrible consequence of lowering Attack and Defense every time it is used. Dragon Dance + Endure + Salac Berry can allow Haxorus to set up on and outspeed Hydreigon and not worry about being beaten. However, this isn't that necessary as Haxorus can set up before Hydreigon comes in and can OHKO it as long as Hydreigon is not equipped with a Choice Scarf.

Checks and Counters
########

**Revenge Killers**: Haxorus's Speed tier is awkward, allowing faster Pokemon such as Mienshao and Hydreigon to OHKO it with their STAB moves. They threaten it before and after Haxorus sets up, as both of them can carry Choice Scarf and have a higher base Speed stat than Haxorus. Focus Sash Alakazam is another check as its Psychic can do a decent chunk to Haxorus, crippling it to the point of being revenge killed. Priority is also a pain for Haxorus, as Mega Absol's Sucker Punch and Lucario's Extreme Speed can do a ton of damage if they set up alongside Haxorus or have already set up.

**Fairy-types**: This is the ideal counter to most Dragons, and Haxorus is no exception. Haxorus has to set up to KO Florges with Poison Jab while Florges needs no investment and OHKOes Haxorus with Moonblast. Aromatisse does not boast the ability to OHKO Haxorus with its Moonblast, but it has better HP and Defense, allowing it to take more hits.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types, particularly those carrying Ice Beam, such as Vaporeon and Suicune, can also prove laboring, as Haxorus cannot set up in fear of being 2HKOed. Haxorus, even after setting up, cannot OHKO them back in return.

**Status**: Haxorus is exposed to all statuses, and if it is not carrying a Lum Berry, it must watch out for these as all of them can cripple Haxorus, rendering it useless for the rest of the match.
