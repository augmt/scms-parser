Overview
########

Haxorus has fallen from grace since the beginning of ORAS, especially now that Salamence and Tyrantrum provide more competition to Haxorus as a Dragon-type. Haxorus has access to two amazing boosting moves, however, in Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, as well as an amazing Attack stat; unfortunately, its Speed and bulk are lacking.

Double Dance
########
name: Double Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Dragon Dance
move 3: Dragon Claw / Outrage
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Lum Berry
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Swords Dance allows Haxorus break through more defensively oriented teams by boosting its Attack stat by two stages. Dragon Dance, on the other hand, boosts Haxorus's Speed and Attack stats at the same time, allowing Haxorus to beat more offensive teams. Dragon Claw is a reliable STAB move, although its damage output can be underwhelming at times. Outrage, on the other, hand hits hard but has the drawback of locking Haxorus into it. Earthquake has great coverage in conjunction with Dragon-type moves, hittingthe Steel-types that resist Dragon-type moves for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed EVs allow Haxorus to sweep as efficiently as possible. Mold Breaker is the chosen ability, as it has the most use out of all three choices, nullifying defensive abilities such as Mega Aggron's Filter and Rotom-H's Levitate. A Lum Berry gives Haxorus a means of setting up more easily. A Jolly nature allows Haxorus to outspeed many threats ranging from Nidoking to Lucario. An Adamant nature can also be used, should the extra power be appealing to you.

Usage Tips
========

Haxorus should be sent in during the mid- and late-game against more offensive teams to have a good chance of cleaning up. Against more defensive teams, however, it should be sent in from the get-go or during the mid-game to wear down the opposing team for another Pokemon to clean after it.

Team Options
========

Haxorus appreciates entry hazard support, making Forretress and Roserade good teammates. Haxorus can wear down opposing teams fairly well, making cleaners such as Yanmega and Mega Sharpedo excellent partners to it. Lastly, wallbreakers such as Choice Band Darmanitan and Life Orb Hydreigon can wear down foes for Haxorus to clean up.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Poison Jab
move 4: Dragon Claw / Sleep Talk
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Outrage warrants the first moveslot, as it hits extremely hard in conjunction with a Choice Band. Earthquake gives perfect neutral coverage with Outrage and hits the Steel-types that tend to switch into Haxorus. Poison Jab hits Fairy-types for super effective damage, which is important, as they're the best switch-ins for Haxorus. Dragon Claw is a viable option if you don't want to lock Haxorus into Outrage. Sleep Talk is an alternative, should you want Haxorus to serve as a sleep absorber on your team.

Set Details
========

Haxorus's Speed and Attack EVs are maximized to augment its offensive capabilities. Choice Band is the item for the set, as it allows Haxorus to be an amazing wallbreaker, nailing 2HKOs and OHKOs on a majority of the tier's premier walls such as Suicune and Florges. An Adamant nature is used to increase Haxorus's damage output as much as possible. A Jolly nature can also be used should outspeeding positive-natured base 85s and above seem more important. Mold Breaker is the chosen ability as it provides the most use out of all three choices, nullifying defensive abilities such as Levitate.

Usage Tips
========

This particular Haxorus set is most effective during the mid-game, when it can start to break down opposing walls or significantly dent the opposing team. Haxorus shouldn't be locked into Outrage if opposing Fairy- or Steel-types are still active on the opposing team.

Team Options
========

Shaymin is an amazing teammate, as it not only forms a good wallbreaking core with Haxorus but also has access to Healing Wish, which allows Haxorus to have another chance at wallbreaking should it be weakened at some point during the game. Sharpedo, Mega Beedrill, and Swords Dance Lucario are examples of cleaners, which highly appreciate the wallbreaking capabilities that Haxorus possesses. Vaporeon and Florges are clerics, making them good partners, as they can heal off any status Haxorus incurs. Haxorus appreciates entry hazard support, making Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Chesnaught good partners. An excellent partner for Choice Band Haxorus is Choice Scarf Heracross, as Haxorus lures in most of its defensive checks, making it easier for Heracross to clean. Speed control support, such as Stun Spore and Tailwind, really helps this Haxorus set fare well against more offensive teams; therefore, Tornadus and Whimsicott are amazing teammates.

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Outrage / Dragon Claw
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Taunt / Poison Jab
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Life Orb / Lum Berry
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Dragon Dance raises Haxorus's Speed and Attack stats by one stage, making it a deadly sweeper. Outrage hits relatively hard but confuses Haxorus after two to three turns and locks Haxorus into it during that period. Dragon Claw doesn't have the flaws Outrage does but is lacking in the damage department. Earthquake is the most important coverage move for Haxorus, being able to hit anything that resists Haxorus's STAB type for at least neutral damage. Taunt allows Haxorus to set up on walls relying on support moves to prevent Haxorus from sweeping, such as Will-O-Wisp Rotom-H and Roar Swampert; however, it should only be used with a Life Orb, as Lum Berry usually makes Taunt less useful. Poison Jab can be used over Taunt as an alternate coverage move to hit Fairy-types such as Aromatisse and Granbull super effectively.

Set Details
========

Life Orb gives Haxorus a nice damage boost at the cost of 10% HP each time it uses an attacking move. Lum Berry gets rid of status only once per match; it is also a good option when using Outrage, removing the that the move causes. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are being used to maximize Haxorus's sweeping potential. A Jolly nature allows Haxorus to outspeed positive-natured base 85s, whereas an Adamant nature gives Haxorus a 10% damage increase.

Usage Tips
========

This Haxorus set should be sent in during mid- or late-game to sweep or weaken the opposing team. Haxorus should set up on Pokemon that can't OHKO it, don't have phazing moves, or are forced out by it. Haxorus should only set up when the opposing team doesn't have a Choice Scarf user or any priority users left.

Team Options
========
This Haxorus set aims to sweep or clean mid- to late-game; therefore, wallbreakers make for excellent partners, such as Life Orb Hydreigon and Choice Band Darmanitan. Physically defensive Steel-types usually stop Haxorus from sweeping unless they're weakened, which makes Ground-, Fighting-, and Fire-types good partners. Examples of them are Nidoking, Heracross, and Entei, respectively. Shaymin is an amazing partner to this Haxorus set, as it can wallbreak as well as use Healing Wish to allow Haxorus more than one chance to sweep the opposing team.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Poison Jab
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Swords Dance allows Haxorus to break through more defensively orientated teams by boosting its Attack stat by two stages. Outrage pairs well with Swords Dance due to its amazing damage output coupled with a STAB boost. Given that Outrage users such as Haxorus commonly lure in Steel- and Fairy-type Pokemon, super effective coverage against them is most appreciated in the last two slots, thus making Earthquake and Poison Jab perfect fits.

Set Details
========

Due to Haxorus not having any significant bulk, the EVs are put into Attack and Speed instead. A Lum Berry gives Haxorus a one-time immunity to status. A Life Orb, on the other hand, gives Haxorus a 1.3x damage boost, but at the cost of 1/10 of its HP with each hit. A Jolly nature is crucial for outspeeding positive-natured base 85s. Meanwhile, an Adamant nature can be used for more power.

Usage Tips
========

This particular set is most effective against defensively oriented teams and is best set up when no faster threats are left. This set should also be sent in mid-game.

Team Options
========

A set such as this is always paired best with cleaners, as they can usually sweep after Haxorus does its job; as such, Mega Sharpedo, Yanmega, and Choice Scarf Mienshao make the best of partners. Lunar Dance and Healing Wish are both moves that can remove status and heal the recipient to full, giving Haxorus another chance to wear down walls. Therefore, Lunar Dance and Healing Wish users, such as Cresselia and Shaymin, respectively, make for excellent teammates.

Other Options
########

Haxorus can run a Choice Scarf set, but it's usually beaten by a majority of the other Choice Scarf users in the tier. A Hone Claws set might seem viable but is outclassed by the Swords Dance set. Despite learning a variety of support moves such as Roar and Taunt, Haxorus doesn't have the typing nor the bulk to run a good defensive set. Dual Chop is an option over Dragon Claw on any Haxorus set, as it breaks through Focus Sashes, Sturdy, and Substitutes; however, it has a chance to miss, which can be crucial.

Checks & Counters
########

**Granbull**: Granbull checks all Haxorus variants, being able to take a Poison Jab and OHKO with Play Rough in return.

**Faster Choice Scarf Users**: Choice Scarf users that outspeed Haxorus at +1 Speed such as Hydreigon and Mienshao check Haxorus fairly well.

**Fairy-types**: Bulky Fairy-types such as Aromatisse and Florges check Haxorus fairly well but have to be wary of Poison Jab, while Whimsicott, a faster Fairy-type, can switch into a setup move and Encore Haxorus into said move.

**Faster Dragon-types**: Faster Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Salamence easily outspeed Haxorus and OHKO with a STAB Dragon-type move.

**Bulky Water-types with Ice Beam**: Bulky Water-types that run Ice-type coverage, such as Ice Beam Suicune and Ice Beam Vaporeon, check Haxorus fairly well.

**Ice Shard Users**: Pokemon with STAB Ice Shard such as Cloyster and Abomasnow can easily revenge kill Haxorus by hitting it super effectively before it can do anything.
