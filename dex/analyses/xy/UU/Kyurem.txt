Overview
########

Kyurem's Dragon / Ice typing is decent defensively, resisting Grass-, Water-, and Electric-type attacks. It also has great offensive coverage, only being resisted by Steel-types, which are taken care of by Earth Power. Its typing along with its 125 / 90 / 90 bulk means that it can take hits, while its 130 / 130 offenses means it isn't a sitting duck. This allows its Pressure ability to shine, as it means it can effectively stall the PP out of super effective attacks such as Stone Edge and Close Combat. Kyurem has reliable recovery which improves its ability to Pressure stall. It is also the only Pokemon in UU with the ability to use Pressure stall effectively and still have an offensive presence.

However, Kyurem does have flaws stopping it from being a top tier threat. It has a hard time getting around special walls such as Blissey, Umbreon, Florges, and Snorlax. Even with Focus Blast, it still cannot get past Blissey or Florges, two Pokemon that hard-wall Kyurem. It is stuck at the 95 Speed tier, which means that there are many threats that can put a stop to Kyurem, such as Hydreigon, Infernape, and Mienshao, which all carry a STAB move that can outright OHKO Kyurem.

SubRoost
########
name: SubRoost
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Roost
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Earth Power / Dragon Tail
ability: Pressure
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
evs: 56 HP / 236 SpA / 216 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Substitute allows Kyurem to avoid status and helps it effectively Pressure stall, as it tends to be faster than most, if not all, walls. Roost is for reliable recovery and allows Kyurem to Pressure stall even longer. Ice Beam is a reliable STAB move and hits hard with a Life Orb boost and Special Attack investment. Earth Power has great synergy with Ice Beam, hitting Fire- and Steel-types super effectively while hitting Water-types harder than Ice Beam. Dragon Tail is an option if your team stacks entry hazards, as it phazes and helps rack up chip damage.

Set Details
========

The 56 HP EVs give Kyurem 405 HP in total, allowing Kyurem to have 101 HP Substitutes, which is ideal to avoid the Substitute being broken by Seismic Toss and to survive four switches into Stealth Rock. Timid is the ideal nature when combined with 216 Speed EVs, as they allow Kyurem to outspeed positive nature base 90 Speed Pokemon. While Dragon Tail is an option, it isn't going to be a powerful attack, as it is only used for phazing. Life Orb is used to ensure Kyurem hits harder, which works well as Kyurem has reliable recovery in Roost, mitigating the HP loss from making Substitutes and Life Orb recoil. Leftovers is also an option, which allows Kyurem to have more survivability at the cost of power.

Usage Tips
========

This set can be used throughout the game to Pressure stall low PP moves, like Draco Meteor, Stone Edge, and Close Combat. Its move coverage coupled with its decent Special Attack means it can wear the opponent down while stalling out hits that could spell doom. This set must be very wary of Infiltrator users such as Crobat, as Infiltrator can now hit through Substitutes.

Team Options
========

Kyurem really loves entry hazards removed, as it is susceptible to all of them, especially Stealth Rock. Mega Blastoise makes a great partner, as it can wallbreak with its Mega Launcher boosted attacks, and its bulk allows it to spin multiple times throughout the match. Florges is an amazing partner, as it takes all the Dragon- and Fighting-type attacks aimed at Kyurem. Although they are both weak to Steel, it isn't that common of an attacking type. Kyurem also loves its own hazard support, as it forces switches with the Pressure stalling. More specifically, Kyurem likes Spikes support, as most common switch-ins are Fighting-types such as Infernape or Mienshao.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Outrage / Iron Head / Roost
ability: Pressure
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Hasty / Timid

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is a STAB nuke, but comes with a detrimental Special Attack drop that prevents it from being spammed. Ice Beam is a weaker STAB move, but it allows Kyurem to stay in and keep wearing the opponent down. Earth Power hits the Steel-types that resist Kyurem's STAB combination. Outrage is to get around special walls such as Blissey, while Iron Head is specifically for Florges, a common switch-in to Kyurem. Roost, however, provides reliable recovery and helps mitigate Life Orb recoil.

Set Details
========

The EVs are tailored for hitting as hard as possible on the special side while using Kyurem's base 130 Attack to its advantage. It should be noted that 104 Atk EVs guarantee the 2HKO on Umbreon with Outrage, but that is the only reason to invest more than 4 EVs into Attack as Outrage 2HKOes Blissey. A Hasty nature is used to increase damage so that Outrage or Iron Head can hit harder, but a Timid nature is preferred if Roost is selected for the fourth moveslot.

Usage Tips
========

This set takes advantage of Kyurem's 130 / 130 attacking stats along with the power Life Orb provides help Kyurem to hit hard both physically and specially. The coverage Kyurem has is a godsend, as it weakens the team to let late-game cleaners to come in and finish off the opponent. It can also weaken walls so that setup sweepers can set up and power through the opponent.

Team Options
========

Florges is still an excellent partner for this set, especially if Kyurem doesn't opt for Roost, as it appreciates the Wish / Aromatherapy support. This set really appreciates cleaners and setup sweepers as partners, such as Choice Scarf Krookodile or Swords Dance Lucario. This set also appreciates entry hazard support to secure OHKOs. Forretress is a great partner as most of Kyurem's checks are weakened by Spikes. Sticky Web also helps Kyurem outspeed faster threats. Galvantula or Shuckle can work, with the former providing offensive pressure and the latter able to consistently set Sticky Web up, should it be Defogged or spun away.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Outrage
ability: Pressure
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Hasty / Mild

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is the hardest hitting STAB move with a nasty secondary effect that often forces Kyurem out. Ice Beam, on the other hand, is a more spammable STAB move. Earth Power rounds out Kyurem's coverage, hitting Steel- and Fire-types that plague Kyurem. Outrage allows Kyurem to hit fast, frail threats on the physical side or break though special walls, such as Blissey or Goodra.

Set Details
========

A Hasty nature is used so that Kyurem can outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf base 95 Speed Pokemon. A Mild nature can be used to boost Special Attack if Choice Scarf Pokemon in that speed tier aren't a problem to the team. The EVs simply capitalize on Kyurem's Special Attack and Speed with the four leftover EVs put in Attack to boost Outrage's power.

Usage Tips
========

This set gets the jump on some of Kyurem's checks, as most expect the SubRoost set. Choice Scarf allows Kyurem to outpace threats that tend to threaten Kyurem, such as Infernape, Mega Aerodactyl, and non-Choice Scarf Mienshao. This set also has no means of recovery, so it should be used late-game after the opponent is worn down by Kyurem's teammates to clean up or act as a revenge killer.

Team Options
========

Although Choice Scarf Kyurem can surprise some of its checks, it doesn't have the power that Choice Specs or Life Orb has and thus needs a wallbreaker. Choice Band Victini does this well, resisting Fighting- and Steel-type moves aimed at Kyurem. Florges is still a great partner to this set, especially as Kyurem is more prone to paralysis and has no recovery, so Wish / Aromatherapy support alleviates that. Entry hazard support and removal is almost necessary with this set as it doesn't have the power to OHKO or 2HKO Pokemon by itself like Life Orb Kyurem does, and it is easily worn down by entry hazards. Forretress is an excellent partner as it sets up Spikes, Stealth Rock, and can spin away any entry hazards. Sticky Web isn't as needed on this set, but it helps Kyurem by allowing it to outspeed other Choice Scarf Pokemon with 95 or more base Speed.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Dragon Pulse / Flash Cannon / Focus Blast
ability: Pressure
items: Choice Specs
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Draco Meteor and Ice Beam are great STAB moves that hit hard thanks to Choice Specs. Earth Power puts the Fire- and Steel-types in their place. Dragon Pulse provides a more reliable Dragon-type STAB move, allowing Kyurem to stay in and not lose momentum. Flash Cannon hits Florges and Focus Blast allows Kyurem to power through the other special walls, such as Snorlax and Umbreon.

Set Details
========

These EVs are standard for a special sweeper, with max Special Attack, max Speed, and a Timid nature. This, combined with Choice Specs, makes Kyurem extremely lethal. However, a Modest nature can be used as most of Kyurem's checks are faster. It should be noted that with a Modest nature, Kyurem can 2HKO Florges after Stealth Rock damage with Flash Cannon. Sticky Web from the likes of Galvantula or Shuckle really helps this set to outspeed faster threats and kill them.

Usage Tips
========

This set is meant to wallbreak and use Kyurem's nice offensive typing to its advantage. This set plays as more of a pivot thanks to its main STAB attack, Draco Meteor, lowering its Special Attack by two stages every time it is used. However, depending on its last move, it can also stay in and just spam a move until it is KOed.

Team Options
========

Kyurem appreciates entry hazard removal as it is susceptible to all of them and this set plays like more of a pivot. Mega Blastoise is a decent partner as its natural bulk allows it to spin multiple times throughout the match, and it complements Kyurem's wallbreaking capabilities. This set appreciates setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Lucario and Mienshao as partners, due to Kyurem crippling walls, allowing for easier setup opportunities. This set still appreciates entry hazard support to secure OHKOs.

Other Options
########

A physically biased mixed set is an option, using moves such as Outrage, Iron Head, Ice Beam, and Roost with a Life Orb. This is usually not as viable because Kyurem doesn't have a decent physical Ice-type STAB attack and being locked into Outrage isn't ideal, consdering how common Florges is. Kyurem can also use dual screens, as it has reliable recovery in Roost, but this is usually a waste as it leaves Kyurem with one attack, meaning it can't set up on the threats that already plague it. A Substitute + Toxic set is also very plausible, using Substitute / Roost / Toxic / Ice Beam or Dragon Pulse. An utility counter set, with Ice Beam / Earth Power / Dragon Tail / Roost is also plausible, but it has a hard time without Substitute, as status is a huge problem and Kyurem is crippled by all of them. Blissey also is able to almost always safely switch in, as Dragon Tail doesn't do enough damage and Ice Beam and Earth Power deal little damage to Blissey.

Checks & Counters
########

**Special Walls**: Florges, Snorlax, and Umbreon all wall Kyurem with ease and Kyurem has no way to get around them without coverage, which it cannot run on its SubRoost set, the most common Kyurem set. Kyurem usually doesn't run both coverage moves as it needs Iron Head to get around Florges, Focus Blast to get around Umbreon and non-Assault Vest Snorlax, and Outrage to get around Blissey.

**Fast Fighting-types**: Infernape and Mienshao both threaten Kyurem with their STAB moves. Any of these Fighting-types can outspeed Kyurem and OHKO it. A special mention goes to Mienshao, as its most common set is its Choice Scarf set, meaning most of the time Kyurem will not be able to outspeed and OHKO it.

**Steel-Types**: Although hit hard by Earth Power, specially defensive Steel-types can take Kyurem's coverage moves and resists its STAB combination. Specially defensive Jirachi, Assault Vest Metagross, and Bronzong are just a few. Bronzong gets a special mention as it takes both of Kyurem's STAB moves with ease and is immune to Earth Power, thanks to Levitate.

**Hydreigon**: With its base 98 Speed, Hydreigon is able outspeed Kyurem and take on any of its sets. It does, however, have to watch out for Choice Scarf Kyurem and SubRoost if it has a Substitute up as Kyurem's STAB moves threaten Hydreigon.
