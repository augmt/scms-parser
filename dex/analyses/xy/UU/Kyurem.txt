Overview
########

Kyurem is one of the most versatile Pokemon in the entire UU metagame. With an excellent base 130 Special Attack and decent base 95 Speed, it is very effective as a wallbreaker or a revenge killer, giving both bulky teams and hyper offense teams headaches. Additionally, Kyurem's 120 / 90 / 90 bulk, surprisingly decent defensive typing, and Pressure allow it to be a formidable PP staller, all while maintaining a strong offensive presence. Kyurem can even get past opposing Steel- and Fairy-types that can switch into its STAB attacks with Earth Power and Flash Cannon, respectively. On the downside, while base 95 Speed is enough for Kyurem to revenge kill with a Choice Scarf, it's fairly lackluster on its own, leaving Kyurem outsped by threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Pidgeot, and Cobalion. While Kyurem's typing gives it useful resistances to Grass-, Water-, and Electric-type attacks, it also gives Kyurem weaknesses to Dragon- and Fighting-type moves. This makes Kyurem easily revenge killed, as most Dragon- and Fighting-types such as Salamence and Mienshao outspeed it. Kyurem also possesses a nasty weakness to Stealth Rock, meaning it will have trouble switching in, which it must do often if it is running a Choice item. Nonetheless, Kyurem's versatility in UU means it should always be considered for a team of any archetype.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Focus Blast / Dragon Pulse / Flash Cannon
ability: Pressure
item: Choice Specs
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is extremely powerful due to the STAB boost and Choice Specs, and it isn't even that weak if Kyurem needs to use it consecutively. Ice Beam is a more reliable STAB attack that does not lower Kyurem's Special Attack and still hits hard with Choice Specs. Earth Power smashes the Fire-types that resist Ice Beam and the Steel-types that resist both Ice Beam and Draco Meteor. Focus Blast allows Kyurem to break Umbreon, Snorlax, and Blissey. Dragon Pulse is an alternate STAB move with good neutral coverage, hitting Kingdra and opposing Kyurem super effectively, while Flash Cannon is another option for Kyurem to beat Florges.

Set Details
========

Choice Specs boosts Kyurem's Special Attack, making it a fearsome wallbreaker. Speed and Special Attack are maximized to make the most of Kyurem's wallbreaking potential. A Timid nature is preferred to get the jump on positive-natured Roserade, Krookodile, and Heracross, though a Modest nature can be used to 2HKO Florges or Blissey with Flash Cannon and Focus Blast, respectively. Alternatively, a bulky spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD prolongs Kyurem's presence on the battlefield.

Usage Tips
========

This set has the role of a wallbreaker, so use Kyurem in the early-game or mid-game in order to wear down the opposing team. Though Draco Meteor hits extremely hard, don't spam it, as its side effect of lowering Kyurem's Special Attack allows Kyurem to be walled after enough uses of the move. Moreover, as Kyurem will be switching out often, use this set as a way to pivot around, and be sure to clear the field of entry hazards so Kyurem can come back in safely.

Team Options
========

If running a Timid nature, entry hazard support is required for Kyurem to 2HKO Blissey and Florges with Focus Blast and Flash Cannon, respectively. Swampert, Azelf, Empoleon, and Gligar can all set up Stealth Rock to aid Kyurem's wallbreaking. Setup sweepers such as Lucario and Haxorus appreciate Kyurem wearing down walls, thus aiding their sweeps. Entry hazard removal is necessary so Kyurem can switch out in order to change moves. Blastoise is a great spinner that forms a dual-wallbreaking core with Kyurem.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Dragon Pulse
ability: Pressure
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is very powerful coming off of a base 130 Special Attack stat. Ice Beam is a more reliable STAB attack that does not lower Kyurem's Special Attack. Earth Power hits the Steel-types that wall Kyurem's STAB combination, such as Mega Aggron, as well as Fire-types such as Entei, which resist Ice Beam. Dragon Pulse is an alternative STAB attack that gives Kyurem a better shot at beating bulky Water-types such as Suicune.

Set Details
========

Choice Scarf boosts Kyurem's lackluster base 95 Speed to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and make it a solid revenge killer. Special Attack and Speed are maximized to increase Kyurem's offensive capability. A Timid nature allows Kyurem to Speed tie with other Choice Scarf Pokemon with base 95 Speed, such as Darmanitan.

Usage Tips
========

As Kyurem has no way of boosting its offense, this set is relegated to the role of a late-game cleaner. If the opposing team hasn't been weakened enough, you may need to switch Kyurem out frequently in order to change moves, so keep Stealth Rock off the field at all times. Use this set to land a surprise KO on Kyurem's checks such as Infernape and Mega Aerodactyl, which would outspeed and OHKO Kyurem otherwise.

Team Options
========

As Choice Scarf Kyurem sometimes finds itself lacking in power, a physical wallbreaker such as Darmanitan can wear down the special walls that Kyurem can't break. Heal Bell support from Florges can heal Kyurem's paralysis, as Kyurem loses its ability to revenge kill if it is paralyzed. Entry hazard control is important to allow Kyurem to have an easier time landing KOs and to switch in more easily. Forretress and Donphan can both set entry hazards and remove them.

SubRoost
########
name: SubRoost
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Roost
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Earth Power / Toxic
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
evs: 56 HP / 220 SpA / 232 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Substitute allows Kyurem to absorb status and PP stall the foe with Pressure as they try to break the Substitute. Roost heals off the HP lost by using Substitute and makes Kyurem harder to take down in general. Ice Beam is Kyurem's STAB move and gives it solid offensive presence, despite being a wall. Earth Power has great synergy with Ice Beam, hitting the Steel- and Fire-types that resist Kyurem's Ice-type STAB move, in addition to hitting bulky Water-types harder. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to put a timer on opposing sweepers and defensive Pokemon. With Toxic in combination with Substitute and Roost, Kyurem can do a great job at stalling its foes.

Set Details
========

The given HP EVs allow Kyurem to make 101 HP Substitutes, preventing Blissey from breaking its Substitutes with a single Seismic Toss. 232 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are necessary to outspeed Jolly Krookodile. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack to make Kyurem as powerful as possible. Leftovers promotes Kyurem's longevity and makes it very difficult to take down in combination with Substitute and Roost. Alternatively, Life Orb raises the power of Kyurem's attacks, and Roost can heal off the recoil from Life Orb. Pressure makes foes lose 2 PP whenever they use a move. Couple that with Kyurem's bulk, and it becomes adept at PP stalling.

Usage Tips
========

This set is for stalling out low PP moves such as Draco Meteor, Close Combat, and Stone Edge. Kyurem can be brought in at any point in the game to stall, but make sure to bring it into battle against Pokemon that can't break its Substitute with one hit, such as Blissey. Infiltrator users such as Crobat and Noivern can hit through Kyurem's Substitute and give it trouble, so be cautious if the opponent packs one. Kyurem's offensive capability turns it into a tank instead of a wall, so take advantage of it to weaken foes as they try to break Kyurem down. This set struggles mightily with dedicated walls, so be sure to scout with Substitute and Toxic in order to win stall wars.

Team Options
========

A physical wallbreaker such as Mienshao can deal with the Pokemon that wall Kyurem, making it easier for Kyurem to outstall the opponent's team. An entry hazard remover such as Mega Blastoise can allow Kyurem to enter the battlefield unscathed. Mega Blastoise also doubles as a wallbreaker that can help Kyurem win stall wars should it lack Toxic. Florges can take the Dragon- and Fighting-type attacks that hit Kyurem for massive damage. As many of Kyurem's checks are Fighting-types, Spikes is preferred over Stealth Rock to help it wear down its checks. Forretress provides Spikes and removes entry hazards on Kyurem's side of the field. Offensive Pokemon such as Salamence appreciate Kyurem's ability to stallbreak, allowing them to set up and sweep.

Life Orb Attacker
########
name: Life Orb Attacker
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Outrage / Iron Head / Roost
ability: Pressure
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Hasty / Timid

Moves
========

Draco Meteor hits Kyurem's foes very hard with the boosts from STAB and Life Orb. Ice Beam is a second STAB attack that does not lower Kyurem's Special Attack, making it far more spammable than Draco Meteor. Earth Power hits the Steel-, Fire-, and Water-types that resist Kyurem's other attacks. Outrage is great for cleaning up in the late-game and taking on most special walls, while Iron Head 2HKOes Florges. If your team already handles special walls well enough, Roost can be used in the fourth slot to recover Life Orb damage. Kyurem is bulky enough to make use of recovery even on an offensive set such as this one.

Set Details
========

Life Orb makes Kyurem function as a sweeper by boosting the power of its attacks and giving it the freedom to change moves at will. Special Attack and Speed are maximized to give Kyurem as much offensive presence as possible. A Hasty nature is necessary to outspeed base 90 Speed Pokemon and tie with other base 95 Speed Pokemon, and to not lower Kyurem's Attack should it be running Outrage or Iron Head. However, if running Roost, use a Timid nature instead.

Usage Tips
========

Due to Life Orb boosting Kyurem's damage output, this set has the role of a wallbreaker. The ability to switch moves means that Kyurem can stay in and sweep on its own, so this set does not rely heavily on entry hazard removal. Kyurem has few switch-ins because it hits both physically and specially, and it threatens Florges with the presence of Iron Head.

Team Options
========

Late-game cleaners such as Mega Beedrill appreciate Kyurem's wallbreaking ability, making it easier for them to finish off the weakened opposing team. Wish support from Florges can help Kyurem stay healthy enough to sweep. Entry hazard support from a setter such as Forretress or Donphan is important to allow Kyurem to have an easier time landing KOs. Sticky Web support from Galvantula or Shuckle allows Kyurem to outspeed some of its checks, such as Infernape.

Other Options
########

Hone Claws can be used to boost Kyurem's Attack, but Kyurem has no physical Ice-type STAB moves to take advantage of, so it is outclassed by Kyurem's other offensive options. Dual screens can provide Kyurem's teammates with some extra bulk, but Kyurem is better off attacking or stalling. Dragon Tail allows Kyurem to phaze stat boosters that attempt to use its SubRoost set as setup bait.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Fast Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Infernape outspeed most variants of Kyurem and threaten it with their STAB moves.

**Fast Dragon-types**: Both Hydreigon and Haxorus outspeed Kyurem and OHKO it with their Dragon-type STAB attacks.

**Special Walls**: Even with Outrage, Iron Head, and Focus Blast, Kyurem still struggles against Blissey, Snorlax, Umbreon, and Florges.

**Specially Defensive Steel-types**: Bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong and Escavalier hard counter Kyurem because they wall all of its common special attacking moves and resist Outrage.
