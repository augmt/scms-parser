Overview
########

Exploud is a pretty average Pokemon; it doesn't have any notable stats or even a unique typing. In fact, there is only one reason to use Exploud at all: STAB Boomburst. While Chatot also has the same niche, Exploud has enough bulk to take some hits while it's smacking the opposition. Unlike other specially attacking Normal-types, such as Porygon-Z, Exploud has access to Scrappy, allowing it to completely bypass Ghost-types, as all relevant Ghost-types are flat-out OHKOed by Boomburst. Exploud does have its faults though. It's laughably weak when hit by Knock Off, extremely slow, and is prone to being revenge killed.

Moves
========

Boomburst is the only reason to use Exploud. STAB and Choice Specs allow it to hit like a truck. Fire Blast lets Exploud hit Steel-types coming in to take Boomburst, while Overheat does the same with a little more power. Focus Blast also does the same, except it can also hit Rock-types and Umbreon. Surf is for extra coverage against Pokemon like Rhyperior.

Set Details
========

The nature and EVs are standard for a special attacker, meaning that it has maxed out Speed and Special Attack, and Scrappy lets Exploud hit Ghost-types. Choice Specs are used to make Exploud's attacks actually do some damage. A Modest nature is used because Timid doesn't outpace anything notable at the cost of some extra power.

Usage Tips
========

Most of the time, you should just go for Boomburst; the other moves are just for coverage, so only use them when necessary.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can take advantage of the heavy damage that Exploud leaves in its wake make the best partners, such as late-game sweepers, namely Sharpedo and Lucario. Exploud also likes Sticky Web on the field to make up for its pitiful Speed, so Pokemon like Galvantula and Shuckle are good partners. Ghost-types like Doublade are welcome because they can take incoming Fighting-type attacks. Pokemon that can take a Knock Off or two, like Mega Evolutions or Cobalion, can be good partners too.

Other Options
########

A Life Orb set with Sticky Web support can go a long way if used properly, though the Choice Specs set packs way more of a punch, and the ability to switch moves isn't too big of a deal for Exploud. Ice Beam can be used for another coverage option, though it doesn't hit anything notable for more damage than moves on the main set. A Timid nature can be used for more Speed in exchange for power. A Silk Scarf can also be used to mimic a Life Orb without the recoil damage. Work Up can be used as a boosting move for Exploud over Surf, allowing it to hit just as hard as Choice Specs, but with the ability to switch moves.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Almost every Fighting-type in the tier can threaten Exploud into switching out to avoid a KO.

**Blissey**: Blissey completely stops Exploud in its tracks, though the same can't be said about the other special walls, such as Umbreon.

**Offensive Pokemon**: Most  offensive Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage or powerful STAB moves can pose a problem.
