Overview
########

Exploud has one major thing going for it: Boomburst, a 140 Base Power STAB move that allows Exploud to put a major dent in most of the tier. Also, to augment its Boomburst-spamming power, Exploud has access to Scrappy, allowing it to hit Ghost-types. Additionally, Exploud has excellent coverage options in Fire Blast, Focus Blast, and Surf, as well as other useful moves such as Sleep Talk. Sadly, Exploud's flaws lie in its underwhelming Speed, its average bulk, and its weakness to the common Fighting-types in UU.

BOOMBURST
########
name: BOOMBURST
move 1: Boomburst
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Surf
move 4: Focus Blast / Sleep Talk
ability: Scrappy
item: Choice Specs
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Boomburst is what Exploud should be using almost all of the time and is its most powerful STAB move. Fire Blast is useful for hitting Steel-types, which resist Boomburst. Surf nails the Rock-types, mainly Mega Aerodactyl, that switch in on Exploud for super effective damage. Sleep Talk is recommended in the fourth slot to allow Exploud to switch in on sleep inducers, but Focus Blast can be used to hit Blissey and Rock- and Steel-types (namely Empoleon) super effectively, though its accuracy is disappointing.

Set Details
========

252 EVs in Special Attack with a Modest nature maximize Exploud's power. 252 Speed EVs allow Exploud to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, including uninvested base 90 Speed Pokemon such as specially defensive Roserade. A Timid nature can be used over a Modest nature, but it doesn't allow Exploud to outspeed many notable threats.

Usage Tips
========

Because Exploud's bulk isn't too great, the best practice is to bring it in off of a fainted teammate, U-turn, or Volt Switch. When using Exploud, most of the time you should just go for Boomburst, as very little likes to switch in on it. Other coverage moves should only be used when necessary, as Boomburst already does enough to most Pokemon.

Team Options
========

Fighting-types such as Machamp, Infernape, and Lucario make for good partners for their ability to take on Blissey, one of the few Pokemon Exploud can't reliable take on. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Mienshao, Infernape, Jirachi, Mega Ampharos, Rotom-H, Rotom-C, and Crobat make for good partners for their ability to bring Exploud into the battle safely. Crobat also gets a special mention for its ability to take on Fighting-types. Fairy-types such as Florges and Aromatisse are helpful for their ability to take on Fighting-types. Sticky Web support from Pokemon such as Shuckle and Galvantula is helpful to allow Exploud to outspeed more Pokemon and damage them with Boomburst. Finally, Tailwind support from Pokemon such as Tornadus and Whimsicott is useful to double Exploud's Speed for a few turns.

Other Options
########

Life Orb is an option to allow Exploud to switch moves, but a Choice Specs-boosted Boomburst already hits most Pokemon hard enough and Exploud doesn't appreciate Life Orb's recoil. Choice Scarf can be used to surprise the opponent and get a surprise KO, but doesn't have the sheer power of Choice Specs. Hammer Arm can be used be used in conjunction with Life Orb to help take on Blissey (it even has a chance to 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage), but Exploud doesn't like having its Speed or bulk compromised. Ice Beam can be used to hit Pokemon such as Gligar harder, but its useful coverage is rather limited. Finally, Work Up can be used to let Exploud act as a setup wallbreaker (and has a chance to 2HKO Blissey with Boomburst, which is guaranteed if Focus Blast hits twice), but Exploud prefers to hit hard right off the bat.

Checks & Counters
########

**Blissey**: Blissey is the closest thing to a counter for Exploud, as it is never 2HKOed by Focus Blast after Stealth Rock, which is unreliable in the first place, and can heal off any damage with Wish + Protect.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Empoleon and Bronzong can take a Boomburst, but must be wary of Exploud's coverage moves.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Infernape, Lucario, and Toxicroak can OHKO Exploud with their STAB moves, but can't switch in.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon such as Darmanitan, Entei, Roserade, Hydreigon, and Krookodile outspeed Exploud and can KO it with their STAB moves.
