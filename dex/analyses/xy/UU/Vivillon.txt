Overview
########

At first glance, Vivillon seems to be a bit of a pushover, just like almost every other generation's generic Bug-type Pokemon. However, Vivillon breaks this trend with its access to an accurate Sleep Powder and Hurricane outside of rain courtesy of its Compound Eyes ability, as well as an incredible boosting move in Quiver Dance, securing it a spot in UU as a deadly sweeper and wallbreaker. Unfortunately, Vivillon is hampered by relatively severe downfalls. Its base stats are nothing to write home about, and as such, it heavily relies upon Quiver Dance to fulfill its role. Despite Vivillon's immunity to Sticky Web and Spikes, it loses half of its health upon switching into Stealth Rock, limiting its longevity. Its defensive typing doesn't do it any favors either, with weaknesses to common Fire-, Flying-, and Rock-type attacks. Vivillon is also extremely susceptible to status afflictions; paralysis essentially makes it useless, while poison and burn break its Focus Sash and wear it down. In addition to this, Vivillon can be played around due to only having one viable set to use and being extremely one-dimensional in that regard. Overall, while Vivillon is certainly a threat to be prepared for, it is not by any means unstoppable.

Moves
========

Vivillon's signature set primarily relies on its first three moves: Sleep Powder, Quiver Dance, and Hurricane. Sleep Powder nearly guarantees a free Quiver Dance on any non-Grass-type or Overcoat user, and with 97% accuracy, it doesn't rely much on chance. Quiver Dance is essential, boosting Vivillon's Special Attack and Speed stats to more threatening levels and paving the way for a potential sweep. Hurricane is Vivillon's strongest STAB move; with its 91% accuracy and decent coverage, it is a very spammable move that can deal heavy damage even when resisted. Bug Buzz is a great secondary STAB move, hitting most Pokemon that resist Flying for neutral damage; it also has a chance to lower Special Defense and bypasses Substitutes. Substitute can used over Bug Buzz to ease prediction and block status, as mono-Flying-type coverage is great offensive coverage on its own.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread maximizes Vivillon's Special Attack and Speed stats, as it needs all the power and Speed it can get to begin and continue sweeping. A Timid nature is crucial to outspeed Choice Scarf Nidoking. The four leftover EVs are tossed into Special Defense, as Quiver Dance boosts it anyway and Vivillon is already horrendously frail on the physical side. The items both have their benefits; Life Orb allows Vivillon to effectively break through special walls, something it cannot do with any other item, while Focus Sash ensures that Vivillon will be able to either put the opposing Pokemon to sleep or set up. Alternatively, a Lum Berry can be used to give Vivillon a layer of protection against debilitating status afflictions.

Usage Tips
========

Vivillon surprisingly forces a large amount of switches, especially if the opponent's Pokemon is a wall or a win condition, so capitalize on this properly, and Vivillon can find itself with more than one Quiver Dance boost under its belt. Vivillon's one-dimensional nature can also be used to its advantage; double-switch into a favorable match-up, set up a Quiver Dance, or go straight for a Hurricane as the opponent brings in their Grass-type to absorb the predicted Sleep Powder. Using Quiver Dance on the switch is often the best play, as Vivillon can usually outspeed most Grass-types lacking a Choice Scarf and hit even harder at +1 Special Attack. However, do be cautious of Overcoat users, as they can switch into Sleep Powder with no repercussion. The common Choice Scarf Victini and Darmanitan will also outspeed Vivillon even after a Quiver Dance, so be wary if the opponent has either of these two Pokemon in their team. Taunt also cripples Vivillon by preventing it from using Sleep Powder or Quiver Dance, so keep it away from common users of this move such as Aerodactyl. Vivillon can also be used on hyper offensive teams; send it in after your team's suicide lead has been KOed to prevent setup or removal of entry hazards by the opponent.

Team Options
========

A Defogger or spinner is nearly essential, as Vivillon hates losing half of its health from Stealth Rock upon switching in; Empoleon, Blastoise, and Starmie fit this role relatively well, taking Fire-type attacks relatively well and Starmie can even act as a status absorber with Natural Cure. Defensive Defog Flygon is an excellent partner, walling pretty much any physical Fire-type while clearing entry hazards. Vivillon also pairs well with setup sweepers such as Toxicroak and Azelf, which can easily dispatch the Grass-types that it attracts. Volt Switch or U-turn users also benefit Vivillon, allowing it to enter the battlefield unscathed. Trappers such as Dugtrio can also work well with Vivillon, eliminating the various Electric- and Steel-types that bother it. Pokemon that appreciate special walls gone are also great teammates, as Vivillon functions well as a wallbreaker with the combination of Sleep Powder and Quiver Dance.

Other Options
########

Roost can be used on a mono-attacking set with Leftovers for a more sustained assault. A dual screens set can be used to some effect, but Vivillon performs much better as a wallbreaker and Meowstic-M can set up dual screens more reliably with Prankster. Aromatherapy can also be placed in the last slot to act as a cleric, but Vivillon needs to make full use of every turn in order to set up and wallbreak. Powder is a very intriguing move that allows Vivillon to counter Pokemon locked into a Fire-type move, such as the previously mentioned Choice Scarf Victini and Darmanitan. Powder cancels out the opponent's Fire-type moves and deals 25% of their max HP as damage, effectively forcing a switch.

Checks & Counters
########

**Status**: Most status effects cripple Vivillon; paralysis essentially removes all the Speed boosts gained from Quiver Dance, while poison and burn slowly whittle down Vivillon's HP. Prankster Thunder Wave or Stun Spore is especially dangerous coming from Meowstic-M and Whimsicott, respectively.

**Phazers**: Most phazers such as Milotic or Empoleon have the bulk to take a boosted Hurricane and can then proceed to nullify Vivillon's boosts with Roar, Whirlwind, or Dragon Tail.

**Taunt**: Taunt blocks Sleep Powder and Quiver Dance, which are both mandatory for Vivillon to actually be of use. Prominent users include Aerodactyl, Sableye, and Whimicott.

**Faster Pokemon**: Most faster Pokemon can OHKO Vivillon due to its paper-thin defenses unless its Focus Sash is used. Choice Scarf Darmanitan and Victini in particular are extremely threatening, outspeeding Vivillon even at +1 and taking it out with a STAB Fire-type move.

**Overcoat users**: Overcoat users generally check Vivillon well, as they don't have to worry about an incoming Sleep Powder. Forretress and Assualt Vest Escavalier serve as roadblocks to Vivillon, gaining momentum with Volt Switch and using it for setup fodder, respectively.

**Mega Aerodactyl**: Mega Aerodactyl resists both of Vivillon's STAB moves while also being able to outspeed and Taunt Vivillon before it can use Sleep Powder. Both of Mega Aerodactyl's STAB moves also hit Vivillon for super effective damage.
