Overview
########

With access to the most powerful boosting move in Shell Smash, Cloyster finds a strong place in the UU metagame. Cloyster's ability, Skill Link, effectively gives it a 125 Base Power Ice-type attack in Icicle Spear, which hits very hard and breaks Focus Sash. Cloyster also has Rock Blast, which complements its main attack Icicle Spear by providing very good coverage alongside it. Cloyster also has an incredible base 180 Defense stat, allowing it to set up on many physical attackers lacking a super effective move. Cloyster's Water typing is very potent offensively and defensively, with a decent amount of resistances. However, its secondary Ice typing gives Cloyster a multitude of weaknesses that can be taken advantage of. Cloyster also has a horrendously low Special Defense stat of 45, which is problematic when considering the various powerful special attackers in the tier. Also, Cloyster is fairly weak and slow before a Shell Smash boost. It is generally walled by Water- and Steel-types, which are very common in the tier. Lastly, Cloyster is weak to Stealth Rock and is susceptible all other forms of entry hazards, so it requires a significant amount of team support.

Moves
========

Shell Smash boosts Cloyster's Attack, Special Attack, and Speed to extremely high levels, often allowing it to sweep or heavily dent the opponents team. Icicle Spear is Cloyster's main STAB move that has 125 Base Power thanks to Skill Link, and it hits very hard after the Shell Smash boost. Rock Blast provides good coverage, hitting Ice- and Fire-types, and will hit five times thanks to Skill Link. Hydro Pump is a good Water-type STAB move that hits Steel-types which resist Cloysters other moves, and also deals more damage to physically defensive Pokemon. Ice Shard can be used for a form of priority, but it leaves Cloyster completely walled by Steel-types. Cloyster is a good lure to Water-types, so Explosion can be used to OHKO or severely damage most of them after a Shell Smash. Cloyster can opt for Surf instead of Hydro Pump, but Cloyster wants to get as much damage off as it can as it is a mid- or late-game sweeper.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment is used for Cloyster to hit as hard as possible, and maximum Speed investment is used to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible after a Shell Smash. A Naive nature is preferred when using Hydro Pump, but a Naughty or Adamant nature can be used for more physical power. However, without a Speed-boosting nature Cloyster is outsped by common Choice Scarf users, such as Hydreigon and Mienshao. Skill Link allows Icicle Spear and Rock Blast to hit five times. Focus Sash is used to almost guarantee that Cloyster can set up a Shell Smash, especially against offensively based teams. A King's Rock can potentially give Cloyster a free turn to attack thanks to the decent flinch chance coupled with Skill Link, but it is generally unreliable. Life Orb is an option for wallbreaking, as Cloyster's Life Orb-boosted attacks can massively dent or OHKO bulky Water-types such as Swampert after a boost with some prior damage.

Usage Tips
========

Don't set up on special attackers if Cloyster does not have a Focus Sash, as it cannot take even the weakest of special attacks. Additionally, while Cloyster has a great Defense stat, it should not set up on physical attackers with a super effective attack. Cloyster is best used mid- or late-game, especially after its checks and counters have been weakened. It is important to wear down bulky Water- and Steel-types before attempting a sweep, unless Cloyster is carrying Explosion. When using Explosion, it is best to surprise the opponent with it early- or mid-game in order to severely weaken or KO a teammate's check or counter.

Team Options
========

Celebi and Shaymin are great teammates because they can wear down bulky Water-types that trouble Cloyster, and are able to absorb status with Natural Cure. Entry hazard control is extremely important for Cloyster, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and is vulnerable to all other forms of entry hazards. Rapid Spin and Defog users such as Forretress, Crobat, and Empoleon are good Pokemon for this role. Pokemon like Darmanitan that don't appreciate bulky Water-types appreciate Life Orb Cloyster's support, as it can lure in and OHKO most of them after a Shell Smash.

Other Options
########

A Lum Berry can stop Pokemon like Sableye from halting Cloyster's sweep and enable Cloyster to set up on Pokemon that would try to status it like Swampert. White Herb can be used to restore Cloyster's defenses after a Shell Smash to make it much less vulnerable to priority attacks. Hidden Power Grass is a nice way to 2HKO Swampert and other bulky Water-types after Stealth Rock damage, but it has little use outside of that. Lastly, Razor Shell can be used as a reliable physical Water-type STAB move.

Checks and Counters
########

**Bulky Water-types**: Suicune, Alomomola, Vaporeon, and Quagsire are great examples of Pokemon that can wall Cloyster very well, but all of them bar Quagsire must watch out for Explosion variants of Cloyster.

**Bulky Steel-types**: Jirachi can take a +2 Hydro Pump from Cloyster and proceed to paralyze it. Mega Aggron can do the same, but not as easily.

**Priority**: Sucker Punch, Extreme Speed, and Mach Punch are all powerful forms of priority that can stop Cloyster in its tracks. However, Sucker Punch users have to watch out for Ice Shard, which may outprioritize them and cause Sucker Punch to fail.

**Empoleon**: Empoleon is the best answer to Cloyster, as it resists all of Cloyster's moves.
