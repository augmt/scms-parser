Overview
########

Cloyster has always been an amazing cleaner, especially with access to Shell Smash, one of the best boosting moves in the game. Cloyster has an amazing 180 Defense stat, though it has a mediocre HP stat and subpar defensive typing. Every other stat is either average or below average on Cloyster. Contrary to Cloyster's typing from a defensive point of view, Cloyster actually has quite the good offensive typing. Lastly, Cloyster has access to Skill Link, which is an ability that complements its movepool.

The Janitor
########
name: The Janitor
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Icicle Spear
move 3: Rock Blast / Explosion
move 4: Ice Shard / Hydro Pump
ability: Skill Link
item: Focus Sash / Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Naive

Moves
========

Shell Smash is mandatory on this set, as it allows Cloyster to sweep opposing teams late-game. Icicle Spear is its best STAB attack that hits 125 Base Power after all 5 hits and can also break Focus Sashes and Sturdy. Rock Blast is great coverage for Cloyster and can break through the aforementioned Focus Sashes and Sturdy due to Skill Link. Explosion is a nice option, as it allows Cloyster to remove some of its supposed checks and counters for other Pokemon to clean up the mess. Ice Shard gives Cloyster a form of priority to sweep past other priority users when they are at low health such as Honchkrow and Toxicroak, whereas Hydro Pump is a great STAB option that allows Cloyster to remove checks such as Mega Aggron and Bronzong after prior damage and a boost.

Set Details
========

252 Attack and Speed EVs allow Cloyster to have maximum sweeping potential. The remaining 4 EVs are put into either Special Attack or Special Defense stats depending on whether Hydro Pump is being used. A Jolly or Naive nature is used to maximize Speed, allowing Cloyster to outspeed every Choice Scarf user in the tier up to Infernape. A Focus Sash is used to allow Cloyster to live any one hit and guarantee that Cloyster can use a Shell Smash whereas a Life Orb allows extra damage output, which is crucial when using Explosion or Hydro Pump.


Usage Tips
========

Cloyster should be sent in to clean the remains of the enemy team, especially after all its counters and checks have either been removed or severely weakened. Try to clear out entry hazards from your side of the field so that Cloyster's Focus Sash remains intact or, if using a Life Orb, you can bluff a Focus Sash.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard setters and removers, Volt Switch and U-Turn users, and wallbreakers all work well with Cloyster. Forretress deserves a special mention for being able to fulfill the three former roles. Azelf, Aggron, and Froslass can also fulfill the entry hazard setter role. Heliolisk and Infernape make for good Volt Switch and U-Turn partners. Crobat and Tentacruel can remove entry hazards fairly well. Life Orb Hydreigon and Choice Band Darmanitan can break the walls that hinder Cloyster. Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Darmanitan that can utilize Cloyster's Explosion, which removes most of the bulky Water-types, most notably Suicune and Alomomola.


Other Options
########

A Choice Scarf set can be used to get surprise revenge kills on quick Pokemon such as Infernape and Crobat, although it lacks a lot of Speed and hits weakly without the boosts from Shell Smash. Razor Shell can be used on the last slot of the main set but is outclassed by Hydro Pump. Cloyster has access to Rapid Spin, which could be used in a lead set, but is generally a bad set due to Cloyster's inability to perform the role adequately. A specially offensive or specially biased Shell Smash set can be used but lacks the sweeping potential the physical and mixed sets have. White Herb, King's Rock, and Lum Berry are options for the item on the main set but are either generally outclassed, luck-reliant, or extremely situational in that order.


Checks & Counters
########

**Physically Bulky Water-types**: Water-types that have a decently high Defense stat such as Suicune, Alomomola, and Blastoise can take a +2 Rock Blast from Cloyster and retaliate with a potential burn from Scald.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types can take any hit Cloyster can throw at them at +2 and retaliate, although they might not take it well after being weakened.

**Fighting-type Priority Moves**: Fighting-type priority moves such as Vacuum Wave and Mach Punch can easily check Cloyster, as its only form of priority is Ice Shard which won't even 2HKO users of each move.

**Mixed Walls**: Mixed walls such as Cresselia and Porygon2 can take any one hit from Cloyster at +2 and retaliate.

**Empoleon**: Empoleon resists every move Cloyster can throw at it, although the specially defensive variant has a chance to be OHKOed by a Life Orb-boosted Explosion after a Shell Smash.
