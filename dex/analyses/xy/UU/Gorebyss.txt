Overview
#######

Gorebyss finds its niche as a user of Shell Smash + Baton Pass. With this combination, Gorebyss can effectively Baton Pass boosts to scary sweepers such as Hydreigon and Nidoking, which can become nearly unstoppable after a boost. Gorebyss also has the benefit of being decently powerful after it boosts, meaning it can actually fend for itself if need be. However, Gorebyss suffers from its low Speed, which leaves it vulnerable to almost every Choice Scarf user in the tier, even after a boost. It's also not very bulky, meaning it can have trouble taking a hit in order to Shell Smash.

SmashPass
#########
name: SmashPass
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Hydro Pump / Surf
move 4: Substitute / Ice Beam
ability: Swift Swim
item: White Herb
evs: 252 HP / 24 SpA / 232 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
======

Shell Smash and Baton Pass allow Gorebyss's teammates to sweep easily if the combination is pulled off correctly. Hydro Pump is used in the third slot for a STAB attack if Gorebyss needs to use it. Surf can also be used for its better accuracy, though it's significantly weaker. Substitute helps Gorebyss more easily pass Shell Smash boosts by avoiding things like status, while also having the chance of being able to potentially pass a Substitute to a recipient. Ice Beam is another option for its good coverage alongside Hydro Pump, hitting the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Water-type attacks.

Set Details
=========

The given EV spread with a Timid nature allows Gorebyss to outspeed Pokemon with base 130 Speed after a Shell Smash, while maximum HP investment is used to help improve overall bulk. The rest is put in Special Attack in case Gorebyss ever needs to attack. White Herb helps Gorebyss better take a hit before Baton Passing, while also making sure its teammates aren't receiving stat drops. Mental Herb, while not on the set, allows Gorebyss to negate Taunt and successfully pass boosts to its teammates. Swift Swim, while very situational, can help make Gorebyss even faster and more threatening against opposing rain teams.

Usage Tips
==========

Make sure that Gorebyss is in an ideal situation before Shell Smashing, as powerful attacks, Taunt, phazing moves, and status can all stop it from being able to pass. It is important to keep in mind that most Choice Scarf users will outspeed Gorebyss, even after a Shell Smash, meaning that Gorebyss will have trouble passing if the opponent is using a Choice Scarfer. Make sure you're using Gorebyss for Baton Pass and not for sweeping, as it's severely outclassed as a sweeper. That being said, Gorebyss can sweep late-game if absolutely necessary.

Team Options
============

The best partners for Gorebyss are easily powerful attackers with good coverage and decent bulk that lack a good boosting move, such as Hydregon, Nidoking, Kyurem, and Infernape. If these Pokemon are not sufficient for whatever reason, other good recipients include Metagross, Jirachi, Alakazam, Exploud, Krookodile, Arcanine, and Entei. Recipients such as Mega Houndoom, Victini, and Chandelure are helpful for absorbing incoming Grass-types attacks for Gorebyss, while the aforementioned Hydreigon, Nidoking, and Kyurem, in addition to Shaymin and Roserade, are helpful for taking on the Electric-types Gorebyss attracts. Roserade can also set up Spikes, which can assist in sweeps.

Other Options
============

Focus Sash is an option to guarantee Gorebyss can survive a hit, though White Herb is better for not passing Defensive and Special Defense drops. Hidden Power Grass can be used for bulky Water-types, though it misses out on valuable coverage against Dragon- and Grass-types if it is used over Ice Beam. Scald can be used instead of Hydro Pump, but it's weaker, and Gorebyss wants all the power it can get. An offensive Shell Smash set is possible, though it is outclassed by other Shell Smashers such as Cloyster and Omastar. Finally, a Baton Pass set utilizing Agility, Amnesia, or Barrier can be used, though it's almost always better off Baton Passing Shell Smash boosts.

Checks & Counters
##############

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Roserade, Shaymin, and Celebi can do massive damage to Gorebyss and prevent it from effectively passing boosts to a teammate. They do not enjoy taking a Ice Beam, however, especially at +2.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Raikou can KO Gorebyss with ease, preventing it from passing Shell Smash boosts.

**Taunt**: Taunt from the likes of Sableye prevents Gorebyss from using Shell Smash or Baton Pass. It's important to be careful of the rare Mental Herb, however.

**Phazing**: Phazing from the likes of Swampert or Mega Aggron can remove any stat boosts Gorebyss has accumulated.

**Powerful Attackers**: In general, powerful attackers such as Choice Specs Porygon-Z and Choice Band Victini have no trouble OHKOing Gorebyss.
