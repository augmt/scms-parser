Overview
########

Blissey finds itself as one of UU's premier defensive threats and support Pokemon due to its enormous base 255 HP, which, coupled with an amazing base 135 Special Defense, makes it just as good as impassable with special attacks. Blissey movepool is extremely extensive, allowing it to utilize Soft-Boiled for reliable recovery as well as Thunder Wave to cripple opponents and Wish to support the team. Blissey's amazing ability in Natural Cure also sets it apart from other special walls. Natural Cure enables Blissey to completely ignore any status by switching out, which is usually the bane for most walls. Blissey's typing also grants it an immunity and only one weakness.

However, Blissey's typing is a double-edged sword. While only one weakness seems nice, it also provides Blissey with absolutely no resistances. Additionally, while Blissey has enormous HP and Special Defense stats, its Defense stat is pathetically low, sitting at only 10. Blissey's low Attack stat and only mediocre base 75 Special Attack stop Blissey from doing any damage, forcing it to rely on Seismic Toss. Because of this, Blissey is extremely passive, and it can be easily played around with recovery or Substitute. To compound this further, Blissey is literal setup and Taunt bait for any Pokemon. At best, Blissey can use Seismic Toss or attempt to poison, which makes Blissey fare very poorly against opposing offensive teams and most Substitute users.

Moves
========

Toxic is an ideal move for most walls, and Blissey is no exception. Toxic cripples opposing Pokemon, and eventually stacks up enough damage to where they are in range of a KO from Seismic Toss, or are forced to switch out to reset Toxic's timer. However, if your team can just break through opponents just fine with entry hazard control or wallbreakers, Thunder Wave is an alternative if you wish to cripple faster Pokemon. Soft-Boiled is reliable recovery, allowing Blissey to stall and rack up Toxic damage. Wish, however, is an alternative if supporting the team is of concern, as Blissey's wishes are so big that a Pokemon, under normal circumstances, will regain all of its HP back. Heal Bell removes all status conditions for Blissey's team, which provides great support in pressuring opponents to use status moves. Protect pairs well with Wish, allowing for a guaranteed healing if Blissey wishes not to pass the Wish to its teammates. Protect also helps rack up Toxic damage, as well as scout the opponent out. Stealth Rock is certainly an option if Blissey chooses not to support the teams in terms of longevity, but in softening up the opponents so sweepers can go undisturbed. Seismic Toss is a mandatory move on the set, as it allows Blissey to deal damage without being completely susceptible to Taunt.

Set Details
========

Natural Cure is the best ability for Blissey, as it eliminates status without using Heal Bell by simply switching out. Leftovers is the preferred item, as it allows Blissey to gradually recover health, which adds on to its general longevity. Maximum HP allows Blissey to pass enormous wishes, while maximum Defense patches up Blissey's terrible Defense stat to an extent. A Bold nature further maximizes Blissey's Defense stat. A Specially Defensive spread at first seems appealing, but Blissey's special bulk is so high that investing in it is rather redundant.

Usage Tips
========

Blissey does a relatively good job spreading status between Toxic and Thunder Wave, then easily stalling out with Soft-Boiled and wearing down the opponent with Seismic Toss. However, most of the time, Blissey should prioritize valuable team support between Wish and Heal Bell, as Blissey will usually be able to do a good enough job tanking a hit and using a support move of choice. Blissey also does a good job in keeping special attackers and opposing walls in check, as it does not take much damage from their attacks bar Psyshock, which, with enough Defense investment, does not do much either.

Team Options
========

Physical walls can form amazing balanced cores with Blissey that tend to be very hard to break. Pokemon such as Mega Aggron and Alomomola fulfill this role quite well, and the latter can even form a dual-cleric core, making it extremely hard to wear the team down with status. Dual-cleric cores in general are very good with Blissey taking part in them; the aforementioned Alomomola and Florges can do this well, and Aromatisse is an especially good option, as its Taunt immunity due to Aroma Veil almost guarantees it to successfully use its support moves. Entry hazard removal is a must, as Blissey is easily worn down between Stealth Rock and Spikes; Crobat can do this as well as pivot into Fighting-type attacks, while Empoleon can do the same. Likewise, hazard support in its own right is great, as the opponent will commonly switch around attempting to deal with Blissey, which makes wearing them down significantly easier.

Other Options
########

Blissey doesn't have any other options that aren't simply outclassed by its main set or by other Pokemon. Blissey's wide special movepool allow it to utilize moves such as Ice Beam and Flamethrower to hit specific targets, in tandem with Serene Grace to take advantage of the side effects, but they are almost always going to be situational by themselves and are hard to fit into virtually any set. Counter can allow Blissey to score some surprising KOs, but once it is revealed, it becomes utterly useless, as it can be played around. A dual status set with Thunder Wave and Toxic is unique in annoying the opponent, but Blissey will want to fit multiple moves on one set and simply having one status move is enough. Calm Mind can be used to play with some of Blissey's damaging attacks, but it rarely will be effective due to Blissey's bad Special Attack.

Checks & Counters
########

**Taunt**: Taunt is Blissey's best counter. Taunt prevents Blissey from using any support move and will force it to use the weak Seismic Toss. Pokemon such as Crobat can use a quick Taunt against Blissey, while Sableye is immune to Seismic Toss and has priority Taunt.

**Physical Attackers**: Infernape, Mienshao, and Lucario not only have a type advantage over Blissey, but they can also easily break through Blissey with any given STAB moves. Pokemon who hits neutrally such as Entei also can do a good job denting Blissey, but they fear status as they cannot always OHKO.

**Setup Sweepers**: Blissey is fodder to almost any Pokemon that can set up against it. At best, Blissey can attempt to use Seismic Toss or Toxic to score some damage. However, Blissey carrying Thunder Wave will generally cripple the Pokemon.

**Substitute**: Blissey is extremely passive when it comes to doing damage, and Substitute forces Blissey to use Seismic Toss to break the Substitute; however, by then, the opponent will usually have done whatever it intended to do behind the Substitute.

**Espeon**: Espeon's ability, Magic Bounce, bounces back any status moves Blissey attempts to use against Espeon, as well as Stealth Rock.
