Overview
########

Blissey's astronomical HP and Special Defense make her the premier special wall of UU. In addition, Blissey has access to a plethora of support moves, such as Wish and Heal Bell, allowing her to aid her team by providing cleric support and tanking all special hits. Her Normal typing gives her only one weakness, and Natural Cure allows her to absorb status effects. In combination, these two traits make Blissey difficult to wear down. Access to Seismic Toss and Toxic are all Blissey needs to not be setup bait. However, even with those options of dealing damage, Blissey is still pretty passive. She also struggles against Pokemon that rely on Substitute, as Seismic Toss does not break a Substitute of a Pokemon with 404 HP or more, and status moves, such as Toxic, do not hit through Substitute. As Seismic Toss is Blissey's only direct attacking option, she is very vulnerable to Taunt and will often find herself doing little for the team if affected by it. Though the Normal-type has only one weakness, it's a very common one in UU, with physical Fighting-type attackers such as Mienshao and Infernape running rampant in the tier. Blissey also suffers a bit from four-moveslot syndrome, as she really wishes she had access to all her support moves. Even so, Blissey is still one of the best walls in the UU tier and finds a home on many defensively minded teams.

Moves
========

Wish recovers Blissey's HP and can be used to heal her teammates as well. Thunder Wave allows Blissey to cripple opposing sweepers with paralysis, making it more difficult for them to sweep. Protect allows Blissey to stall out the foe with Toxic and heal herself safely with Wish. Soft-Boiled gives Blissey reliable recovery, prolonging her presence on the field. Seismic Toss gives Blissey some offensive presence and will break Substitutes if the foe's maximum HP stat is less than 404. Heal Bell lets Blissey act as a cleric, while Toxic can be used to put a timer on opposing sweepers and defensive Pokemon. Alternatively, Stealth Rock can be used to punish opposing switch-ins, allowing Blissey's teammates to sweep more easily. There are several combinations of Blissey's viable moves outside of the slashes seen here. However, every Blissey needs a recovery move and Seismic Toss in order to stay alive longer and not be completely shut down by Taunt, respectively.

Set Details
========

Full investment in HP and Defense and a Bold nature maximize Blissey's physical bulk and allow her to pass the largest Wishes possible to her teammates. Natural Cure allows Blissey to cure herself of status simply by switching out, and Leftovers provides Blissey with passive recovery.

Usage Tips
========

Blissey's main jobs are tanking special attacks and spreading status. Switch out if the opponent sends in a physical attacker; Blissey can take a few physical hits if need be, but she shouldn't be if she doesn't have to. Pokemon holding Lum Berry and Substitute users are major problems for this set, as they can get past Blissey's Toxic and get free turns. Seismic Toss may provide Blissey with some offensive potential, but she remains serious Taunt bait. Be cautious when trying to pass Wishes to teammates with low health, as the opponent can recognize this and KO the intended recipient. Moreover, as Roar and Whirlwind hit through Protect, Blissey can easily be phazed out when attempting to heal herself with Wish.

Team Options
========

A dedicated physical wall can deal with the physical attackers that give Blissey trouble. Nidoqueen, for example, makes a good partner, especially since she covers Blissey's Fighting-type weakness. Chesnaught and Arcanine make passable partners as well. Entry hazard removal is necessary, as Taunt users and physical attackers easily force Blissey out, and you will be switching Pokemon around a lot in order to keep passing Wishes, provided Blissey is running Wish. Donphan and Forretress are great Rapid Spinners that double as physical tanks. As Blissey will force a lot of switches herself, an entry hazard setter makes a good partner. Empoleon can both set and remove entry hazards, making it a prime choice. A Taunt user will help against Pokemon with Substitute and phazing moves. Tornadus and his Prankster Taunt make him a good option. You also need teammates that Blissey can support; you can pair her with nearly any setup sweeper in order to keep said sweeper healthy. Good setup Pokemon that she can support include Haxorus, Absol, and Lucario.

Other Options
########

Counter can net a surprise KO against physical attackers, but Blissey won't always survive an attack from one, nor does she typically have room for the move. Calm Mind is a decent win condition, but Blissey is better used in a supporting role. Blissey can also use Healing Wish to bring a teammate back to full health, but Blissey already supports her team well enough with Heal Bell and Wish.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Machamp, Lucario, Infernape, and Mienshao all hit Blissey for super effective damage with their Fighting-type STAB moves, thus forcing her out.

**Taunt Users**: If Blissey is hit by Taunt, she will be unable to do much, and the foe can subsequently use her as setup bait. Crobat, Azelf, and Tornadus are a few Pokemon that can Taunt Blissey.

**Substitute Users**: Blissey cannot spread status to Pokemon behind a Substitute, so they can use it to gain a free turn to set up or attack. Furthermore, if the foe has a maximum HP stat of 404 or higher, Seismic Toss will fail to break its Substitute in one hit. Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune and Chandelure easily set up Substitute against Blissey, with Suicune having 404 HP to avoid having its Substitute broken in one shot and Chandelure being immune to the Fighting-type Seismic Toss.

**Pokemon with Lum Berry**: Similar to Substitute, Lum Berry provides Pokemon with protection from Blissey's attempts to inflict status on them. Haxorus, for example, enjoys having Lum Berry to protect itself from a single Toxic or Thunder Wave.

**Physical Attackers**: Though Blissey can take a few physical hits with her high HP and some Defense investment, she should only be switching into special attacks.
