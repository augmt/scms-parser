Overview
########

Cofagrigus is the only fully evolved Pokemon to have Mummy, which allows Cofagrigus to render the abilities of Pokemon that rely on contact moves useless, making it serve as a good switch-in to Guts Heracross and Mega Aerodactyl, among others. Cofagrigus's amazing Defense stat allows it to take a lot of physical hits and serve as a decent tank. It also has good Special Defense and Special Attack stats, while its low Speed stat makes it a good Pokemon under Trick Room, which it can reliably set itself. Furthermore, it has a diverse support movepool ranging from Toxic Spikes to Will-O-Wisp. Lastly, Cofagrigus also has access to two good boosting moves in Calm Mind and Nasty Plot.

Despite its numerous positives, Cofagrigus is far from perfect, as its defensive typing only grants it two resistances and two immunities. Cofagrigus is also very reliant on Trick Room to be utilized effectively. Additionally, Cofagrigus lacks a reliable recovery move, making it fairly easy to wear down coupled with its mediocre HP stat.

Moves
========

Trick Room allows slower Pokemon to move first, making it an excellent move in conjunction with Cofagrigus's low Speed. Shadow Ball is a consistent STAB move that also has a chance to lower the foe's Special Defense. Nasty Plot boosts Cofagrigus's Special Attack by two stages, making it a good sweeper under Trick Room. Hidden Power Fighting allows Cofagrigus to hit Dark-, and Normal-types for super effective damage. Will-O-Wisp is also an option, as it allows Cofagrigus to cripple physical attackers.

Set Details
========

Leftovers are the chosen item because it gives Cofagrigus a form of passive recovery. The given EVs allow Cofagrigus to have as much offensive power as possible while retaining some bulk. A Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs are chosen to ensure Cofagrigus is as quick as possible under Trick Room.

Usage Tips
========

Cofagrigus should attempt to set Trick Room up as early as possible should it be attempting to support its teammates. However, should Cofagrigus be attempting to sweep, it should set up a Nasty Plot before using Trick Room, as that allows Cofagrigus to have four turns under Trick Room with a boost. Don't be afraid to sack Cofagrigus early on for the sake of letting your Trick Room sweepers have extra turns under Trick Room. However, should Cofagrigus be needed later on to set Trick Room, don't hesitate to preserve it.

Team Options
========

Trick Room sweepers, such as Choice Band Escavalier and Swords Dance Rhyperior, make for good teammates, as they take advantage of Trick Room. Cofagrigus thrives on Trick Room, making additional Trick Room setters, such as Reuniclus and Cresselia, good partners. Cofagrigus has issues getting past Dark-types, therefore, Pokemon that can deal with Dark-types, such as Aromatisse and Pangoro, make for good teammates. Cofagrigus can sweep more easily with entry hazard support, making entry hazard setters such as Forretress and Bronzong good teammates.

Other Options
########

Cofagrigus has a high Defense stat, making a defensive set with Will-O-Wisp and Haze an option, although its mediocre defensive typing means Cofagrigus can't utilize this effectively. Cofagrigus can use a Choice Specs set with Trick to cripple walls but is generally better off just using a Trick Room set. Cofagrigus can also utilize a Trick Room set made to specifically support its teammates with Memento and Toxic Spikes, but this set tends to be very passive on Trick Room teams which generally rely on offensive momentum. Cofagrigus also has access to Calm Mind, but it is unable to utilize it well, as it lacks a form of reliable recovery.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dark-types**: Dark-types such as Mega Absol and Hydreigon hit Cofagrigus for super effective damage with their STAB attacks and only have to worry about Hidden Power Fighting, which doesn't OHKO the majority of them, and Will-O-Wisp, which can cripple the physical attackers but doesn't really bother the special attackers.

**Calm Mind Sweepers**: Calm Mind sweepers, namely Calm Mind Suicune and Calm Mind Florges, can easily set up on Cofagrigus with little consequence, as Cofagrigus can't do much back to them.

**Knock Off**: Knock Off is super effective against Cofagrigus and also cripples it badly, as losing Leftovers makes Cofagrigus much easier to take down.

**Wallbreakers**: Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Darmanitan and Choice Specs Kyurem can easily KO Cofagrigus with their powerful attacks, whereas Cofagrigus is unable to KO them in return.

**Taunt Users**: Taunt users can easily shut Cofagrigus down, as Cofagrigus depends on support moves to be utilized effectively; Mega Aerodactyl, Crobat and Azelf are just a few examples of Taunt users.

**Status**: Cofagrigus is crippled by all forms of status, except paralysis, as they can either wear Cofagrigus down or just render it unable to do anything for a few turns.
