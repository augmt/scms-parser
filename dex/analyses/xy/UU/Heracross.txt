Overview
########

Heracross has outstanding power due to its high base Attack, great offensive typing, and access to high-powered STAB moves and coverage options. Its two abilities, Guts and Moxie, both let it perform unique roles in the metagame. Moreover, Heracross has usable bulk with a set of resistances that allows it to check certain Pokemon such as Krookodile. Heracross's base Speed allows it to outspeed all relevant walls but leaves it prone to being revenge killed by the plethora of faster offensive Pokemon, especially because it has no usable priority. Additionally, its typing makes makes it difficult to deal with the bulky Fairy- and Flying-types of the UnderUsed tier.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Close Combat
move 2: Megahorn
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Stone Edge / Earthquake
ability: Guts
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Close Combat and Megahorn are Heracross's two best STAB moves, each with a Base Power of 120. Knock Off hits Flying- and Poison-types neutrally and Ghost-types super effectively, and it also cripples some switch-ins that Heracross cannot immediately handle. Stone Edge hits Flying-types super effectively, although most outspeed Heracross, so it must hit them on the switch. Earthquake hits Poison-types super effectively and certain other Pokemon such as defensive Arcanine more reliably than Stone Edge does. Pursuit can be used to trap Ghost- and Psychic-types and get useful chip damage on Pokemon that frequently switch out of Heracross. Sleep Talk can be used to absorb sleep-inducing moves from Pokemon such as Roserade, and Heracross can proceed to fire off Guts-boosted attacks against unsuspecting foes.

Set Details
========

Choice Band takes advantage of Heracross's enormous power and greatly limits its switch-ins to a select few physically defensive Pokemon. Guts takes advantage of status inflicted by moves such as Toxic and Scald to add even more to Heracross's power. Heracross's Attack and Speed are maximized to allow it to hit as hard and as fast as possible. An Adamant nature makes Heracross noticeably more powerful, giving Heracross a chance to 2HKO standard Florges after Stealth Rock damage. A Jolly nature can be used instead to outspeed certain offensive Pokemon, such as Timid Chandelure and Adamant Lucario. A bulkier spread of 112 HP / 252 Atk / 144 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used to better complement Heracross's natural bulk while still outspeeding Adamant Honchkrow.

Usage Tips
========

Heracross can easily be switched into common users of Scald and Toxic, such as Suicune and Blissey, respectively, to absorb status and get a huge power boost with Guts. Use Knock Off to remove Leftovers and Eviolite from Pokemon such as Florges and Gligar early in the game so that Heracross can break through them more easily later in the battle. Predict switches into Flying- and Poison-types early on and use the appropriate coverage move to allow Heracross to spam its STAB moves easily once they have been removed.

Team Options
========

Heracross needs teammates that check Fairy- and Flying-types. As with all offensive Pokemon, entry hazards are essential in order for Heracross to net certain KOs and pressure the opposing team. Mega Aggron and Forretress can switch into many of Heracross's checks and set up Stealth Rock, making them great partners on more balanced teams. Heracross should also be used with faster teammates that appreciate its ability to soften up physical walls. Examples of these are Choice Scarf Infernape and Mega Aerodactyl, both of which can clean up opposing teams once Heracross has broken through bulkier foes.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Close Combat
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Megahorn / Facade
ability: Guts
item: Leftovers / Toxic Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance boosts Heracross's Attack to sky-high levels and allows Heracross to dismantle slower teams. Close Combat is Heracross's most powerful and reliable STAB move, KOing many of the tier's Pokemon at +2. Knock Off provides neutral coverage on Poison- and Flying-types and super effective coverage on Ghost-types and also removes Eviolites and Leftovers from defensive targets. Facade can be used over Megahorn in conjunction with Toxic Orb to take advantage of Heracross's ability, Guts, and to hit Fairy- and Poison-types for massive damage.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment is placed into Attack and Speed to allow Heracross to hit as hard and as fast as possible. An Adamant nature gives Heracross significantly more power and allows it to KO defensive Aromatisse with no prior damage and defensive Granbull after Stealth Rock damage with a +2 Guts-boosted Facade. A Jolly nature can be used instead in order for Heracross to outspeed Pokemon such as Timid Chandelure and Adamant Lucario. Guts is the preferred ability for Heracross to take advantage of status moves such as Scald and Toxic, and Heracross is too slow to benefit from Moxie anyway.

Leftovers increases Heracross's longevity and allows it to set up more comfortably against certain defensive Pokemon, including Gligar and Vaporeon. Toxic Orb can be used to increase Heracross's immediate power and reliably boost Facade, but it heavily takes away from Heracross's longevity. Toxic Orb variants can opt to run a fourth attacking move over Swords Dance if the immediate power and coverage of both Megahorn and Facade is desired. An alternate EV spread of 112 HP / 252 Atk / 144 Spe can be used on the Leftovers variant to set up more easily in the face of passive Pokemon and potentially avoid being revenge killed by Pokemon such as Mienshao. The Speed EVs on this spread allow Heracross to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow.

Usage Tips
========

Use Heracross's ability to force out Pokemon such as Snorlax and Umbreon to set up easily against slower teams. However, it is fruitless to set up during battles against more offensive teams, as Heracross should simply go for attacks. Heracross's mediocre Speed usually prevents it from sweeping entire teams. Instead, Swords Dance Heracross should be used to break down walls to support its teammates. Use Volt Switch or U-turn support to bring in Heracross and activate its Toxic Orb safely, if running the item.

Team Options
========

Heracross should be paired with Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mienshao or Choice Scarf Infernape, which take advantage of Heracross luring in and breaking down physical walls. Teammates that check the Flying- and Fairy-types that often switch into Heracross are necessary, especially for the Leftovers variant. Heracross appreciates paralysis support from Pokemon such as Stun Spore Whimsicott, which lures the Flying-types that Heracross commonly struggles with.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Close Combat
move 2: Megahorn
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Stone Edge / Earthquake
ability: Moxie / Guts
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
Close Combat and Megahorn are Heracross's two most powerful STAB moves. Knock Off provides coverage on Flying-, Poison-, and Ghost-types and also cripples Pokemon that rely on items such as Leftovers and Eviolite. Stone Edge hits Flying- and Fire-types, such as Crobat and Arcanine, respectively, for super effective damage. Earthquake can be used over Stone Edge for super effective coverage on many Poison-types, such as Nidoqueen, and to serve as a more reliable way to hit Fire-type Pokemon.

Set Details
========

252 EVs are placed into Speed with a Jolly nature and a Choice Scarf to allow Heracross to outspeed the entire unboosted tier. 252 EVs in Attack allow Heracross to hit as hard as possible. Moxie is used as Heracross's ability to allow it to accumulate boosts after revenge kills and potentially snowball into a late-game sweeper. Guts can be used instead to allow Heracross to safely switch into moves such as Scald and Toxic and to avoid being completely crippled by burns.

Usage Tips
========

Use Choice Scarf Heracross as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner after the appropriate walls have been weakened or eliminated. Use Knock Off to remove items from defensive walls such as Florges and Hippowdon early in the game. If Moxie is the chosen ability, avoid letting Heracross get inflicted by status, as it removes the possibility of sweeping. Alternatively, Heracross with Guts should primarily act as a revenge killer and status absorber instead of a sweeper. Use Close Combat sparingly, especially against Pokemon with Pressure, as its limited PP should be conserved until late-game.

Team Options
========

Heracross needs teammates to break down opposing physical walls, especially Fairy-types. Nidoqueen can check many of Heracross's switch-ins and heavily pressure physical walls. Heracross also needs teammates that can handle opposing Choice Scarf users, most of which are faster than Heracross. Spikes support from Pokemon such as Roserade makes it much more difficult for defensive Pokemon to consistently switch into Heracross, especially after their items have been removed with Knock Off.

Other Options
########

Heracross can use Bulk Up to complement its respectable natural bulk, though Swords Dance is generally the preferred boosting option. Substitute is an option to deter revenge killing and ease prediction, but Heracross must be wary of Infiltrator Crobat. Heracross can run an Endure + Salac Berry set with Reversal and Moxie to act as a late-game sweeper after priority users and faster Choice Scarf Pokemon have been removed. Finally, a RestTalk set with Life Orb can be used to take advantage of Guts and keep Heracross healthy.

Checks & Counters
########

**Flying-types**: Crobat can switch into any move other than Stone Edge or a Guts-boosted Facade and easily KO Heracross. Physically defensive Salamence can switch into Choiced variants of Heracross and can even survive a +2 Guts-boosted Facade after Intimidate. Physically defensive Gligar can switch into Choiced variants of Heracross, though it doesn't appreciate having its Eviolite removed by Knock Off and is beaten by Swords Dance variants. Other Flying-types such as Mega Aerodactyl and Fletchinder can revenge kill Heracross as well, but they have more trouble switching in.

**Fairy-types**: Physically defensive Aromatisse and Granbull can switch into Choiced variants of Heracross and KO it with their STAB moves.

**Poison-types**: Most Poison-types resist both of Heracross's STAB moves. Nidoqueen, in particular, can stomach most of Heracross's moves and retaliate with a powerful Sludge Wave, though it is hit hard by Earthquake.

**Faster Offensive Pokemon**: Pokemon such as Entei, Alakazam, and Mega Beedrill can outspeed Heracross and KO it with their STAB moves.
