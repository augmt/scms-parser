Overview
########

With a base 109 Speed stat, Heliolisk outspeeds a lot of common Pokemon such as Infernape, Galvantula, and Cobalion. It also has a great movepool, boasting moves such as Surf, Grass Knot, Focus Blast, Thunderbolt, Hyper Voice, Volt Switch, and Dark Pulse. Heliolisk also has Dry Skin, which provides it an immunity to Water-type moves and therefore allows it to threaten a multitude of Water-type Pokemon in UU. It also has a nice immunity to Ghost-type moves, meaning it can switch into Choice-locked Chandelure and nab a free Volt Switch.

While Heliolisk has two immunities and a colorful movepool, it is weak to common attacking types in UU such as Ground and Fighting. This is also exacerbated by the fact that it has pitiful 62 / 52 physical bulk, meaning even resisted physical hits are going to take a chunk of Heliolisk's HP. It must also use Life Orb, which can wear it down even more quickly if it wants to take advantage of its coverage moves.

Moves
========

Volt Switch is a STAB move that provides easy momentum for Heliolisk's team. Hyper Voice is a decent STAB move as well, hitting all Ground-types as well as striking targets through Substitute. Grass Knot is for bulky Ground-types, such as Hippowdon and Swampert, that may attempt to switch into Heliolisk's STAB moves. Thunderbolt is a reliable STAB move and secures the 2HKO on Suicune. Surf can be used instead of Grass Knot, as it hits Nidoqueen and Nidoking along with Rotom-H for super effective damage. Focus Blast may also be used to hit certain Dark- and Steel-types, such as Hydreigon and Mega Aggron, a lot harder. Focus Blast also nails many special walls, such as Umbreon, Snorlax, and Blissey, harder than any other move Heliolisk has.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs allow Heliolisk to outspeed many threats and to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Life Orb boosts the power of all of Heliolisk's attacks while giving it the freedom to switch between its moves, but Choice Specs can be used instead for more initial power at the cost of not being able to switch between moves. A Timid nature allows Heliolisk to outspeed base 108 Pokemon, such as Infernape, Galvantula, Virizion, and Cobalion. Dry Skin is used to allow Heliolisk to switch in on Water-types and threaten them with a Life Orb-boosted STAB Thunderbolt.

Usage Tips
========

This set enjoys being brought in after a teammate has fainted or with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn rather than hard switching in, as Heliolisk cannot take many hits.

Team Options
========

Fire-types particularly enjoy Heliolisk's ability to absorb Water-type moves and threaten Water-types back with its STAB Electric-type attacks. Entei is a particularly good partner, as it serves as a very good wallbreaker once bulky Water-types are worn down or gone. Flying-types make good partners as well, as they can take care of all of Heliolisk's weaknesses; they resist Fighting-type attacks and take no damage from Ground-type attacks. Crobat is a particularly good partner, as it can form a VoltTurn core with Heliolisk, providing easy momentum for the team. Other U-turn users such as Mega Beedrill and Mienshao can also be good partners and form an effective VoltTurn core with Heliolisk. Rain support from the likes of Whimsicott or Tornadus can prove very helpful, as Dry Skin's recovery under the rain essentially negates the recoil of Life Orb. Thunder can be an option for Heliolisk to use over Thunderbolt, as it gains 100% accuracy under the rain and hits a lot harder.

Other Options
########

Glare is a great option, allowing Heliolisk to cripple Pokemon that may try to switch into it, such as Ground-types. However, Heliolisk has amazing coverage and would much rather take advantage of that to try and cripple the enemy. Choice Scarf allows Heliolisk to outspeed a lot of common Choice Scarf users, such as Mienshao and Infernape, as well as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl. Substitute can be a nice move for Heliolisk, allowing it to avoid status, and it can gain HP fairly easily thanks to Dry Skin. Leftovers can be used over Life Orb. Without Life Orb, however, Heliolisk loses a lot of power and cannot 2HKO Suicune. Signal Beam is another option, hitting Grass-types harder for super effective damage. However, like Chesnaught and Roserade, most Grass-types in UU are neutral to Bug thanks to their secondary typing.

Checks & Counters
########

**Special Walls**: Special walls such as Florges and Blissey can tank any move Heliolisk has to offer and proceed to Wish stall Heliolisk or use Toxic to poison it.

**Calm Mind Users**: Calm Mind users, such as Reuniclus, can Recover off any damage they have taken from Life Orb Heliolisk, which Reuniclus can take advantage of by setting up Calm Mind.

**Physical Attackers**: With Heliolisk having such frail Defense, any hard hitting physical attacker such as Entei or Mienshao can OHKO it.

**Priority**: Most forms of priority, bar Aqua Jet, are going to hit Heliolisk hard due to its pitiful bulk. Furthermore, Heliolisk is weak to Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, two common priority moves in UU.
