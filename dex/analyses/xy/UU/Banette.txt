Overview
########

Be on the look out for this sinister foe, as the Marionette Pokemon is back with a new bag of tricks! Banette is a Pokemon that isn't easy to use. Banette's stats, aside from its attack, are lackluster. It has very little offensive capability, and is not a threat to many Pokemon. However, Banette got a Mega Evolution in XY to help it against its new competition. Mega Banette's new ability, Prankster, allows it to take advantage of all kinds of non-damaging moves. Banette also receives a huge buff to its Attack and a slight buff to its defenses in its Mega Evolved form. Mega Banette can now lead and can cause opponents trouble with Prankster Destiny Bond. However, Mega Banette still suffers from low Speed and subpar defenses. It also has a small movepool and a lack of reliable recovery. Banette is severely outclassed by Sableye, which not only has a wider movepool but actually has access to reliable recovery, while Mega Banette suffers from having four-moveslot syndrome; usually not being able to use all the moves it wants to use and having to use move sets that are based on the moves it generally runs.Another issue with Banette is that Prankster doesn't come into effect on the turn that it Mega Evolves; Mega Banette must wait a turn for its much desired ability in order to function properly. However, Banette can still manage to scare up the competition with its newfound strength and ability.

Prankster
########
name: Prankster
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Will-O-Wisp / Thunder Wave
move 3: Shadow Claw / Shadow Sneak / Knock Off
move 4: Destiny Bond
ability: Frisk
item: Banettite
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Taunt allows Mega Banette to stop entry hazard setters dead in their tracks, while also shutting down any offensive leads that attempt to set up. Prankster Will-O-Wisp is used to get a quick burn on opponents, crippling physical attackers. Alternatively, slowing down opponents with Thunder Wave can help Mega Banette outspeed them and hit them with its own attacks. STAB Shadow Claw deals good damage coming off of its massive base 165 Attack, but Shadow Sneak can be used for priority and picking off weakened opponents. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to remove opponent's items. Destiny Bond works incredibly well with Prankster; if all else fails, this is your kill switch. Frisk allows you to scout for items such as Focus Sash, Assault Vest, and Leftovers that Knock Off can remove.

Set Details
========

252 EVs are invested in HP since Mega Banette needs to be able to take a hit to make up for its low Speed and frail defenses, while 252 Attack EVs allow it to hit relatively hard. Running Frisk on Banette allows you to scout out the opponent's items to get a sense of what they're planning: finding items such as Berries, Choice items, and Focus Sashes will give you an idea of how the opponent will use that Pokemon. Banettite is the best item for Banette; not only does Banette get a 100-point boost to its base stat total, but it also gains the much needed Prankster, which is the only reason that Mega Banette is viable in the first place. Lastly, Mega Banette will want to run an Adamant nature to ensure that it can take full advantage of its newfound Attack without sacrificing Speed or bulk. An alternate spread of 148 HP / 252 Atk / 108 Spe can be used in order to allow Banette to outspeed Pokemon like Suicune and effectively spinblock against Blastoise, granted that the opponent doesn't predict the switch in. However, this spread reduces Banette's overall bulk, so it should be used to remove Blastoise if hazard blocking is necessary for your team's success.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Banette doesn't gain Prankster on its first turn, so try to Mega Evolve it as soon as possible. Mega Banette works well mid-game, when it can whittle down the opponent's team with Will-O-Wisp. Use Taunt on the opponent to prevent them from setting up when they predict you to use Destiny Bond or Will-O-Wisp. Prankster Destiny Bond allows you to instantly shut down a sweep only once, so use this wisely. However, most of the time Destiny Bond is obvious, so it's always important to figure out when to use it, since it's sometimes difficult to determine whether or not a opponent may attack, use a status move, or set up. Avoid wasting Destiny Bond on weakened Pokemon; conserve it to get rid of stronger foes. Using status moves and switching out can be great for allowing bulkier teammates to set up on burned or Taunted Pokemon, so burning or paralyzing an opponent and then making a switch can really put pressure on an opponent while giving you the edge.

Team Options
========

Due to its limited movepool, Mega Banette can't provide its teammates with too much help, so it relies more on its team members instead. Mega Banette is vulnerable to Dark-types, so having bulkier teammates like Cobalion or hard-hitting teammates like Lucario to take a Knock Off is appreciated; not only can it benefit them if they have the Justified ability, but it can also get Mega Banette out of difficult situations. Other good teammates that can take hits are Florges and Umbreon, as they both resist Dark-type moves. Florges has great Special Defense, while Umbreon can take both physical and special attacks nicely. Florges and Umbreon can also provide support for Banette with Wish and Heal Bell / Aromatherapy in case you want Mega Banette to last longer and wreak more havoc.

Other Options
########

Mega Banette can also run a number of alternative options. Mega Banette can run Trick Room to support slower team members. Not only does Mega Banette gain a speed advantage from this, having both speed and priority, but this can also be beneficial because it can stop faster sweepers in their tracks. Mega Banette can also use Confuse Ray to possibly gain some free turns. Curse can be used to force the opponent to switch out, which is great for racking up residual damage and swinging the momentum in your favor. Torment and Disable are also troublesome for the opponent, as restricting their options is always useful. Other status moves such as Toxic can be annoying as well. Protect is a very good move for ensuring that Banette can safely Mega Evolve and is also valuable for scouting out an opponent's moveset. Moves like Sucker Punch and Pain Split can also surprise opponents as well. Sucker Punch can be used as a Dark-type priority move, while Pain Split in conjunction with Substitute can slowly diminish the HP of bulky opponents. Gunk Shot allows Mega Banette to take out pesky Fairy-types such as Florges and Aromatisse. Phantom Force is another alternative choice to use, as it is a very strong STAB move. Vanishing on the first turn may also prove useful, sparing Mega Banette a turn of damage.

Checks & Counters
########

**Faster Prankster Users**: Quicker Prankster users such as Whimsicott and Meowstic can cause Mega Banette problems by outspeeding it.

**Dark-types**: Mega Houndoom, Mega Absol, and Hydreigon are bad news for Mega Banette, as they are faster and stronger than it. Mega Houndoom and Mega Absol can counter Mega Banette completely with their Speed, abilities, and power. These Pokemon also have access to Dark Pulse, Knock Off, and Sucker Punch, which are red flags for Mega Banette.

**Bulky Fire-types**: Fast Fire-types such as Arcanine and Entei can check Mega Banette since it can't use Will-O-Wisp on them. While not the most ideal option, Rotom-H can also check Mega Banette, since its Electric / Fire typing allows it to absorb its two most common status moves.
