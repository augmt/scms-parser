Overview
########

Escavalier is a great Pokemon to use in the UU tier. In XY, Escavalier gained new toys to play with, most notably the new Assault Vest item, which boosts a Pokemon's Special Defense stat by 1.5 at the cost of only being able to only use attacking moves. This item increases Escavalier's longevity, allowing it to take more hits. In addition, its ability, Overcoat, was buffed to make Escavalier now immune to powder moves, allowing it to act as a Sleep Powder / Spore absorber. It also has a great typing in Bug / Steel, which gives it many resistances and one immunity. It has a massive Attack stat, which is backed by its access to Megahorn, Knock Off, Pursuit, and many other useful moves, which makes Escavalier a force to be reckoned with. However, Escavalier is not without its flaws. It is 4x weak to Fire, easily crippled by burns, and extremely slow. Nonetheless, Escavalier should not be underestimated, and it can be a great asset to your team.


Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Megahorn
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Drill Run / Pursuit
ability: Overcoat
item: Assault Vest
evs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe
nature: Adamant


Moves
========

Escavalier makes an ideal user of Assault Vest. It has a whopping base 135 Attack stat, and its defensive typing leaves it susceptible to only one type. Megahorn is the Bug-type STAB move of choice, as it deals massive damage to anything that does not resist it. Iron Head has great neutral coverage alongside Megahorn and serves as the secondary STAB attack. Knock Off allows Escavalier to remove items such as Leftovers or Eviolite, and hits Ghost-type Pokemon such as Chandelure that might try to switch into its STAB moves. The last move is a bit of a toss-up. Drill Run provides excellent coverage for hitting the Fire-type Pokemon that would otherwise take pitiful damage from Escavalier's attacks. However, Pursuit allows it to trap opponents and is a great option nonetheless, as Fire-types like Victini are hit hard by Knock Off on the switch as it is, and others like Houndoom are dented by Megahorn on the switch as well.


Set Details
========

The given EVs allow Escavalier to hit as hard as possible while also allowing Escavalier to outspeed the likes of Slowking, Calm Mind Reuniclus, and Snorlax, and an Adamant nature maximizes Escavalier's damage output. An Assault Vest makes Escavalier a very good tank, boosting its Special Defense at the cost of only being able to use damaging moves. The ability Overcoat should be used, as it has been buffed to allow Escavalier to switch in on Pokemon that have access to powder-based moves, such as Sleep Powder Roserade, and force them out with its powerful attacks.


Usage Tips
========

Do not stay in against Fire-type Pokemon; they will literally roast Escavalier. Also, try not to let Escavalier get burned, as it will halve its Attack and cripple it throughout the match. Remember, Escavalier is worn down easily because it has no reliable recovery, so keep that in mind when continuously switching into attacks.


Team Options
========

Escavalier appreciates Wish support, as it has no options for recovery. Good partners include Florges or Umbreon because they both have access to Wish, as well as Aromatherapy and Heal Bell, respectively. Florges especially has great type synergy with Escavalier. Rapid Spin or Defog support is also appreciated, as Escavalier gets worn down easily. Ironically, Fire-types are ideal partners. Since Escavalier naturally lures in Fire-type attacks, Pokemon such as Houndoom and Chandelure can switch in and get a Flash Fire boost. Water-types are also good partners, especially Blastoise or Tentacruel, which can provide Rapid Spin support, which is vital to preserve Escavalier's longevity, as mentioned previously. Paralysis or Trick Room support can also help with Escavalier's Speed issue. Status absorbers are also helpful, as Escavalier is crippled by burns.


Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Iron Head
move 2: Megahorn
move 3: Drill Run / Pursuit
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Overcoat
item: Choice Band
evs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe
nature: Adamant


Moves
========

It's not hard to see why one would equip a Choice Band on a Pokemon like Escavalier. Its Attack stat is boosted to extreme levels, and with a high Base Power move in Megahorn, Escavalier will rip many teams apart. Megahorn deals massive damage to anything that does not resist it. Iron Head is a decent secondary STAB move with good coverage alongside Megahorn. Drill Run allows Escavalier to hit the Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon that can otherwise switch into it. Alternatively, Pursuit can also used to trap many opposing Pokemon. Knock Off removes items and is helpful when facing stall-based teams.


Set Details
========

Maximizing Attack allows Escavalier to hit as hard as possible with a Choice Band. The given HP EVs allow Escavalier to tank more hits and switch more times into Stealth Rock, and the 84 Speed EVs allow Escavalier to outspeed Pokemon such as Snorlax. The ability Overcoat should be used because it makes Escavalier immune to powder-based moves.


Usage Tips
========

Do not stay in against incoming Fire-type moves, and also try not to stay in against Scald, which runs the risk of inflicting a burn. Take advantage of opposing Grass-, Fairy-, or Bug-type Pokemon that cannot harm Escavalier, and start punching holes through teams. Also do your best to predict well, as Escavalier will be locked into a move because of Choice Band.


Team Options
========

Rapid Spin or Defog support is greatly appreciated, as they help with Escavalier's longevity. Blastoise makes a solid partner, as it resists Fire-type attacks and can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards. Fire-type resistant Pokemon make excellent partners, as they can take the Fire-type moves aimed at Escavalier. Chandelure and Houndoom make excellent offensive partners, as they can absorb Fire-type attacks and get a Flash Fire boost from them in the process. Cleric support is appreciated to allow Escavalier to stay healthy throughout the match. Paralysis support is helpful because Escavalier is too slow to sweep. Trick Room is another option that may be useful as it lets slower Pokemon move first, but is gimmicky. Status absorbers such as Guts Machamp make great partners.


Other Options
########

A defensive set can be used; however, Forretress would be a better choice if you need a defensive Bug / Steel type. A RestTalk set can also be used, but Escavalier is better off taking full advantage of its Attack stat.


Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Many Fire-type Pokemon such as Houndoom, Chandelure, or Darmanitan can stop Escavalier right in its tracks and can easily OHKO it with their respective STAB moves. Arcanine and Entei stand out especially because of their unusual, yet excellent, physical bulk. Rotom-H resists both of Escavalier's STAB attacks and is immune to Drill Run courtesy of its Levitate ability.

**Steel-types**: Steel-type Pokemon can easily switch into Escavalier's STAB attacks. Mega Aggron is a good example of one that can take any hit from Escavalier, and because of its Filter ability, Drill Run won't do as much as it normally would. Since Aggron can Mega Evolve, its item is prevented from being Knocked Off.

**Burn Status**: Burn cuts Escavalier's Attack by half, and then it is crippled until it is cured.

**Physical Walls**: Physical walls such as Hippowdon and Mega Blastoise can take almost all of Escavalier's moves bar Choice Banded Megahorn for pitiful damage and the former can set up Stealth Rock while the latter can direct strong attacks at Escavalier. Forretress in particular can take on all of Escavalier's attacks, set up hazards, and Volt Switch to a better counter while maintaining momentum.
