Overview
########

Emboar has gained a great ability in Reckless, which increases its wallbreaking capabilities by boosting the power of its recoil attacks. These wallbreaking capabilities are supported by Emboar's very good base 123 Attack stat, which makes it an excellent choice for offensively based teams. Furthermore, Emboar has quite a wide movepool with a variety of coverage options to benefit from. Emboar also has a solid HP stat that helps it switch in against foes and take their attacks better, but most importantly, it lets Emboar take recoil from its attacking moves better. An immunity to Will-O-Wisp is excellent for a physical attacker like Emboar, as it means Emboar cannot be hampered by burn. Emboar also has a good offensive typing as well as a decent defensive typing, with several useful resistances but also a lot of weaknesses. Additionally, Emboar's high HP stat is let down by its mediocre Defense and Special Defense stats, and it is also easily worn down by the recoil damage induced by Flare Blitz, Wild Charge, and Head Smash. Emboar also has a low Speed stat, which leaves it outsped by a lot of common threats in the current metagame. Lastly, Emboar faces competition from Darmanitan as a wallbreaker because of the latter's access to U-turn and Sheer Force, but Emboar's niche lies in Reckless, its typing, and priority in Sucker Punch.

evs: 252 Atk / 36 SpA / 220 Spe
nature: Naughty / Adamant

Moves
========

Flare Blitz is a STAB attack which becomes extremely powerful after boosts from STAB, Life Orb, and Reckless. Superpower is a secondary STAB attack with great power and coverage but lowers Emboar's Attack and Defense stats after each use. Grass Knot gets the primary slash in the third slot, as it lets Emboar KO Mega Swampert and Hippowdon which would normally wall it. Wild Charge is an option in the third slot that allows Emboar to hit Water-types such as Suicune harder and is boosted by Reckless. Head Smash is also an option in the third slot for superior power and coverage over Wild Charge, but it is less accurate and inflicts more recoil. Its main targets are Arcanine and Chandelure. Sucker Punch is used for hitting Psychic-types that threaten Emboar, as well as picking off weakened Pokemon.

Set Details
========

Reckless boosts the power of Flare Blitz and other recoil-inducing attacks Emboar uses by 20%. Life Orb gives an additional boost to all of Emboar's moves, turning it into a dangerous physical wallbreaker. The given spread lets Emboar outspeed up to uninvested base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Suicune, Gligar, defensive Roserade, and defensive Rotom-H. The Attack EVs ensure Emboar hits as hard as possible. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack for a higher chance to OHKO Swampert after Stealth Rock. Either a Naughty or Adamant nature should be used, depending on whether Grass Knot is used or not. If so, a Naughty nature should be used; if not, use Adamant. If Grass Knot is not used, the 32 Special Attack EVs should be shifted into HP with the remaining 4 going into Special Defense to prevent Download Porygon-Z from getting a Special Attack boost.

Usage Tips
========

Emboar can switch into a handful of physical walls, such as Porygon2, in order to attack them and pressure them by dealing a lot of damage. Superpower should be used sparingly, as after each use, Emboar's Attack and Defense stats are lowered, and thus its damage output will be lessened. Emboar's safest option is Flare Blitz if you're not sure of your opponent's play, as it hits switch-ins hard, even those that resist it. Switch Emboar out of faster Pokemon with a type advantage, such as Crobat and Alakazam, as they can inflict a ton of damage on Emboar with a super effective move. Emboar can switch in on certain Pokemon it has a type advantage against, such as Umbreon and Forretress, force them out, and then hit whatever switches in hard.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Forretress and Froslass is appreciated, as it eases wallbreaking for Emboar. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Forretress and Mega Blastoise is good for Emboar, as entry hazards wear down Emboar quickly. Setup sweepers such as Haxorus and Lucario appreciate Emboar's wallbreaking capabilities and thus make for good partners. Wish support Umbreon and Florges is also very useful because of Emboar's limited longevity due to recoil from its attacks. Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Chesnaught, and Shaymin are nice choices because they can switch into Ground-type attacks from faster Pokemon. Pokemon such as Rotom-H and Mega Aerodactyl can take care of faster Flying-types and therefore make excellent teammates as well. Slow momentum gainers, such as Gligar, Rotom-H, and Forretress, grant Emboar a safe switch in against its foe.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Flare Blitz
move 2: Superpower
move 3: Wild Charge
move 4: Head Smash / Earthquake
ability: Reckless
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Flare Blitz is a very powerful STAB attack boosted by Reckless and hits almost any Pokemon hard on the switch in, including those that resist it. Superpower is a powerful secondary STAB attack and has good neutral coverage with Flare Blitz, but it does lower Attack and Defense after use. Wild Charge hits the Water-types resistant to Flare Blitz and is boosted by Reckless as well. Head Smash hits opposing Fire-types, such as Chandelure, has excellent overall coverage, and gets a 20% boost from Reckless. Earthquake is another attacking option for decent power and coverage and forms almost perfect neutral coverage with Wild Charge. Sleep Talk can be considered in order to absorb sleep-inducing moves such as Roserade's Sleep Powder.

Set Details
========

Reckless gives a boost to recoil-inducing attacks. Choice Scarf turns Emboar into a dangerous revenge killer and allows it outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame. The EV spread lets Emboar hit as hard as possible, and the investment in Speed makes Emboar a lot faster, letting it outspeed even more Pokemon. A Jolly nature is recommended, as without it, Emboar will fail to outspeed Alakazam and Mega Pidgeot.

Usage Tips
========

Emboar is a fine late-game cleaner once physical walls have been beaten, so try to beat them first before sending Emboar in. This set also makes Emboar a decent revenge killer, so sending it in after a teammate has fainted is a decent choice too. Use Superpower sparingly, as it lowers Emboar's Attack and Defense after use. Definitely watch out for moves that remove items because if Emboar gets hit by one, it will be easily revenge killed by foes because of its low Speed stat.

Team Options
========

Wallbreakers such as Dragalge are generally good partners for their ability to beat physical walls, which this set fails to do. Wish support from Pokemon such as Florges, Umbreon, and Alomomola is good for letting Emboar stay healthy after recoil damage. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Forretress and Roserade is appreciated in order to KO foes with more ease. Mega Blastoise, Donphan, and Forretress can remove hazards for Emboar and are excellent choices in order to help it avoid this passive damage. Pokemon such as Suicune and Hippowdon, which can handle faster Pokemon such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl, make for good partners, as do Mega Pokemon such as Mega Aggron and Mega Sceptile, which do not mind taking a Knock Off. A cleric that can remove paralysis, such as Umbreon, is very good for Emboar, because paralysis leaves it outsped by a lot of Pokemon.

Other Options
########

A defensive set with Will-O-Wisp, Low Kick, Flare Blitz, and Roar can be used, but Emboar is a bit frail and can be easily KOed. The combination of Substitute + Focus Punch can be used, but Emboar is too slow to set up a Substitute and Superpower is generally better. A fully special set is an option to use to surprise opponents, but Emboar lacks the moves to fully take advantage of this and it puts Reckless to waste.

Checks & Counters
########

**Passive Damage**: The recoil induced by moves such as Flare Blitz, Wild Charge, and Head Smash will eventually bring Emboar to its end. Life Orb Emboar takes even more recoil damage. Pokemon with a Rocky Helmet will also contribute to wearing Emboar down, as most of its damaging moves make contact.

**Faster Pokemon with Super Effective Coverage Moves**: Pokemon such as Mega Pidgeot, Krookodile, and Mienshao can outspeed Emboar and beat it with their super effective attacks. They should watch out for Choice Scarf Emboar, however.

**Very Bulky Physical Walls**: Very bulky physical walls such as Alomomola and Hippowdon can usually take Emboar's physical attacks, but they should be wary of Grass Knot.
