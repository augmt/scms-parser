Overview
########

This unique little Fire-type has more going for it in the UU metagame than its exceptional design: Rotom-H has a unique typing which gives it great STAB coverage and a whopping 8 resistances and one immunity, along with only two weaknesses. This typing allows it to easily check some of the most prominent threats in the metagame, such as Victini, Roserade, and Escavalier. However, typing is not the only thing that Rotom-H has to going for it; it also has great stats across the board, with a strong Special Attack stat of 105 along with a large amount of bulk with 50 / 107 / 107 defensive stats. Furthermore, Rotom-H is also somewhat versatile and also has good support movepool containing moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, Trick, and Pain Split.

However, not all is good for our floating oven; although its typing is exceptional, it comes at the cost of having a nasty Stealth Rock weakness. Rotom-H also relies on Overheat for its main damage output, forcing it to switch more often, further exacerbating its Stealth Rock weakness. Additionally, Rotom-H has a subpar Speed stat, and lacks reliable recovery outside of Pain Split, which is generally inconsistent. However, Rotom-H still boasts more positive aspects than negative, and still functions very well in the UU metagame.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Overheat
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Will-O-Wisp / Thunder Wave
move 4: Pain Split
ability: Levitate
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 216 Def / 44 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

This set utilizes Rotom-H's defensive typing, bulk, and its ability to spread status. Overheat is Rotom-H's main STAB move, and is good for softening up an opposing Pokemon, however, it has the downside of lowering Special Attack, and therefore cannot be spammed. Volt Switch is a very important move in Rotom-H's arsenal: it allows Rotom-H to pivot to its teammates, and has great coverage with Overheat. Will-O-Wisp is used to cripple physical attackers, but Thunder Wave can also be used to cripple setup sweepers such as Volcarona. Pain Split gives Rotom-H recovery while also damaging the opponent, and is especially helpful early-game if Rotom-H is at low health.

Set Details
========

This set maximizes Defense to allow Rotom-H to check physical attackers such as Darmanitan and Victini, while still being able to switch into Florges. 248 HP EVs let Rotom-H take minimum damage from Stealth Rock, while 44 Speed EVs are used to allow it to outspeed Victini after the Speed drop from V-create. However, giving Rotom-H 136 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow and burn it before it can attack. A specially defensive set can also be used if it is more helpfuul to your team.

Usage Tips
========

Thanks to Rotom-H's bulk and excellent defensive typing, this set can threaten many Pokemon and force them out. Because of this, getting up Stealth Rock early-game can be beneficial. Pain Split should generally should not be spammed in a situation when the opposing Pokemon is faster than Rotom-H, because it will lose in the end. Status can be spread freely even if the opponent has a Synchronise user, since Rotom-H is immune to both Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Rotom-H is a good switch-in to Florges, as it can take a Moonblast and pivot to something else which can deal with it.

Team Options
========

It is almost mandatory to have some kind of entry hazard removal in your team if it includes Rotom-H. Flygon, Empoleon, and Mega Blastoise are good options, with the former resisting Rock and having U-turn, and the latter two resisting Water. Rotom-H's ability to force switches often makes Stealth Rock very beneficial. Nidoqueen and Jirachi are good options to use, as they both have great synergy with Rotom-H, the former relying on Rotom-H to take Water- and Grass-type attacks while the latter relying on it to take Ground- and Fire-type attacks, and both taking Rock-type attacks for Rotom-H. Setup sweepers such as Toxicroak enjoy its pivoting ability and its ability to cripple potential revenge killers. Pokemon with U-turn can be beneficial by forming a VoltTurn core with Rotom-H. Celebi is a good option, as it can deal with Rhyperior, Swampert, Gastrodon, and Lanturn.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Overheat
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Trick / Thunderbolt
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Rotom-H's great STAB coverage and decent Speed makes it the perfect candidate for a Choice Scarfed revenge killer. Overheat is used as its main revenge killing tool due to its high Base Power. Volt Switch gains offensive momentum and can also be used for revenge killing in combination with Overheat. Hidden Power Grass nails Swampert, Gastrodon, and Rhyperior, which would otherwise wall Rotom-H completely. However, Hidden Power Ice can instead be used to hit Flygon, Hydreigon, and Mega Ampharos. Trick allows Rotom-H to cripple walls such as Blissey and slower attackers such as Snorlax. Thunderbolt can also used in this slot to revenge kill more effectively without switching out.

Set Details
========

Using maximum Speed EVs with a Modest nature allows it to outspeed Jolly Mega Aerodactyl and everything below. A Timid nature can also be used to outspeed Choice Scarf Porygon-Z and Chandelure.

Usage Tips
========

This set functions as a great lead with its great Speed in combination with Volt Switch, allowing it to quickly grab momentum early-game. Rotom-H should be wary of being locked into Overheat, as Pokemon such as Kyurem and Houndoom can take advantage of it. Rotom-H also shouldn't Trick away its Choice Scarf early-game, as it severely hinders Rotom-H's ability to revenge kill. Furthermore, if it is tricked onto the wrong Pokemon; one that can take advantage of it, it can be detrimental. Rotom-H should find opportunities to switch in agaist most Ground-, Electric-, Grass-, Steel-, and Flying-types in general, or be switched in through U-turn or Volt Switch.

Team Options
========

Much like the first set, entry hazard removal is mandatory. Flygon and Crobat are great options, as in addition to having access to Defog, they also have access to U-turn, forming a VoltTurn core. Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Aerodactyl that attract burns and paralysis can also give Rotom-H switch in opportunities. Finally, Hydreigon and Jirachi, to name a couple, appreciate some of the Pokemon that Rotom-H take out gone, such as Escavalier, Honchkrow, and Kyurem.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Overheat
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Trick / Thunderbolt
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Specs
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

This set takes a more offensive approach compared to the last two; focusing on Rotom-H's Special Attack and offensive coverage by using Choice Specs. Overheat is its main tool for denting opponents, and does an extremely high amount of damage when coupled with Choice Specs. Volt Switch allows Rotom-H to pivot, while dealing great damage. The next slot is for coverage: Hidden Power Grass is for Rhyperior, Swampert, and Quagsire, and Hidden Power Ice is for Flygon, Hydreigon, and Mega Ampharos. Will-O-Wisp can also be used in the third slot, allowing you to cripple physical attackers after you Trick away your Choice Specs. Trick also allows it to cripple walls, especially specially orientated ones, such as Florges and Porygon2, along with setup sweepers such as Toxicroak. Thunderbolt can also be used as an Electric-type STAB attack that doesn't force Rotom-H to switch out, but it leaves Rotom-H vulnerable to special walls.

Set Details
========

Using Choice Specs on Rotom-H allows it to hit like an absolute truck and hits more frail Pokemon that resist Fire hard. Using a Timid nature allows it to outspeed non-Choice Porygon-Z, Nidoking, and Toxicroak. However, a Modest nature provides more firepower, allowing Rotom-H to get OHKOs and 2HKOs more easily. Also, a more bulky spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD with a Modest nature can be used, but it fails to deal with Pokemon such as Nidoking and Honchkrow as easily compared to the given EVs.

Usage Tips
========

Rotom-H should be brought out on a Pokemon it counters, such as Nidoking, or through U-turn or Volt Switch. Once Rotom-H is in a threatening position, it can grab momentum with Volt Switch and deal a lot of damage in doing so. However, try not to bring Rotom-H in at all when Stealth Rock is on the field, as the damage racks up very quickly because Rotom-H will be switching a lot. Be wary of using Volt Switch too often, as the opponent can take advantage of it by switching into a Ground-type, or into a Pokemon that would normally be countered by Rotom-H.

Team Options
========

The teammates for this set are very similar to the others; make sure to have some form of entry hazard removal, a Stealth Rock setter, and optionally a U-turn user to form a VoltTurn core. A bulky Grass-type can help this particular set to get rid of Rhyperior and Swampert, allowing it to repeatedly use its STAB moves more safely. Celebi fits this role nicely, while also having U-turn to complete the VoltTurn core. Other teammates for this set are Pokemon that appreciate Rotom-H's wallbreaking ability, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Darmanitan.

Other Options
########

Rotom-H, being somewhat versatile, has a few more tricks up its sleeve. It has access to dual screens, which can be used as its own set in conjunction with Volt Switch to allow setup sweepers to get their job done easier. Rotom-H can also support its team with Sunny Day in combination with a Heat Rock or Trick in conjunction with the a Flame Orb. The former powers up Rotom-H's Overheat, while the latter stops opposing Pokemon from healing burns though Heal Bell or Aromatherapy. For the defensive set, the ChestoRest strategy can be used to give it more reliable recovery, or the SubSplit strategy to wear down opponents easier. As far as offensive options go, an Assault Vest can be utilized to make Rotom-H more bulky without investment, or even an Expert Belt to bluff a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs.

Checks & Counters
########

**Special Walls**: Special walls such as Florges, Aromatisse, Blissey, and specially defensive Hippowdon can switch into most of Rotom-H's attacks and proceed to Toxic-stall it. However, the former three are crippled by Trick while the latter is crippled by Will-O-Wisp.

**Fast Offensive Pokemon**: Speedy offensive Pokemon such as Aerodactyl and Starmie can outspeed and OHKO Rotom-H. However, it should be noted that these Pokemon can't directly switch into Rotom-H.

**Dragon-types**: Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Flygon, Mega Ampharos, and Noivern can switch into most of Rotom-H's attacks bar Hidden Power Ice and threaten it with their respective STAB moves.

**Special Defense Boosters**: Pokemon that commonly run Quiver Dance or Calm Mind can switch in and start accumulating boosts.

**Ground-types that resist Overheat**: Ground-types that resist Overheat such as Gastrodon, Swampert, Rhyperior, and Quagsire can switch into all of Rotom-H's attacks except for Hidden Power Grass and proceed to pummel it with super effective STAB moves.

**Lanturn**: Lanturn can freely switch into any of Rotom-H's attacks thanks to its ability and proceed to cripple it with Toxic or strike back with a super effective Scald.
