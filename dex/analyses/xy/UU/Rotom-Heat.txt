Overview
########

Rotom-H has a great typing, garnering eight resistances, an immunity, and only two weaknesses. Not only that, but Rotom-H's STAB Fire- and Electric-type coverage is nearly unresisted in the UU metagame and also provides Rotom-H with immunities to burn and paralysis. It also has decent stats with 107 / 107 defenses and a nice base 105 Special Attack stat. Levitate is a great ability, as it makes Rotom-H the only Fire-type in UU that is not weak to Ground-type moves. Rotom-H has great support moves in Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, Pain Split, and Trick while also being able to go on the offensive with powerful STAB moves in Thunderbolt, Volt Switch, and Overheat and a Hidden Power of its choice.

Although Rotom-H has great 107 / 107 defenses, it is held back by its horrible base 50 HP stat, which backfires in many situations. Another drawback is that Rotom-H has a weakness to Stealth Rock, meaning it can only switch in four times at max unless the team has a way to clear entry hazards. Not only that, but its main Fire-type STAB move, Overheat, cripples Rotom-H by lowering its Special Attack by two stages, forcing Rotom-H to switch out more often than it wants to. Additionally, Rotom-H has no reliable recovery outside of Pain Split, so it can be worn down easily without team support.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Overheat
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Will-O-Wisp / Thunder Wave
move 4: Pain Split
ability: Levitate
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 124 Def / 136 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Overheat is a great nuke, nailing the Grass- and Steel-types that are weak to it and Ground-types which are immune to Volt Switch. Volt Switch is used as the obligatory momentum move, allowing Rotom-H to not be setup bait, although it doesn't hit as hard as the offensive sets. Will-O-Wisp is a great status move, crippling physical attackers that Rotom-H tends to switch into. Thunder Wave is another option, stopping cold a lot of faster offensive Pokemon that you may struggle with. Pain Split is Rotom-H's only recovery move and while it isn't the best, it allows Rotom-H to outstall the Pokemon that may try to wear it down or spam a neutral STAB move.

Set Details
========

This set utilizes Rotom-H's useful resistances, bulk, and ability to check a plethora of Pokemon in the UU metagame. 136 Speed EVs are important to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow and burn it before it can attack. 248 HP EVs are used to maximize bulk and allow Rotom-H to switch into Stealth Rock four times. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Defense, allowing Rotom-H to check common physical attackers such as Entei, Darmanitan, and Crobat. A Bold nature is preferred to further bolster Rotom-H's Defense stat.

Usage Tips
========

This set is aimed at taking advantage of Rotom-H's great typing and bulk to either burn physical attackers or paralyze faster Pokemon. It also forces out a lot of Pokemon, which pairs up greatly with Rotom-H's access to Volt Switch. If the foe has a lot of HP, Pain Split can wear it down while subsequently healing Rotom-H up to allow it to continue to do its job. This set also checks a lot of physical attackers in UU such as Entei, Darmanitan, Mega Beedrill, and Infernape, thanks to its typing, bulk, and access to great status moves in Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Rotom-H can also grab easy momentum off of Fire-types that try to switch in and absorb Will-O-Wisp, thanks to Volt Switch.

Team Options
========

This set appreciates special walls to complement Rotom-H's physical EV investment.bulk Blissey and Florges are great partners, as they can provide Wish support for Rotom-H. Defog Empoleon is an exceptionally good special wall to pair with Rotom-H, as Empoleon can take the Rock- and Water-type moves aimed at Rotom-H while Rotom-H can take on the Electric- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Empoleon. Empoleon can also get rid of Stealth Rock, which allows Rotom-H to switch in more often and stay around for the majority of the game. This set can also be a great supporter to a lot of setup sweepers in UU such as Swords Dance Heracross, Swords Dance Haxorus, and Calm Mind Florges, all of which appreciate Rotom-H's ability to cripple faster Pokemon and physical attackers.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Overheat
move 3: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice / Thunderbolt
move 4: Trick
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Specs
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Volt Switch allows Rotom-H to hit hard and grab easy momentum for the team. Overheat is an amazing nuke, allowing Rotom-H to hit Ground-types which are immune to its other STAB move, while roasting Grass- and Steel-types. The next slot is up to preference; Hidden Power Grass hits Swampert, Quagsire, and Gastrodon, all of which resist Overheat and are immune to Volt Switch. Hidden Power Ice can be used instead to hit Dragon-types that resist Rotom-H's STAB moves, such as Hydreigon. If the aformentioned Pokemon are not a threat to your team, Thunderbolt can be used over Hidden Power to help break down bulky Water-types better. Trick allows Rotom-H to cripple special walls, such as Blissey or Florges, which tend to switch in and tank Rotom-H's attacks.

Set Details
========

Choice Specs, along with maximum Special Attack EVs and Speed EVs, allow Rotom-H to hit as hard and as fast as it can. Timid is preferred to outspeed base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Heracross, Toxicroak, and Nidoking. However, Modest can be used for more firepower to nab some OHKOs and 2HKOs more easily. This set acts as a wallbreaker that can gain some easy momentum through Volt Switch or Trick. A bulkier spread of 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe can be used to outpace Honchkrow while also being able to tank weaker hits such as Florges's Moonblast more easily.

Usage Tips
========

Rotom-H can break walls a lot easier with this set than its other sets while still gaining momentum via Volt Switch, allowing Rotom-H to hit hard and wear down the opponent's team at the same time. This set partners well with VoltTurn cores, as most of them can bring Rotom-H in safely and allow it to wreak havoc on the opponent's team. This set, however, isn't as fast as the Choice Scarf set, which means it may have to take a hit before attacking or rely on forced switches to stay alive. Avoid bringing Rotom-H in while Stealth Rock is up, as it wears Rotom-H down very quickly and the opponent can proceed to overpower it. Try to use Volt Switch early-game as once the opponent knows your set, they will try to bring a Ground-type into Volt Switch, sucking away all the momentum you may have gained.

Team Options
========

This set appreciates setup sweepers that can benefit from walls being crippled or broken down. Pokemon such as Swords Dance Heracross and Calm Mind Florges appreciate Rotom-H's ease in wearing down their checks and counters while also nuking Steel-types that tend to wall Pokemon like Florges. This set appreciates entry hazard support as well, as Rotom-H can easily force switches thanks to a great STAB combination. Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Forretress can easily set up Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes, and even Spikes in Forretress's case, allowing Rotom-H to take advantage of the entry hazards.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Overheat
move 3: Hidden Power Ice / Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Trick
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Rotom-H's great STAB coverage backed by a decent base 86 Speed stat allows it to be a great contender for a revenge killer. Volt Switch is an amazing STAB move that can grant the team some momentum while wearing down the opponent's team and forcing switches. Overheat is another STAB move, allowing Rotom-H to nuke Ground- and Grass-types that may try to switch into Volt Switch. Unfortunately, it isn't as spammable as Volt Switch due to it lowering Rotom-H's Special Attack by two stages. Hidden Power Ice is used for Dragon-types that resist Rotom-H's STABs. Will-O-Wisp can be used if you are worried about physical attackers or are not in need of the coverage Hidden Power Ice provides. Trick is mandatory, allowing Rotom-H to cripple walls that can switch into Rotom-H's moves and proceed to recover or wear it down.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed EVs and a Choice Scarf, thanks to Rotom-H's base 86 Speed, allow Rotom-H to outspeed Choice Scarf Heracross and Choice Scarf Chandelure if running a Timid nature. However, a Modest nature may be used to gain more firepower while still outspeeding Jolly Mega Aerodactyl and everything below.

Usage Tips
========

This set functions as a great momentum grabber early-game. With a fast Volt Switch, it can chip at the foe's health and whittle the opponent's team down, allowing your team to clean up later in the game. However, Rotom-H should be wary of being locked into Overheat, as many UU Pokemon, such as Flash Fire Chandelure and Mega Blastoise can take advantage of it and proceed to suck the momentum that Rotom-H may have gathered earlier in the game. Rotom-H should also save Trick until mid- to late-game, as Tricking Choice Scarf early-game severely hinders Rotom-H's ability to revenge kill; furthermore, if the Choice Scarf is Tricked onto the wrong Pokemon, it can be detrimental to Rotom-H and its team.

Team Options
========

This set appreciates entry hazard support as well as Rapid Spin or Defog support. Forretress is a great partner, as its only weakness is resisted by Rotom-H and it can provide Stealth Rock and Spikes support while spinning away Stealth Rock, which hinders Rotom-H's existence. This set appreciates wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Goodra, to break the walls it has worn down via Volt Switch and forced switches.

Other Options
########

ChestoRest is a more reliable way of allowing Rotom-H to recover health and get rid of status. However, it only works once and Rotom-H is already immune to paralysis and burn, so the only status that truly affects Rotom-H is Toxic. A SubSplit set is plausible; however, Rotom-H has better options and doesn't get as much use out of Substitute as the only status Substitute protects it from is Toxic. Toxic can itself be an option on the defensive set to whittle down the Fire-types that tend to switch in to absorb Will-O-Wisp. Trick + Flame Orb can catch some Pokemon off-guard as it can easily burn the opposing Pokemon and reliably keep the burn on them even if they have Heal Bell or Aromatherapy support. However, most Pokemon that Rotom-H checks are Fire-types, which are immune to burn. Also Guts users such as Heracross and Machamp would appreciate the Flame Orb boosting their Attack to stupidly high levels.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dragon-types**: Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Haxorus, and Mega Ampharos all resist Rotom-H's STABs. Hydreigon and Mega Ampharos can gather free momentum via U-turn or Volt Switch. Haxorus can easily break through, as it tends to carry Lum Berry and has Mold Breaker Earthquake to bypass Rotom-H's Levitate. Though it doesn't like taking Overheat, Mega Sceptile is a decent check, as it is faster and gains a +1 Special Attack boost from Volt Switch thanks to Lightningrod, and can it can even survive an Overheat if it is healthy.

**Stealth Rock**: Stealth Rock is the bane of Rotom-H's existence. While Rotom-H does avoid other entry hazards due to its ability, it suffers from a Stealth Rock weakness and thus has a limited number of times it can switch into opposing attacks even if running the defensive set, as Pain Split is only semi-reliable. The Choice Specs and Choice Scarf set are even further pressured for switching, as they have no way to recover their HP. This limits just how much Rotom-H can reliably switch in, tank hits, and keep up the momentum via Volt Switch.

**Water-types**: Although Rotom-H can threaten Water-types with its Electric-type STAB moves, most Water-types can still check it. Bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune can threaten Rotom-H with their own STAB moves and Rotom-H usually cannot break them, as Swampert is immune to Volt Switch and resists Overheat whereas Suicune can boost its Special Defense via Calm Mind while also Resting off the damage. Faster Water-types such as Mega Sharpedo can outright OHKO Rotom-H before it can do anything to Mega Sharpedo.

**Assault Vest Users**: Common users of Assault Vest, such as Entei, can easily tank any of Rotom-H's hits, thus gaining the upper hand against Rotom-H.

**Special Walls**: Special walls, such as Blissey and Florges, can easily take anything Rotom-H has to offer, as they can get rid of status and take little damage from its attacks. These special walls, however, have to be wary of Trick on the Choice Specs and Choice Scarf set.
