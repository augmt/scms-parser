Overview
########
Cinccino is an extremely effective anti-lead and revenge killer. Its base 95 Attack and base 115 Speed allow it to hit relatively hard while still outspeeding most of the unboosted tier; these qualities make it stand out from other Normal-types. Cinccino's movepool also contains all the tools it needs and more, and its abilities only serve to augment its offensive prowess. Bullet Seed, Tail Slap, and Rock Blast give Cinccino excellent coverage, and, when combined with Skill Link, allow it to consistently break through Focus Sashes and Substitutes.

However, Cinccino has many glaring flaws that limit its capabilities. Its Normal typing and somewhat poor defenses mean that it can't be switched in directly, so it requires some degree of support from teammates. Ghost- and Steel-types also pose a major problem to Cinccino; its coverage moves barring Knock Off won't be doing much damage to them, and they can easily force it out. Cinccino is also particularly vulnerable to status, as burns and paralysis cripple it and render it incapable of performing its role. All in all, Cinccino is a very capable wallbreaker and revenge killer in the right hands, but it is a textbook glass cannon and should be handled like one.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Tail Slap
move 2: Bullet Seed
move 3: Rock Blast
move 4: U-turn / Knock Off
ability: Skill Link
item: King's Rock / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
Tail Slap is Cinccino's signature STAB move, consistently hitting five times for a grand total of 187.5 Base Power, which makes it an ideal move to spam when in doubt. Bullet Seed and Rock Blast serve as superb coverage options, both hitting five times and allowing Cinccino to break through bulky Water-types and pesky Flying-types, respectively. U-turn, in combination with Cinccino's great Speed tier, allows it to gain offensive momentum for its team. Knock Off is also a solid choice for the last moveslot, surprising Ghost-types and providing team support in general, and possibly even removing a revenge killer's Choice Scarf.

Set Details
========
The EVs are standard for an offensively-geared Pokemon; 252 Attack EVs allow Cinccino to hit as hard as possible, 252 Speed EVs let Cinccino outpace most of the unboosted tier, and the remaining EVs give Cinccino an extra point in HP. A Jolly nature is used to capitalize on its high Speed, notably allowing it to outspeed max Speed Galvantula and lead Infernape while KOing them through Focus Sash before they can set up their entry hazards. Skill Link is preferred over Technician, as the consistent five hits on multi-hit moves is more reliable than a Technician-boosted move's damage output. A Life Orb makes Cinccino's attacks even stronger, but a King's Rock can also be used to abuse the 41% flinch chance granted by Cinccino's multi-hit moves.

Usage Tips
========
Cinccino is quite frail, so use Volt Switch or U-turn to bring it in safely. If the opponent has a wall that Cinccino cannot easily beat, use U-turn on the predicted switch and let a teammate with a more favorable matchup take care of it, though you must remember that Life Orb recoil will slowly wear it down. This Cinccino is best suited to revenge kill Pokemon behind a Substitute or be an anti-lead, due to its multi-hit moves breaking through Focus Sashes and Substitutes.

Team Options
========
Cleric support is very crucial, as all status afflictions cripple Cinccino in some way. Wish support is also quite helpful, considering Cinccino has no access to reliable recovery. It also appreciates Dark-, Fire-, and Ground-type teammates to reliably take care of Ghost- and Steel-types. In addition, Fire-types can absorb Will-O-Wisp, and Ground-types can absorb Thunder Wave, making them great status sponges for Cinccino. In the same vein, bulky Ghost-types are also handy, absorbing the super effective attacks that would otherwise KO Cinccino. Sticky Web support is extremely useful, as it prevents Choice Scarf users from moving first, turning Cinccino into a wrecking ball.

Revenge Killer
########
name: Revenge Killer
move 1: Tail Slap
move 2: Bullet Seed
move 3: Rock Blast
move 4: U-turn
ability: Skill Link
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
Tail Slap is the best move to use unless the opponent resists it or is hit super effectively by a coverage move. Bullet Seed and Rock Blast provide nifty coverage, with only Steel-types resisting all of Cinccino's moves. U-turn is used to gain momentum, using Cinccino's amazing Speed to hit first most of the time and switch into a more favorable match-up.

Set Details
========
252 Attack and 252 Speed EVs are used to maximize Cinccino's power and Speed, enabling it to revenge kill with ease. Skill Link is chosen over Technician for reliability. Choice Scarf allows Cinccino to outspeed the entire tier, making it impossible to outpace unless the opponent packs a priority move. A Jolly nature allows Cinccino to revenge kill Jolly Choice Scarf Mienshao, one of the most common Pokemon in the tier, but an Adamant nature can be used if your team already has an answer to it.

Usage Tips
========
Cinccino easily beats most revenge killers and Choice Scarf users, so bring it in on a weakened Pokemon or use it as a lead. It also destroys substitutes and Focus Sashes with ease, so don't be afraid if an enemy carries them. U-turn as often as possible if a switch is predicted, and swing the momentum in your favor.

Team Options
========
Defoggers or spinners are necessary to clear entry hazards, allowing Cinccino to switch in more often to revenge kill. Clerics and status absorbers are also useful, as Cinccino cannot revenge kill as efficiently when paralyzed or burned. Steel- and Ghost-types still wall Cinccino, so teammates such as Mienshao and Mega Absol to break past them are appreciated.

Other Options
########
Wake-Up Slap or Aqua Tail can be used to hit Steel-types a bit harder, but they don't receive any benefits from Technician or Skill Link. Iron Tail smacks Fairy-types hard, but it has little use besides that. Work Up can be used to boost Cinccino's Attack, but it is too frail to set up. Choice Band is a viable option, allowing Cinccino to break past Vaporeon and Amoonguss more easily. A support set using U-turn / Encore / Toxic, Thunder Wave, or Sing / Tail Slap can be used, but Cinccino's main selling pain is its stellar coverage and Speed backed by workable power.

Checks & Counters
########
**Bulky Ghost-types**: Bulky Ghost-types are immune to Tail Slap and generally take little damage from its coverage moves, though they must watch out for Knock Off. In particular, Sableye has Prankster Will-O-Wisp, and it isn't hit hard by any of Cinccino's attacks.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types resist most of Cinccino's attacks with the exception of Knock Off and the rare Aqua Tail, which still don't do much damage. Mega Aggron, in particular, walls Cinccino to no end; Knock Off is pathetically weak with no item to remove and Aqua Tail does almost nothing to it.

**Physical Walls**: Dedicated physical walls don't have much to fear from Cinccino unless they are weak to one of its coverage moves.

**Priority**: Cinccino can be revenge killed by priority users such as Infernape and Mega Absol due to its low defenses.
