Overview
########

At first glance, Amoonguss seems to be outclassed by Roserade, which sports higher special stats as well as the ability Natural Cure. However, that is not entirely the case. Amoonguss has decent bulk; 114 / 70 / 80 defenses are nothing to laugh at. It also has a usable Special Attack and a great defensive typing, allowing it to check many threats in the tier, such as Mienshao and Shaymin. In addition, Amoonguss has access to Spore, arguably the best sleep-inducing move thanks to its perfect accuracy. Its Poison typing allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes that may trouble its teammates. However, Amoonguss is not without its faults; it has a low offensive presence and Speed as well as a small movepool, making it easy to revenge kill. Spore is less powerful in Generation VI, as Grass-types and Pokemon with the Overcoat ability are immune to it, but nonetheless, Amoonguss can be a great addition to your team.


Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Spore
move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Clear Smog / Sludge Bomb
move 4: Stun Spore / Synthesis / Foul Play
ability: Regenerator
item: Black Sludge
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold


Moves
========

Spore is the most important move, as it has perfect accuracy and lets Amoonguss cripple most Pokemon, rendering them useless for a few turns. Giga Drain is a decent STAB attack, allowing Amoonguss to regain some HP while also preventing it from being total setup bait. Clear Smog is the preferred move for the third moveslot, allowing Amoonguss to stop most setup sweepers cold in their tracks. However, if that is not your cup of tea, Sludge Bomb can be used if you want the extra power. The last move is a bit of a toss-up. Stun Spore is the generally the best choice, as it paralyzes opponents and assists slower sweepers. Synthesis can be used for recovery, though it is not preferred due to the dominance of weather in the tier, and Amoonguss has Regenerator anyway. Finally, Foul Play can be used to deal with physical attackers, also hitting some counters such as Metagross hard.


Set Details
========

The given EVs maximize Amoonguss's ability to take physical attacks. Regenerator is the only ability that should be considered, as it lets Amoonguss recover a third of its HP when it switches out and thus pivot more effectively. Black Sludge allows Amoonguss to survive more hits and grants it additional recovery; in conjunction with Regenerator, this makes Amoonguss very hard to take down.


Usage Tips
========

Amoonguss can easily switch into many Pokemon such as Mienshao, Virizion, and Sharpedo lacking Ice Beam, as well as physical moves it resists. Use Spore and Stun Spore a lot, but predict well if your opponent has any Pokemon immune to them. Do not stay in on super effective special attacks, as Amoonguss isn't invested in Special Defense, and they will hurt it a lot. Do not expect Amoonguss to entirely wall attackers; it should be used as an excellent defensive pivot. Switch out often, as Amoonguss benefits from doing so thanks to Regenerator.


Team Options
========

Vaporeon and Alomomola are great partners, the latter forming an effective Regenerator core with Amoonguss. They can take the Fire- and Ice-type attacks aimed at it, and in return, Amoonguss can take the Electric- and Grass-type moves directed at them. Sweepers that appreciate paralysis support from Amoonguss, such as Krookodile and Houndoom, make good partners. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Donphan and Roserade is appreciated, as Amoonguss forces quite a lot of switches. Cleric support is also very useful, as Amoonguss has no other means of removing status. Umbreon and Florges make excellent partners, as they can also pass Wishes to improve Amoonguss's longevity.


Other Options
########

An offensive set with Life Orb or Assault Vest set can be used, but Amoonguss's Special Attack is subpar. Furthermore, it is outclassed in such roles by Roserade, Shaymin, and Slowking, and it loses its valuable support options if it opts to use Assault Vest. Similarly, Amoonguss can use Hidden Power Fire in order to deal with Steel-types such as Forretress, but it finds it difficult to fit in among the moves listed. A specially defensive set can be used to allow Amoonguss to take on the prominent special attackers in the tier such as Nidoking, but it leaves Amoonguss unable to check many physical attacking Pokemon.


Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Steel-types trouble Amoonguss greatly; they resist both of Amoonguss's STAB attacks, and most of them can use it as setup fodder provided something is already asleep. Forretress and Escavalier stand out because of their immunity to powder moves thanks to Overcoat. Forretress can set up entry hazards on Amoonguss, while Escavalier can force it out with its powerful attacks. However, do note that they take heavy damage from Hidden Power Fire.

**Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Chandelure, Darmanitan, and Entei can easily dispose of Amoonguss with their respective STAB attacks.

**Crobat**: Crobat resists both of Amoonguss's STAB attacks and can KO with Brave Bird or Taunt it.

**Roserade**: Roserade is immune to Spore and Stun Spore and takes pitiful damage from all of Amoonguss's attacks and can wear it out with Sludge Bomb or set up Spikes on it.

**Magic Bounce**: Magic Bounce users such as Xatu and Mega Absol are immune to Amoonguss's powder moves and can force it out with their STAB attacks.
