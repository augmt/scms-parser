Overview
########

Chatot is a Generation 4 favorite, being well known for its signature move, Chatter. In Generation 6, however, it gains access to a wonderful new STAB attack, Boomburst. With its decent Speed and access to Nasty Plot, it has all of the makings of an excellent special sweeper. However, there are a few things holding it back. It lacks any bulk whatsoever and is completely walled by Steel-types. Along with its nonexistent bulk, it has a lacking movepool. Fortunately, Chatot can make due with what it has, and with proper use, it can be a big threat to the tier.

Moves
========

Chatot has only one main set, but it manages to get by with it. Nasty Plot is a set up move that boosts Chatot's Special Attack to an amazing level. Boomburst is a 140 Base Power STAB move that hits anything that is not a Ghost-type extremely hard with no drawbacks. It also bypasses Substitute with the new mechanics in XY. Chatter is the secondary STAB move on the set that allows Chatot to confuse its opponent while dealing great damage to threats such as Mienshao and Scrafty. The last slot is a toss-up between Encore, Substitute, and Hidden Power Grass. Encore can make the opponents pay when they use a predicted setup move such as Stealth Rock or Swords Dance and allows Chatot to freely set up Nasty Plot. Along with Chatter's confusion chance, this gives Chatot many opportunities to set up. Substitute allows Chatot to dodge status, and in several cases, it can capitalize on an opponent trying to set up on it. Finally, Hidden Power Grass can be used as it hits common threats such as Rhyperior, Swampert, and Gastrodon.

Set Details
========

Chatot has maxed out Special Attack and Speed for maximum sweeping capabilities, with 4 EVs in Defense to take minimum Stealth Rock damage. A Focus Sash allows Chatot to set up at least one Nasty Plot. On the other hand, Leftovers can be used in tandem with Substitute as it allows for recovery while the foe is confused, and while Chatot is behind the Substitute, setting up. A Timid nature is used for maximum Speed.

Usage Tips
========

Chatot needs lots of team support in order for it to be used succesfully. Chatot needs to set up in order to be useful, and Focus Sash provides this opportunity. Substitute can allow Chatot to set up while its opponent is confused from Chatter. Stealth Rock should always be eliminated in order for Chatot's Focus Sash to remain intact. Good Rapid Spinners such as Donphan and Forretress aid in this case.

Team Options
========

Chatot is mainly a wallbreaker with Boomburst, so it nicely complements bulky teams. Chatot needs a whole lot of support from its teammates, including hazards such as Sticky Web and Stealth Rock, dual screens, and anything else it can get. It appreciates Sticky Web to outspeed common threats that could otherwise beat it, such as Darmanitan, Mienshao, and any other non-Flying-type or Levitate user. In this case, Shuckle is a great teammate for setting up hazards, and it can Encore opponents to allow Chatot a free switch-in. Lastly, a good special attacking Fire- or Ground-type such as Chandelure or Nidoking can deal well with opposing Steel-types.

Other Options
=========

Unfortunately, there are not many other options for Chatot. It does have access to Heat Wave, but it is incompatible with its best move, Boomburst. U-turn and Ominous Wind are other attacking options. Chatot does have a very large utility movepool including Torment, Tailwind, Roost, Taunt, Defog, Rain Dance, and Sunny Day. It has access to Agility, but it already has decent Speed. Lastly, it has access to Sing, but it's a bit too inaccurate for it to work properly.

Checks & Counters
########

**Faster Pokemon**: Pokemon that can outspeed base 91 Speed can all pretty much beat Chatot, as it is very frail. Fast Pokemon such as Noivern, Victini, and any Pokemon with a Choice Scarf can deal with it well.

**Priority Users**: Priority users can generally beat Chatot as long as its Focus Sash is broken, as once again, it is extremely frail. Users of Fake Out such as Mienshao or Ambipom have no trouble beating Chatot, breaking its Focus Sash with Fake Out and finishing off with another move.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Doublade and Magneton completely wall Chatot and can beat it with any attacking move.

**Rock-types**: Rock-types, especially bulky ones like Rhyperior, have no trouble busting Chatot. However, Rhyperior should be wary of a boosted Hidden Power Grass.

**Electric types**: Most Electric-type Pokemon, such as Jolteon and Raikou, can outspeed and KO Chatot with a STAB move.
