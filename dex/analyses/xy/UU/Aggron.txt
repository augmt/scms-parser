Overview
########

Mega Aggron shines in the tier as the bulkiest available Mega Evolution. With sky-high Attack and Defense stats, Mega Aggron can tank UU's strongest physical hits while dealing out serious damage in return. Like all Mega Evolutions, however, Mega Aggron loses out on an item slot, which means it loses out on the passive recovery that Leftovers provides for other defensive Pokemon. This, combined with its relatively low HP and Special Defense, means that Mega Aggron isn't quite as overpowered as it first appears. Still, Mega Aggron's access to support moves like Stealth Rock and Roar and extra bulk due to Filter make it an outstanding and reliable tank.

Moves
========

With this set, Mega Aggron becomes a utility-based Pokemon that can also dish out some serious damage. Heavy Slam draws power from Mega Aggron's high weight to provide a strong STAB attack. Earthquake provides great coverage to hit Pokemon who are less susceptible to Heavy Slam and still deals significant damage due to Mega Aggron's high Attack. Because of Mega Aggron's all-around good bulk, it can set Stealth Rock up reliably. Finally, either Roar or Toxic will add extra utility for the last slot. Roar allows Mega Aggron to become an effective phazer, racking up damage from its own hazards as well as thwarting the efforts of set up sweepers like Suicune. Toxic, on the other hand, can be used to cripple Pokemon such as Swampert and Alomomola who are otherwise resistant to Mega Aggron's moves.

Set Details
========

Although Mega Aggron's main purpose is to tank physical hits, it's important to have a fair amount of investment in its low Special Defense stat. In a pinch, Mega Aggron may have to take some special attacks, and the nature of EVs makes it overall more efficient to invest in lower base stats. An Impish nature makes Mega Aggron more tanky. Sturdy is the only relevant ability for this set for Mega Aggron's base form, but it's the ability it has as Mega Aggron that really helps it out. Filter, which makes Mega Aggron take only 75% of the damage from super effective attacks, further augments its tankiness on both the physical and special sides.

Usage Tips
========

While this set does capitalize on Mega Aggron's insane bulk, remember that its base form is more useful in some cases. For instance, if you're facing off against a Victini, it might be a good idea to hold off on Mega Evolving&mdash;Aggron's Rock typing makes Fire-type attacks neutral instead of super effective. Also, be careful against special attackers; Mega Aggron has great overall bulk, but it doesn't enjoy taking special hits that it doesn't have to. If you choose to run Roar, use it to predict switches into offensive counters or spinners in order to keep hazards on the field and continue racking up damage.

Team Options
========

Mega Aggron benefits from Wish passers such as Alomomola, Blissey, Aromatisse, and Florges, who can all make up for its lack of Leftovers and keep it in play for longer. Blissey is a wonderful partner, as it makes up for Mega Aggron's relatively low special bulk and covers threats like Chandelure, Mega Blastoise, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen. Florges and Aromatisse can do this to a lesser extent, but they accept a weakness to Nidoking and Nidoqueen in exchange for better physical bulk. Finally, Alomomola creates a strong defensive core with Aggron by taking the few powerful Fighting-, Fire-, and Ground-type physical moves that Mega Aggron struggles against. Mega Aggron's access to hazards and phazing also makes it a great partner for offensive sweepers like Sharpedo and Mienshao that rely on hazard damage to nab crucial KOs. Mega Aggron's weaknesses are also covered defensively by Pokemon like Qwilfish.

Other Options
########

Choice Band Aggron is viable purely because of its surprise factor, but it's mostly outclassed by other bulky Choice Band users such as Rhyperior. Mega Aggron can run sets that incorporate Rest and Sleep Talk&mdash;its one source of recovery, but these aren't optimal. This move combination can either be paired with Curse and Iron Head to provide an alternate win condition for stall teams or with Roar and Heavy Slam to become a tanky dedicated phazer. Rest can be used without Sleep Talk in the main set in place of Roar or Toxic, but this strategy quickly loses momentum for the rest of the team, making alternate solutions like Wish passing more viable solutions for Mega Aggron's lack of recovery. In terms of EVs, putting all of the EVs into either Defense or Special Defense is certainly viable and can be tailored to what your team needs, but a balanced spread is usually the best option.

Checks & Counters
########

**Special Attackers**: Pokemon like Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Hydreigon that carry dangerous, super effective special attacks pose a serious threat to Mega-Aggron.


**Fire-types**: While physical Fire-types like Victini, Darmanitan, and Entei are certainly threatening, they can't reliably OHKO Mega Aggron and are extremely susceptible to Earthquake. The main threat comes in the form of special attackers like special Infernape and Chandelure, who can easily OHKO Mega Aggron with boosting items or moves. Rotom-H deserves a special mention for its resistance or immunity to both of Mega Aggron's attacks while also threatening it offensively.

**Fighting-types**: Similarly to physical Fire-types, strong physical Fighting-types such as Mienshao can deal hefty damage to Mega Aggron. Special Fighting-type coverage like that of Lucario, Mega Blastoise, and Alakazam is extremely threatening as well.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types such as Swampert, and Mega Blastoise can laugh off Mega Aggron's offensive moves and force it out. Mega Blastoise deserves a special mention for its ability to remove Mega Aggron's hazards while also threatening it offensively.

**Bulky Ground-types**: Bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon fear nothing from Mega Aggron's attacks and can spam Earthquake to take advantage of Mega Aggron's lack of recovery.

**Rapid Spinners**: Like Mega Blastoise, some other Rapid Spinners like Forretress or Donphan can remove Mega Aggron's hazards without fearing much from its attacks.
