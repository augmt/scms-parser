Overview
########

Aggron's Mega Evolution boasts a ridiculously high base 230 Defense stat. Furthermore, its ability, Filter, reduces the amount of damage taken from super effective attacks by 25%. Mega Aggron's pure Steel typing gives it ten resistances and one immunity. It has access to great support moves, including Stealth Rock, Roar, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Mega Aggron has a good base 140 Attack stat, which lets it fire off strong attacks; however, this is fairly average considering that Mega Aggron cannot use a boosting item. Before Mega Evolving, Aggron has a horrible defensive typing, and after Mega Evolving, it misses out on the passive recovery that Leftovers would give it. Mega Aggron also has a fairly average base 80 Special Defense stat and a pitiful base 50 Speed stat.

Moves
========

Stealth Rock damages the foe as it switches in. Roar is a reliable phazing tool and allows Mega Aggron to rack up Stealth Rock damage on the opposing team. However, Toxic may be used instead to cripple walls such as Vaporeon, Suicune, Swampert, and Alomomola, as may Thunder Wave, which Mega Aggron generally uses to paralyze foes on the switch. Heavy Slam has massive power coming off of Mega Aggron's base 140 Attack stat and does serious damage thanks to Mega Aggron's gargantuan weight. Earthquake provides good coverage alongside Heavy Slam, hitting Steel-, Fire-, and Electric-type Pokemon for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP investment makes Mega Aggron very bulky, allowing it to take hits from both physical and special attacks. 16 Defense EVs and an Impish nature hit a jump point and give Mega Aggron a high chance to survive two Choice Band-boosted Earthquakes from Krookodile. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to help Mega Aggron take special attacks better.

Usage Tips
========

In certain situations, it is better to hold off on Mega Evolving Aggron. For example, if Aggron is up against Entei, not Mega Evolving it lets Aggron take less damage from an incoming Sacred Fire; due to Aggron's Rock typing, it will take neutral damage. When running Roar, predict switches wisely. Use an attack that would badly damage the predicted switch-in, or use Roar when you think that Mega Aggron can't do much damage to the predicted switch-in.

Team Options
========

Due to its lack of recovery, Mega Aggron partners well with Vaporeon, Blissey, Alomomola, Florges, and Aromatisse, as they can all heal it with Wish. Special walls such as Blissey and Florges form a great defensive core with Mega Aggron, as Mega Aggron tanks physical attacks, while the special wall can tank special attacks. Powerful sweepers such as Nidoking, Darmanitan, and Mienshao are good partners for Mega Aggron because they have an easier time sweeping late-game thanks to Stealth Rock. Bulky Water-types make good teammates for Mega Aggron, as they handle the Fire-types that threaten it. Grass-type Pokemon and Choice Band Guts Machamp can handle the bulky Water-types that threaten Mega Aggron and don't mind switching into Scald.

Other Options
########

Rest and Sleep Talk can be used alongside Heavy Slam and either Curse or Roar. If Mega Aggron is running Roar, having a Pokemon that can provide entry hazard support is recommended. Dragon Tail is a damage-dealing phazing move, and it deals with Magic Bounce and Taunt users. Metal Burst can be utilized to tank hits and retaliate with 1.5x the damage taken. A Choice Band set consisting of Head Smash, Heavy Slam, Earthquake, and Double-Edge is viable but a lot less bulkier compared to Mega Aggron; Aggron's main niche in UU is provided by its Mega Evolution.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Ground-types**: Mega Steelix and Hippowdon can take any one of Mega Aggron's attacks and either set up Stealth Rock or retaliate with an attack of their own.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types such as Mega Blastoise, Vaporeon, Suicune, Swampert, and Alomomola take minimal damage from Mega Aggron's attacks.

**Rapid Spin Users**: Mega Blastoise, Forretress, and Donphan are able to get rid of Stealth Rock by using Rapid Spin and take very little damage from Mega Aggron's attacks.

**Strong Special Attackers**: Nidoking and Chandelure are both great examples of strong special attackers that can OHKO Mega Aggron. However, they have trouble switching into Earthquake.

**Powerful Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Entei, Rotom-H, Darmanitan, and Chandelure all threaten Mega Aggron with their powerful STAB attacks, which can OHKO or 2HKO it.
