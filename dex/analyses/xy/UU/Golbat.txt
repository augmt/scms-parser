Overview
########

Although slower and less powerful than its evolved counterpart, Crobat, Golbat sports a niche in UU as a viable Defogger with access to Eviolite-boosted defenses. Gligar is generally a superior option, but Golbat's Infiltrator niche and access to a Flying-type STAB move give it a spot on teams that require Crobat's typing, but more bulk. Golbat's role is predictable, so it's always important to beware of the opponent taking opportune moments to set up on or wear down Golbat. Access to Infiltrator makes a bulky Toxic stall set viable; however, limited offensive presence and vulnerability to Knock Off and Taunt prevent Golbat from being more than a simple support Pokemon.

Eviolite Bat
########
name: Eviolite Bat
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Roost
move 3: Defog
move 4: Toxic / U-turn / Taunt
ability: Infiltrator
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Brave Bird is Golbat's only reliable STAB move, hitting frailer threats for moderate damage. Roost gives Golbat access to reliable recovery, enabling it to serve somewhat effectively on its own. Defog removes entry hazards and is Golbat's primary role on most teams. Toxic works well with Infiltrator and is useful against set up sweepers, especially those that like to use Substitute, such as Cresselia. U-turn is a decent slow-pivoting option that enables you to regain momentum against a switch-in. Taunt works against bulkier entry hazard users, such as Hippowdon and Forretress, and stops status users from crippling Golbat.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs give Golbat some much-needed bulk while maintaining an odd HP value to get an extra switch into Stealth Rock as well as non-divisible number for Roost, granting you future opportunities to switch into Stealth Rock. 252 Defense EVs allow Golbat to function effectively against many premier Choice Band wallbreakers, such as Heracross, Machamp, and Infernape. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense in order to maximize Golbat's bulk. Infiltrator is the optimal choice, as Inner Focus is rarely needed due to flinch strategies being extremely rare since Jirachi's departure. Infiltrator also allows Toxic to hit through the foe's Substitute. Eviolite boosts Golbat's defenses by 1.5x.

Usage Tips
========
Golbat can absorb physical hits much better than Crobat can, proving itself as a niche Defogger. It's always best to try to save Golbat for the mid-game, as early offensive pressure from moves such as Knock Off and Taunt will wear Golbat and its teammates down. With access to Brave Bird, Roost, Defog, and Toxic, Golbat is effective at taking on bulky Ground-types such as Hippodown and Donphan. However, it fears Donphan's Knock Off, which will severely impact Golbat's bulk and long-term effectiveness. If using U-turn, Golbat can perform as a defensive pivot.

Team Options
========

Golbat pairs extremely well with Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards off the field, as well as Pokemon that can wallbreak after a free switch, such as Entei or Darmanitan. Golbat also pairs well with Pokemon such as Snorlax that are weak to Fighting-type wallbreakers, as Golbat can absorb physical hits extremely well even without Eviolite.

Other Options
########

A Choice Band or Choice Scarf set is completely outclassed by Crobat and any item aside from Eviolite should never be considered for Golbat. However, other support moves can be used, such as Tailwind. A specially defensive set can be used in order to answer special attackers such as Infernape, Shaymin, and Hydreigon.

Checks & Counters
########

**Knock Off Users**: Krookodile and Donphan are notable examples of Pokemon that like to take advantage of Golbat's poor Attack and use an early-game Knock Off on either Golbat or its teammates.

**Flying-type Resists**: Mega Aggron, Rotom-H, and Rhyperior can wear Golbat down pretty easily with their powerful moves.

**Special Attackers**: Chandelure, Kyurem, and Nidoqueen have a severe advantage over Golbat despite its Eviolite-boosted bulk.

**Taunt**: Taunt users such as Crobat, Krookodile, and Azelf all disrupt Golbat's ability to function as a support Pokemon.

**Bulky Water-types**: Empoleon, Swampert, Vaporeon, and Suicune can all wear down Golbat with continued Scalds. Access to Roar will also severely wear down Golbat, especially if Stealth Rocks is up on Golbat's side of the field, which Empoleon and Swampert can repeatedly set up even if it is removed.
