Overview
########

Sceptile has an excellent combination of offensive stats and Speed as well as a wide movepool with many good coverage options. Furthermore, after Mega Evolving, it has a pretty decent ability in Lightningrod, which makes Mega Sceptile a good switch into Electric-type attacks. Mega Sceptile has a decent defensive typing with a handful of useful resistances, but it also has a lot of weaknesses and low defenses, which makes it easier to KO. Even though Mega Sceptile's Speed is rather great, it is still outsped by a lot of common Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and Mienshao; it also Speed ties with Mega Beedrill and is outsped by Mega Aerodactyl.

All-Out Offensive
########
name: All-Out Offensive
move 1: Leaf Storm
move 2: Focus Blast
move 3: Dragon Pulse
move 4: Giga Drain / Earthquake / Hidden Power Fire
ability: Overgrow
item: Sceptilite
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Naive

Moves
========

Leaf Storm is a very powerful Grass-type STAB move, but it harshly drops Sceptile's Special Attack after use. Focus Blast is a powerful Fighting-type attack that has great overall coverage, but it is a little inaccurate. Dragon Pulse is a secondary STAB attack with good neutral coverage. Giga Drain is another good STAB attack that recovers Sceptile's health and doesn't have a drawback, unlike Leaf Storm, and therefore it can be used in the fourth slot. Earthquake can be used instead, as it hits Pokemon such as Chandelure and Infernape for better damage and also has great coverage. Hidden Power Fire can also be used in the fourth slot to 2HKO Assault Vest Escavalier and hit Doublade and Forretress harder, but it lacks power otherwise.

Set Details
========

Overgrow is Sceptile's ability before Mega Evolving, but it isn't really useful, as Sceptile tends to Mega Evolve immediately anyway. Lightningrod grants Mega Sceptile an immunity to Electric-type attacks, making it a perfect switch-in for them. Maximum Special Attack investment ensures Mega Sceptile hits as hard as possible, and the Speed EVs and Timid nature allow it to Speed tie with Jolly Mega Beedrill and outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Chandelure. If running Earthquake, a Naive nature is recommended, and the 4 HP EVs can be shifted to Attack.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as Sceptile will get a huge boost to its offenses. Use Leaf Storm sparingly, as it will harshly drop Sceptile's Special Attack after use, leaving it fairly weak. If it has been used, switch out to reset Sceptile's stats. Mega Sceptile is a good switch-in to Water-, Grass-, and Electric-type attacks, even gaining a Special Attack boost from the latter. However, switch carefully, as the opponent can predict the switch and hit Mega Sceptile with a more effective move. Mega Sceptile can also be used as a late-game cleaner once special walls are gone. Bringing Mega Sceptile in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is wise, as it doesn't have the bulk to switch in itself.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can bring Sceptile in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Forretress, make for good teammates, as Sceptile does not have the bulk to switch in directly. Physical attackers such as Lucario, Darmanitan, and Haxorus make for good partners as well because they can break through specially defensive Pokemon such as Florges and Blissey, which hinder Mega Sceptile. Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Escavalier can beat the Fairy-types that hinder Mega Sceptile. Infernape, Rotom-H, and Crobat are also good teammates because they beat Grass-types, which trouble Mega Sceptile. Entry hazard setters such as Nidoqueen and the aforementioned Forretress can help Mega Sceptile KO foes more easily thanks to the chip damage they provide. Lastly, Wish support from Umbreon and Blissey is useful too, keeping Mega Sceptile healthy.

Substitute Attacker
########
name: Substitute Attacker
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Dragon Pulse
move 4: Focus Blast
ability: Overgrow
item: Sceptilite
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Substitute allows Sceptile to avoid status moves, and it is also a great move to use on a forced switch; this allows Sceptile a free attacking turn, unless the opposing Pokemon uses a sound-based move or has Infiltrator. Giga Drain is a STAB move with a decent Base Power, decent coverage, and excellent synergy with Substitute, as it recovers Sceptile's HP a bit, allowing it to set up more Substitutes. Dragon Pulse is a reliable STAB attack that hits most types neutrally. Focus Blast is used in the fourth slot to hit Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Lucario hard, as they resist Sceptile's STAB attacks, and Focus Blast also has great overall coverage.

Set Details
========

Overgrow is Sceptile's ability before Mega Evolving, but it doesn't provide much use outside of letting Giga Drain hit harder when at low health, and Sceptile will Mega Evolve immediately anyway. With Lightningrod Mega Sceptile can absorb Electric-type attacks upon switching in and gain a Special Attack boost from them. The EV investment maximizes Mega Sceptile's offensive capabilities and the Timid nature lets Mega Sceptile outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Chandelure and Speed tie with Jolly Mega Beedrill. The remaining EVs go in HP to let Mega Sceptile set up a maximum of five Substitutes if it cannot go for Giga Drain.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as Sceptile will get a huge boost in its offensive stats as well as a small boost in its Defense stat. Use Substitute on a predicted switch; this allows Mega Sceptile to get a free attacking turn most of the time. Mega Sceptile is a good switch-in for Electric-type attacks, as Lightningrod will raise Mega Sceptile's Special Attack, making it even more powerful. However, Sceptile should switch in carefully, because Mega Ampharos can knock it out with Dragon Pulse if the opponent predicts the switch. Mega Sceptile is a good switch-in for Grass- and Water-type attacks, as it can easily take an attack because of its 4x resistances and can hit their users with a powerful STAB attack or just set up a Substitute. Although Sceptile can switch into certain types of attacks, it isn't bulky enough to switch into most neutral attacks, so bringing it in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is good, as it ensures Sceptile gets a safe switch in so it can Mega Evolve right after.

Team Options
========

As mentioned in Usage Tips, slow U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Forretress are good teammates, as they help Sceptile switch in safely. Fire-types such as Infernape and Chandelure are useful for their ability to take the Ice-type attacks that bother Mega Sceptile and beat these users afterwards. Steel- and Poison-types such as Escavalier, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen are useful for beating the Fairy-types that threaten Mega Sceptile. Physical wallbreakers such as Pangoro, Krookodile, and Haxorus can break through specially defensive walls for Sceptile, and therefore they make for good partners too. Pokemon weak to Grass-, Water-, or Electric-types appreciate Mega Sceptile as a teammate, as it can switch into these attacks and beat those Pokemon. Wish support from Umbreon and Blissey is useful to keep Mega Sceptile healthy.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Leaf Blade
move 3: Dragon Claw / Outrage
move 4: Earthquake / Drain Punch
ability: Overgrow
item: Sceptilite
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance allows Sceptile to boost its Attack to great levels. Leaf Blade is a powerful STAB attack with decent coverage. Dragon Claw is a secondary STAB move that achieves great coverage alongside Leaf Blade. Outrage is another usable Dragon-type attack with more power than Dragon Claw, but it leaves Sceptile confused and unable to switch out. Earthquake is an option for the last slot, as it hits the Steel-types that resist Mega Sceptile's STAB combination. Drain Punch is another option because it can allow Mega Sceptile to break through common walls that usually would switch into it, such as Blissey and Umbreon.

Set Details
========

Overgrow is Sceptile's ability before Mega Evolving, but it doesn't provide much utility. Lightningrod is Sceptile's ability after Mega Evolving and makes it a great switch-in to Electric-type moves. Sceptilite allows Sceptile to Mega Evolve and gain a huge boost in stats. 252 Attack and Speed EVs maximize Mega Sceptile's offensive capabilities, and the Jolly nature allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf Chandelure and Speed tie with maximum Speed Jolly Mega Beedrill.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as Sceptile will become way more powerful than its normal forme. Use Swords Dance on a forced switch; this gives Sceptile an easier time to sweep. Mega Sceptile can be easily switched into Water-, Grass-, and Electric-type attacks; it takes barely anything from the former two and is immune to the latter. However, it should certainly be wary of Scald, which can burn Sceptile and weaken it a lot. Bringing Sceptile in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is good, as it usually doesn't have the bulk to switch in directly.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can bring Sceptile in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Forretress, make for good teammates, as Sceptile generally doesn't have enough bulk to switch in itself. Mega Sceptile appreciates special wallbreakers such as Chandelure and Hydreigon, which can take care of some physical walls that hinder Mega Sceptile during its sweep, such as Forretress and Gligar. Pokemon that take advantage of Sceptile's ability to lure in special walls, such as Chandelure, make for good partners too. Pokemon such as Escavalier can reliably beat the Fairy-types that get in Mega Sceptile's way, and Crobat and Rotom-H can take care of Grass-types. Entry hazard setters such as Nidoqueen, Froslass, and Forretress are good teammates, as entry hazard support can help Mega Sceptile KO foes more easily. Cleric support from Pokemon such as Florges and Blissey is appreciated too, as burn is troublesome for Mega Sceptile. Wish support from Umbreon and Blissey is useful to keep Mega Sceptile healthy.

Other Options
########

Iron Tail can be used to hit Fairy-types, which threaten Mega Sceptile, but it is inaccurate and doesn't have good overall coverage. Rock Slide is another option for hitting Chandelure and Flying-types, which resist Sceptile's Grass-type STAB moves, for more damage, but most types are hit well by Dragon Pulse and Fire-types are better hit by Earthquake anyway. Leech Seed is an option to recover Sceptile's health a bit, but Sceptile doesn't have the bulk to pull the trick off. Synthesis is a recovery move that can improve longevity, but Sceptile does not have the bulk to pull one off without getting hurt badly.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types such as Florges, Aromatisse, and Whimsicott are the most reliable counters to Mega Sceptile, as they all can take a hit and beat it with a STAB attack.

**Revenge Killers**: Revenge killers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Darmanitan can come in and KO Sceptile with one of their STAB attacks, as Sceptile doesn't have great bulk.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Whimsicott can switch into Mega Sceptile's attacks and steadily recover damage back, and they can KO it afterwards.
