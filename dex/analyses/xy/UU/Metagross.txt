Overview
########
Metagross is a very versatile Pokemon in UU thanks to a variety of qualities. Metagross has a respectable base 135 Attack stat, alongside good Defense and HP stats. Metagross also has a good STAB combination which is supported by a plethora of coverage options, which include Earthquake, Grass Knot, and Thunder Punch. Metagross can utilize a variety of strategies, which makes it unpredictable. However, its Steel typing leaves it weak to Fire-type attacks, which are extremely common. In addition, Metagross gained new weaknesses to Ghost- and Dark-type attacks, in particular the omnipresent Knock Off. Lastly, Metagross suffers from a low Speed stat, so it often must take a hit before responding.

Agility
########
name: Agility
move 1: Agility
move 2: Meteor Mash
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Zen Headbutt
ability: Clear Body
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Agility raises Metagross's Speed by two stages, allowing it to outspeed common Pokemon found on offensive teams. STAB Meteor Mash deals immense amounts of damage, and it also has a 20% chance to boost Metagross's already extraordinary Attack by one stage. Earthquake helps Metagross beat Steel- and Fire-types, which resist Meteor Mash, which is Metagross's main attack. Zen Headbutt is a powerful STAB move that dents Fighting-types, which often carry Knock Off

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature allow Metagross to outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon before the Agility boost, as well as Choice Scarf Mienshao after the boost. Life Orb increases Metagross's damage output significantly. Clear Body prevents any stats from being lowered.

Usage Tips
========

This Metagross acts as a late-game setup sweeper. After an Agility boost, there are very few Pokemon that can outspeed it. When Metagross is safely in, be careful about using Agility. Don't use Agility if it's bound to be more harmful than beneficial to Metagross, and don't be afraid to switch out once you've used it. If Metagross is your best shot at winning, keeping it safe is more important than keeping it boosted. That being said, try to avoid setting up if there are still Pokemon that wall Metagross. Attempt to get rid of them beforehand, as to not waste turns on setting up.

Team Options
========

Flying-types or Pokemon with Levitate, such as Aerodactyl and Hydreigon, help deal with Ground-type attacks. Arcanine or bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune can take on Fire-types and attempt to remove such Pokemon, leaving more room for Metagross to set up. Pokemon that don't mind taking a Knock Off, such as Arcanine, Mega Blastoise, and Chesnaught, help to alleviate prediction as Metagross needs the power of Life Orb to muscle past offensive teams. Metagross appreciates cleric and Wish support from Pokemon such as Florges and Vaporeon, due to its vulnerability to status moves and its lack of recovery.

Wallbreaker Mixgross
########
name: Wallbreaker Mixgross
move 1: Meteor Mash
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Grass Knot
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Bullet Punch
ability: Clear Body
item: Life Orb
evs: 224 Atk / 160 SpA / 124 Spe
nature: Naughty

Moves
========

STAB Meteor Mash does immense amounts of damage with a Life Orb equipped, and it even has a 20% chance to increase Metagross's Attack by one stage. Earthquake helps this set power through the Steel- and Fire-types that it can't break through otherwise. Grass Knot defeats Suicune, Swampert, and Quagsire, all of which would otherwise wall Metagross. Hidden Power Fire smacks Forretress, another common switch-in to Metagross. If Forretress isn't a problem for your team, Bullet Punch gives Metagross a bit of priority that can help it get around its poor Speed, hitting faster threats such as Mega Aerodactyl.

Set Details
========

160 Special Attack EVs are enough to 2HKO Suicune with Grass Knot after Stealth Rock damage. 124 Speed EVs allow Metagross to outspeed uninvested Suicune. The remaining EVs are put in Attack because Metagross is able to deal the most damage physically. A Naughty nature boosts Attack at the expense of Special Defense because Metagross should be dependent on physical bulk instead of Special Defense. If it fits better with your team, a Lonely nature, boosting Attack at the expense of Defense, might be the preferable option. Life Orb allows Metagross to do a better job as a wallbreaker, greatly powering up all of its attacks. Clear Body prevents any stats from being lowered by moves and abilities such as Sticky Web and Intimidate.

Usage Tips
========

This Metagross set excels at luring in Pokemon that typically counter Metagross, such as Water-types, and surprising them with a powerful Grass Knot. It also lures in Forretress, which falls to Hidden Power Fire. This set is meant to surprise and take down the enemy's walls.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate the ability of this set to wallbreak, such as Darmanitan, Snorlax, and Mega Houndoom, make for good teammates. Flying-types or Pokemon with Levitate, such as Aerodactyl or Hydreigon, respectively, help deal with the Ground-type attacks Metagross has trouble dealing with. Arcanine or bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune can take Fire-type attacks. Pokemon that don't mind taking a Knock Off, such as Arcanine, Mega Blastoise, and Chesnaught, help to alleviate prediction. It is very important that this set keeps its Life Orb, or else it will not be able to 2HKO Suicune. Metagross appreciates cleric and Wish support from Pokemon such as Florges and Vaporeon, due to its vulnerability to status moves and its lack of recovery.

Stealth Rock
########
name: Stealth Rock
move 1: Meteor Mash
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stealth Rock
move 4: Bullet Punch / Zen Headbutt
ability: Clear Body
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Meteor Mash is the most powerful STAB attack Metagross has, having a good Base Power of 90 and a 20% change to increase Metagross's Attack. Earthquake provides very good coverage, as it hits Fire- and Steel-types, such as Empoleon and Chandelure, for super effective damage. Stealth Rock supports the team by wearing down the opponent's Pokemon upon switch-in, and Metagross finds many opportunities to set it up. Bullet Punch is Metagross's priority move, which makes up for its average Speed and hits faster targets such as Mega Aerodactyl for super effective damage. If the priority is not needed, then Zen Headbutt should be used to hit Fighting- and Poison-types, such as Amoonguss and Mienshao, for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature allow Metagross to hit as hard as possible. Maximum HP investment increases Metagross's overall bulk, allowing it to tank many neutral and resisted attacks. Leftovers keeps Metagross healthy throughout the battle.

Usage Tips
========

Generally, it is best to switch Metagross in on resisted hits such as Roserade's Giga Drain or Alakazam's Psyshock. Metagross finds many opportunities throughout the match to setup Stealth Rock due to its respectable bulk and typing. Metagross is often bulkier than sometimes perceived, especially on the physical side, as it can take powerful attacks such as a Reckless High Jump Kick from Mienshao. Don't be afraid to take a hit if Metagross can hit back harder. Meteor Mash tends to be the best option when hitting opponents neutrally, as it has good Base Power and a chance to raise Metagross's Attack by one stage. However, it is important to be smart with predicting the opponent's switches, as hitting an Empoleon with Earthquake or an Infernape with Zen Headbutt on an anticipated switch can be a determining factor within a battle.

Team Options
========

Spinblockers such as Sableye and Chandelure can ensure that Stealth Rock stays on the field. Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate, such as Aerodactyl and Hydreigon, respectively, make for good teammates as they can help mitigate the Ground-type weakness Metagross possesses. Arcanine and bulky Water-types such as Swampert, Vaporeon, and Suicune can take Fire-type attacks, while in return Metagross can decently take on Grass-types for them. Pokemon that don't mind taking a Knock Off or Dark-type attacks, such as Arcanine, Mega Blastoise, and Chesnaught, help to alleviate prediction. This is important as Leftovers are important for Metagross's survivability. Metagross appreciates cleric and Wish support from Pokemon such as Florges and Vaporeon, due to its vulnerability to status moves and its lack of recovery.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Meteor Mash
move 2: Zen Headbutt
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Bullet Punch / Trick / Thunder Punch
ability: Clear Body
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Meteor Mash is a strong STAB move that deals massive damage to anything that does not resist it. Earthquake helps to deal with Steel- and Fire-types that resist Metagross's STAB moves. Zen Headbutt is used to deal with common Fighting- and Poison-type Pokemon, while also receiving the STAB boost. Bullet Punch helps Metagross circumvent its poor Speed and hit fast threats like Mega Aerodactyl, as well as revenge kill weakened Hydreigon, Haxorus, and Nidoking. Trick can be used to cripple physical walls such as Vaporeon and Alomomola. Thunder Punch is another option in the last slot as it helps Metagross get through Water-type Pokemon, such as Suicune, Vaporeon, and Slowking, which can generally wall Metagross.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature are used for power, and maximum HP investment is used to give Metagross decent bulk alongside its good Defense stat. Choice Band amplifies its attacking power to extremely high levels, allowing it to to break through many defensive Pokemon. Clear Body prevents any stats from being lowered by an ability or move, such as Intimidate from Arcanine and Krookodile.

Usage Tips
========

This Metagross set is meant to hit extremely hard, and it can tear through certain bulky walls due to the crazy power that it has. However, it cannot dent bulky Pokemon that resist its STAB moves, such as Alomomola and Swampert. Furthermore, it is important to be cautious regarding what move you choose to lock Metagross into, as this can be played around. When in doubt, Meteor Mash is probably the best move to be locked into, as it is a powerful STAB move that has the chance of boosting Metagross's absurdly high Attack even further.

Team Options
========

Flying-types or Pokemon with Levitate, such as Aerodactyl and Hydreigon, make for good teammates, being able to mitigate the Ground-type weakness that Metagross faces. Defensive Arcanine or bulky Water-types such as Swampert and Suicune can take Fire-type attacks that are problematic for Metagross. Pokemon that don't mind taking a Knock Off, such as Arcanine, Mega Blastoise, and Chesnaught, help to alleviate prediction. Knock Off is problematic to Metagross because it will be unable to break through walls if it has lost its Choice Band. A partner that can set up entry hazards, such as Swampert or Rhyperior, helps Metagross break through Pokemon that would otherwise be able to survive its attack, as it doesn't have the option of changing to a different move without switching out. Metagross appreciates cleric and Wish support from Pokemon such as Florges or Vaporeon, due to its vulnerability to status moves and its lack of recovery.

Other Options
########

Metagross can utilize a Choice Scarf + Trick set, since it will almost always get the Trick off before the enemy moves. Such a set lacks the offensive power of the Choice Band set, though. Pursuit can be used to help Metagross hit Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon as they switch out, thought it doesn't deal much reliable damage otherwise. Ice Punch can be used to deal massive damage to Gligar, which does a solid job of taking all of Metagross's attacks otherwise. Explosion is an option on the Choice Band set for a huge surprise factor, being able to heavily dent anything that does not resist it.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Water-types**: Unless Metagross is running Grass Knot, Water-type Pokemon can be very difficult to dispose of. In a tier riddled with the likes of Blastoise, Swampert, Suicune, and Quagsire, Water-type Pokemon can be a serious problem for Metagross.

**Ground-types**: Considering Metagross's weakness to Ground-type moves, it must watch out for these, as it has no solid means of taking out Ground-type Pokemon. Also considering its low Special Defense, it is especially weak to Nidoking's and Nidoqueen's Earth Power, although these Pokemon can't take an Earthquake.

**Fire-types**: Although Metagross has Earthquake, which can hit most Fire-types hard, it is outsped and takes a lot of damage from almost all of them. Rotom-H is especially a problem, as it is immune to Earthquake.

**Knock Off**: Although Metagross can defeat some Knock Off users rather quickly, they still provide the initial threat of both super effective damage through the use of Knock Off and the removal of an item, which is generally detrimental to Metagross.
