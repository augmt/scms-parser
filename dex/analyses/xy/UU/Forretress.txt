Overview
########
Forretress benefits from great 140 Defense that lets it serve as the mainstream physical sponge to the majority of the tier and it also has access to Rapid Spin. It also comes with two handy abilities: Sturdy ensures that Forretress will survive any one hit while Overcoat protects it from powder moves and hail damage. Forretress's main role is to serve as an entry hazard stacker and spinner. Having access to Volt Switch also allows Forretress to serve as a slow defensive pivot that helps retain momentum. Forretress's usable base 90 Attack allows for a decent-hitting Gyro Ball, letting it to take on some fast and frail threats. Unfortunately, poor attacking options make it setup bait, and its poor base 60 Special Defense does not aid in helping Forretress do its main jobs.


Defensive Pivot Rapin Spin
########
name: Defensive Pivot Rapid Spin
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Stealth Rock / Spikes
move 3: Volt Switch
move 4: Gyro Ball / Toxic
ability: Sturdy / Overcoat
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Relaxed

Moves
========
First and foremost, Forretress's job is to use Rapid Spin and keep entry hazards off your side of the field. The choice of entry hazard is team-dependent; if another Pokemon has Stealth Rock, you should run Spikes and set up dual entry hazards. Volt Switch turns Forretress into a defensive pivot by retaining momentum against switch-ins. The choice between Gyro Ball and Toxic is preference; Gyro Ball lets Forretress take on fast Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mienshao, Alakazam, Crobat, and Whimsicott, while Toxic cripples most of Forretress's common switch-ins, including Swampert and Vaporeon.

Set Details
========

Leftovers ensures longevity and passive recovery. Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Forretress to maximize its defensive bulk. An alternate spread of 244 SpD EVs allows Forretress to switch in against a few extra specially bulky Pokemon such as Swampert, Florges, and Vaporeon and make entry hazard stacking or spinning a little easier. An Attack-lowering nature and 0 Attack IVs help against Foul Play, while a Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs should be used if one opts for Gyro Ball. Sturdy guarantees that Forretress will be able to use Rapid Spin or Volt Switch or set up entry hazards, assuming it is at full HP. Alternatively, Overcoat allows Forretress to work around threats such as Roserade and other powder users.

Usage Tips
========

Try to avoid using Forretress as a lead. Instead, use it to take hits from a variety of strong physical attackers such as Choice Scarf Mienshao. As a defensive pivot, it benefits from Wish support to help utilize its "sponge and switch" tactics. Once you've done your job with Forretress, it is okay to use it as death fodder. Forretress does not work with every team; a defensive pivot with spinning capabilities is not particularly useful on hyper offense. Normally, you'll want to run Forretress on balanced teams that can provide a synergistic relationship between spinning and Wish support. This set's Toxic allows you to apply pressure to Hippowdon, Donphan, and Swampert. Essentially, Forretress applies Toxic pressure on almost any Pokemon that chooses to switch in expecting entry hazards. Most notably, Baton Pass Vaporeon and Swampert hate being Toxic poisoned.


Team Options
========

This set works extremely well with bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon or Suicune, and it appreciates additional utility support from pivots such as Gligar or Crobat. Slow Volt Switch works well with wallbreakers and stallbreakers, such as Mienshao, Darmanitan, and Hydreigon. Forretress works well with fast Taunt users that can help prevent opposing Pokemon from setting up entry hazards. It also appreciates Pokemon such as Krookodile that can take care of spinblockers. Forretress is perfectly suited for balanced teams, well-suited for bulky offense, and decently suited on semistall teams.

Custap
########
name: Custap
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Explosion
move 3: Spikes / Toxic Spikes
move 4: Rapid Spin / Gyro Ball
ability: Sturdy
item: Custap Berry
evs: 252 Atk / 252 Spe
ivs: 0 HP / 0 Def / 0 SpD
nature: Hasty / Lonely

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is a great entry hazard that damages all types of Pokemon. Explosion allows Forretress to get off a lot of damage on foes as well as prevent slower Pokemon from using Rapid Spin or Defog that turn, and it works well in conjunction with Custap Berry. Spikes is another amazing entry hazard that damages grounded foes and works great for wearing down walls, as it doesn't account for typing, unlike Stealth Rock. Toxic Spikes can also be used to wear down walls, as they don't appreciate being poisoned upon switching in. Rapid Spin allows Forretress to remove entry hazards for its teammates. On the other hand, Gyro Ball allows Forretress to beat quicker suicide leads, such as Azelf and Aerodactyl.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack EVs allow Forretress to hit as hard as possible with Explosion and Gyro Ball, while maximum Speed EVs allow Hasty Forretress to outspeed everything up to uninvested Blastoise and everything up to uninvested base 65 Speed Pokemon with a Lonely nature. While a Hasty nature does allow Forretress to hit a more significant Speed benchmark, a Lonely nature allows Forretress to hit harder with Explosion and Gyro Ball. Both natures are used with minimum HP, Defense, and Special Defense IVs to ensure Forretress gets knocked down to Sturdy or Custap Berry range as easily as possible. Custap Berry is used as the item to allow Forretress to outspeed foes using moves in the same priority bracket and either hit them with a powerful Explosion or Gyro Ball, set an entry hazard, or use Rapid Spin to remove opposing entry hazards for its teammates before Forretress is KOed.

Usage Tips
========

This set should be used as a suicide lead on offensive teams most of the time, as it is able to set entry hazards, prevent their removal, and explode to bring it in its teammates safely. Should a potential Rapid Spin or Defog user attempt to remove entry hazards against Forretress, keep setting entry hazards until Forretress is knocked into range of Custap Berry and proceed to use Explosion to ensure the preservation of any hazards Forretress has previously set.

Team Options
========

Offensive Pokemon, such as Lucario, Infernape, and Entei, capitalize on Forretress's ability to successfully set up entry hazards which weaken their checks and counters, making them good teammates. Mega Aerodactyl is a particularly good teammate to Forretress, as it is able to threaten every Defog user in the tier. Ghost-types, such as Doublade and Chandelure, also make for good teammates, as they are immune to Rapid Spin.


Other Options
########

Toxic Spikes is a rarely used option due to the plethora of Defog users and Poison-types; however, it is still an option if one opts to use it. An alternate spread of 80 or 120 Attack EVs can be used for harder hitting Gyro Balls on the defensive set. One can opt to use Earthquake in order to hit Fire-types on the switch. Counter can also be utilized with Sturdy on the defensive spread in order to better take on Haxorus, Machamp, and other bulky physical attackers; however, Gyro Ball is generally the superior option against Mega Aerodactyl and frail attackers. On the Custap set, a bulkier EV spread of 252 Atk / 252 Def along with 0 Special Defense IVs can be used to ensure Forretress takes on physical attackers well while still easily getting put into Custap Berry range.


Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Water-types** Forretress hates Scald users, notably defog Empoleon, but will be able to do its job with the right support.

**Fire-types** All Fire-types, notably Chandelure, Entei, and Arcanine, give Forretress trouble. Pokemon such as Noivern or Hydreigon, that have access to common Fire-type moves, also cause grief for Forretress.

**Taunt Users** Taunt users shut Forretress down, as they prevent it from setting up entry hazards.

**Setup Sweepers** Suicune and most bulky setup sweepers, as well as Substitute + Calm Mind users such as Raikou and Jirachi, will be able to set up on Forretress.

**Magic Bounce** Espeon or Xatu bounce back Forretress's entry hazards.

**Trick Users** Forretress needs to anticipate Choiced Trick users, such as Jirachi, that like to cripple it.

**Spinblockers** Though UU doesn't have a plethora of Ghost-types to choose from, the occasional Jellicent and the common switch-in Chandelure will pose a problem for Forretress.
