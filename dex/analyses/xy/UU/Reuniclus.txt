Overview
########

Once a force to be reckoned with in the early stages of Black and White, Reuniclus now finds itself in RU in XY. However, that does not stop it from being effective in UU as well. With a massive base 125 Special Attack stat, access to Magic Guard, and relatively decent bulk to boot, one can see why Reuniclus is such an effective attacker. However, its miniscule Speed and weaknesses to the common Dark- and Bug-types make Reuniclus vulnerable to common UU threats such as Hydreigon, Mega Houndoom, and Yanmega. With access to Trick Room and Calm Mind, Reuniclus is able to hold its own in the Underused environment as an effective clean-up sweeper.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Psyshock / Psychic
move 3: Focus Blast / Shadow Ball
move 4: Recover
ability: Magic Guard
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Calm Mind is the name of the game. Reuniclus sets up a few of them and it's on its way to a sweep. Psyshock and Psychic are its primary STAB moves; Psyshock being more useful as it helps win Calm Mind wars with other Calm Mind users such as Suicune and it allows Reuniclus to hit special walls such as Florges much harder. Psychic has its benefit in having more Base Power than Psyshock and hitting physical walls such as Hippowdon harder than Psyshock. Focus Blast is its primary coverage move, hitting most Pokemon that Psychic cannot do much to. Running Focus Blast can leave it vulnerable to other Psychic-types like Slowking or other Reuniclus, and Sableye, so Shadow Ball should be considered as an alternative coverage move. Recover serves as reliable recovery, allowing it to remain healthy while it sets up Calm Minds.

Set Details
========

For this set, maximizing HP and Defense is ideal as Reuniclus is going to want to tank as many hits as possible so it can set up Calm Minds without much hassle. With access to Recover, Reuniclus has the ability to heal off any damage taken and when used in conjunction with Leftovers, Reuniclus is going to stick around for a while and will be able to use Calm Mind effectively. Alternatively, Reuniclus can utilize Life Orb over Leftovers to deal extra damage without recoil due to Magic Guard.

Usage Tips
========

When using Calm Mind Reuniclus, it's in your best interest to get rid of strong Dark- and Bug-type Pokemon before it starts to set up. They will do devastating damage to Reuniclus before it even gets a chance to attack back or start boosting with Calm Mind, so getting those out of the way will help it out tremendously. Once those are gone, Reuniclus will want to set up on Pokemon that will not 2HKO it as you Calm Mind up. Setting up on bulky, defensive Pokemon is the way to go.
This set shines brightest on balanced and stall teams. Using Calm Mind Reuniclus on offense would be very ill-advised as it is just too slow and just simply does not fit on such a team. Hazard support can very beneficial for Reuniclus as it helps wear down the Bug- and Dark-types that it dreads. Once Reuniclus starts to set up Calm Minds, it will probably be forcing switches, and if entry hazards are set up, whatever comes in will be taking entry hazard damage as it attempts to attack or phaze Reuniclus out.

Team Options
========

As previously mentioned, this particular set is best on balanced and stall teams. Having teammates that handle Dark- and Bug-types are necessary. Florges and Chesnaught cover the Dark-type weakness and provide Wish, Leech Seed, or Spikes support. Next, it's going to want teammates which can come in on Bug-types. Nidoqueen, Forretress, and Crobat can all take Bug-type attacks with ease while providing team support with entry hazards or Defog.

Trick Room
########
name: Trick Room
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Psyshock / Psychic
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Shadow Ball
ability: Magic Guard
item: Life Orb
evs: 192 HP / 64 Def / 252 SpA
nature: Quiet

Moves
========

Trick Room is what this set is about; being able to essentially make Reuniclus the fastest Pokemon on the field. Like the Calm Mind set, Psyshock and Psychic are its primary STAB moves, with Psyshock being the predominant STAB attack. In the case of this set, Psyshock is better as it allows Reuniclus to hit special walls such as Florges harder. Focus Blast hits most Pokemon that Psychic cannot deal much to, namely Steel- and Dark-types. Lastly, Shadow Ball rounds out the set, allowing Reuniclus to hit Psychic-types like Slowking and Celebi for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

For this set, maximizing Special Attack is the way to go. With Magic Guard and Life Orb, Reuniclus is going to unleash a world of hurt upon anything that wishes to tackle it. With a Quiet nature, Reuniclus becomes both stronger in Special Attack and slower in Speed, which is ideal for this set. You will want to set Reuniclus's Speed IV to 0 so it is even faster under Trick Room. The remaining EVs are put into Reuniclus's HP and Defense to help it take a hit before it sets up Trick Room.

Usage Tips
========

Trick Room Reuniclus is best used as a late-game sweeper. Once the opposition is weakened, it can come in and clean up. When Reuniclus comes in, it is best to set up Trick Room as soon as possible. Without Recover or Leftovers, Reuniclus will not be lasting long, so getting Trick Room up quickly is in its best interest. Also, when it is trying to set up Trick Room, it is best to not set up against something that can severely threaten Reuniclus as it risks the possibility of getting KOed.

Team Options
========

As stated before, Reuniclus is extremely threatened by Dark- and Bug-types, so having teammates which can handle these threats is ideal. Hydreigon, as well as other Dark-types like Mega Houndoom, and Fighting-types can come in on incoming Dark-type attacks and can retaliate with their own STAB attacks. Bug-types can be handled by Poison-type Pokemon like Nidoking, Fire-type Pokemon like Arcanine, Darmanitan, or Infernape, or Rock-types like Mega Aerodactyl. Escavalier is a good partner for this set as it can abuse Trick Room along with Reuniclus and can proceed to punch holes in the opponent's defense. Offensive entry hazard users like Azelf or Froslass are good teammates as they help whittle down the opposition, which helps Reuniclus in sweeping under Trick Room.

Other Options
########

Other than the sets listed, there is not much else that is viable on Reuniclus. There's the possibility of a Choice Specs set, which sounds decent on paper but is rather impractical. One can use Thunder Wave to catch an incoming threat and cripple it with status, but there are better users of Thunder Wave such as Slowking or Jirachi. Regenerator can be a nifty ability for Reuniclus, being able to gain HP upon switching out, but is ultimately inferior to Magic Guard. Lastly, on the Calm Mind set, one can run 164 Special Attack EVs and Life Orb for more damage output while retaining a reasonable amount of bulk.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dark-types**: Hydreigon, Mega Houndoom, Honchkrow, Sharpedo, Umbreon, and Krookodile can all do tons of damage to Reuniclus with their STAB moves.

**Bug-types**: Escavalier, Vivillon, Galvantula, and Durant all threaten Reuniclus with strong, STAB Bug-type attacks. Since Reuniclus cannot afford to stay in against them, most of them can set up as Reuniclus switches out and deal damage to the player's team.

**Sableye**: Due to its lackluster Speed, Reuniclus is very vulnerable to Taunt users. Sableye can easily come in and use Taunt, then proceed to Knock Off and whittle Reuniclus down until it faints.

**Chandelure**: Life Orb and Choice Specs sets for Chandelure can OHKO Reuniclus with relative ease. Choice Scarf sets can still do a ton of damage with Shadow Ball.
