Overview
########

Mega Pidgeot has a respectable base 121 Speed stat that allows it to become an ideal special wallbreaker and revenge killer. After Mega Evolving, it becomes faster than Azelf, Alakazam, Mienshao, and other common offensive Pokemon. Decent offensive coverage in Hurricane and Heat Wave, alongside its ability No Guard, means Mega Pidgeot is one of the most reliable special wallbreakers in the tier. Mega Pidgeot also has above-average longevity, despite its Stealth Rock weakness, due to its access to Roost. Unfortunately, Mega Pidgeot suffers from a rather lacking movepool, which means that it struggles against Electric- and Rock-type Pokemon. Furthermore, a slightly poor defensive typing means that Mega Pidgeot is prone to being revenge killed by powerful Choice Scarf users such as Mienshao.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Hurricane
move 2: Heat Wave
move 3: Roost
move 4: U-turn / Substitute
ability: Keen Eye
item: Pidgeotite
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Hurricane is an incredibly reliable and powerful STAB move that hits the entire tier for moderate-to-large damage, bar resists. Hurricane's 30% confusion rate also adds to Mega Pidgeot's overall viability as a wallbreaker. Heat Wave offers good synergy with Hurricane, hitting Steel-types such as Mega Aggron for super effective damage. Refresh is another option, allowing Mega Pidgeot to work around Toxic stall and paralysis. Roost adds to Mega Pidgeot's longevity and is especially useful for mitigating Stealth Rock damage. U-turn is a useful scouting move, especially when predicting a switch, as this allows Mega Pidgeot to retain momentum for its teammates. Work Up increases Mega Pidgeot's already huge Special Attack to insane levels, hitting as hard as a Choice Specs set after one boost. Lastly, Substitute is a valid option that allows Mega Pidgeot to get two hits on a switch-in, whereas it would otherwise only get one.

Set Details
========

252 Special Attack EVs give Mega Pidgeot as much wallbreaking power as possible, creating many 2HKO opportunities. 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature let Mega Pidgeot outspeed all base 120 Speed Pokemon, including huge threats such as Alakazam. No Guard gives Hurricane and Heat Wave perfect accuracy, alleviating the need for predicting; however, all incoming attacks will also have perfect accuracy, including moves such as Stone Edge, which Mega Pidgeot is extremely weak to.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Pidgeot is best used as a special wallbreaker and late-game cleaner. Bring Mega Pidgeot in on a good matchup and proceed to wallbreak or set up a Substitute as you force the switch. Use U-turn to switch out of counters such as Blissey and Rhyperior.

Team Options
========

Mega Pidgeot may not be very versatile, but it is very decent at what it does, especially with proper teammate support. Mega Pidgeot fits well with a physical wallbreaker such as Machamp or Mienshao that can deal with the special walls that stop Mega Pidgeot. Mega Pidgeot also appreciates entry hazard support to turn some 3HKOs into 2HKOs against Pokemon such as defensive Vaporeon. Defog and Rapid Spin support help keep Mega Pidgeot healthy for the mid- and late-game sweep.

Work Up Stallbreaker
########
name: Work Up Stallbreaker
move 1: Hurricane
move 2: Work Up
move 3: Roost
move 4: Refresh / Substitute
ability: Keen Eye
item: Pidgeotite
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

As is the case with the conventional Special Attacker Set, Hurricane is an incredibly reliable and powerful STAB move, hitting the entire tier for moderate-to-large damage, bar resists. Hurricane's 30% confusion rate also adds to its overall viability as a wallbreaker in the same fashion. Roost increases Mega Pidgeot's longevity, especially against Stealth Rock damage. Work Up allows Mega Pidgeot to hit as hard as a Choice Specs set after one boost. Refresh allows Mega Pidgeot to work around Toxic stall and paralysis while Substitute allows Mega Pidgeot to get two hits on a switch in where it would normally get none as well as preventing Mega Pidgeot from getting revenge killed.

Set Details
========

Again, 252 Special Attack EVs give Mega Pidgeot as much wallbreaking power as possible, creating many 2HKO opportunities. 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature let Mega Pidgeot outspeed all base 120 Speed Pokemon, including huge threats such as Alakazam. No Guard gives Hurricane and Heat Wave perfect accuracy, alleviating the need for predicting; however, all incoming attacks will also have perfect accuracy.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Pidgeot is best used as a setup stallbreaker and special wallbreaker. Bring Mega Pidgeot in when it has a good chance of surviving and proceed to wallbreak or set up a Work Up or Substitute as you force the switch. With Refresh, it can take on almost any stall playstyle. Be careful when using Work Up against Foul Play users such as Umbreon, as the Attack boost can increase the damage that Foul Play users can inflict.

Team Options
========

Like the Special Attacker variant, Mega Pidgeot fits well with a physical wallbreaker such as Machamp or Mienshao that can deal with the special walls that stop Mega Pidgeot. Mega Pidgeot also appreciates entry hazard support to turn some 3HKOs into 2HKOs against Pokemon such as defensive Vaporeon. Defog and Rapid Spin support help keeps Mega Pidgeot healthy for a good chance at a sweep.

Other Options
########

Tailwind increases Pidgeot's sweeping potential against offense and allows it to support strong Pokemon such as Haxorus so that can clean up with ease. Feather Dance is an interesting option, allowing Pidgeot to go toe-to-toe against some fearsome physical attackers. Defog allows Pidgeot to remove entry hazards off the field, but that job is usually better left for other Pokemon, such as Crobat, Empoleon, or Gligar. Whirlwind can be used for phazing and preventing Wish users such as Florges and Umbreon from recovering. Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Water can be used to answer Ground- and Rock-type switch-ins.

Checks & Counters
########

**Electric-types**: Rotom-H and Mega Ampharos can beat Mega Pidgeot with their strong Electric-type STAB moves and excellent special bulk.

**Rock-types**: Mega Aerodactyl and Rhyperior will counter and OHKO Mega Pidgeot with their powerful STAB moves, which Mega Pidgeot is extremely susceptible to.

**Dedicated Special Walls**: Florges, Umbreon, Blissey, and Vaporeon cause massive problems for Mega Pidgeot, as it will usually be unable to wallbreak against them with Hurricane.

**Choice Scarf users and faster Pokemon**: Mienshao and Darmanitan are notable examples of Choice Scarf users that can OHKO Mega Pidgeot. Crobat and Noivern also cause Mega Pidgeot some trouble with their powerful STAB moves.

**Special Tanks**: Snorlax and Empoleon pose a significant threat to Mega Pidgeot by being able to survive Hurricane and severely crippling Mega Pidgeot in return.
