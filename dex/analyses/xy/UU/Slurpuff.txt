Overview
########

Slurpuff is one of the most deadly sweepers in the XY UU metagame&mdash;if it can set up. Herein lies the problem with Slurpuff, namely that it requires a tremendous amount of team support to set up, both in regards to luring certain Pokemon out and keeping entry hazards off the field. However, given the proper support, once Slurpuff uses Belly Drum, there are very few Pokemon in the metagame that can stand up to a +6 Slurpuff. Given its ability Unburden, it's also able to outspeed all the major Choice Scarf users. Furthermore, Slurpuff has other setup options such as Calm Mind and Cotton Guard, which adds to its versatility and bulk. Though Slurpuff has very good typing (which allows it to set up on the ever-so-common Hydreigon), Slurpuff is quite frail. This can make setting up quite difficult, especially if hazards are on the field. All in all, there are only a select number of scenarios in which Slurpuff can set up, which makes it a very situational Pokemon to use when teambuilding.

Belly Drum
########
name: Belly Drum
move 1: Belly Drum
move 2: Play Rough
move 3: Return
move 4: Substitute
ability: Unburden
item: Sitrus Berry
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Belly Drum is the bread and butter of this set, as it maximizes Slurpuff's Attack while also activating its Sitrus Berry. Once Slurpuff's Sitrus Berry is activated, it is able to outspeed all the common Choice Scarf users thanks to its ability, Unburden. Play Rough is Slurpuff's most powerful attack, as it is its only STAB option. This move isn't used for its ability to hit super effectively, but rather as further coverage in a limited movepool. Adding onto this, Return gives Slurpuff the ability to hit most Pokemon in the metagame for at least neutral damage. However, even at +6, a number of Steel-types can still withstand an attack and OHKO back. In the last slot, Substitute is useful in reducing mindgames with the opponent. Instead of deciding whether the opponent will switch out, use a status move, or attack, using Substitute will allow Slurpuff to safely get its Belly Drum off if the opportunity arises. Lastly, Substitute is helpful when dealing with Sucker Punch users. Even though Slurpuff resists Dark-type attacks, Slurpuff is frail and generally has low HP by the time the Sucker Punch user comes in.

Set Details
========

As a sweeper, the EV spread for Belly Drum Slurpuff is fairly standard, maximizing both Attack and Speed. Though at first glance one would assume more bulk may be helpful, all of the Speed as well as a Jolly nature are needed to outspeed Choice Scarf Mienshao. An Adamant nature can be used if Choice Scarf Mienshao isn't an issue, however. 4 HP EVs give Slurpuff an even amount of Hit Points, which allows Sitrus Berry to activate immediately after a Belly Drum. However, if Slurpuff's main goal is to break through opposing walls, then an Adamant nature is usable. In that case, Slurpuff would mainly be breaking through Steel-types, as Slurpuff OHKOes the majority of the metagame after a Belly Drum.

Usage Tips
========

Despite having a very useful array of resistances, Belly Drum Slurpuff is still a very fragile set that requires every Hit Point to set up and sweep. For this reason, try to avoid switching Slurpuff directly into any attack, as setting up Slurpuff without full health is very difficult. As it is very difficult to set up, it is essential that Slurpuff sets up at the correct moment. Due to the nature of Sitrus Berry, Slurpuff only has one shot at sweeping the opposing team. Though sweeping the entire opposing team is always what Slurpuff should aim for, if Slurpuff breaks an opposing wall for another member of the team to sweep, then the opportunity should be taken. In order to set up with Slurpuff, it's often useful to play the game out to lure in Pokemon that Slurpuff can set up on. Hydreigon is a perfect example of a Pokemon that is setup bait for Belly Drum. In this case, luring out Hydreigon with Mega Houndoom paves the way for a sweep. Sacrificing one Pokemon to allow Slurpuff a chance to set up is the epitome of playstyle needed for this juggernaut of a sweeper.

Team Options
========

With how fragile Slurpuff is, dual screen and Memento users are extremely useful in aiding a Belly Drum sweep. Specifically, Azelf is able to set up Reflect and Light Screen while also luring in Hydreigon. Fire-types make good offensive partners to Slurpuff, as they can also lure in Hydreigon; Mega Houndoom does this perfectly, as it forces the opponent to send in not only Hydreigon, but also Florges (both of which Slurpuff can set up on). Some other Pokemon that do this job similarly are Chandelure, Krookodile, and Honchkrow. Defog or Rapid Spin users are helpful, as it is difficult enough for Slurpuff to set up at full health&mdash;Toxic Spikes makes sweeping nearly impossible or at least short-lived. Lastly, Dugtrio is helpful to trap common Steel-types such as Metagross and Jirachi.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Draining Kiss
move 3: Flamethrower
move 4: Surf / Rest
ability: Unburden
item: Sitrus Berry / Chesto Berry
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Calm Mind is the core of the set, allowing Slurpuff to boost its Special Defense and Special Attack. This combination of bulk and offensive boosts allows it to topple more bulky teams with ease. Draining Kiss is the preferred STAB option, which is Slurpuff's strongest move outside of Dazzling Gleam. Though Dazzling Gleam does seem like a legitimate option, the Calm Mind set is sure to be taking a couple of attacks, which does not bode well for a Pokemon with no recovery. Flamethrower is used for Steel-types that usually wall Slurpuff, such as Metagross and Jirachi, and Surf is used to hit Nidoking and Nidoqueen while also hitting the dominant Fire-types such as Entei and Darmanitan. This moveset provides the best coverage while also providing a hint of sustainability.

Set Details
========

Though it would seem like a Calm Mind set for Slurpuff would need more bulk, Calm Mind provides all the bulk it needs to demolish balance and stall teams. Maximizing the Speed EVs on Slurpuff allows it to outspeed Honchkrow before the Unburden boost. After Unburden activates, this spread ties with Choice Scarf Hydreigon; though Slurpuff does perfectly fine against Hydreigon, the added benefit of outspeeding it is helpful in pinch situations. Maximizing Slurpuff's Special Attack and giving it a Modest nature works well with Draining Kiss, which allows it to recover a very healthy number of Hit Points. Especially because this set prefers Draining Kiss over Dazzling Gleam, a Modest nature is appreciated. A Timid nature isn't really needed, as the extra Speed is negligible.

Usage Tips
========

Much like the Belly Drum set, the Calm Mind set is quite frail before the boosts. For this reason, Slurpuff still needs to set up on the correct types of Pokemon. Luring in Hydreigon, Florges, or anything not able to heavily damage Slurpuff is essential. Moreover, since Sitrus Berry is a one-time item, picking and choosing the correct moment to set up is important. Predicting switch-ins like Nidoqueen and Nidoking is much more important for the Calm Mind set, as it doesn't have a way to automatically activate its Berry like the Belly Drum set. Lastly, when low on health, using Draining Kiss is helpful to gain Hit Points back. This decision needs to be weighed with getting damage on key Pokemon on the opponent's team.

Team Options
========

Being quite frail, dual screens and Memento users are extremely useful before setting up with Calm Mind. One of the best partners to Slurpuff that utilize this strategy is Azelf, which usually lures in Hydreigon; as Slurpuff easily sets up on Hydreigon, it is a perfect bait. As Calm Mind Slurpuff easily defeats most balance and stall teams, a team centered around defeating offensive or more fast-paced teams is ideal. As always, luring in the Pokemon that Slurpuff easily sets up on is recommended. Once again, Mega Houndoom makes a great partner as it lures in Pokemon that Slurpuff can set up on. Defog or Rapid Spin users are even more helpful for this set, as Toxic Spikes will completely deny a sweep. As the Calm Mind set lacks upfront power, entry hazard control is even more important.

Other Options
########

A Substitute + Endeavor set is quite deadly to bulkier teams, but it is quite susceptible to priority and still very difficult to set up. Aromatherapy is useful for setting up on defensive Pokemon such as Slowking, but Slurpuff will be hard-pressed in finding the time to use it&mdash;it's difficult enough to  get off a Belly Drum, let alone a clerical move. It also provides the option of providing support for the team, but Slurpuff is a sweeper, not a defensive wall. Flamethrower on the Belly Drum set lures in and KOes Forretress, but Slurpuff then loses out on blocking status and Sucker Punch with Substitute. Psychic is usable on the Calm Mind set for Toxicroak, but Slurpuff then loses coverage against Fire-types like Victini and Darmanitan. A bulky support set with Wish and Aromatherapy is an option, but it is heavily outclassed by other special walls in the metagame such as Florges and Umbreon. Cotton Guard and Calm Mind in the same set is viable, but Slurpuff then loses important coverage again; however, it does make it easier to set up and sustain a sweep. Substitute and Thunderbolt are usable on the Calm Mind set to block status and provide more coverage for Water-types, respectively.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Mega Aggron, Jirachi, Forretress, and Metagross are able to survive a +6 Play Rough and OHKO Slurpuff in return. However, Forretress is OHKOed by Flamethrower. The Calm Mind set only has to worry about Steel-types until it has enough boosts to OHKO them.

**Hippowdon**: Physically defensive Hippowdon survives a fully boosted Play Rough and is able to either use Earthquake or phaze with Whirlwind. Keep in mind that Hippowdon will be severely weakened after this, though.

**Defensive Arcanine**: Arcanine resists Play Rough and weakens Slurpuff with Intimidate. Furthermore, Extreme Speed is very dangerous once Slurpuff has been weakened from Belly Drum.

**Offensive Pressure**: Providing heavy offensive pressure, without the use of Hydreigon, renders Slurpuff fairly useless. Throw in entry hazards and it makes setting up with Slurpuff very difficult. Toxic Spikes ensures the Calm Mind set will never set up.

**Nidoking and Nidoqueen**: Both Nidoqueen and Nidoking are able to pressure and KO the Calm Mind set, but they need to be wary of Surf.
