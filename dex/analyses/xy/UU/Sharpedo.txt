Overview
########

Mega Sharpedo hits obscenely hard with a Strong Jaw-boosted Crunch and has good coverage. Mega Sharpedo has slightly increased bulk, which lets it take some priority attacks such as Extreme Speed. Unfortunately, it still has to give up a moveslot for Protect to attain a Speed boost before Mega Evolving. Sharpedo and its Mega Evolution are still somewhat reliant on prior damage and entry hazard support in order to secure OHKOs, and, unfortunately, being extremely weak to most priority moves can sometimes prevent a late-game sweep.

Mega Chomp
########
name: Mega Chomp
move 1: Protect
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Hydro Pump / Waterfall
move 4: Ice Fang
ability: Speed Boost
item: Sharpedoite
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Protect is used so that Sharpedo can get a Speed boost safely before Mega Evolving, and it also lets Sharpedo scout the foe's moveset. Crunch is Mega Sharpedo's main STAB move and hits for a lot of damage thanks to Strong Jaw. Hydro Pump is used to deal more damage to physical walls, such as Hippowdon and Donphan, than Waterfall does. Waterfall can be used so that Sharpedo has a chance to flinch slower Pokemon, and it lets Sharpedo run a nature that doesn't lower its defenses. Ice Fang is used to hit Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Salamence, which can both tank Sharpedo's attacks with little trouble.

Set Details
========

The listed EV spread maximizes Sharpedo's Attack and Speed. A Naughty or Naive nature is used with Hydro Pump so that Sharpedo can attack with both offensive stats while lowering its least useful defensive stat. An Adamant or Jolly nature is used with Waterfall, as Sharpedo's Special Attack is then irrelevent. Jolly and Naive natures deserve special mention, as it is fairly important to outspeed or Speed tie most Choice Scarf users at +1 because Mega Sharpedo is by no means guaranteed to get to +2.

Usage Tips
========

If facing slower teams, Sharpedo should Mega Evolve immediately so that it can punch holes in the opposing team as soon as possible, as it does not need the Speed boost. Against more offensive teams, it should use Protect if it is trying to clean late-game so it can outspeed slower Choice Scarf users before Mega Evolving. In some cases, Sharpedo might need to force the switch and then Protect, or go for the double Protect before Mega Evolving if the opponent has a faster Choice Scarf user, such as Infernape, on their team. Mega Sharpedo only has one chance to sweep because Mega Evolving removes Speed Boost, so it should not be brought in unless it has a very good chance of sweeping.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support helps Sharpedo in wallbreaking and cleaning, so Hippowdon, Swampert, Chesnaught, Froslass, and Roserade all are all good partners. Entry hazards wear down Mega Aggron, Florges, Empoleon, and Forretress, all of which give Sharpedo trouble, and turns some 2HKOs into OHKOs against Pokemon such as Nidoqueen. Toxic Spikes works well with Protect to get Pokemon down to KO range. Because Sharpedo is best used with entry hazards, pairing it with spinblockers such as Chandelure and Froslass or fast Taunt users such as Crobat or Azelf benefit it greatly. Pivots that have access to Volt Switch, U-turn, or Baton Pass, such as Forretress, Heliolisk, and Gligar, all make for good partners, as they can get Sharpedo in safely. In particular, Swords Dance + Baton Pass Gligar sets make Mega Sharpedo an extremely potent offensive threat. If opting to use a Speed-boosting nature, Sharpedo should partner up with good entry hazard stackers, to ensure that it's able to clean up at the end of the game, as the power decrease is noticeable.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Protect
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Waterfall
move 4: Ice Beam / Destiny Bond
ability: Speed Boost
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 12 SpA / 244 Spe
nature: Naughty

Moves
========

Protect is used to get a Speed boost without taking damage and also scouts the foe's moveset. Crunch offers excellent offensive synergy with Waterfall. Waterfall uses Sharpedo's Speed boosts to try to get a flinch, and also has good coverage, hitting the plethora of Fire- and Ground-types in the tier for super effective damage. Ice Beam is used to hit Pokemon such as Chesnaught, Hydreigon, and Salamence super effectively. Lastly, Destiny Bond can be used as a last-ditch effort to score an extra KO against a threat.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread is used to maximize Sharpedo's Attack and outspeed Adamant variants of Choice Scarf Krookodile, with the rest of the EVs dumped into Special Attack so that Sharpedo can hit Chesnaught, Hydreigon, and Toxicroak for as much damage as possible. Life Orb is used to increase its damage output. A Naughty nature is used to increase Sharpedo's Attack stat without lowering its Special Attack and is used over Lonely so Sharpedo can take less damage from priority attacks, although Mach Punch from any notable Pokemon still OHKOes Sharpedo. Lastly, if Ice Beam is not used, opt for an Adamant or Jolly nature.

Usage Tips
========

Sharpedo should be saved until late-game, when the opposing team's Pokemon have been weakened, as it usually needs a fair amount of prior damage to clean. Sharpedo should not be switched in at any cost, as it takes a lot even from resisted hits due to its terrible defenses. Ultimately, Sharpedo appreciates the removal of priority users so that it can clean late-game uninterrupted.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Forretress, Froslass, Swampert, Chesnaught, Hippowdon, and Mega Aggron is appreciated, as it wears down Pokemon that try to switch into Sharpedo, making it easier for Sharpedo to clean late-game. Entry hazards wear down Mega Aggron, Florges, Empoleon, and Forretress and turn some 2HKOs into OHKOs against Pokemon such as Nidoqueen. Toxic Spikes works well with Protect to get Pokemon down to KO range. Pivots such as Mega Ampharos, Gligar, and Rotom-H make for good partners, as they can keep up offensive momentum, slowly wear down the opposing team, and bring in Sharpedo safely.

Other Options
########

Aqua Jet can revenge kill weakened Pokemon while stalling for a Speed Boost. Earthquake takes on the many Steel-types in the tier, including Empoleon, Cobalion, and Mega Aggron, but is generally inferior to other options. Zen Headbutt can be useful against Fighting-types such as Heracross, Machamp, Virizion, and the occasional Dragalge. Poison Fang can be used so that Mega Sharpedo has an easier time getting past Fairy-types such as Florges and Aromatisse. Focus Sash can be used alongside Speed Boost, but the power drop is extremely noticeable. Substitute is a notable option against bulky Water-types such as Suicune, as it protects Mega Sharpedo from Scald burns.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Steel-types**: Mega Aggron and Forretress can switch into Mega Sharpedo's moves and beat it one-on-one.

**Revenge Killers**: Mach Punch and Choice Scarf Infernape and Mienshao as well as Vacuum Wave Lucario work around Mega Sharpedo by forcing it to switch or revenge killing it.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-type Pokemon such as Cobalion and Machamp can take a Waterfall and OHKO Mega Sharpedo.

**Bulky Pokemon With Recovery**: Umbreon and Florges can both easily take a Crunch and can work around Mega Sharpedo's other attacks.

**Bulky Water-types**: Suicune, Swampert, and some Empoleon variants apply defensive pressure to regular Sharpedo, forcing it to risk a burn or 3HKO from Suicune's Scald or an OHKO from Swampert and Empoleon; however, Swampert and Empoleon will generally lose to Mega Sharpedo.
