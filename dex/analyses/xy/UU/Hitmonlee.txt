Overview
########

Hitmonlee has an interesting niche in the UU metagame in that it's one of the few Pokemon with access to Unburden, which it can make great use of with its great Attack stat, and good movepool. It also is one of the few offensive spinners in the tier, which is another thing that sets it apart from other Fighting-types, such as Mienshao and Machamp. However, it faces severe competition from them and also has terrible Defense, along with a mediocre Speed stat that lets it get revenge killed fairly easily by the likes of Jirachi. Hitmonlee also has a hard time with Crobat, which is able to switch into it multiple times and force it out. However, Hitmonlee is an interesting pick for a Fighting-type and should be still considered on offensive teams.

Reckless
########
name: Reckless
move 1: High Jump Kick
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Rapid Spin
move 4: Mach Punch
ability: Reckless
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
item: Life Orb
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

High Jump Kick is a hard-hitting STAB move thanks to Life Orb and Reckless, although it's somewhat risky to use due to its miss chance and the massive recoil if it fails to land. Knock Off hits Ghost- and Psychic-types that don't care about High Jump Kick, and can cripple Pokemon reliant on their item. Rapid Spin lets Hitmonlee clear entry hazards, which is one of the things that sets it apart from the likes of Mienshao and Machamp. Mach Punch lets Hitmonlee pick off weakened threats. Sucker Punch can be used to smack Jirachi, which can be a large problem otherwise.

Set Details
========

Reckless is the preferred ability, as it boosts High Jump Kick's power. Life Orb is used to increase Hitmonlee's damage output, and it turns High Jump Kick into an extremely threatening STAB move. The EVs maximize Hitmonlee's Speed and damage output. An Adamant nature is preferred, as with it Hitmonlee still outspeeds Modest Chandelure and 2HKOes physically defensive Hippowdon, whereas Jolly Hitmonlee only has a 32% chance to do this. Jolly lets Hitmonlee outspeed more Pokemon, however.

Usage Tips
========

Hitmonlee can switch into very few physical attacks, due to its terrible bulk. When using Hitmonlee, you should know when to use High Jump Kick; it shouldn't be spammed when there are Pokemon on the other side that are Ghost-types or carry Protect.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate having Stealth Rock cleared, such as Mega Houndoom, Mega Aerodactyl, and Darmanitan, are good partners for Hitmonlee; Darmanitan is able to put a huge dent in the Fairy-types that make Hitmonlee miserable in return. Pokemon that can't get through Steel-types, such as Crobat and Cloyster, are also good partners for Hitmonlee, as they have a much easier time doing their job without Steel-types on the field. Pokemon such as Shaymin and Roserade that can check physical walls are also good partners for Hitmonlee.

Unburden
########
name: Unburden
move 1: Endure
move 2: Reversal
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Mach Punch
ability: Unburden
item: Liechi Berry
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Endure ensures that Hitmonlee's Liechi Berry is activated as soon as possible, letting Hitmonlee get the Unburden boost. At 1 HP, Reversal becomes a 200 BP move, OHKOing virtually anything that doesn't resist it. Knock Off smacks Psychic- and Ghost-types that resist Reversal, such as Chandelure, for super effective damage. Mach Punch is used to punish Pokemon such as Infernape that try to revenge kill Hitmonlee with their own priority, although it usually will not OHKO many Pokemon unless they're weakened by a fair amount or it hits them for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

Hitmonlee's EVs are used to maximize its Attack and Speed. Liechi Berry increases Hitmonlee's Attack, making it a very potent threat when combined with Endure and Unburden. An Adamant nature is used to give Hitmonlee as much power as possible. Due to Unburden, Hitmonlee doesn't need a Speed-boosting nature, as it will already have all the Speed it needs to function.

Usage Tips
========

Hitmonlee should usually be attempting a sweep late-game, when most of its common switch-ins are off the field or are weakened enough to be KOed by Reversal. Hitmonlee should avoid residual damage at all costs, as it will render Endure useless, and thus its sweep short-lived. Hitmonlee should also avoid Pokemon with Extreme Speed, which outprioritizes Mach Punch.

Team Options
========

Hitmonlee appreciates entry hazard support, which makes it easier for Hitmonlee to clean. Froslass is a great partner, as it prevents Toxic Spikes from being set up with Taunt, and it sets up its own hazards easily. Azelf is also a good partner as, like Froslass, it stops opposing setup with Taunt, and can cripple Pokemon dependent on their item early-game with Knock Off. Pokemon that can KO Fairy-types are a godsend for Hitmonlee, as it has a lot of trouble with the likes of Aromatisse and Granbull. Nidoking and Nidoqueen are very good partners, as they can force the aforementioned Fairies out, set up hazards on them, and absorb Toxic Spikes. Pokemon that can take on Sableye, such as Infernape, work well with Hitmonlee, as they can switch into Sableye's Will-O-Wisp and threaten it out. Pokemon that can beat common Flying-types, such as Crobat, are great partners for Hitmonlee. Mega Ampharos counters Crobat and lures in Blissey, which Hitmonlee loves. Mega Ampharos also sponges common priority attacks.

Other Options
########

Stone Edge is an option for Hitmonlee to hit Flying-types such as Crobat and Noivern hard, but it can mostly only hit them on the switch-in, as unless Hitmonlee has an Unburden boost, it will just be revenged by any faster Flying-type. Poison Jab can hit Fairy-types such as Florges and Aromatisse, but Hitmonlee usually doesn't have the room to run it. Close Combat is a more reliable STAB move that doesn't have the risk of missing and Hitmonlee losing half its health, but it doesn't get the damage boost from Reckless that High Jump Kick does. Double-Edge is a move that is surprisingly powerful thanks to Reckless, and it can 2HKO a lot of physical walls that would resist High Jump Kick. However, the recoil is usually too much for Hitmonlee to bear, and you would want it alive as much as possible.


Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Fighting-type Resists**: Pokemon that can repeatedly take attacks from Hitmonlee, heal off any damage, and retaliate easily, such as Aromatisse, Gligar, and Granbull, are very problematic for Hitmonlee, although Gligar hates getting its item Knocked Off.

**Sableye** Sableye can take a Knock Off, burn Hitmonlee with a Prankster Will-O-Wisp, and prevent it from spinning thanks to its typing.

**Faster Pokemon** Pokemon that can tank a Mach Punch and outspeed non-Endure Hitmonlee, such as Alakazam and Crobat, can easily beat it. Most of them must be wary of Knock Off and Stone Edge, however.

**Priority** Hitmonlee despises priority, as it really hates being hit. Pokemon such as Fletchinder, Entei, and Lucario can all bypass Hitmonlee's own priority and severely dent, if not KO, it.
