Overview
########

Snorlax is an underestimated Pokemon in the UnderUsed tier, and it can use this to its advantage as a fantastic win condition and slow wallbreaker. Base 160 HP and 110 Special Defense allow Snorlax to act as a sponge to many threats including Choice Specs Hydreigon. Access to Curse and Rest allows it to become one of the best win conditions in the game after Fighting-types have been dealt with. A great base 110 Attack is ideal for for a Choice Band set, while Assault Vest can be used a to maximize Snorlax's immediate bulk. A fantastic ability in Thick Fat allows it to take on Fire-type and Ice-type attacks with relative ease. Unfortunately, a subpar base 65 Defense stat means Snorlax sometimes needs to shift some EVs towards bulking it up against Pokemon such as Honchkrow or Crobat, and horrid base 30 Speed means you have to rely on sponge-and-attack tactics.

Curselax
########
name: Curselax
move 1: Curse
move 2: Body Slam / Return
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk / Earthquake / Crunch
ability: Thick Fat
item: Leftovers
evs: 144 HP / 188 Def / 176 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Curse sets up Snorlax for a sweep, increasing its Attack and Defense by a stage while lowering its Speed by a stage. Body Slam is Snorlax's primary STAB move with an added 30% chance to paralyze its target. Return is a slightly more powerful option that nabs more 2HKOs against slightly bulkier threats, such as Mega Blastoise, after one Curse boost. Rest provides Snorlax with reliable recovery, and allows it to remain as a win condition. Sleep Talk allows Snorlax to remove some disadvantage of the two-turn sleep by setting up more Curses or using Body Slams. Earthquake is ideal for Steel-types and can hit Ghost-types for neutral damage as well as Chandelure for super effective damage. Crunch targets Ghost-types, as they are immune to Snorlax's STAB moves.

Set Details
========

Curselax's 144 HP / 188 Def EV investment is meant to turn it into a sponge against physical hits after a Curse, as well as let it survive a High Jump Kick from Choice Scarf Mienshao at +2. The remaining 176 Special Defense EVs and a Careful nature allow Curselax to also survive a 2HKO from Mega Blastoise's Aura Sphere. The mixed defensive spread is designed to take on countless other threats as well, including Raikou, Nidoqueen, and Nidoking. Leftovers is used for passive recovery and longevity. Chesto Berry is another option to work alongside Rest. Thick Fat is used to weaken Fire- and Ice-type attacks by 50%, giving Snorlax two added resistances.

Usage Tips
========

It's best to use Snorlax as a mid- and late-game win condition after its threats have been eliminated. Once the opponent sees Leftovers, they'll probably assume a Curse set. Snorlax cannot take on Fighting-types, such as Machamp and Mienshao, at +1 Defense, so it is very important to work around and KO these Fighting-types such that Snorlax has the opportunity to set up. For these reasons, it is generally unwise to use Snorlax as a lead. Snorlax beats almost all other boosting win conditions in the game due to its marvelous Special Defense. For example, CroCune and Substitute + Calm Mind Raikou cannot hope to beat Snorlax one-on-one.

Team Options
========

Snorlax partners well with Crobat, as it can sponge all Fighting-type attacks with complete ease. Alomomola also partners well with Snorlax and Crobat by relieving some pressure of predicting. Snorlax appreciates Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Jirachi, which can dismantle common Taunt users such as Azelf, Hydreigon, or opposing Crobat. Because Snorlax might be put in the position where it has to use Rest prematurely, it appreciates cleric support from Florges, as Florges resists U-turn, resists Fighting-type moves, has Protect for scouting, and has Moonblast to check almost all Fighting-type threats in the UnderUsed metagame.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Return / Body Slam / Double-Edge
move 2: Pursuit / Crunch
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Fire Punch
ability: Thick Fat
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 88 Def / 168 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Return is a powerful STAB option, OHKOing all unresisted frail threats and 2HKOing all moderately bulky threats such as Mega Blastoise. Body Slam is a reliable yet less powerful STAB option with a 30% chance to paralyze. Double-Edge is Snorlax's strongest reliable STAB move, hitting almost 50% harder than Body Slam; however, the recoil damage is problematic. Pursuit is great against Psychic-types as well as Chandelure and other Ghost-types. Crunch is useful in one-on-one situations where the opponent wants to commit with the Ghost- or Psychic-type. Earthquake is a great coverage move, hitting the common UnderUsed Fire-, Electric-, Steel-, and Poison-types for super effective damage. Fire Punch is useful against Forretress and other Bug- and Grass-types, though Return will hit slightly harder than a 2x super effective Fire Punch.

Set Details
========

This set maximizes Attack in order to wallbreak as hard as possible. 88 Defense EVs allow Snorlax to survive a 2HKO from Brave Bird Crobat. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to increase Snorlax's walling potential. Thick Fat is a wonderful ability that weakens Fire- and Ice-type attacks by 50%, giving Snorlax two added resistances. Choice Band further increases Snorlax's Attack by 50%.

Usage Tips
========

Snorlax is a decent wallbreaker that can survive any non-super effective hit. It is particularly useful at dismantling stall with its slow and hard-hitting Returns; however, Snorlax still requires some prediction to use its STAB move when Snorlax's checks and counters are still alive.

Team Options
========

Snorlax really appreciates Crobat as a teammate, as it can sponge all Fighting-type attacks with complete ease. Nidoqueen is another option to check Fighting-types for a more balanced wallbreaking core. Snorlax appreciates Rapid Spin support from Forretress, which can then slow Volt Switch into Snorlax. Snorlax also partners well with Wish + cleric users such as Vaporeon or Florges.

Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Return / Body Slam
move 2: Pursuit / Crunch
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Fire Punch / Crunch
ability: Thick Fat
item: Assault Vest
evs: 252 Atk / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Return is a powerful STAB option, 2HKOing all frailer attackers and doing decent damage to moderately bulky threats such as Mega Blastoise and Crobat. Body Slam is a reliable but less powerful STAB option with a 30% chance to paralyze. Pursuit is great against Psychic-types as well as Chandelure and other Ghost-types. Earthquake is a great coverage move, hitting the common UnderUsed Fire-, Electric-, Steel-, and Poison-types for super effective damage. Fire Punch is useful against Forretress and other Bug- and Grass-types. Crunch is useful in one-on-one situations where the opponent wants to commit with a Ghost- or Psychic-type.

Set Details
========

Assault Vest allows Snorlax to become the perfect special sponge, as the strongest special Fighting move, Focus Blast, is an unreliable move to hit Snorlax with. This set maximizes Attack with an Adamant nature in order to hit as hard as possible. This set also maximizes Snorlax's defensive capabilities, helping it tank physical attacks such as Superpower from Life Orb Hydreigon or Honchkrow. Snorlax's huge base 160 HP and 110 Special Defense allow it to avoid investing in more special bulk or HP, instead investing the EVs into its Defense. Thick Fat is a wonderful ability that weakens Fire- and Ice-type attacks by 50%, giving Snorlax two added resistances, further increasing Snorlax's dependability against Fire-type spam strategies.

Usage Tips
========

Snorlax is a decent wallbreaker that can survive any non-super effective hit. It is best used as a sponge-and-hit tactician. Fundamentally, Snorlax relieves prediction due to Assault Vest, allowing it to use its optimal attacking options.

Team Options
========

Snorlax partners well with Crobat, as it can sponge all Fighting-type attacks with complete ease. Alomomola also partners well with Snorlax and Crobat by relieving some pressure of predicting. Snorlax appreciates cleric support from Florges, as Florges resists U-turn, resists Fighting-type moves, has Protect for scouting, and has Moonblast to check almost all Fighting-type threats in the UnderUsed metagame.

Other Options
########

Immunity can be used as an ability to prevent Toxic users from gaining the upper hand, but this is generally outclassed by Thick Fat. A mono-attacking RestTalk + Whirlwind set can be used. Lum Berry or Leftovers can be used instead of Assault Vest, but the Defense EVs should be moved to HP. Self-Destruct can also be used in place of Fire Punch. Wild Charge and Heavy Slam are both interesting attacking options, but they are generally outclassed by Snorlax's main attacking options. Seed Bomb is an option to hit Ground- and Water-types.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-Types**: Mienshao, Machamp, and Toxicroak nullify Snorlax with their strong STAB moves.

**Physical Wallbreakers**: Krookodile, Swords Dance Celebi, and other Choice Band wallbreakers all severely impact Snorlax's longevity.

**Phazers**: Roar and Whirlwind users such as Swampert and Hippowdon prevent Curselax from setting up, while also potentially racking up entry hazard damage.

**Taunt**: Taunt users such as Krookodile and Crobat prevent Curselax from setting up.

**Burn**: Will-O-Wisp users such as Arcanine and Rotom-H cripple the Choice Band and Assault Vest sets.
