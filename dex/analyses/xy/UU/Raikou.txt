Overview
########

Raikou is blessed with great Special Attack and Speed stats. Its typing leaves it susceptible to only one type and it has decent defensive stats for an offensive Pokemon. It also has access to great coverage moves. However, Raikou is not without its faults. Hidden Power was nerfed in XY, having a lower Base Power. It is also forced to run a Rash nature if it wishes to use Aura Sphere due to it being an event-exclusive move. In addition, special walls such as Snorlax, Florges, and Umbreon take pitiful damage from Raikou's attacks. Nonetheless, Raikou can be a great addition to your team.


Substitute + Calm Mind
########
name: Substitute + Calm Mind
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Calm Mind
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Hidden Power Ice
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Substitute and Calm Mind are obviously the most important moves on this set. Substitute eases prediction as well as blocking status, and Calm Mind increases Raikou's Special Attack to extreme levels, making it a dangerous sweeper. Thunderbolt is the STAB attack of choice, having a high Base Power with no drawbacks. Finally, Hidden Power Ice creates a pseudo-BoltBeam combination, hitting almost every Pokemon for at least neutral damage.

Set Details
========

The given EVs allow Raikou to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment with a boosting nature allows it to outrun as many Pokemon as possible. Leftovers lets Raikou regain HP lost from switching into entry hazards, allowing it to survive longer.

Usage Tips
========

As Raikou forces many switches, using that time to set up Substitute or Calm Mind is a good idea. However, staying in and trying to set up on bulky special walls such as Florges is not-- they take pitiful damage from Raikou's attacks and can retaliate by wearing out Raikou.

Team Options
========

Rapid Spin or Defog support is really vital to preserve Raikou's longevity. Flygon, Starmie, and Crobat make good partners. Flygon, especially, has great type synergy with Raikou. Pokemon that are resistant or immune to Ground-type moves are also good partners. Rotom-H is a fantastic partner for Raikou because it is immune to Ground-type moves courtesy of its Levitate ability. It can also burn Pokemon to cushion physical attacks for Raikou as well as damage them with Hidden Power Grass. In addition, Grass-types such as Shaymin make excellent partners because they can get rid of problematic Pokemon like Gastrodon and Swampert that would otherwise stop Raikou right in its tracks. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Roserade and Gligar is vital for allowing Raikou to secure KOs that it wouldn't normally get.


Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice
move 3: Volt Switch
move 4: Extrasensory
ability: Pressure
item: Choice Specs
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Thunderbolt is the obligatory STAB attack and deals a massive amount of damage to anything that does not resist it. Hidden Power Grass is the preferred Hidden Power, nailing most of Raikou's hard counters such as Rhyperior, Gastrodon, and Swampert. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ice creates a pseudo-BoltBeam combination and hits almost everything for at least neutral damage. Volt Switch allows Raikou to provide valuable momentum for the team as well as allowing Raikou to escape from potential threats. Finally, Extrasensory hits Poison-types such as Roserade, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen harder than Hidden Power Ice as well as providing coverage to hit Fighting-type Pokemon for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

It's easy to see why one would equip Choice Specs on a Pokemon like Raikou. It raises Raikou's already high Special Attack to extreme levels. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Raikou to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Timid nature gives Raikou the ability to outpace most unboosted Pokemon in the tier.

Usage Tips
========

Do your best to predict well, as Raikou will be locked into one move due to Choice Specs. As Raikou causes so many switches due to its sheer power, using Volt Switch is a good idea to scout the opponent and gain momentum for your team. However, be cautious of opposing Ground-types, as using Volt Switch as one switches in will hurt your team's momentum.

Team Options
========

Because Raikou attracts Ground-type moves, Grass-types make great partners with Raikou. They take on the Ground-types that trouble Raikou, and in return Raikou takes the Flying-type moves aimed at them. In addition, Rotom-H is a great partner because it is immune to Ground-type moves thanks to its Levitate ability and can burn Pokemon to cushion physical attacks for Raikou. Raikou will be using Volt Switch a lot, so Defog or Rapid Spin support is appreciated. In addition, cleric support is greatly appreciated, as Raikou has no other means of recovery; Umbreon and Florges are good choices. Entry hazard support is recommended, as it allows Raikou to secure certain KOs, such as on specially defensive Celebi after Stealth Rock and three layers of Spikes, as well as having the capability of sweeping more easily.


Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Hidden Power Ice
move 3: Volt Switch
move 4: Extrasensory / Aura Sphere
ability: Pressure
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Rash

Moves
========

With a blistering Speed stat, Raikou makes an effective revenge killer with Choice Scarf equipped. Thunderbolt is Raikou's STAB attack, with high Base Power and no drawbacks. Hidden Power Ice creates the pseudo-BoltBeam combination and hits almost everything for at least neutral damage. Volt Switch allows Raikou to gain momentum for the team as well as allowing it to escape dangerous threats. The last move is a bit of a toss-up. Extrasensory is the preferred move, as it allows Raikou to hit the many Poison- and Fighting-types that fill the tier. Aura Sphere can be used to hit many problematic Pokemon such as Snorlax and Umbreon for super effective damage; however, it forces Raikou to run a Rash nature, which means it barely outspeeds base 100 Pokemon.

Set Details
========

Due to Raikou's fantastic Speed, it makes a great revenge killer, outpacing the majority of the tier with Choice Scarf equipped. The EV spread allows Raikou to hit as fast and hard as possible. A Timid nature is used to allow Raikou to outpace as many Pokemon as possible.

Usage Tips
========

As Raikou will be locked into one move due to Choice Scarf, try your best to predict well. Raikou will force out many switches, so take advantage of that and use Volt Switch to keep momentum; be aware of Ground-types that will try to switch in to absorb it; if you predict that happening, use the right move or switch out.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support is almost mandatory, as it allows Raikou to revenge kill more efficiently. Swampert, Qwilfish, and Roserade make good partners. Raikou gets worn down easily because it will be using Volt Switch often, so Rapid Spin or Defog support is greatly appreciated. Blastoise makes a great offensive partner, taking on Ground-type Pokemon that trouble Raikou with ease. Wish support is valuable, as Raikou has no reliable recovery or any way to cure status. Florges and Umbreon make excellent Wish passers, and they have access to Aromatherapy and Heal Bell, respectively. Jirachi makes a good partner as well, as it can Wish pass, though it shares a Ground-type weakness with Raikou. Grass-types such as Roserade and Shaymin are great partners because they can take care of Swampert and Gastrodon, two Pokemon that greatly trouble Raikou, as well as having great type synergy with Raikou. In addition, Rotom-H is a great partner, as it can switch into Ground-type moves thanks to its Levitate ability and burn the opposing Pokemon, cushioning the next incoming physical attack.


Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice
move 3: Extrasensory
move 4: Calm Mind
ability: Pressure
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Thunderbolt is Raikou's STAB attack and has high Base Power and no drawbacks. The Hidden Power type is a bit of a toss-up. Hidden Power Grass is preferred, hitting Gastrodon, Rhyperior, and Swampert hard. However, Hidden Power Ice creates a psuedo-BoltBeam combination, nailing problematic Pokemon such as Flygon and Gligar. Extrasensory hits the Fighting- and Poison-types that fill the tier for super effective damage. Calm Mind is used to allow Raikou to sweep more easily.

Set Details
========

Life Orb gives Raikou an offensive boost and gives it the option to hit hard without being locked into a move at the cost of losing some HP. The EV spread allows Raikou to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Timid nature is used to further increase Raikou's Speed and allows it outrun most unboosted Pokemon in the metagame.

Usage Tips
========

Raikou forces many switches due to its sheer power. Taking advantage of the switches and using the time to set up Calm Mind is a good idea. Try not to get Raikou inflicted with status because it ruins Raikou's chances of a successful sweep.

Team Options
========

Cleric support is very useful, as Raikou will be worn down easily by Life Orb recoil and is prone to status. Wish support is greatly appreciated, as Raikou has no form of reliable recovery. Pokemon such as Umbreon and Florges make great partners, as they have access to both Wish and status-curing moves. In addition, Rapid Spin and Defog support is greatly appreciated because Raikou will be taking a lot of damage from switching into entry hazards; coupled with Life Orb recoil, this will make Raikou go down fast. Likewise, entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Roserade is almost mandatory, as it is vital for Raikou to secure KOs on Pokemon such as specially defensive Jirachi after three layers of Spikes. Pokemon that can deal with Ground-types make good partners, such as Water- and Grass-type Pokemon. These include Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Roserade, as they can take care of the Pokemon such as Swampert and Rhyperior that trouble Raikou. Rotom-H is a great partner, as it can switch into Ground-type moves thanks to its Levitate ability.


Other Options
########

Raikou can take advantage of its decent Special Defense by using Assault Vest. However, Raikou has a bad defensive typing and can be worn down very easily. Shadow Ball can be used with Aura Sphere to have perfect neutral coverage. Weather Ball can also be used; however, weather only lasts five to eight turns, so it is not recommended. Charge Beam can also be used to get Special Attack boosts, but sadly it can miss and is outclassed by Thunderbolt.


Checks & Counters
########

**Ground-types**: Ground-type Pokemon give Raikou a lot of trouble. Bulky ones such as Gastrodon, Rhyperior, Hippowdon, and Swampert can switch into Thunderbolt and take pitiful damage from Hidden Power Ice. However, they have to watch out for Hidden Power Grass. Specially defensive Hippowdon is almost a perfect counter to Raikou, as it takes little damage from Hidden Power Ice/Grass, can phaze with Whirlwind, hit back with Earthquake, or stall by healing with Slack Off.

**Special Walls**: Special walls such as Umbreon, Florges, and Snorlax can take most of Raikou's moves and can wear it down with their respective moves, and the former two can also use Raikou to Wish pass. Florges, however, can be setup bait for Calm Mind Raikou. Umbreon is setup bait to a lesser degree, considering Foul Play does a lot of damage. Assault Vest variants of Snorlax can use Earthquake and Curse Snorlax can set up alongside Raikou.

**Revenge Killers**: Choice Scarf Flygon, Mienshao, and Krookodile outspeed all sets but the Choice Scarf and they make excellent checks to Raikou, as they can retaliate with Earthquake or High Jump Kick.

**Bronzong**: Bronzong can switch into Raikou and takes decent damage from Thunderbolt. It can Toxic Raikou, use Earthquake, or set up Light Screen and Reflect.

**Lanturn**: Lanturn is immune to Thunderbolt thanks to Volt Absorb and resists Hidden Power Ice. Lanturn can wear out Raikou by using Scald and attempting to burn it.

**Rotom-H**: Rotom-H resists both Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice/Grass, but it loses to Calm Mind sets.

**Magneton**: Magneton resists all of Raikou's moves, but it has to watch out for Aura Sphere and loses to Calm Mind Raikou.
