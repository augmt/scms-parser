Overview
########

A Pokemon often overlooked in favor of its evolution, Magneton carves out a niche for itself in the UU metagame that only it can hold. With a powerful base 120 Special Attack and an ability in Analytic that boosts its power by 30% whenever the user moves last, including switches, it becomes a force to be reckoned with when equipped with Choice Specs. Not only this, but it can support its teammates by trapping Steel-types with Magnet Pull, eliminating them so its partners can sweep more easily. On top of all this, its typing defensively offers it the most resistances for any Pokemon, allowing it numerous opportunities to switch in and put pressure on the opponent. Offensively, Magneton's Steel typing not only allows it to be among the only special attackers that can keep Florges at bay, and its STABs attain decent neutral coverage together, able to round out its coverage with the appropriate Hidden Power.

Sadly, Magneton still has to compete for a spot on a team with various other Electric-types such as Mega Ampharos, Raikou, Jolteon, and Rotom-H. Its base 70 Speed isn't much to write home about, and allows a number of offensive Pokemon to outpace and threaten it, such as Mienshao, Chandelure, and Nidoking. Its low HP stat also sells its bulk short, even with an Eviolite, on top of how easily it is worn down due to no recovery and susceptibility to entry hazards. However, even with common weaknesses to Ground-, Fire-, and Fighting-type moves and a fairly narrow and predictable movepool, Magneton still has everything it needs to be a threat in UU, be it a vicious wallbreaker that hits like a nuke or a team player that can eliminate certain Pokemon from the opponent's team. The advantages Magneton offers give it a very unique role in UU that can easily make it worthwhile to fit into your team.


Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Flash Cannon
move 3: Volt Switch
move 4: Hidden Power Grass
ability: Analytic
item: Choice Specs
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Thunderbolt and Flash Cannon are Magneton's primary STAB options and have decent coverage that can hit a wide amount of Pokemon for neutral damage. The few Pokemon that resist the combination can be covered with a Hidden Power of choice. Hidden Power Grass is preferred for Magneton to take on common Water / Ground Pokemon, such as Swampert and Quagsire. Hidden Power Ice can be used, however, specifically to hit Mega Ampharos. Bear in mind, however, that most of the Pokemon weak to Hidden Power Ice are still susceptible to Flash Cannon.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed is required as Magneton is otherwise quite slow. With maximum Speed investment, Magneton is able to outrun defensive Arcanine, defensive Roserade, and uninvested base 100 Speed Pokemon. A Modest nature and Choice Specs maximizes Magneton's power, dealing as much damage as possible. Analytic is necessary even with the Speed investment, as it capitalizes on Magneton's ability to force switches with an extra 30% boost in power, punishing whatever Pokemon switches in. A Timid nature can be used for the extra Speed, but it isn't worthwhile as Magneton outspeeds no key Pokemon with it. Life Orb or Expert Belt can be used in order to ease prediction and hinder the opponent by bluffing the usual Choice Specs. Bear in mind that both items cost Magneton a bit of power overall, and Life Orb makes Magneton even easier to wear down than it was to begin with.

Usage Tips
========

This Magneton set is very high-risk, high-reward, as predicting correctly will often result in a badly damaged Pokemon on the opposing side at the absolute worst; however, it's just as easy to predict incorrectly and be forced out. Because they're immune to Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, Ground-types are an issue for Magneton, so play cautiously if they are present. It's best to use Flash Cannon to nail Ground-types switching in when Magneton is in a position to force out a Pokemon weak to Electric-type moves. Usually the switch to a Ground-type is much easier to predict in these cases, as staying in would be an even riskier play for the opponent to make. Use Hidden Power only when you're absolutely certain that the opponent is sending in a Pokemon weak to it, as it is otherwise very weak. Hidden Power Grass, however, can be used as a decent neutral play when the opponent is trying to play around Magneton's STABs with a Water + Ground core, as both are covered by it. Use Volt Switch to gain momentum when you know Thunderbolt won't KO a switch-in even after factoring in the boost from Analytic. This allows you to switch to the appropriate check to what they send in, keeping the momentum of the battle in your favor. Lastly, despite the great number of resistances and switch-in opportunities Magneton's typing offers, it is easy to wear down with multiple entry hazards, and lacks recovery of any sort. Try not to even let it take a resisted hit unless it's absolutely necessary.

Team Options
========

Thanks to its great natural synergy, Crobat pairs nicely with Magneton, as it is capable of checking the Fighting-types that threaten Magneton and forms a nice VoltTurn core, while Magneton is also able to deal with the bulky Water-types that Crobat struggles with. Mienshao and Hydreigon are notable for having incredible offensive synergy with Magneton, as they not only can form an offensive VoltTurn core, but are able to break through a number of defensive cores when used in conjunction with each other. Bulky Water-types of your own, such as Slowking, Swampert, and Vaporeon, are able to check the Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon that give Magneton issues, as well as most Fighting-types. Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate, such as Flygon, Noivern, Mega Aerodactyl, and Cresselia also pair nicely due to their immunity to Ground and ability to check Fighting-types. Clerics such as Umbreon and Florges are provide Wish support to keep Magneton healthy while checking a number of threatening special attackers such as Mega Ampharos, Hydreigon, and Chandelure.


Steel Trapper
########
name: Steel Trapper
move 1: Magnet Rise
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Flash Cannon
move 4: Hidden Power Grass
ability: Magnet Pull
item: Eviolite
evs: 124 HP / 252 SpA / 132 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Magnet Rise gives Magneton a temporary immunity to Ground-type moves, allowing it to deal with numerous Steel-types, such as Mega Aggron, Escavalier, Metagross, and Bronzong. Thunderbolt and Flash Cannon are essential STAB moves, though Thunderbolt is the most important as Steel-types don't resist it. Flash Cannon is still good for coverage, as Steel-types are not likely to be the only Pokemon Magneton has to deal with. Hidden Power Grass allows Magneton to beat Swampert and Quagsire one-on-one, extending its role to also cover these Pokemon for your team.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread allows Magneton to outspeed standard defensive Suicune sets while maximizing Special Attack, with the remaining EVs put into bulk. The Eviolite is necessary as it works well with the investment into its bulk, allowing Magneton to survive coverage moves of the Pokemon it traps much more easily. If the extra HP isn't a concern and more Speed is required, an alternate EV spread of 80 HP / 252 SpA / 176 Spe can be used to reliably outrun max Speed Empoleon, defensive Roserade, and -1 Victini.

Usage Tips
========

The number of Steel-types in UU that can be reliably trapped is a bit lacking; however, the primary targets are Mega Aggron, Bronzong, Doublade, Empoleon, Escavalier, Forretress, Jirachi, Metagross, and Registeel. Of these Pokemon, a few of them are still able to play around Magneton in one way or another: Mega Aggron can phaze with Roar, Doublade can 2HKO with Sacred Sword (Magneton can 2HKO Doublade as well), Escavalier can use Knock Off to remove Eviolite, and Forretress and Jirachi can escape with Volt Switch and U-turn, respectively. As this set is much slower and weaker than the Choice Specs set, try not to liberally go on the offensive unless you have the opportunity to do so. Bulky Water-types, as well as Steel-, Flying-, and Fairy-type Pokemon are handled effectively by this set, and should be the main targets Magneton deals with. Magnet Rise isn't only good for harassing the Steel-types Magneton can trap; it can inhibit a number of Ground-types with this move, such as Hippowdon, Swampert, Quagsire, defensive Nidoqueen (be wary of Focus Blast or Fire Blast), and Rhyperior. Finally, even with the Eviolite and decent HP investment, Magneton still doesn't have the greatest bulk overall. So, it prefers not to take hits that it doesn't need to take. Even though it can survive stray Scalds from Water-types, burns can make it even easier to wear down than it already was to begin with.

Team Options
========

As this set's primary goal is to eliminate opposing Steel-types, partners that appreciate their removal, such as Crobat, Mega Aerodactyl, Cloyster, Hydreigon, Jirachi, and Gardevoir, are all decent teammates. Wish support from Umbreon, Vaporeon, Alomomola, or Florges is helpful given how easily Magneton is worn down, allowing it to stay in the game as long as possible. Once again, defensive partners that can take the Fire- and Fighting-type moves aimed at Magneton pair nicely with it. Cresselia, Swampert, and Hippowdon are a few examples.

Other Options
########

Magneton's movepool is incredibly shallow, not offering too many more options for it to work with. Discharge can be used over Thunderbolt to exchange a little Base Power for a much higher paralysis rate, but Magneton needs all the power it can gets, and a 30% paralysis chance isn't totally reliable. Hidden Power Ground can be used to allow Magneton to deal with opposing Electric-types much more easily while still covering most Steel-types, but Magneton loses out on the ability to hit Water / Ground Pokemon super effectively. Hidden Power Fire can be used to more readily take out Steel-types such as Forretress, Escavalier, and Ferroseed, but it loses the ability to hit several more Pokemon for super effective damage. Substitute and Charge Beam can be used on the Steel Trapper set, as it allows Magneton to become a threat by setting up on a trapped Steel-type and removing it. However, Magneton will not always find itself against teams with Steel-types, making Charge Beam a liability in those cases, especially when compared with its more reliable Electric STAB, Thunderbolt. Charge Beam's boost also isn't reliable, and Magneton can still be revenge killed easily, even with Substitute. Electric Terrain boosts the power of Magneton's moves and prevents grounded Pokemon from sleeping for a few turns, but it's an incredibly niche move and forces Magneton to give up one of its useful coverage options. Thunder Wave can cripple a fast offensive Pokemon trying to switch in on Magneton, allowing it to get the Speed advantage, but it serves no other purpose, and Magneton is better off attacking outright in most cases. This also means it loses out on one of its coverage options, making it easier for some Pokemon to wall it. Sleep Talk can be used on the Choice Specs set if your team absolutely needs a Pokemon to absorb sleep status, but it is highly unreliable and will cost you the ability of selecting the appropriate move, which Magneton heavily depends on in order to be a threat. Lastly, Choice Scarf can be used to compensate for Magneton's average Speed stat, but it is still outsped by all common Choice Scarf users as well as Mega Aerodactyl.


Checks & Counters
########

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Umbreon, Snorlax, and Hippowdon are able to sponge hits even from the Choice Specs set and get free turns to set up or inflict damage.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Rotom-Heat, Mega Ampharos, Jolteon, Raikou, and even opposing Magneton function as checks since as they resist both its STAB moves, allowing them to survive and hit Magneton back. However, Analytic allows Magneton to do a decent amount of damage to frailer Electric-types on the switch.

**Ground-types**: Ground-types, being immune to Electric-type moves, make predicting with the Choice Specs set a bit riskier, as they can get a free turn to come in and force Magneton out with their STAB moves. They can be covered with the correct coverage move, but Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Swampert resist both STAB moves, and are particularly more threatening if Hidden Power Grass is not used.

**Faster Offensive Threats**: Magneton's base 70 Speed lends it to being easily revenge killed and forced out by a number of offensive Pokemon, such as Darmanitan, Mega Houndoom, Mienshao, and Nidoking, just to name a few. Magneton's weaknesses are very common, and the majority of faster offensive Pokemon are likely to have a move it's weak to.

**Dragon-types**: Dragon-types such as Mega Ampharos, Flygon, Hydreigon, and Kyurem are able to come in on Magneton's Electric-type moves and force it out. However, Mega Ampharos is the only Dragon-type that isn't afraid of switching in on a Flash Cannon from the Choice Specs set.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Celebi, Chesnaught, Roserade, and Assault Vest Tangrowth can also switch into Magneton's Electric-type moves with little issue. Though most of them cannot immediately beat Magneton without the proper coverage move, they can set up on it for free; most also have reliable recovery and decent bulk, making them able to risk taking a Flash Cannon upon switching in.
