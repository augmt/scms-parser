Overview
########

Mega Camerupt is a viable Trick Room Pokemon with base 20 Speed after Mega Evolving, which allows it to outspeed and KO Amoonguss, a Pokemon that Trick Room teams struggle with. It has bulky 70 / 100 / 105 defenses and its base 145 Special Attack and ability Sheer Force let it hit hard. However, Mega Camerupt is not viable outside Trick Room and requires support from other Pokemon on its team. It's also hard to send out without taking prior damage or letting its teammate faint.

Moves
========

Heat Wave and Earth Power are Mega Camerupt's STAB attacks and are used for max damage. Hidden Power Ice hits Dragon-types immune to Earth Power such as Hydreigon, Latios, and Salamence. Ancient Power is for special Rock coverage and pairs well with Sheer Force, hitting Fire-types immune to Earth Power such as Rotom-H and Charizard. Protect lets Mega Camerupt scout the foe's moves.

Set Details
========

252 Special Attack EVs let Mega Camerupt hit as hard as possible, while 252 EVs in HP maximize Mega Camerupt's bulk. You may opt for 76 EVs in Defense which allow Mega Camerupt to survive Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge 95% of the time. 0 Speed IVs let Mega Camerupt sweep in Trick Room.

Usage Tips
========

Always use Mega Camerupt in Trick Room, as the chances of non-Mega Camerupt attacking outside of it is much lower due to fact that most people double target it. Trick Room has only four turns after it is used, so don't waste them. Use the four turns to make aggressive plays. Never switch Mega Camerupt in directly unless you are confident that it can take little to no damage.

Team Options
========

Don't consider using Mega Camerupt without Trick Room. Viable Trick Room users, such as Cresselia and Gothitelle, can also set up Sunny Day for Mega Camerupt, making its Fire-type moves stronger. Jellicent has great type synergy with Mega Camerupt. Despite Mega Camerupt's power, it is unable to KO Pokemon such as Aegislash in its Shield forme and requires Helping Hand to make sure it KOes Pokemon neutral to Mega Camerupt's attacks. Pokemon able to redirect attacks such as Amoonguss, which has access to Rage Powder, a resistance to Water-type attacks, and the ability to hit Water-types with Giga Drain, are good partners for Mega Camerupt. Follow Me Clefable, Clefairy, and Togekiss can also redirect dangerous moves. Storm Drain Gastrodon and Cradily redirect Water-type moves for Mega Camerupt. Grass-type Pokemon that take on Water-types one-on-one help Mega Camerupt to defend against Water-types, such as Amoonguss and Ferrothorn. Pokemon that can KO Dragon-, Water-, and Levitating Fire-types such as Sylveon, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar, respectively, help Mega Camerupt a lot.

Other Options
########

Fire Blast and Flamethrower are alternative STAB moves with more power but only target one Pokemon. Hidden Power Grass targets Water-type Pokemon ruining Mega Camerupt's day, such as Rotom-W. Rock Slide works off Mega Camerupt's solid Attack and Sheer Force, letting it hit Mega Charizard Y harder than Ancient Power. However, Intimidate users weaken Mega Camerupt's Attack. Solar Beam combos with Sunny Day Cresselia to hit Water-type Pokemon harder, although it relies on Sunny Day.

Checks & Counters
########

**Water-types**: Rotom-W, Suicune, and Milotic are problematic Water-type Pokemon for Mega Camerupt. Rotom-W has Levitate and resists Mega Camerupt's STAB moves, which is a huge problem if Mega Camerupt doesn't carry Hidden Power Grass or have a teammate to KO it. Milotic and Suicune have amazing Special Defense and so can tank Mega Camerupt's Earth Power with ease.

**Dragon-types**: Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Latios, and Salamence resist Heat Wave, are immune to Earth Power, and can be a huge problem if Hidden Power Ice isn't used. However, they need to be careful when Mega Camerupt is in Trick Room.

**Levitating Fire-types**: Rotom-H and Mega Charizard Y resist or are immune to Mega Camerupt's STAB moves and are hard to defeat without Ancient Power. Talonflame can take a lot of damage from Heat Wave and Brave Bird recoil but has Taunt to stop Trick Room from going up, allowing it to switch in and finish off a weakened Mega Camerupt easily.

**Preventing Trick Room**: In general, Sableye, Thundurus, and Gengar are good checks to Cresselia and Gothitelle, two common Trick Room users, as they can hit them super effectively or Taunt them. Mega Camerupt then becomes much easier to deal with outside of Trick Room.
