Overview
########

Rotom-W arguably has the best typing in the rule set, as Water / Electric, with a Ground-type immunity by virtue of Levitate, is incredible and lets it take minimal damage from threats such as Landorus-T and almost every Water-type around. It's no slouch offensively either; Water and Electric coverage, while limited, is good enough to deal with whatever its typing walls. It also has unique access to Will-O-Wisp for crippling physical attackers, making for a powerful Pokemon every team needs an answer to.

Special Attacking Tank
########

name: Special Attacking Tank
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Protect / Rest
ability: Levitate
item: Sitrus Berry / Chesto Berry
evs: 252 HP / 44 Def / 212 SpA
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Thunderbolt and Hydro Pump give Rotom-W its key STAB coverage. Will-O-Wisp neutralizes most physical attackers. Protect prevents double targeting and allows Rotom-W to avoid taking damage for a turn while its teammate deals damage. It's worth mentioning that Rotom-W is one of the few Pokemon that can afford to skimp out on Protect thanks to its typing and bulk. If your team's Sitrus Berry is already in use, Chesto Berry with Rest can work as an alternative.

Set Details
========

The EVs allow Rotom-W to survive Mega Mawile's Play Rough, or two if it's been burned. The rest of the EVs are invested in Special Attack to give Rotom-W some solid offensive presence. However, most Rotom-W run more Speed EVs to Speed creep, so it's highly recommended you take some EVs out of Special Attack and put them into Speed. If you're interested in outspeeding certain threats, 132 Speed EVs let Rotom-W outspeed Adamant nature maximum Speed Bisharp so Rotom-W can burn Bisharp before it has the chance to attack. 188 Speed EVs will let Rotom-W outspeed every neutral-natured Heatran and Hydro Pump it before it can use Substitute. If you find Modest's extra Special Attack unneeded and would prefer to survive some big hits, 252 HP / 148 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to survive Mega Charizard Y's SolarBeam. 252 HP / 164 SpD with a Calm nature will always survive Modest Specs Hydreigon's Draco Meteor. Sitrus Berry is important, as it gives Rotom-W more longevity. It also makes investing to live certain hits more valuable, as Rotom-W will survive the hit, then get boosted into a more comfortable health range.

Usage Tips
========

Rotom-W is a fairly simple Pokemon to use: switch it into one of its many resistances and either start using Will-O-Wisp or attacking. If Rotom-W's up against something that can't touch it, such as a Landorus-T or most Water-types, they're likely not going to stay in. In this scenario, try to predict the switch and use Will-O-Wisp instead.

Team Options
========

Just about everything appreciates Rotom-W's partnership. Rotom-W is great with Earthquake users such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Rotom-W also pairs well with anything that likes a Flying-, Ground-, or Fire-type switch-in such as Amoonguss, Metagross, and Mega Mawile. Pokemon that dislike bulky Water-types, such as Landorus-T and Talonflame, enjoy Rotom-W being able to Thunderbolt them away.

Other Options
########

Choice Specs sets hit hard and are a bit of a surprise. Traditionally, they've been used as a way to deal with rain teams, but Ludicolo is now almost always present on them, making that role questionable. If you're carrying your own rain inducers, Thunder is an option. Reflect can be used over Will-O-Wisp or even Protect if the accuracy and single target nature of Will-O-Wisp are a turnoff or if you find Protect unneeded. Volt Switch is nice for counteracting obvious switches. Hidden Power Ice damages Dragon-types that can't be touched otherwise. Hidden Power Grass grants coverage for Water-types that would wall Rotom-W otherwise, mainly Gastrodon. Thunder Wave and Electroweb provide Speed control, though Rotom-W is not a terribly good Speed control user compared to Thundurus or Cresselia.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Amoonguss and Ludicolo wall Rotom-W. Amoonguss redirects everything Rotom-W wants to do. Both take laughable damage from Rotom-W's attack and will eventually take it down with Giga Drain. Ferrothorn hates burns, but most carry a Lum Berry and can smack Rotom-W with Power Whip.

**Dragon-types**: Unless Rotom-W carries Hidden Power Ice, which only deals negligible damage, most specially oriented Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Latios can beat Rotom-W.

**Strong Neutral STAB Attacks**: The strongest special attacks around, such as Sylveon's Hyper Voice and Thundurus-I's Thunderbolt, can muscle through Rotom-W after a few hits.

**Gastrodon**: Though uncommon, Gastrodon is immune to both of Rotom-W's STAB moves, prevents Hydro Pump from affecting its partner with Storm Drain, and can eventually win versus Rotom-W one-on-one.
