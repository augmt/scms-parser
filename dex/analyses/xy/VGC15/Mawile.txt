Overview
########
Mawile's Mega Evolution is still a top-tier threat thanks to its ability, Huge Power, great defensive typing, and Intimidate all making it an incredible attacker and team player at the same time. Will-O-Wisp, Intimidate, and effective users of Ground- and Fire-type attacks are more common than ever in this metagame, but their presence is still not enough to keep Mega Mawile from being a major threat.

Mega Attacker
########
name: Mega Attacker
move 1: Play Rough
move 2: Sucker Punch
move 3: Iron Head / Rock Slide
move 4: Protect
ability: Intimidate
item: Mawilite
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Play Rough hits anything that doesn't resist it tremendously hard. Sucker Punch provides useful coverage and priority, allowing Mega Mawile to work around its bad Speed at the expense of only being able to attack when the foe does. Iron Head is a more reliable STAB move with inferior coverage, while Rock Slide gives Mega Mawile coverage against Mega Charizard-Y, Talonflame, and other Fire-types that are otherwise major trouble. Protect shields Mega Mawile for a turn while its partner deals with an opposing threat and lets it avoid being double targeted.

Set Details
========

Intimidate is still arguably the best ability in the game, lowering the target's Attack by one stage. An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs simply get Mega Mawile its maximum damage output. If you find maximum Attack unnecessary, you can take some EVs out of Attack and put them into Mega Mawile's defenses to help it survive certain hits. A list with certain benchmarks is provided below. Choose your investment based on what your team values enduring:

<ul>
<li>44 Def allows Mega Mawile to survive Adamant Choice Band Talonflame's -1 Flare Blitz</li>
<li>36 SpD allows Mega Mawile to never be 2HKOed by uninvested neutral-natured Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and survive Timid maximum Special Attack Chandelure's Heat Wave</li>
<li>52 SpD allows Mega Mawile to never be OHKOed by Modest maximum Special Attack Heatran's Heat Wave</li>
<li>124 SpD allows Mega Mawile to never be OHKOed by Modest maximum Special Attack Chandelure's Heat Wave</li>
<li>148 SpD allows Mega Mawile to never be OHKOed by Modest max Special Attack Life Orb Tyranitar's Fire Blast or be 2HKOed by max Special Attack Rotom-W's Thunderbolt</li>
<li>196 SpD allows Mega Mawile to always survive Naughty 4 Special Attack Life Orb Talonflame's Overheat</li>
<li>204 SpD allows Mega Mawile to always survive Modest Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave when the sun is down</li>
</ul>

Switching to a negative Speed nature with a Speed IV of zero is recommended if you are using Mega Mawile in a dedicated Trick Room team. If using Gothitelle, a Speed IV of 18 or 19 and an Adamant nature is recommended. This allows Gothitelle to use Tickle before Mawile moves under Trick Room.

Usage Tips
========

Don't feel pressured to Mega Evolve Mawile immediately, as you'll want to keep Intimidate around for as long as possible. Mawile can actually switch in quite often thanks to Intimidate and its useful pool of resistances. Additionally, be sure to run some kind of speed control (particularly Trick Room) or redirection support with Mawile, as it greatly increases its effectiveness. Try to preserve Mega Mawile until Landorus and powerful Fire-types are down so it can attack uninhibited.

Team Options
========

Cresselia is an excellent support Pokemon for Mega Mawile. It has Trick Room, Icy Wind, and Thunder Wave for speed control and can lend Mega Mawile a Helping Hand boost. Gothitelle's Shadow Tag, Trick Room, and Tickle are all very helpful for Mega Mawile. Again, if using Gothitelle, don't set Mega Mawile's Speed to 0 IVs with a Brave nature; set it to 18 or 19 IVs with an Adamant nature. This allows Gothitelle to outspeed Mega Mawile by one point in Trick Room and lets Gothitelle get off a Tickle. Thundurus can paralyze the opponent's team and line Mega Mawile up to clean late-game. Hydreigon, Latios, and Salamence all have great defensive synergy with Mega Mawile; Mega Mawile can switch into attacks aimed at these Pokemon and vice versa. Milotic can deal with Fire- and Ground-type attackers and deter the opponent from switching in an Intimidate user on Mega Mawile. Amoonguss and Togekiss are the ideal redirection support for Mega Mawile. Amoonguss can redirect whatever Rotom-W wants to do while Togekiss and Mega Mawile have some nice defensive synergy.

Other Options
########

Brick Break hits Heatran and Ferrothorn, which are otherwise troublesome. Stone Edge hits Fire-types harder than Rock Slide and hits through Wide Guard, but it is inaccurate. Fire Punch is especially helpful for muscling through Steel-types, particularly Aegislash, Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Knock Off hits Aegislash and is a solid alternative to Sucker Punch. It lets Mega Mawile hit Aegislash as it uses Substitute or another non-attacking move in exchange for risking an Attack drop as Aegislash uses King's Shield. Substitute and Swords Dance are also useful tools for Mega Mawile, but it's bulky and powerful enough immediately.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types and Other Pokemon with Super-Effective Attacks**: Entei, Mega Charizard-Y, Talonflame, and Arcanine mean a lot of trouble for Mega Mawile. Keep in mind that Talonflame and Arcanine much prefer their special attacking options against Mega Mawile due to Intimidate. Outside of Fire-types, Landorus-T and Garchomp can do lots of damage to Mega Mawile, though they need prior damage source or a Choice Band to finish the job at +0

**Faster Will-O-Wisp Users**: Rotom-W, Sableye, and Gengar can all burn Mega Mawile before it can hit them for super effective damage. Sableye and Gengar also have Taunt, which prevents Trick Room use.

**Intimidate**: Landorus-T, Arcanine, and opposing Mawile and the -1 Attack drops that come with them are all bothersome for Mega Mawile.
