Overview
########

Overall, Politoed makes for a great support Pokemon due to its movepool and ability Drizzle; however, a lot of VGC players know to bring Grass- and Electric-type coverage to deal with Politoed, which slightly damages its role in VGC 2015.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Scald
move 2: Icy Wind / Ice Beam
move 3: Helping Hand / Encore / Perish Song
move 4: Protect
ability: Drizzle
item: Sitrus Berry
evs: 252 HP / 76 Def / 76 SpA / 100 SpD / 4 Spe
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Scald does solid damage and lets Politoed fish for a burn. Politoed can provide speed control with Icy wind or do more damage with its coverage with Ice Beam. With Helping Hand, Politoed can boost the power of its partner. Encore lets Politoed punish attacks like Fake Out and Protect. Perish Song is used to guarantee a win condition if the opponent is down to their last two Pokemon. Protect is used for scouting out moves that can potentially harm Politoed.

Set Details
========

With the EVs put into HP and Defense, Politoed can survive Mega Mawile's Play Rough. The Special Attack EVs allow Politoed to OHKO 4 HP / 0 SpD Landorus-T with an Ice Beam or rain-boosted Scald. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense. Politoed can also use Leftovers or Wacan Berry if a different Pokemon on the team has a Sitrus Berry already.

Usage Tips
========

Politoed empowers weather abusers, but that doesn't mean you should fill your team with them. Being overly dependant on rain will make your team very ineffective. Rain isn't something to be dependent on; it should be thought of more as a helpful boost. Additionally, you can challenge Mega Charizard Y's sun with Politoed if Charizard has mega evolved already. If it hasn't, Politoed can't challenge it without a partner faster than Mega Charizard Y with Rain Dance.

Team Options
========

Ludicolo is Politoed's go-to partner, as it has a more useful offensive typing than other Swift Swim users such as Kingdra. Ludicolo's Fake Out is also very useful. While Kingdra is still a good teammate for Politoed, the lack of Dragon Gem makes it less powerful than in previous years. Talonflame works well with Politoed and Ludicolo, despite its Fire-type moves being weakened in the rain. The three of them make a pretty good core to build around. Mega Swampert works too, but then there needs to be another Pokemon with Grass-type coverage on the team to take care of Rotom-W. Strong Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Thundurus-T like to abuse Politoed's rain for 100% accurate Thunders. Steel-types also benefit from Politoed and its Drizzle because the rain weakens Fire-type moves. Metagross, Mawile, and especially Ferrothorn love this. Politoed can't bust through Water- and Grass-types that well, so a partner that can hit these types for strong super effective damage synergize well with Politoed. If Politoed is being used in a Perish Trap team, Mega Gengar or Gothitelle is a mandatory partner.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Scald / Surf
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Rain Dance / Encore
ability: Drizzle
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Hydro Pump is the hardest-hitting attack of this set. Ice Beam is used for coverage against Flying- and Grass-types. Scald is used as a compromise between power and accuracy. Surf gives Politoed a spread attack, but Politoed will need a partner who can take it. Hidden Power Grass is used for coverage against Rotom-W. Rain Dance is used for refreshing the rain for the team if Charizard Mega Evolves, or Mega Charizard Y switches in. Encore is used so that Politoed can quickly lock the foe into a status move.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature with maximum Speed and Choice Scarf allows Politoed to outspeed and OHKO 0 HP Jolly Mega Salamence with Ice Beam. Using the given Speed investment allows Politoed to outspeed every Pokemon up to base 130 Speed, such as the rare Crobat.

Usage Tips
========

When using this variant of Politoed, don't let it take too many hits, as it has no defensive investment. Try to snipe Pokemon with Hydro Pump and Ice Beam so that the opposing threats are taken out faster. As with the defensive set, don't make your team overly dependant on Politoed's Drizzle. Rain should complement your team, not be its centerpiece.

Team Options
========

Ludicolo works well with this Politoed set, as it can help with dual offensive coverage. Talonflame works well too as its Flying-type coverage compliments Politoed nicely. Kingdra and Mega Swampert also make for useful Swift Swim users. Ferrothorn and other Steel-types are good teammates for Politoed since the rain temporarily nerfs the power of Fire-type moves. Mega Manectric, Thundurus, and Thundurus-T are all solid teammates as well since they can harness a perfectly accurate Thunder

Other Options
########

A Choice Specs set is viable; rain makes Politoed's Water-type attacks hit surprisingly hard. Other offensive sets aren't terrible, especially with Trick Room. Hidden Power Electric gives Politoed coverage against Water-types, but it's weak and only marginally stronger than a resisted rain boosted Scald. Eject Button can be used as an alternative to Leftovers if Politoed is being used solely for rain. The free switch helps maintain your teams momentum

Checks & Counters
########

**Water Resistant Pokemon with Super Effective hits**: Grass-types accomplish both of these goals naturally. Amoonguss and opposing Ludicolo give Politoed a very hard time

**Opposing the Weather**: A Drought, Sand Stream, or Snow Warning user can switch in and oppose Drizzle. Having a random Sunny Day user can be effective as well.

**Electric-type Attacks** Powerful electric attacks from Thundurus-I and the like are great against Politoed, but unless they have a natural resistance to water like Rotom-W or Rotom-C, Politoed's Water-type attacks are going to hurt.
