Overview
########

Sporting its famous bulk, attacking prowess, speed, and STAB Earthquake, Garchomp is back again to cause havoc. Unfortunately, with the reintroduction of Landorus-T for this season, Garchomp finds itself somewhat outclassed and even at the mercy of Landorus-T's Ground-type immunity and Intimidate. Still, Garchomp is naturally faster than Landorus-T, meaning it doesn't need a Choice Scarf to outspeed and deal with important threats such as Mega Charizard Y. It also fares just as well against most Pokemon as Landorus-T does.

Physical Attacker
########
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Dragon Claw
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Rock Slide / Stone Edge
move 4: Protect
ability: Rough Skin
item: Focus Sash / Life Orb / Lum Berry
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Dragon Claw gives Garchomp a powerful single-target attack. Earthquake is an excellent, powerful spread move, though you'll need an appropriate partner that can dodge the attack. Rock Slide hits some specific troublesome targets, specifically Mega Charizard Y. Stone Edge ensures an OHKO against Mega Charizard Y and lets Garchomp bypass Wide Guard, but it is inaccurate. Protect has all its typical uses. It allows Garchomp to preserve itself to avoid double targeting or let a partner deal with a major threat.

Set Details
========

The EV spread is a simple split between Attack and Speed. If you're interested in surviving specific attacks, a spread of 12 HP / 204 Atk / 4 Def / 36 SpD / 252 Spe allows Garchomp to survive Mega Manectric's Hidden Power Ice. Investing 12 HP EVs and 84 Defense EVs lets Garchomp survive the combination of Jolly Mega Kangaskhan and Adamant Life Orb Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Surviving the combination of those hits is pretty crucial, as Garchomp is one of the best answers to both of them. Focus Sash lets Garchomp take any one hit, particularly a strong Ice Beam, Draco Meteor, or Sylveon's Hyper Voice. Life Orb sacrifices Garchomp's bulk for extra power, pushing a lot of 3HKOs and 2HKOs into 2HKOs and OHKOs. Lum Berry helps Garchomp take on Spore, Will-O-Wisp, and Dark Void users with confidence. Rocky Helmet is also great for catching Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out while generally punishing physical attackers.


Usage Tips
========

Garchomp has trouble OHKOing most Pokemon, so it's best to either bring it out for a late-game sweep or to bring it out early-game to get off some big chunks of damage. Garchomp's Rough Skin punishes Fake Out, so its partner will mostly be targeted by the attack. You can use this as an opportunity to switch out or use Protect on Garchomp's partner. Outside of that, Garchomp is a very straightforward Pokemon. Do as much damage as you can and stay away from Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp.

Team Options
========
Pokemon that benefit from Mega Charizard Y being gone appreciate Garchomp as a teammate. Mega Mawile and Aegislash are great options, especially because they also take care of Fairy and Dragon-types for Garchomp. Cresselia, Thundurus, Rotom-W, Gardevoir, and most Pokemon immune to Earthquake are wonderful partners for Garchomp. Mega Charizard Y makes a really nasty combo with Garchomp thanks to all of their highly damaging spread attacks. Togekiss provides great redirectional support for Garchomp; it's also immune to Dragon and can even set up Tailwind.


Other Options
########

Garchomp can use Substitute and Swords Dance if you're willing to miss out on Rock Slide. Mega Garchomp has its uses as a dedicated or a secondary Mega Evolution, but the opportunity cost for not using another Mega Evolution is pretty high. Fire Fang and Fire Blast allow Garchomp to take on Steel-types that take negligible damage from Earthquake, particularly Ferrothorn. Iron Head lets Garchomp do hefty damage to Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Togekiss. In terms of other item options, Garchomp can run reasonably effective Choice Band and Choice Scarf sets. Haban Berry and Yache Berry are also useful, though with Garchomp's diverse array of weaknesses, a Focus Sash usually does the job better.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ice-types**: Mamoswine, Greninja, and Weavile can all OHKO Garchomp with their STAB Ice-type attacks.

**Ice Beam**: Cresselia, Suicune, Milotic, Ludicolo, and Politoed can all take a hit from Garchomp and either severely damage it or OHKO it outright with Ice Beam.

**Other Dragon-types**: Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Mega Salamence, and Latios can all outspeed Garchomp and knock it out with a Draco Meteor.

**Fairy-types**: Mega Altaria, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon can KO Garchomp with their STAB Fairy-type attacks.

**Trick Room**: Under Trick Room, Pokemon such as Jellicent, Mega Mawile, and Abomasnow can get the jump on Garchomp and knock it out.

**Intimidate**: Landorus-T, Scrafty, Gyarados, and Hitmontop all make Garchomp's life a lot harder by lowering its Attack one stage, drastically reducing its offensive prowess.

**Will-O-Wisp**:Sableye, Gengar, and especially Rotom-W can easily burn Garchomp, crippling it severely.
