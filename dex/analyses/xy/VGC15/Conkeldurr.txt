Overview
########

Conkeldurr boasts an incredible base 140 Attack that helps it dish out tons of damage. Guts allows Conkeldurr to absorb status effects such as Will-O-Wisp, which would otherwise cripple it. Its base 105 HP and base 95 Defense make it fairly physically bulky, and while its base 65 Special Defense might seem rather low, Conkeldurr often uses Assault Vest to patch it up. Conkeldurr also has access to the elemental punches and Knock Off. However, Conkeldurr is vulnerable to Intimidate, which is very common in VGC. It falls to common Flying-types such as Mega Salamence and Talonflame, which can KO Conkeldurr with their STAB attacks. Conkeldurr is also weak to common Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Mawile, and Sylveon.

Assault Vest

name: Assault Vest
move 1: Drain Punch
move 2: Mach Punch
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Ice Punch / Rock Slide
ability: Guts / Iron Fist
item: Assault Vest
evs: 20 HP / 244 Atk / 12 Def / 228 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Drain Punch is Conkeldurr's primary STAB attack because it heals Conkeldurr by 50% of the HP dealt to the foe. Mach Punch functions as a priority move that lets Conkeldurr finish off frail or weakened foes. Knock Off targets Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gengar, Aegislash, and Cresselia, all of which are immune to or resist Conkeldurr's STAB moves. Ice Punch hits Mega Salamence, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, which take little damage from Conkeldurr's other attacks. Rock Slide, on the other hand, can be used to hit Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Talonflame for good damage. It also hits Mega Salamence, just not as hard as Ice Punch does.

Set Details
========

Guts is the preferred ability because it lets Conkeldurr absorb status ailments such as Will-O-Wisp, which would otherwise render Conkeldurr useless. If your team has a solution to status, however, consider using Iron Fist to boost the power of Conekeldurr's punching attacks by 20%. Assault Vest boosts Conkeldurr's Special Defense by 50%, helping it comfortably take special attacks such as Cresselia's Psychic and Thundurus's Thunderbolt. The given EV spread lets Conkeldurr survive a sun-boosted Overheat from Modest Mega Charizard Y, a Double-Edge from Jolly Mega Kangaskhan, or a Choice Specs-boosted Hyper Voice from Sylveon. The remaining EVs are put into Attack, and an Adamant nature is used to let Conkeldurr hit as hard as possible. However, if Conkeldurr is used on a Trick Room team, then a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs are best to make Conkeldurr as slow as possible.

Usage Tips
========

Before sending in Conkeldurr, be sure to remove threats such as Mega Salamence and Talonflame, which apply lots to pressure on Conkeldurr due to their powerful STAB attacks. After removing them, Conkeldurr should use its natural bulk to take hits and dish out damage with its attacks. Conkeldurr should use Mach Punch to hit, or even KO, frail Pokemon such as Bisharp without letting them do anything.

Team Options
========

Bisharp effectively handles Intimidate and can threaten the bulky Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon that are immune to and resist Conkeldurr's STAB moves, respectively. Redirection support helps Conkeldurr handle Talonflame easier, but if Conkeldurr doesn't have Rock Slide, then it still has a hard time damaging Talonflame. Trick Room support from Cresselia and Gothitelle can help Conkeldurr move first. Mega Mawile functions well in Trick Room, too, as it can switch into the Flying- and Fairy-type moves aimed at Conkeldurr, and Conkeldurr can absorb Will-O-Wisp if it has Guts. Thanks to Competitive, Milotic helps handle Intimidate and can threaten Pokemon such as Mega Salamence and Talonflame.

Other Options
########

The classic Iron Fist-boosted Hammer Arm set with Trick Room support can be used, but isn't as good as the Assault Vest set because Conkeldurr loses out on good coverage if using it, and Mega Mawile effectively outclasses it. Thanks to its wide movepool, Conkeldurr can utilize any of the following moves:

<ul>
<li>Wide Guard</li>
<li>Stone Edge</li>
<li>Earthquake</li>
<li>Fire Punch</li>
<li>Thunder Punch</li>
<li>Poison Jab</li>
<li>Superpower</li>
</ul>

Sheer Force can be used to boost the power of Conkeldurr's attacks that have a secondary effect. Life Orb can be used alongside this, or by itself, too. Choice Band boosts Conkeldurr's Attack stat by 50%, letting it hit harder. Sitrus Berry helps Conkeldurr take more hits, and Safety Goggles prevents Conkeldurr's attacks from being redirected by Follow Me and Rage Powder, and also protects Conkeldurr from Spore and Sleep Powder. A Flame Orb alongside Guts gives Conkeldurr a 50% boost to its Attack, but wears Conkeldurr down. Persim Berry alongside Guts lets Conkeldurr safely handle Swagger users while still boosting its Attack when it gets burned, poisoned, or paralyzed. The same goes for Lum Berry; however, it should only be used with Iron Fist or Sheer Force.

Checks & Counters
########

**Typing Advantage**: Flying-types, such as Mega Salamence and Talonflame, threaten Conkeldurr with their powerful Flying-type STAB attacks. Common Fairy-type Pokemon threaten Conkeldurr with a STAB attack. Mega Mawile has access to Intimidate before Mega Evolving, and can threaten Conkeldurr with its STAB Play Rough. Mega Gardevoir, Mega Altaria, and Sylveon all threaten Conkeldurr with a Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice, but they must be wary of the rare Poison Jab or Wide Guard.

**Intimidate**: Intimidate from the likes of Gyarados, Mawile, Salamence, and Landorus-T is a problem for Conkeldurr, lowering its Attack stat by a stage.

**Redirection Moves**: Pokemon such as Togekiss and Amoonguss are pains because they redirect Conkeldurr's attacks, forcing it to use spread moves such as Rock Slide to take them out first.
