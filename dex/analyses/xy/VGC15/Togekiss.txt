Overview
########

Togekiss has access to the rare and extremely useful Follow Me, which combined with its good bulk and well-rounded stats allows it to perform its role as a redirection support Pokemon really well. However, its Fairy / Flying typing is pretty mediocre, as it is weak to the ever-so-common Rock Slide as well as Thunderbolt, Iron Head, and Flash Cannon. It isn't terrible though, considering it has a Dragon immunity as well as resisting Fighting-type attacks, but Togekiss faces competition with Amoonguss, even after the Rage Powder nerf, and Clefable, which doesn't have weaknesses to Rock or Electric.

Moves
========

Follow Me is the main support move that you will be using the most often on Togekiss. Togekiss frequently runs only one attacking move, which is usually going to be either Air Slash or Dazzling Gleam. Air Slash, combined with Serene Grace, is great for netting flinches, while Dazzling Gleam is great for spread damage and inflicts more chip damage than Air Slash. Togekiss has two great options for speed control: Tailwind and Thunder Wave. Tailwind is a good option because it gives a blanket boost to your team as well as allowing your team to possibly outspeed Ground-types such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, while Thunder Wave is a more permanent form of speed control because it doesn't end, unlike Tailwind. Roost is for longevity and instant recovery and is a nice option over speed control if you are using Togekiss on a Trick Room team. Protect is here as it can provide protection for a turn should your opponent choose to double target Togekiss.

Set Details
========

The HP and Defense EVs allow Togekiss to survive an Iron Head from Life Orb Bisharp and Jolly Mega Metagross. With Sitrus Berry, it is also only 4HKOed by Rock Slide from Landorus-T. The Speed EVs allow Togekiss to outrun Rotom-W outside of Tailwind and Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T under Tailwind. A Relaxed or Bold nature with 0 Speed EVs for Trick Room works. A Calm nature can be use to sponge special attacks. If you're running Air Slash, Serene Grace is the best ability, while Dazzling Gleam is best paired with Super Luck.

Usage Tips
========

Togekiss should spam Follow Me until its partner no longer needs redirection support or Togekiss faints. If your opponent has a Pokemon that uses spread moves, such as Mega Charizard Y or Tyranitar, it is better to just use an attacking move or status them if you choose to run Thunder Wave. Togekiss is pretty predictable, as it mainly spams Follow Me, so it is likely that your opponent will double target Togekiss in anticipation of this. In that case, it is a good idea to use Protect.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that benefit from speed control and redirection support, especially those that are weak to Fighting- or Dragon-types, such as Mega Kangaskhan, are great partners for Togekiss. Pokemon that spam Earthquake, such as Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Landorus-T, are great partners too. Examples of Pokemon benefiting from redirection support are Trick Room setters, such as Cresselia and Jellicent, and frail Pokemon such as Breloom. Setup attackers, in general, are great partners too. Examples are Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Salamence; the latter is a great partner due to Togekiss's immunities to Dragon and Ground, which allows Salamence to use Earthquake freely.


Other Options
########

A Choice Specs set with Dazzling Gleam, Air Slash, Fire Blast, and Aura Sphere can be used. Togekiss also has a myriad of support moves to choose from such as Reflect, Light Screen, and Safeguard. Lum Berry, Wacan Berry, and Babiri Berry are alternate item choices; the former can protect Togekiss from status while the latter two can mitigate Togekiss's weaknesses. Mental Herb is another choice if you're afraid of Taunt. Other alternate item choices are Safety Goggles and Leftovers, which can be used if item clause limits Togekiss from using Sitrus Berry or Rocky Helmet. Another option is a Choice Scarf set that capitalizes on Air Slash's flinch chance, but it isn't that great due to Togekiss's lack of a strong Fairy-type STAB move.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Steel-types generally cause a lot of problems for Togekiss, as they are able to do massive damage to it. Mega Metagross, Mega Mawile, and Bisharp can take a chunk out of Togekiss's HP because its Defense stat is lower than its Special Defense. Mega Mawile is also able to outspeed Togekiss under Trick Room while Mega Metagross and Bisharp can outrun Togekiss without speed control. Heatran and Aegislash are both problems as well, as both of them can easily set up a Substitute if they're running it. They can also tank both of Togekiss's STAB moves really easily.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types are able to hit Togekiss for super effective damage, which can allow them to easily whittle it down. Rotom-W, Rotom-H, Zapdos, and Thundurus can take a chunk out of Togekiss's HP even with minimal investment; Thundurus can also Taunt Togekiss. Additionally, they're immune to Thunder Wave and resist what is arguably Togekiss's best STAB moveâ€”Air Slash.

**Rock Slide**: STAB Rock Slide from Pokemon such as Terrakion and Tyranitar hurts, though Togekiss can tank some of the weaker Rock Slides.

**Taunt Users**: Taunt completely shuts Togekiss down, making it rely on its weak STAB moves. Pokemon such as Thundurus, Gengar, and Aerodactyl are huge problems for Togekiss. Thundurus can hit Togekiss for super effective damage with Thunderbolt, while Gengar can do the same with Sludge Bomb. Aerodactyl has access to Rock Slide and Sky Drop, which nullify Follow Me.
