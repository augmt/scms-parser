Overview
########

Mega Kangaskhan's unique ability, Parental Bond, allows it to hit with a move a second time at 50% of its total power, making it a powerhouse. This combined with coverage moves such as Ice Punch and Low Kick makes Mega Kangaskhan quite difficult to deal with.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Return / Double-Edge
move 2: Power-Up Punch / Low Kick
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Fake Out
ability: Scrappy
item: Kangaskhanite
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Return is the main STAB move of this set, as it hits hard without any other negative effects; however, Double-Edge can be used to allow Mega Kangaskhan to hit harder but with recoil. After a Power-Up Punch, Mega Kangaskhan can KO most common threats in VGC with ease. Low Kick can be used over Power-Up Punch to OHKO Pokemon that are weak to it, such as opposing Mega Kangaskhan and Hydreigon. Ice Punch can also be used in that moveslot, as it hits two common Intimidate users, Landorus-T and Salamence, as well as Amoonguss, super effectively. Sucker Punch is needed on this set, as it is the only move that Mega Kangaskhan can hit Ghost-types with after Mega Evolving; it's the only move on the set that has priority and a decent Base Power. Fake Out is an incredibly useful utility move, allowing Kangaskhan to Mega Evolve safely.

Set Details
========

The EV spread allows Mega Kangaskhan to outspeed many threat and to hit as hard as possible. As Mega Kangaskhan has only one weakness and decent bulk, it can survive many hits without any investment in bulk. 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Mega Kangaskhan to outspeed Mega Charizard Y. An Adamant nature allows Mega Kangaskhan to deal significant damage against bulky Pokemon such as Sylveon, Amoonguss, and Rotom-A whilst still outspeeding many Pokemon.


Usage Tips
========
With an appropriate partner, Mega Kangaskhan can be an amazing lead Pokemon, as it can either Fake Out a foe and let its partner KO the foe, or just heavily damage a target, though there aren't many Pokemon that can survive Mega Kangaskhan's attacks after they have taken damage.


Team Options
========

Mega Kangaskhan has three main weakness: Fighting-types, status, and Intimidate. Defiant or Competitive users such as Bisharp or Milotic can deal with Intimidate users, making them good partners. Bulky Ghost-, Psychic-, Flying-, and Fairy-types, such as Aegislash, Thundurus, and Sylveon, make for good partners as well, as they are able to deal with Fighting-types with ease. Intimidate users, such as Landorus, Hitmontop, and Gyarados, are also able to deal with Fighting-types and other physical attackers. Will-O-Wisp users, such as Rotom-A and Sableye, and Thunder Wave users, such as Thundurus and Cresselia, can support Mega Kangaskhan by inflicting its foes with status, allowing it to sweep more easily. Prankster users, such as Thundurus and Whimsicott, can also help with this.

Bulky Offensive
########
name: Bulky Offensive
move 1: Return / Double-Edge
move 2: Low Kick / Power-Up Punch
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Protect / Fake Out
ability: Scrappy
item: Kangaskhanite
evs: 92 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Def / 52 SpD / 68 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Return is the STAB move of choice, as it hits hard, though Double-Edge can be considered instead to hit harder but at the cost of some recoil. Low Kick can be used as a Fighting-type move to KO opposing Mega Kangaskhan. Power-Up Punch can also be used in that moveslot, as it allows Mega Kangaskhan to pseudo-bypass burns and Intimidate while helping Mega Kangaskhan boost its Attack. Sucker Punch covers Ghost-types and gives Mega Kangaskhan a priority move. Finally, Protect is used to guarantee Kangaskhan a completely safe Mega Evolution; it also protects Mega Kangaskhan from spread moves from its partner, such as Earthquake. Fake Out fits a more supportive role, dealing damage to a target, causing it to flinch, and allowing a partner to KO the target.

Set Details
========

The EV spread allows Mega Kangaskhan to take multiple hits with ease and hit as hard as possible. The defensive investment lets Mega Kangaskhan survive a max Attack Mega Kangaskhan's Low Kick, an Adamant max Attack Iron Fist Conkeldurr's Drain Punch, and a Modest max Special Attack Choice Specs Hydreigon's Draco Meteor. It also allows Mega Kangaskhan to avoid the 2HKO from Flash Cannon from Quiet max Special Attack Aegislash, which is one of Mega Kangaskhan's most solid counters. The Speed EVs allow Mega Kangaskhan to outspeed Pokemon with base 145 Speed and below under Tailwind, which helps a lot against fast offensive Pokemon, such as Mega Lucario and Mega Metagross. Kangaskhan can only outspeed Adamant max Speed Bisharp after Mega Evolving, however.

Usage Tips
========

This set is difficult to lead with if Mega Kangaskhan carries Protect, as it cannot use Fake Out and cause the foe to flinch, making it and its partner vulnerable to being KOed. Kangaskhan can easily KO bulky Pokemon when they have taken prior damage, so Mega Kangaskhan is useful for late-game cleaning. It also outspeeds quite a few Pokemon if Tailwind is set up, so Tailwind can be used to make Mega Kangaskhan shine mid-game.


Team Options
========

Although this set does not fear Fighting-types as much as the All-Out Attacker set does thanks to its extra bulk, it still has problems with status and Intimidate, making Defiant or Competitive users such as Bisharp or Milotic, respectively, good partners for Mega Kangaskhan. The only Fighting-type move that OHKOes Mega Kangaskhan is Close Combat, which Ghost-types such as Aegislash are immune to, and Flying- and Fairy-types such as Talonflame and Sylveon can easily OHKO most Close Combat users. An Intimidate user such as Landorus-T or Scrafty can also help Mega Kangaskhan stay on the field longer. Because Mega Kangaskhan appreciates Tailwind support, bulky Tailwind users such as Zapdos and Togekiss make for good partners. Fighting-types such as Mega Lucario can OHKO Mega Kangaskhan even after Intimidate, making Follow Me or Rage Powder users, such as Amoonguss and Togekiss, imperative. Sableye, Klefki, and Rotom-W are problematic, so a fast Prankster and Taunt user such as Thundurus also makes for a good partner.

Other Options
########

Mega Kangaskhan is crippled by status, so Facade can be used to allow it to hit through burn with a 140 Base Power move that is boosted by STAB. Mega Kangaskhan can also run Fire Punch if your team has trouble dealing with Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Gourgeist. Drain Punch can be used instead of Low Kick to gain more longevity. Crunch can be used over Sucker Punch to avoid playing mind games with the foe. Special moves such as Ice Beam and Fire Blast can be used if you don't wish to to take passive damage from Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, or Rough Skin by using a physical move. Finally, though Mega Kangaskhan has a decent Speed stat, it still can be used successfully in Trick Room teams, as Hammer Arm halves its Speed, making it extremely "fast" in Trick Room.


Checks and Counters
########

**Intimidate and Burns**: As Mega Kangaskhan is a physical attacker, Intimidate users, such as Landorus-T, Mawile, and Scrafty, as well as Will-O-Wisp users, such as Rotom-A and Sableye, are able to cripple it and force it out or force it to have to use Power-Up Punch to boost its Attack.

**Aegislash and Gengar**: Aegislash can only be hit by Sucker Punch or the rare Crunch and doesn't take much damage from a Scrappy Low Kick and Return, unlike other Ghost-types. Also, Gengar can burn Kangaskhan or use another status move while it uses Sucker Punch, though it cannot take a Scrappy Return unlike Aegislash.

**Speed Control**: Mega Kangaskhan relies heavily on its Speed, which makes it useless against Trick Room, Thunder Wave, and Icy Wind users, such as Cresselia.

**Double Targeting**: As Protect is not a common move on Mega Kangaskhan it is vulnerable to double targeting. Fake Out sets are also susceptible to other faster Fake Out users. If Mega Kangaskhan hits itself in confusion after getting its Attack boosted by Power-Up Punch it will also be extremely easy for a foe to KO it.

**Strong Fighting-type Moves**: Fighting-type moves, such as Superpower, Low Kick, and Close Combat, are Mega Kangaskhan's only weakness, and it's not able to survive Fighting-type moves easily, especially because they are extremely common.

**Iron Barbs/Rocky Helmet/Rough Skin**: Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, and Iron Barbs handle Kangaskhan quite well, as they make Mega Kangaskhan take damage every time it attacks; this is made even worse if Mega Kangaskhan runs Double-Edge, which already has recoil. Mega Kangaskhan can easily be KOed after taking recoil damage from Double Edge.
