Overview
########

Clefable is one of the rare Pokemon in VGC that has access to the invaluable move Follow Me, and its typing makes it perfect for the role of a Follow Me support Pokemon. Clefable has a versatile movepool with both support and offensive options. It does, however, have pretty low stats with none over base 100. Clefable also faces competition from Togekiss, which has better stats, and Amoonguss, which has played a big part in VGC ever since its introduction. However, Clefable is still a good pick for a support Pokemon as its pure Fairy typing synergizes better with other Pokemon unlike Amoonguss and Togekiss.

Moves
========

Follow Me provides your Clefable's team with redirection support. Ice Beam and Moonblast are both good in their own right and the choice between the two depends on what coverage the team needs. Heal Pulse allows Clefable to heal up bulkier Pokemon such as Aegislash and Mega Venusaur or keep its ally out of KO range. Helping Hand allows Clefable to boost the power of its ally's attack. Clefable has access to two forms of speed control: Icy Wind and Thunder Wave. Icy Wind can be used over Ice Beam or Moonblast, and Thunder Wave can replace Helping Hand or Heal Pulse. Finally, Protect shields Clefable from being double targeted and can give its team a free turn.

Set Details
========

The HP and Defense EVs allow Clefable to live an Iron Head from Life Orb Adamant Bisharp. Clefable can survive most special attacks in the metagame, bar Mega Charizard Y's Overheat, so it is alright to run minimal Special Defense investment. With Unaware, Clefable can more easily handle a boosted Pokemon's hits, such as Defiant-boosted Bisharp and Power-Up Punch Mega Kangaskhan; but if you have more than one Intimidate or Snarl user, switching to Magic Guard is probably your best bet (note: Unaware does not ignore Icy Wind Speed debuffs). Alternate EVs include dropping some Defense for some Special Attack investment (36 Special Attack EVs allow Clefable to OHKO Scarf Landorus-T with Ice Beam) or more Speed (12 Speed EVs allow Clefable to outrun Bisharp after an Icy Wind). Depending on the team, more Special Defense can be used. On a Trick Room team, Clefable can run a Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs.
Usage Tips
========

Most often, Clefable should use Follow Me the most for redirecting attacks such as Close Combat and Draco Meteor. Clefable should also use Icy Wind, Helping Hand, and Thunder Wave often so that it can create safe plays for its partners.

Team Options
========

Boosting Pokemon and those that share a weakness with Togekiss work really well with Clefable. Pokemon such as Mega Salamence greatly benefit from the support provided by Clefable, which, unlike Togekiss, does not share a weakness with Mega Salamence. Mega Metagross and Mega Kangaskhan are both benefited by Clefable's support, as Clefable resists both Dark and Fighting. Trick Room setters such as Cresselia, Chandelure, and Jellicent are also great partners for Clefable. Common physical and special attackers pair well with Clefable. Physically attacking partners for Clefable include Terrakion and Conkeldurr, while specially attacking teammates can include Hydreigon, Latios, and Mega Camerupt.

Other Options
########

Wish and Moonlight are both viable recovery options for Clefable. Aromatherapy allows Clefable to heal itself and its teammates of status. Fake Tears allows Clefable to lower a foe's Special Defense by two stages. Dual Screens in conjunction with Gravity are other options that Clefable has at its disposal. Finally, Clefable also has a pretty large offensive movepool that includes Fire Blast, Dazzling Gleam, Thunderbolt, Psychic, and Shadow Ball.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Powerful Steel-types that can hit hard such as Mega Metagross, Mega Mawile, Aegislash, Heatran, and Bisharp all do a great job at checking Clefable. Aegislash, Metagross, and Heatran are especially threatening as they can easily set up a Substitute on Clefable.
**Spread Moves**: Spread moves such as Rock Slide, Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave, Earthquake, and Blizzard can't be redirected so users of these moves can whittle Clefable down.
**Mega Venusaur**: Mega Venusaur is a great counter to Clefable, as it can tank both of Clefable's most common attacks, not to mention that Venusaur isn't really that affected by speed control. Mega Venusaur can also deal massive damage with Sludge Bomb and can use Leech Seed to stall Unaware Clefable.
**Taunt**: Since Clefable's moveset is mainly supporting moves, Taunt users such as Gengar and Thundurus do a great job at shutting Clefable down.
