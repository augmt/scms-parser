Overview
########

Swellow is an amazing late-game sweeper with its Guts-boosted attacks and amazing Speed. Its immunities and resistances, coupled with pivoting moves and double switches, make it easy for Swellow to switch in relatively safely and activate its Toxic Orb. However, Swellow is extremely frail, and its weakness to Stealth Rock makes it hard to switch in too often. A surprise Choice Specs set can catch many of Swellow's normal checks and counters off-guard and doesn't require any setup, though it is still walled by the common Rock- and Steel-types in the metagame. Because of this, Swellow should generally be saved for the later stages of the game when these Pokemon have been removed.

Guts
########
name: Guts
move 1: Facade
move 2: Brave Bird
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Quick Attack / Protect
ability: Guts
item: Toxic Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Facade is Swellow's best STAB move after Guts is activated. Brave Bird is a good secondary STAB move that allows Swellow to hit Ghost-types hard, but it must be used sparingly due to Swellow's low HP. U-turn allows Swellow to switch out against its checks and counters while still dealing damage, though you should avoid switching Swellow in too often due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Quick Attack allows Swellow to defeat Sucker Punch users and damage opposing priority and Choice Scarf users. Protect is also an option that makes it easy to activate Swellow's Toxic Orb, though it becomes significantly less useful afterwards.

Set Details
========

A status Orb is required in order to activate Guts, as Toxic poison or burn together with Guts allow Swellow to hit extremely hard. A Toxic Orb is preferred, but a Flame Orb may be used to deal less damage to Swellow over the course of four turns, though Swellow should not be staying in for more than three turns unless it is in a position to sweep. To maximize Swellow's sweeping capabilities, Attack and Speed are fully invested in. The remaining 4 EVs are placed in Defense to slightly improve Swellow's ability to withstand priority moves, and more importantly allow Swellow to maintain an odd HP stat in order to switch into Stealth Rock four times. A Jolly nature is used so that Swellow can outspeed as many threats as possible.

Usage Tips
========

If Swellow is not using Protect, it will have to rely on pivot moves and double switches to activate Toxic Orb. Timing and prediction are key in this regard and in using Swellow in general. One should try to activate Swellow's Toxic Orb as soon as possible so that Swellow has more utility throughout the battle. Early- or mid-game, Swellow should mainly be using U-turn in order to wear down its checks and counters. Just don't bring Swellow into battle too often, as its weakness to Stealth Rock will quickly deplete Swellow's valuable HP. Always try to predict when your opponent is switching in a Pokemon that resists one of Swellow's moves; Swellow cannot afford to waste turns because it loses HP so quickly due to Stealth Rock and Toxic damage.

Team Options
========

Slow Volt Switch, U-turn, and Baton Pass users such as Probopass, Lanturn, and Musharna are highly recommended in order to safely activate Swellow's Toxic Orb. Swellow already loses HP from Toxic damage and does not appreciate more residual damage from Stealth Rock, so spinners or Defoggers such as Sandslash, Cryogonal, or Pelipper are very useful teammates. As most of Swellow's counters are grounded, Spikes users such as Garbodor and Accelgor are excellent teammates that can wear them down via usage of said Spikes. Fighting- and Ground-types such as Gurdurr, Choice Band Sawk, and Golurk are great teammates that beat the Rock- and Steel-types that wall Swellow. Teammates that use Rock- and Steel-types as setup opportunities, such as Gorebyss, Leafeon, and Feraligatr, are great teammates that make use of the momentum Swellow gains with U-turn.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Boomburst
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Endeavor
move 4: Hidden Power Fighting
ability: Scrappy
item: Choice Specs
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Boomburst is a STAB move that is able to hit Ghost-types due to Scrappy, bypass Substitute, and make up for Swellow's lackluster Special Attack stat with its high Base Power. U-turn allows Swellow to maintain momentum when your opponent brings in their main check or counter. Endeavor makes use of Swellow's Stealth Rock weakness and frailty to cripple most Pokemon, most notably Steel- or Rock-types. Hidden Power Fighting is used solely to hurt Steel- and Rock-types, most notably Air Balloon Probopass and Pawniard, when they are weakened or when Swellow is at high enough health for Endeavor to be useless. Hidden Power Water can be used instead of Hidden Power Fighting for more damage against Golem and Rhydon, but it lacks power against Steel-types. Sleep Talk is also an option for the last slot, as it makes Swellow an effective sleep absorber. However, it should only be used with Boomburst and U-turn in order to avoid Sleep Talk selecting Endeavor or Hidden Power.

Set Details
========

Choice Specs is the only option for an item, as Swellow lacks power otherwise due to its poor Special Attack stat. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed raises Swellow's damage output. The remaining 4 EVs are placed in Defense to slightly improve Swellow's ability to withstand priority moves, but more importantly to allow Swellow to maintain an odd HP stat in order to switch into Stealth Rock four times. A Timid nature allows Swellow to outspeed as many threats as possible. A Modest nature can be used instead to increase Swellow's damage output, but it would no longer outspeed positive-natured base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Archeops. Scrappy is the best ability for this set, as it allows Boomburst to hit Ghost-types.

Usage Tips
========

This set works best as a lure for most physically defensive Pokemon, such as Weezing, Qwilfish, and Granbull, wearing them down for Swellow's physically offensive teammates. During the early stages of the game, make use of U-turn to scout your opponent's initial check or counter to Swellow. In order to accomplish this, Swellow should only switch in after one of your Pokemon faints in order to maintain the facade of the Guts set as long as possible. If your opponent's main check or counter to a physical Swellow set is a physically defensive Pokemon, striking them with Boomburst is also an effective strategy to allow Swellow's teammates to take advantage of their weakened defensive Pokemon. Swellow is best used as a revenge killer, though it does very well as a late-game sweeper. If Swellow is at low health while its counters are still healthy, it is best to simply cripple them with Endeavor and allow Swellow's teammates to take advantage of the situation. Hidden Power should only be used when it inflicts super effective damage and Boomburst is resisted, as otherwise you are better off using Boomburst.

Team Options
========

This set allows Swellow to cripple many of its usual checks and counters, so Pokemon that share counters with the Guts set, such as Sawk, Gurdurr, Zangoose, and Barbaracle, make good teammates. In addition, Pokemon such as Golurk, Sawk, and Magmortar that can beat Rock- and Steel-types are good teammates. Rock- and Steel-types are also great setup opportunities for Pokemon such as Gorebyss, Leafeon, and Feraligatr, which can make great use of the momentum Swellow gains from U-turn. Spinners and Defoggers such as Sandslash, Cryogonal, and Pelipper are useful teammates that help to keep Stealth Rock from whittling away at Swellow's HP.

Other Options
########

Roost can be used alongside a Flame Orb on the Guts set to keep Swellow healthy, but Swellow prefers to be a hit-and-run attacker early-game, and it does not require longevity when it sweeps late-game. Defog can be used on either set, but being locked into it allows your opponent to set up, and Guts Swellow prefers to attack. An Agility + Baton Pass set can be used, but Ninjask is simply better at passing Speed boosts. Air Slash can be used as a secondary STAB move for the Choice Specs set, but the flinch chance does not make up for the fact that Boomburst hits almost everything harder than Air Slash does. A Choice Band + Scrappy set can be used, but it does not beat anything that the Guts set does not. Pursuit can be used on the Guts set, as Swellow forces many switches, but Swellow generally does not have room for it. Heat Wave is a good move for the Choice Specs set, but it is incompatible with Boomburst, which is the main draw of the set.

Checks & Counters
########

**Rock- and Steel-types**: Pokemon such as Probopass, Regirock, and specially defensive Steelix completely wall Swellow that lack Endeavor. However, Probopass must be wary of Hidden Power Fighting.

**Priority Moves**: Most priority moves can cripple Swellow, while Sucker Punch forces Swellow to play around it.

**Faster Pokemon**: Due to its frailty, Swellow can easily be revenge killed by most faster Pokemon, as long as they can hit it at least neutrally. Of course, as Swellow is naturally very fast, most Pokemon that outspeed it carry Choice Scarf.

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Pokemon with decent special bulk such as Audino and Assault Vest Muk tank most attacks from Choice Specs Swellow, although they lose to physical variants.

**Physically Defensive Pokemon**: Granbull, Avalugg, Piloswine, and Uxie are some examples of physically defensive Pokemon that can withstand at least one attack from Guts Swellow and retaliate, though many of these Pokemon lose to the Choice Specs set.
