Overview
########

Stoutland faces a lot of competition from the other offensive Normal-types in the tier: Kangaskhan, Zangoose, Tauros, and Bouffalant outperform it in almost every role. Stoutland, however, stands out as one of NU's two Sand Rush sweepers and boasts good coverage, power, and decent bulk. Unfortunately, sand is not such a great playstyle because of its reliance on matchup and it cannot beat rain or sun teams easily.

Sand Rush Sweeper
########
name: Sand Rush Sweeper
move 1: Return
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Superpower
move 4: Play Rough
ability: Sand Rush
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Return is a powerful STAB move that hits very hard. Crunch is a coverage move to hit Ghost-types. Superpower weakens or outright KOes most Rock- or Steel-types. Finally, Play Rough is used to to damage Fighting-types, even 2HKOing Gurdurr.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Attack and Speed. An Adamant nature is used to hit as hard as possible, allowing Stoutland to nab some important KOs. For example, Adamant Stoutland always 2HKOes Gurdurr with Return after Stealth Rock damage. A Jolly nature allows Stoutland to outrun non-Choice Scarf Adamant Sawk and Timid Ludicolo outside of sand, but Stoutland should not attempt to sweep outside of sand anyway. Choice Band is used for maximum power; a Life Orb can be considered, but the power drop is quite noticeable. Life Orb also cuts into Stoutland's above-average bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Sand should always be set up before Stoutland tries to sweep. In addition, you should try to predict switch-ins to Stoutland where appropriate to avoid wasting precious sand turns. It is better to eliminate Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types before sweeping with Stoutland so that it can spam Return. Stoutland can be played as either a wallbreaker or a sweeper; it can either wear down bulky opponents for its teammates or sweep with sand up once its checks and counters are KOed.

Team Options
========

Hippopotas with Sand Stream is a compulsory teammate because Stoutland is mediocre outside of sand. Sandslash is another good Sand Rush sweeper, working together with Stoutland to break down opposing teams. Cacturne can be considered on sand teams thanks to its ability, Sand Veil, and Spikes, which aid its teammates. Other entry hazard users, such as Qwilfish, Crustle, and Rhydon, are good teammates to help Stoutland grab more KOs. For example, Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes ensure 2HKOs on Qwilfish, Gourgeist-XL, specially defensive Steelix, and Rhydon with the appropriate move. Rock-types are good teammates that take advantage of sand's Special Defense boost. In particular, Carracosta makes use of the boost extremely well, in conjunction with good physical bulk and Solid Rock to set up Shell Smash. Pursuit Spiritomb is also another good teammate for its ability to trap and KO troublesome Ghost-types that prevent Stoutland from freely using Return.

Other Options
########

Sleep Talk is a good alternative to Play Rough that allows Stoutland to absorb sleep. A bulky tank set with Intimidate and Thunder Wave can be considered. A Choice Band Scrappy set can be run, but it faces competition from the faster Kangaskhan. Wild Charge can be used to 2HKO Qwilfish, but it is not worth it because Return accomplishes the same thing after Stealth Rock and some prior damage. Stoutland gets Roar, but it would generally prefer to attack rather than phaze. Stoutland also gets Facade to switch into and take advantage of status moves, although it is quite situational. Pursuit could be used, but Ghost-types don't usually switch out of Stoutland, making this inferior to Crunch.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Rock- and Steel-types**: Rhydon, Regirock, Steelix, and Ferroseed can easily defeat Stoutland, especially if they have defensive investment. Variants that do not invest in Defense are still rather safe because they can avoid being 2HKOed if they do not switch into Superpower.

**Ghost-types**: Bulky Ghost-types are hard checks to Stoutland. Gourgeist-XL, if it avoids Crunch, can get off a Will-O-Wisp or a Leech Seed onto Stoutland or one of its teammates. Offensive Ghost-types, including Haunter and Mismagius, can check Stoutland too, if they predict around Crunch.

**Opposing weather**: Opposing rain or sun teams cut Stoutland's Speed and leave it vulnerable. It is an almost impossible matchup for sand teams because opposing weather teams usually have multiple weather starters, some of which have Prankster.

**Gurdurr**: Gurdurr can't switch in on Return or Play Rough, but it can beat Stoutland one-on-one with a combination of Drain Punch and Mach Punch.

**Priority users**: Priority users, such as Kangaskhan and Feraligatr, usually can't do a lot of damage to Stoutland because it is relatively bulky. However, they can easily finish it off once weakened.

**Lack of sand**: Once Hippopotas is KOed and sand stops, Stoutland is much slower and easier to defeat.
