Overview
########
Marowak has two unique traits that make it stand out: Thick Club and Bonemerang. Thick Club doubles Marowak's Attack, while Bonemerang hits twice and therefore through Sturdy, Focus Sash, and Substitute. This gives Marowak a niche in NU as a powerful Ground-type attacker, with Thick Club maximizing Marowak's Attack at 568. With access to Stealth Rock, Marowak can also function as a lead, and it has decent physical bulk between its high Defense and its average HP. However, despite its massive power and decent utility, Marowak's low Speed and mediocre special bulk often hold it back, and its reliance on its item is a liability against the very common Knock Off.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Bonemerang
move 2: Double-Edge
move 3: Substitute / Stealth Rock
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Rock Head
item: Thick Club
evs: 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
Bonemerang is a STAB move that hits twice with 50 Base Power on each hit, allowing it to KO opponents through Sturdy, Focus Sash, and Substitute. However, it does not have perfect accuracy; Earthquake is an alternative with 100% accuracy. Double-Edge is a powerful coverage move with no recoil thanks to Marowak's ability, Rock Head. Substitute can be used to ease prediction, while Stealth Rock allows Marowak to function well as a lead. Knock Off is another great coverage move, hitting Ghost-types that use Levitate. Stone Edge can be used instead of Double-Edge to hit Flying-types super effectively, but Double-Edge is more reliable.

Set Details
========
Maximum Attack investment is used for the largest possible damage output, while 216 Speed EVs allow Marowak to outpace Jolly Carracosta and max Speed Rhydon, as well as uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon and negative-natured Seismitoad. The remaining EVs are placed in HP to slightly increase Marowak's bulk. Thick Club doubles Marowak's Attack, while Rock Head prevents recoil damage from Double-Edge.

Usage Tips
========
Try to avoid being hit by Knock Off, because without Thick Club, Marowak has mediocre Attack. Bring Marowak in on Pokemon that it outspeeds or on those that cannot do much to it offensively. If bringing it in on a slower offensive threat, do so through a double switch or a pivoting move such as Volt Switch and U-turn. Use Substitute on predicted switches or when you know a Pokemon is about to go for a non-attacking move. Marowak can be used as an anti-lead, breaking Focus Sash and Sturdy with Bonemerang and limiting Spikes setters such as Garbodor and Qwilfish to only one layer. However, be wary of Omastar, Torterra, and Seismitoad, as Omastar can OHKO Marowak with Scald and Torterra and Seismitoad can survive an attack from Marowak and KO it in return.

Team Options
========
Fairy-types such as Granbull and Slurpuff are good teammates for Marowak, as they can easily switch in on Knock Off. Bulky Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Vileplume can switch into Water- and Grass-type moves aimed at Marowak and either set up entry hazards in the case of Ferroseed or threaten back with STAB Sludge Bomb and Giga Drain in the case of Vileplume. Entry hazard support from a Pokemon such as Omastar or Crustle can give Marowak an easier time KOing opponents. Sticky Web setters such as Kricketune and Ariados can give Marowak the ability to outspeed several threats that would otherwise outspeed it. Paralysis support also accomplishes this.

Other Options
########
Do not run any item other than Thick Club. Fire Punch is an option to OHKO Ferroseed and to hit other Grass-types slightly harder than with Double-Edge. Swords Dance boosts Marowak's Attack even more and can help it OHKO walls like Ferroseed or Vileplume, though Marowak will find few opportunities to use it against offensive teams.

Checks & Counters
########
**Removal of Thick Club**: Moves that result in the removal of Thick Club, such as Knock Off and Trick, effectively halve Marowak's Attack stat, seriously hampering its offensive capabilities.

**Special Sweepers**: Faster special sweepers such as Sceptile and Ludicolo can take advantage of Marowak's low Special Defense to OHKO it with super effective STAB attacks.

**Defensive Grass-type Resists**: Tangela and Quilladin resist Marowak's STAB moves and can threaten Marowak with their Grass-type STAB moves; note that Ferroseed and Vileplume do not fall under this category as both of them are 2HKOed by Marowak's STAB moves.

**Will-O-Wisp**: Burns halve Marowak's Attack, tremendously reducing its offensive presence.
