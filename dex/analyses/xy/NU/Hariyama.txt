Overview
########

Despite having low base Speed, an intense case of four-moveslot syndrome, and weaknesses to common attacking types, Hariyama acts as one of the best special tanks in the tier. Thanks to a monstrous base HP stat and two amazing abilities in Thick Fat and Guts, Hariyama finds a niche as a solid switch-in to many Fire and Ice-type attacks and status inducing moves alike. A huge Attack stat, access to Close Combat, incredible coverage options, and even priority such as Fake Out and Bullet Punch mean Hariyama can also pose a threat as an attacker.

Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Close Combat
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Bullet Punch
move 4: Fake Out / Earthquake
ability: Thick Fat / Guts
item: Assault Vest
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Close Combat is an incredibly powerful STAB option that will destroy anything that isn't resistant or immune to it. The only downside to this attack is the stat drop in both defenses, though this can be mitigated by switching out. Knock Off provides excellent coverage with Close Combat, as Fighting and Dark coverage is only resisted by Fairy-types and allows Hariyama to damage Psychic- and Ghost-types that would otherwise freely switch in on Close Combat. Knock Off has the added benefit of removing the foe's item, which is great for Hariyama because most Fairy-types don't appreciate having their item removed, as well as serving as a way to cripple the various Eviolite users in the tier. Bullet Punch provides extremely useful priority, allowing Hariyama to pick off weakened foes such as Archeops and Jynx. Fake Out is another form of priority that allows Hariyama to get useful chip damage which can rack up quickly with entry hazard support. It also gives Hariyama the ability to stall out turns of weather and Trick Room. Earthquake is good coverage for common Poison-type switch-ins, such as Garbodor and Qwilfish, which resist Hariyama's STAB Close Combat. Heavy Slam is a niche option that allows Hariyama to surprise Granbull and Togetic on the switch in. Factoring in Stealth Rock damage, Heavy Slam scores a 2HKO on defensive Togetic and has a chance to 2HKO defensive Granbull. Ice Punch is an option that can allow Hariyama to deal a respectable amount of damage to Vileplume and Scyther.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment allows Hariyama to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Special Defense investment adds more overall bulk on the special side than maximum HP investment would. Thick Fat allows Hariyama to switch into most Fire- and Ice-type attacks easily. Guts is another option that allows Hariyama to take on Will-O-Wisp users such as Pyroar, Mismagius, and Rotom without the fear of getting burned. It should also be noted that an alternative EV spread of 252 Atk / 128 Def / 128 SpD can be used to avoid the OHKO from Jolly Choice Band Sawk's Close Combat 100% of the time, as well as take a plethora of physical attacks better.

Usage Tips
========

Thanks to Thick Fat, Hariyama acts as a solid switch-in to special attacking Fire- and Ice-types such as Cryogonal, Typhlosion, and Pyroar. Hariyama can use Fake Out to stall turns of Trick Room and weather while also scoring crucial chip damage on faster offensive Pokemon. It should be noted that while Close Combat is extremely powerful, the defense drops can be troublesome for Hariyama due to its naturally low Speed stat. For example, faster Substitute users such as Klinklang can attempt to score KOs that they normally couldn't on Hariyama by forcing it to lower its defenses with Close Combat to break their Substitute.

Team Options
========

Hariyama pairs well with Pokemon weak to Fire and Ice, as they appreciate Hariyama's ability to switch in on Pokemon such as Cryogonal and Typhlosion. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Vileplume, and Rhydon, which can handle strong physical attackers such as Feraligatr and Kangaskhan, pair well with Hariyama. Other good defensive teammates include Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon such as Steelix, Probopass, and Rhydon, which can take powerful Flying-type attacks aimed at Hariyama and set up Stealth Rock. Bulkier Psychic-type Pokemon such as Uxie and Xatu can take pretty much every Fairy- and Psychic-type attack aimed at Hariyama. Rapid Spinners and Defoggers such as Cryogonal, Togetic, and Prinplup allow Hariyama to switch into strong attacks more easily by clearing the field of entry hazards. Wish and Healing Wish users such as Audino, Mesprit, and Lilligant can allow Hariyama to continuously take hits in the late-game; this is extremely helpful, as Hariyama has no other way of recovering HP. If Hariyama needs to fulfill a more offensive role on its team, Spikes or Toxic Spikes setters such as Garbodor and Qwilfish allow Hariyama to rack up damage quickly with Fake Out.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Close Combat
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Earthquake / Facade
move 4: Bullet Punch
ability: Guts
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 116 Def / 140 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Close Combat is a STAB move that hits hard, and with a Guts boost, even Pokemon that resist it won't appreciate switching in on one. Close Combat's defense drops are less of an issue to offensive Hariyama, but it's something to keep in mind. Knock Off provides great coverage with Close Combat and can remove items such as Eviolite and Leftovers from common Fairy-type switch-ins such as Togetic and Granbull. Facade is a great move for breaking down typical Fighting-type counters, such as Weezing and Vileplume, which commonly rely on status to combat Fighting-types. Earthquake offers super effective coverage against Qwilfish and Garbodor and gives Hariyama a way to hit Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage without lowering its defenses. Bullet Punch can be used to pick off weakened threats and frail attackers weak to it, such as Archeops and Jynx. Its increased priority also provides utility late-game. Ice Punch can be used to 2HKO defensive Vileplume while providing solid neutral coverage and hitting Flying-types for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

This set faces heavy competition from the likes of Sawk and Primeape, which are naturally faster, and in the case of Sawk, hit harder with similar coverage options. The main niche Hariyama has over other Choice Band Fighting-types is that it does not have to worry about status ailments, specifically burn, thanks to Guts. Choice Band is a solid option for teams that prefer to hit hard right away and value Hariyama's natural bulk a little more than Primeape or Sawk's. Guts is useful in these situations to avoid being crippled by Will-O-Wisp and Scald burns. The given EV spread allows Hariyama to outpace everything up to uninvested Lanturn, which Hariyama can hit before it Volt Switches out. Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature allow Hariyama to take full advantage of the Guts boost and hit foes hard. The remaining 116 EVs are thrown into Defense to allow Hariyama to pivot into physical attackers with greater ease.

Usage Tips
========

Hariyama should be used as a wallbreaker, aim to come in on bulkier Pokemon, and fire off powerful Choice Band-boosted attacks so that a teammate can sweep late-game. Thanks to Guts, Hariyama can switch in without much worry on bulky Water-types looking to score burns with Scald, such as Seismitoad and Lanturn. Hariyama can look to switch in on Pokemon that rely on status moves such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp to deal the majority of their damage, such as Audino and Gourgeist-XL. Make sure to watch out for Knock Off, as losing Hariyama's Choice Band can be devastating. Hariyama can come in on many of the Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon in the tier and threaten them out with a STAB Close Combat.

Team Options
========

Sticky Web setters such as Leavanny and Kricketune can ease Hariyama's troubles with faster Pokemon and give it more opportunities to fire off boosted attacks. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Crustle and Qwilfish can give Hariyama an even easier time breaking down the opposition. Other physical attackers appreciate having Pokemon such as Weezing and Granbull worn down. Feraligatr, Kangaskhan, and Klinklang all appreciate these Pokemon weakened in their attempts to sweep late-game. Trick Room support can be a useful form of speed control that takes advantage of Hariyama's subpar Speed. Notable setters are Carbink and Uxie, both of which have the ability to set up Stealth Rock and dual screens. If running this set with Trick Room support, an alternative EV spread of 252 Atk / 128 Def / 128 SpD, a Brave nature, and 0 Speed IVs will benefit more than a spread with Speed investment.

Other Options
########

Hariyama can opt to run a defensive RestTalk set to favor longevity over initial bulk, but it is significantly weaker than Assault Vest variants and foes can take advantage of turns during which Hariyama is forced to sleep. Hariyama can directly take advantage of Guts by activating it with either Flame Orb or Toxic Orb, though it's very likely that Hariyama will come across status in a match, and the extra residual damage can rack up quickly. Hariyama can use its other ability, Sheer Force, to boost the power of several of its moves, but this is typically inferior to a Choice Band set. Sets choosing to forgo Assault Vest in favor of Leftovers can utilize Toxic or Bulk Up instead of a coverage or priority move. Stone Edge can be used to hit Flying-types, such as Scyther, Mantine, Pelipper and Swanna, which would otherwise take negligible damage from Hariyama's other coverage options.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-type Pokemon such as Granbull, Togetic, and Mega Audino can hit Hariyama for super effective damage with their STAB move of choice and typically shrug off attacks such as Close Combat and Knock Off, or in Mega Audino's case, takes the hit and KO a Hariyama with lowered defenses. However, Togetic doesn't appreciate taking a Knock Off, and all three need to watch out for Heavy Slam.

**Bulky Poison-types**: Weezing, Garbodor, and Qwilfish all take minimal damage from Hariyama's attacks and can stack entry hazards against it. Weezing can burn Hariyama with Will-O-Wisp and use Pain Split to heal off any damage it takes.

**Flying-types**: Offensive Flying-types such as Scyther, Rotom-S, and Archeops can force Hariyama out with their powerful STAB attacks, with only Archeops taking much damage from any of Hariyama's coverage moves. Defensive Flying-types such as Pelipper and Mantine can shrug off any of Hariyama's attacks and support their team with Defog or choose to weaken Hariyama with their super effective STAB moves.

**Physical Attackers**: Strong physical attackers such as Kangaskhan, Feraligatr, and Sawk can overwhelm Hariyama fairly easily throughout the course of the match, forcing it to take entry hazard damage every time it has to switch out and come back in. While variants of Hariyama with 128 Defense EVs can take some physical attacks better, it's not recommended that it stay in to take these hits unless absolutely necessary.

**Psyshock Users**: Special attackers with access to Psyshock, such as Ninetales, Xatu, and Mesprit, can be troublesome for Hariyama, considering its Defense stat is typically weaker than its Special Defense stat. It should be noted that most common Psyshock users don't appreciate a Knock Off.
