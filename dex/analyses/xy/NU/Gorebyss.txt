Overview
########

Gorebyss's niche in NU lies in its access to the coveted combination of Shell Smash and Baton Pass. It has all the tools it needs to pull off a SmashPass effectively with decent physical bulk, enough Speed to pass against most threats at +2, and a strong matchup against common phazers such as Rhydon. As such, Gorebyss has several opportunities to pass a boost to a sweeper and possibly end the game for your opponent. However, Gorebyss fails to outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom and Rotom-S even at +2, leaving it vulnerable to being revenge killed. Its special bulk is also less than stellar, making it difficult to set up against powerful special attackers such as Mismagius. Perhaps most importantly, Gorebyss faces competition from Huntail, which has Sucker Punch to deal with Rotom. Nonetheless, Gorebyss's significantly better matchups against NU's most common phazers and Haze users are all that it needs to set itself apart from Huntail.

SmashPass
########
name: SmashPass
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Scald
move 4: Substitute / Hidden Power Electric
ability: Swift Swim
item: White Herb
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Shell Smash raises all of Gorebyss's offensive stats to high levels, and the boosts can be passed with Baton Pass to give one of Gorebyss's teammates a large boost to its offenses, making the recipient very difficult to stop. Scald is a reliable STAB attack that allows Gorebyss to attack when it needs to. The 30% chance to inflict a burn can give Gorebyss an easier time setting up if it gets lucky. Substitute helps Gorebyss safely set up a Shell Smash and lets it pass a shield to a teammate in order to protect it from status moves and weaker attacks. Alternatively, Hidden Power Electric deals serious damage to Mantine, who gives Gorebyss trouble if it is running Haze.

Set Details
========

White Herb removes the Defense and Special Defense drops from Shell Smash once. Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature make Gorebyss as fast as possible in order to be able to pass a Shell Smash before it takes a hit and to outspeed Swellow and Choice Scarf Mesprit at +2. Alternatively, full investment in Special Attack can maximize Gorebyss's offensive capabilities, but it is meant to be used as a supporter and not a sweeper.

Usage Tips
========

Due to Gorebyss's low Speed, it cannot set up a Shell Smash on most users of Taunt, such as Archeops. However, once Gorebyss gets to +2, it will outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and certain Choice Scarf users, though it still fails to outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom and Rotom-S. Ideally, Gorebyss should use slow, defensive Pokemon such as Uxie for setup bait, as well as Choice-locked Fire-types such as Typhlosion and Pyroar. If necessary, however, Gorebyss's decent bulk and good defensive typing allow it to set up on various offensive Pokemon. Generally, Gorebyss can set up a Shell Smash against most foes that cannot hit it super effectively, including offensive powerhouses such as Kangaskhan and Scyther. Gorebyss can attempt a late-game sweep if it needs to, but it should not be your team's primary sweeper because of its poor coverage and uninvested Special Attack.

Team Options
========

Bulky offensive Pokemon that appreciate boosts to their Speed and offensive stats, such as Mesprit, Kangaskhan, Malamar, and Samurott, are excellent recipients of Shell Smash. Gorebyss appreciates Pokemon that can take Grass- and Electric-type attacks aimed at it, such as Typhlosion and Rhydon, respectively. Dual screens support from Uxie makes it easier for Gorebyss to set up a Shell Smash and protects the recipient of Shell Smash from a revenge kill. Xatu makes for a great recipient of a Shell Smash boost because of Magic Bounce, which bounces back Whirlwind and Roar. Xatu also enjoys bouncing back Taunt against Pokemon that try to prevent Gorebyss from setting up a Shell Smash.

Other Options
########

Gorebyss can Baton Pass defensive stat boosts by use of Barrier and Amnesia, but it lacks the room and the Speed to use either boosting move effectively. Hydro Pump is a more powerful STAB move than Scald, but Scald hits hard enough as is, and Hydro Pump's shaky accuracy can cause problems. Focus Sash can be used over White Herb to survive a super effective hit from strong attackers such as Choice Specs Rotom, but Gorebyss's teammates will not appreciate receiving a drop to their defenses. Ice Beam hits the Grass-types that threaten Gorebyss, such as Tangela and Vileplume, while Signal Beam hits Ludicolo and Psychic-types such as Mesprit, Uxie, and Jynx. A fully offensive set consisting of Shell Smash and three attacks is usable, but slightly niche.

Checks & Counters
########

**Rotom and Rotom-S**: Choice Scarf Rotom and Rotom-S outspeed Gorebyss even at +2 and can usually OHKO Gorebyss with Thunderbolt if they carry it.

**Liepard**: Liepard's Prankster Encore allows it to lock Gorebyss into Shell Smash, meaning it can turn Shell Smash against Gorebyss entirely.

**Haze Users**: Cryogonal can survive a +2 Scald and either directly OHKO Gorebyss with Freeze-Dry or Haze away the Shell Smash boosts that Gorebyss has accumulated. Mantine can also Haze away Gorebyss's Shell Smash boosts, though it must be careful of Hidden Power Electric.

**Grass-types**: All Grass-types such as Tangela, Lilligant, and Ludicolo can directly switch into Gorebyss's Scald and force it out with their Grass-type STAB attacks.
