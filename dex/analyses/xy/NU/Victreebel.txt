Overview
########
Victreebel is a Pokemon that sun teams appreciate; with its ability Chlorophyll raising its Speed and its good offensive stats, it's a great sweeper. Victreebel's high Attack and Special Attack make it versatile. It resists five different types, which grants it many opportunities to switch in and either set up sun or boost both its offensive stats with Growth. Victreebel is resistant to common priority moves, such as Aqua Jet; this, however, doesn't make up for Victreebel's frailness, not to mention its poor Speed outside of sun.

evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
Solar Beam is a hard-hitting STAB move and Victreebel's main spamming attack; only use it when Sunny Day is up, as this bypasses its charging turn. Weather Ball, combined with the sun, is used to hit Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon, which resist Victreebel's STAB moves. Sludge Bomb is a reliable Poison-type attack with a 30% chance to poison the opponent; it allows Victreebel to hit Fire-type Pokemon neutrally and Fairy-type Pokemon, such as Slurpuff, super effectively. Sunny Day is an option instead of Sludge Bomb, as it benefits the rest of Victreebel's moves and gives it the Chlorophyll boost. However, there should be a sun setter on the team whether or not Victreebel is running Sunny Day. Sleep Powder is used for putting Pokemon to sleep and for Victreebel to proceed with firing off hard hits, switching out, or getting up sun. Growth is another option, as it allows Victreebel to boost its Special Attack and Attack; combining it with Sunny Day causes it to boost Victreebel's stats by two stages rather than one. Giga Drain can be used, as it doesn't rely on sun and still hits Water-type Pokemon hard enough, while getting some recovery back.

Set Details
========
Life Orb allows Victreebel to deal out as much damage as possible without getting locked into one move; it's not built on taking hits, so Victreebel wants to 2HKO or OHKO Pokemon as quickly as possible. Maximum Special Attack investment is also used to deal the highest amount of damage possible. The 252 EVs in Speed are used to ensure that Victreebel will outspeed most Pokemon when Sunny Day is up, due to Chlorophyll. A Timid nature can be used at the cost of some power; however, if you opt for Sleep Powder and Sunny Day, it helps Victreebel and the team by allowing it to outspeed neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon outside of sun, such as Adamant Kabutops and Modest Mesprit, and proceed to put them to sleep and set up the sun.

Usage Tips
========
Sun support is mandatory with this set; without it, Victreebel needs to waste a turn charging Solar Beam, and its Speed becomes a liability. With the sun, Weather Ball not only becomes a Fire-type move that can be used for hitting Steel-type Pokemon super effectively and Poison-type Pokemon neutrally, but it also gets a boost in Base Power to 150; without sun, it stays a Normal-type move and has a base power of 50. Victreebel can clean up Pokemon that are low on health near the end of the battle; it's a fast sweeper when in sun and is able to deal out powerful hits with its STAB Sludge Bomb and Solar Beam. Victreebel needs to utilize the sun turns well, as it only has 5-8 turns to use its attacks. Even if Sunny Day is used on Victreebel's set, you want another teammate to get up the sun.

Team Options
========
Sun setters, such as Liepard, Exeggutor, and Regirock, are appreciated, as Victreebel can't reliably set up Sunny Day by itself due to how frail it is. Liepard has priority on Sunny Day due to Prankster, and Exeggutor and Regirock can take hits much better than Victreebel. Entry hazard setters, such as Crustle, make great teammates, as they help wear down switch-ins to the point where Victreebel can OHKO or 2HKO them without taking an attack. Pokemon that resist Victreebel's weaknesses or can take them well, such as Assault Vest Hariyama for Fire-type attacks, are a great help; this is extra appreciated due to Victreebel's frailness. Victreebel also pairs well with other teammates that benefit from the sun, such as Typhlosion for the boost to Fire-type attacks, Sawsbuck for the Speed boost from Chlorophyll, and Exeggutor with its abilities Chlorophyll and Harvest.

Other Options
########
Hidden Power Fire is more reliable than Weather Ball, as it allows Victreebel to hit Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon respectively when sun isn't up. A mixed set can be used to hit specially defensive Pokemon like Audino harder. Encore can be used for locking Pokemon into one move so that Victreebel can either get a free turn to boost or set up sun. Sucker Punch is a priority attack that hits hard with its 80 Base Power. Swords Dance can be used over Growth for boosting the Attack stat by two stages if sun proves to be unreliable on the mixed set. Knock Off hits hard and removes the item of the opposing Pokemon. Leaf Blade has 100% accuracy, making it much more reliable than Power Whip, and still has 90 Base Power; it also has a high critical-hit ratio.

Checks & Counters
########

**Flying-types**: Flying-types, such as Archeops and Vivillon, can't switch in on Victreebel but can easily check it with their STAB attacks when the sun isn't up, forcing it to either switch out or get OHKOed due to its poor defensive stats. Double switches can force Victreebel into this situation against Archeops at full HP, which even Timid Victreebel can't outspeed, leaving it to take an Acrobatics or switch out; that the opponent can predict this and go for U-turn.

**Poison-types**: Poison-type Pokemon, such as Garbodor, can take both of Victreebel's STAB moves and wear Victreebel down with moves of their own to the point where it will get OHKOed or 2HKOed. Dragalge, unlike other Poison-types, also resists Weather Ball due to its Dragon typing, completely walling the special sun sweeper's attacks.

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Hariyama, and Audino, can take a hit or two and retaliate with their own attacks by 3HKOing or 2HKOing Victreebel. Lickilicky can come in on the turn Victreebel sets up Sunny Day or Growth, live a hit, and proceed to use Dragon Tail to force Victreebel out or Body Slam with the chance of Victreebel getting paralyzed.

**Liepard**: Liepard can check Victreebel with Prankster Encore by locking it in as it sets up Sunny Day or Growth; it can also go for priority Rain Dance while Victreebel has its sun up already. Liepard comes in on the turn that Victreebel is using Sunny Day, and Victreebel either gets locked into Encore or switches; the opponent can predict this and go for Thunder Wave on the incoming Pokemon or use U-turn to gain momentum.

**Kangaskhan**: Kangaskhan can waste sun turns with Fake Out by making Victreebel unable to attack one turn; Kangaskhan can also take one hit from Life Orb Solar Beam and hit back with Return. If Victreebel is already weakened because of its poor defenses, Kangaskhan can finish it off with Sucker Punch instead to avoid taking unnecessary damage.
