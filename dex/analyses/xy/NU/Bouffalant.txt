Overview
########

Unlike most other Normal-types commonly found in the tier, Bouffalant doesn't rely on Speed or access to priority to be effective, but rather on its amazing bulk. In addition, it boasts a great Attack stat and 3 useful abilities, each of which has its own unique uses and adds to Bouffalant's versatility. Bouffalant's movepool contains everything it could wish for, with the standout being its signature move Head Charge, a powerful move with minimal recoil. Unfortunately, Bouffalant sports a low Speed stat, which often prevents it from sweeping faster teams.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Return / Head Charge
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Substitute / Stone Edge
ability: Sap Sipper
item: Leftovers / Lum Berry
evs: 156 HP / 252 Atk / 100 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Swords Dance boosts Bouffalant's Attack stat to sky-high levels, allowing it to easily power through most physical walls. Return is a reliable STAB move with no drawbacks; Head Charge is a stronger option, though its recoil cuts into Bouffalant's bulk. Earthquake hits the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Bouffalant's Normal-type STAB moves. Substitute lets Bouffalant avoid status and allow it an easier time setting up. Stone Edge is Bouffalant's only way to hit Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Rotom, while also providing a stronger hit on Pokemon such as Archeops.

Set Details
========

100 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Lanturn, with full Attack investment used to maximize Bouffalant's power, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into HP to enhance Bouffalant's great natural bulk. Leftovers allows Bouffalant to make more Substitutes and stay around longer, and is also useful to negate Head Charge recoil if it is used. Sap Sipper provides Bouffalant with free switch-ins into Grass types such as Vileplume and Lilligant, turning them into setup bait. Soundproof is an alternative to absorb sound-based moves, but as there aren't many relevant ones in the NU metagame, it's usually not as useful. 216 HP / 72 Atk / 220 SpD with a Careful nature is an alternative spread to provide an easier time setting up against defensive Pokemon, specifically Vileplume, which can never break Bouffalant's Substitute with Sludge Bomb when using this spread. Lum Berry is helpful to avoid status if not running Substitute, as Bouffalant hates status.

Usage Tips
========

This set does best against bulky teams; Bouffalant should aim to set up on something that can't hurt it, and proceed to smash through the opposing team. When facing offensive teams, try to generate free switch-ins for Bouffalant, as frailer Pokemon absolutely hate having to switch in on it, but it can't do much if it takes damage when switching in.

Team Options
========

A Pursuit trapper is nice to have on your team, as Bouffalant hates facing Ghost-types (and Uxie, to an extent); Sneasel, Liepard, and Scyther all perform this job well. Having something to beat Gurdurr with, such as Mesprit, is also appreciated. Bouffalant despises Toxic Spikes, so having a Poison-type on your team to absorb them is recommended.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Head Charge
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Megahorn
ability: Reckless / Sap Sipper
item: Choice Band
evs: 156 HP / 252 Atk / 100 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Head Charge is a ridiculously strong STAB move, especially with a Reckless boost. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-types such as Regirock and Steelix, respectively. Stone Edge is Bouffalant's main option to hit Ghost-types and hits Archeops and Armaldo for super effective damage. Finally, Megahorn gets super effective coverage on Cradily. Pursuit is a cool option in the last slot to trap Mismagius and Rotom that lack Will-O-Wisp.

Set Details
========

100 Speed EVs allow Bouffalant to outpace Lanturn, while full Attack investment maximizes power; the rest of the EVs are thrown into HP to enhance Bouffalant's great natural bulk. Choice Band increases Bouffalant's power to jaw-dropping levels. Reckless significantly increases Head Charge's power, while Sap Sipper gives Bouffalant a handy immunity to Grass-type moves as well as potential Attack boosts.

Usage Tips
========

Head Charge is by far Bouffalant's strongest move; as such, it should be used as much as possible. Earthquake is useful to hit predicted switch-ins of Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhydon and Steelix, allowing it to weaken or outright beat them so that Bouffalant can spam Head Charge later on. Stone Edge should only be used to get rid of Archeops and Armaldo and to hit Ghost-types such as Mismagius or Rotom if not running Pursuit. If Pursuit is run, it should be used to trap those Ghost-types and get rid of them for teammates. Megahorn's only targets are Cradily and Gourgeist, which Bouffalant doesn't have a more effective move for.

Team Options
========

Pursuit support is very important if Bouffalant itself isn't running it, with Sneasel, Liepard, and Scyther being good teammates. Pokemon such as Mesprit also pair well with Bouffalant, as they can take advantage of Gurdurr. Pivots such as Lanturn and Probopass can provide free switch-ins for Bouffalant to wallbreak. Late-game sweepers such as Swords Dance Feraligatr appreciate having physical walls broken down to aid their sweep.

Other Options
########

Assault Vest can turn Bouffalant into a great special tank and a counter to Pokemon such as Lilligant and Vivillon, but the lack of passive recovery limits Bouffalant's tanking capabilities throughout the battle. Wild Charge is a coverage option for sets with Reckless to hit Flying- and Ghost-types hard, but doesn't do much to Rotom which can be a problem.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types such as Mismagius, Rotom, and Gourgeist are immune to Bouffalant's STAB moves and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp.

**Bulky Rock- and Steel-types**: Pokemon such as Regirock, Steelix, and Rhydon all resist Normal-type attacks and can even take Earthquake relatively well with their great physical bulk. They can then retaliate back with an attack, status, or phazing move.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Sawk and Primeape outspeed Bouffalant and hit it hard with STAB Close Combat. Gurdurr can use its great physical bulk and Drain Punch to defeat Bouffalant, though it is cleanly 2HKOed by Choice Band Head Charge and can't OHKO with Mach Punch.

**Entry Hazards**: All types of entry hazards take away a chunk of Bouffalant's bulk and make it more susceptible to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Samurott and Archeops.

**Strong Attackers**: Bouffalant's poor Speed makes it prone to being outsped by powerful attackers such as Typhlosion, Zangoose, and Magmortar.
