Overview
########

Kangaskhan has a notable niche as a dual priority revenge killer with access to Fake Out and Sucker Punch, allowing it to come in on weakened opponents and finish them off with a one-two hit combo. With good overall bulk, Kangaskhan can take multiple hits if invested. Silk Scarf-boosted STAB Double-Edge allows Kangaskhan to 2HKO a lot of the tier, and Scrappy allows Kangaskhan to hit Ghost-type Pokemon trying to switch in on a Normal- or Fighting-type move and grants Kangaskhan unresisted neutral coverage. However, its lack of reliable recovery means that residual damage racks up fast on Kangaskhan between Double-Edge recoil and entry hazards. Kangaskhan also has trouble muscling past physical walls that resist Normal-type attacks.


Physical Attacker
########
name : Physical Attacker
move 1: Fake Out
move 2: Double-Edge / Return
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Earthquake / Drain Punch
ability: Scrappy
item: Silk Scarf / Leftovers
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Fake Out gives Kangaskhan a good priority attack that flinches the opposing Pokemon on the first turn, letting Kangaskhan easily finish off weakened opponents. Double-Edge is a powerful STAB move that puts big dents into teams. Return is a slightly weaker STAB move to be used in the place of Double-Edge should you wish not to take recoil damage. Sucker Punch gives Kangaskhan nice dual priority in combination with Fake Out. Earthquake gives Kangaskhan good coverage, hitting Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon hard. Drain Punch also gives Kangaskhan good coverage on these Pokemon, while regaining HP at the same time; however, Drain Punch is rather weak compared to Earthquake.

Set Details
========

Silk Scarf boosts Normal-type moves while not sacrificing HP, while Leftovers can be used for increased longevity; alternatively, Life Orb can be used, boosting all of Kangaskhan's attacks but decreasing its longevity. An Adamant nature gives Kangaskhan an Attack boost. Alternatively, a Jolly nature can be used to increase Kangaskhan's Speed; however, the difference in power is noticeable. Scrappy lets Kangaskhan hit Ghost-type Pokemon with its STAB moves. A standard offensive spread of maximum Attack and Speed lets Kangaskhan hit hard and outspeed other Pokemon; alternatively, a spread of 160 HP / 252 Atk / 96 Spe and an Adamant nature can give Kangaskhan increased bulk while still allowing it to hit hard. Notably, 96 Speed EVs enable Kangaskhan to outspeed fully invested base 70, positive-natured base 60, and uninvested base 100 Speed Pokemon.

Usage Tips
========

Kangaskhan is a fantastic revenge killer, so you should bring it in on a weakened enemy and use its priority moves to finish the opponent off. Some opponents will predict the obvious Fake Out and switch out right away: try to predict the switch and go for Double-Edge instead to get more damage on the switch-in and possibly 2HKO it. Watch out for Ghost-types with Will-O-Wisp, as they will use it when predicting Sucker Punch. Instead, either switch out, or go for Double-Edge. Kangaskhan can be used as a mid-game cleaner against slower teams, coming in and KOing weakened and slower Pokemon. It is best to soften up its checks and counters early in the game before attempting to clean. Against faster teams Kangaskhan should try denting opposing Pokemon mid-game with Double-Edge.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that resist Fighting-type moves, such as Granbull and Vileplume, make good teammates for Kangaskhan, as they can switch into opposing Fighting-type Pokemon and take a relatively small amount of damage. Entry hazard setters such as Crustle and Garbodor punish switching and help Kangaskhan get more 2HKOs with Double-Edge. Spinblockers help prevent the removal of aforementioned entry hazards and can also help deter the opponent from using Fighting-type moves. Healing Wish support from Mesprit allows Kangaskhan to recover back to full from the recoil damage of Double-Edge, allowing it to punch holes in the opposing team multiple times. Wallbreakers similar to Kangaskhan, such as Choice Band Sawk and Zangoose, can help wear down similar walls and open up holes sooner, allowing Kangaskhan to clean up or another team member to sweep.

Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Return
move 2: Drain Punch
move 3: Power-Up Punch / Fake Out
move 4: Sucker Punch
ability: Scrappy
item: Assault Vest
evs: 160 HP / 252 Atk / 96 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Return is Kangaskhan's primary STAB move. Drain Punch allows Kangaskhan to recover health and hit Steel- and Rock-types. After a boost, Drain Punch recovers a good amount of health. Earthquake can be used over Drain Punch for more power; however, the recovery is usually more beneficial on this set. Power-Up Punch is used to increase Kangaskhan's Attack by one stage, which is useful for sweeping late-game. Sucker Punch provides Kangaskhan with a form of priority. Fake Out can be used over Power-Up Punch for dual priority.

Set Details
========

160 HP EVs let Kangaskhan survive an Eruption from Choice Specs Typhlosion and have a chance to survive two of its Fire Blasts, while also being able to survive two Fire Blasts from Life Orb Pyroar. 252 Attack EVs maximize damage output, while 96 Speed EVs allow Kangaskhan to outspeed max Speed base 70 Pokemon. Scrappy is used to allow Kangaskhan to hit Ghost-types with all of its moves, and Assault Vest increases Kangaskhan's Special Defense. Alternatively, a maximum Speed and Attack spread can be used to still pivot into special attackers while being able to check Sawk and other fast offensive Pokemon.

Usage Tips
========

Assault Vest Kangaskhan can be used as an offensive pivot against special attackers; however, be wary of switching in multiple times, as Kangaskhan can be worn down fairly quickly and Drain Punch doesn't recover much HP without a boost. Kangaskhan can be used late-game to sweep, when its checks and counters are worn down enough: use Power-Up Punch on the switch and proceed to use Return, Drain Punch, or Sucker Punch accordingly. Be careful of Sucker Punch mind games against faster threats that like to carry Substitute, Trick, or Will-O-Wisp, as these moves can put a stop to Kangaskhan's sweep. If running Fake Out over Power-Up Punch, be aware that Fake Out is relatively weak on this set due to the lack of a boosting item.

Team Options
========

Kangaskhan appreciates entry hazard support, which helps to wear down its checks and counters more quickly; Sticky Web is especially helpful, as it allows Kangaskhan to outspeed more threats. Pokemon such as Crustle and Garbodor are good for general hazard setup, while Kricketune is a good setter of Sticky Web. Spinblockers such as Rotom and Mismagius are also recommended when using entry hazards to prevent them from being removed; if using Sticky Web, a Pokemon such as Pawniard can be used to deter Defog users with Defiant. Clerics such as Granbull and Vileplume can cure Kangaskhan of burns or paralysis, while also being able to switch in to tank Fighting-type moves. Wallbreakers similar to Kangaskhan, such as Choice Band Sawk and Zangoose, are good teammates because they can help wear down similar walls and assist Kangaskhan in setting up a late-game sweep.

Other Options
########

Aqua Tail is a great alternative coverage move on Kangaskhan, as it can be used to lure in Rhydon, a common check, and 2HKO it. Fire Punch can be used to specifically hit Ferroseed; however, the coverage it provides is not too great, and there are other ways of dealing with Ferroseed. Hammer Arm can be used over Drain Punch as a more powerful Fighting-type move; however, it drops Kangaskhan's Speed and does not offer any recovery. Wish can be used on offensive Kangaskhan as a way to regain HP, though this requires your team to be able to deal with Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon that could hard wall Kangaskhan otherwise. Circle Throw can be used on a bulkier Kangaskhan set in conjunction with entry hazards as a way to quickly wear down opposing teams. A Substitute and Focus Punch set can be used to hit opposing Pokemon really hard. Facade can be used as Kangaskhan's STAB move if you are worried about getting statused.

Checks & Counters
########

**Garbodor**: Garbodor is a decent check to Kangaskhan, as Kangaskhan takes a lot of passive damage between Double-Edge recoil, Rocky Helmet, and, if KOing Garbodor with Double-Edge, Aftermath damage. Garbodor can also switch in on Fake Out, taking minimal damage from it and inflicting Rocky Helmet damage. Finally, the opponent can switch out and scout to see if Kangaskhan is running Earthquake or Drain Punch. If Drain Punch is being used, then Garbodor will force Kangakshan to use Double-Edge and damage it with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath.

**Status**: All status cripples Kangaskhan; Will-O-Wisp reduces Kangaskhan's Attack and is commonly carried by physical walls, Thunder Wave reduces Kangaskhan's Speed and makes it easier to revenge kill, and Toxic damage racks up fast with Double-Edge recoil.

**Physical Walls**: Physical walls such as Gourgeist-S and Weezing can take multiple hits from Kangaskhan and proceed to hit it with a status move such as Will-O-Wisp, recover off damage, or use utility moves such as Toxic Spikes and Leech Seed.

**Bulky Steel- and Rock-types**: Bulky Steel-type Pokemon such as Steelix and Metang and bulky Rock-types such as Regirock and Rhydon take minimal damage from Kangaskhan's STAB moves and can survive multiple hits from either Earthquake or Drain Punch. Regirock also can cripple Kangaskhan with Thunder Wave.

**Ferroseed**: Ferroseed gets a special mention as Iron Barbs and Leech Seed cause a lot of residual damage to Kangaskhan, and Earthquake and Drain Punch deal pitiful damage to Ferroseed. Ferroseed can also set up Spikes, while wearing Kangaskhan down and staying at good health by racking up extra Leech Seed recovery with Protect.

**Fighting-types**: Pokemon such as Poliwrath or Gurdurr can survive any hit Kangaskhan can throw at them and retaliate with a STAB move; however, they can't directly switch into a hit from Kangaskhan as they risk getting 2HKOed with entry hazards up.
