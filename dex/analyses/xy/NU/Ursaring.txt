Overview
########
Ursaring is a very strong Pokemon with a gargantuan Attack stat and a respectable movepool, meaning it can deliver very powerful blows to most Pokemon in the tier. It also has a nifty ability in Quick Feet, mitigating its subpar Speed. However, this reliance on having a status effect to utilize Quick Feet undermines Ursaring's decent bulk.


Quick Feet
########
name: Quick Feet
move 1: Facade
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Close Combat
move 4: Protect / Swords Dance
ability: Quick Feet
item: Toxic Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly


Moves
========
Facade is the primary STAB attack, having twice as much Base Power from being statused. It allows Ursaring to utterly decimate any Pokemon that does not resist or is immune to it. As a result, Ursaring must run Crunch, allowing it to deal with Ghost-type Pokemon such as Mismagius and Rotom. These previous two moves still leave Ursaring partially walled by Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Steelix, so Close Combat is used as it almost guarantees a 2HKO on the former, and allows for Ursaring to always 4HKO the latter. The last moveslot is reserved for a utility move, depending on the scenario. Protect can be used to allow Ursaring to guarantee the activation of its status orb, allowing it to outspeed many Pokemon in the tier that are not holding a Choice Scarf. However, Protect is redundant if Ursaring has any form of slow U-turn or Volt Switch support, as both of those guarantee that Ursaring gets statused. In this case, Swords Dance is much more beneficial to run, as it allows Ursaring to double its already high Attack stat. It also punishes Pokemon that attempt to stall out Ursaring, allowing Ursaring to get up to +2 Attack. Alternatively, either Seed Bomb or Earthquake could be run in the last slot. The former deals with Pokemon such as Rhydon and Seismitoad, always 2HKOing them after Stealth Rock damage. Earthquake can help deal with Garbodor, letting Ursaring avoid the Rocky Helmet and Aftermath damage at the expense of not always getting an OHKO.


Set Details
========
252 EVs in Attack allow Ursaring to tear through certain defensive Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Ferroseed easier, making it a force to be reckoned with. 252 EVs are placed in Speed alongside a Jolly nature, allowing Ursaring to outspeed base 106 Speed Pokemon such as Pyroar and Mismagius after the Quick Feet boost, and proceed to OHKO them with Facade and Crunch, respectively.


Usage Tips
========
The best way to ensure that Ursaring gets the Quick Feet boost without having to run Protect is to pivot it in on a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, ensuring that it gets in safely without having to take prior damage. The first priority of Ursaring is to whittle down opposing Pokemon, seeing as it cannot stay in for prolonged amounts of time due to the status ailment it requires to function. On Pokemon that attempt to stall Ursaring out with Protect, getting up a Swords Dance is a surefire way to ensure that Ursaring blasts through such Pokemon. Ursaring also needs to be cautious in certain scenarios that could cost it valuable health, such as in the instance of Ghost- and Steel-types. Trying to hit such Pokemon with a move that is not very effective can cost Ursaring precious time, so take into consideration what move to use based on the team matchup.


Team Options
========
Ursaring gets whittled down quickly due to Toxic damage and potential hazards, so having a Wish passer is greatly beneficial to Ursaring's performance. On more balanced teams, Audino is a decent fit for this, though it shares a weakness to Fighting-type attacks and costs momentum in certain instances. On more offensive teams, Slurpuff and Flareon are better at Wish passing, as they can also keep up offensive pressure. Slurpuff excels especially well on this one, being able to threaten Fighting-type Pokemon that pester Ursaring. Ursaring also lacks power without Guts, so it requires entry hazard support to score certain essential OHKOs. A prime example of this is against Rotom-S, as Ursaring has less than a 50% chance to OHKO it from full with Facade without prior damage, whereas Ursaring's Facade always OHKOes Rotom-S after Stealth Rock damage. The Pokemon best suited for this role would be Seismitoad, as it can take Fighting-type attacks relatively easy while still getting up Stealth Rock. Seismitoad can also attempt to burn physical attackers with Scald, thoroughly neutering them for Ursaring. To get Ursaring in safely and ensure a Quick Feet boost, having slow U-turn or Volt Switch support is almost required. Pelipper and Lanturn both work here, with the former being able to remove hazards that whittle Ursaring down as well as potentially burn physical attackers, and the latter having some offensive pressure and the ability to burn physical attackers for Ursaring. Other Pokemon that work would be Togetic and Musharna, which can both Baton Pass to Ursaring safely and not be threatened at all by Fighting-type attacks. Alternatively, Probopass can be used to wall faster threats in the tier, though it shares a crippling weakness to Fighting-type attacks with Ursaring.


Other Options
########
Ursaring can run a Choice Band set to utilize its monstrous Attack stat, though it does not guarantee that Ursaring gets statused, which is one of the key reasons to use Ursaring. Alternatively, Ursaring can run a Guts set in place of Quick Feet, though it is outclassed by Zangoose as Ursaring has no access to priority and is relatively slow. However, a Guts set can easily be used as a bluff to surprise opponents expecting to survive a Quick Feet attack. In that regard, Ursaring should only run a Toxic Orb on this set, as a Flame Orb would make it clear to the opponent that the Ursaring is Guts instead of Quick Feet. Finally, Ursaring can run Taunt to prevent set up sweepers from setting up, utilizing the immense Speed it possesses after a Quick Feet boost.


Checks & Counters
########
**Bulky Steel-types**: Steelix can easily switch into a Close Combat from Ursaring, and retaliate for heavy damage after the defense drops. Ferroseed can also switch into anything but Close Combat and proceed to whittle it down with Leech Seed. Ursaring also faces the issue of taking Iron Barbs damage from Ferroseed, which further wears it down.

**Fast Fighting-types**: Pokemon such as Sawk and Primeape that outspeed Ursaring are typically able to OHKO it with any STAB move, as Ursaring has only moderately decent Defenses.

**Priority Attacks**: Ursaring doesn't boast the greatest defenses, and has a hard time recovering any HP due to the status it has to inflict on itself in order to work. This means that most STAB priority moves such as Gurdurr's Mach Punch can remove Ursaring once it has been whittled down a decent chunk.
