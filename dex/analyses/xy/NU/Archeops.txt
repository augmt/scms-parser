Overview
########

Despite its terrible ability, Archeops is a powerful offensive threat due to its excellent Speed and Attack stats. Its high Speed allows it to check common threats such as Pyroar, Typhlosion, Mismagius, and Liepard. Archeops has a great support movepool, including Taunt, Endeavor, Defog, Stealth Rock, and reliable recovery in Roost. Between its STAB Acrobatics and Earthquake, Archeops is able to hit most of the tier for at least neutral damage, and can outlast common defensive Pokemon, unlike other hard hitters such as Kangaskhan and Sawk. Unfortunately, Defeatist halves Archeops's Attack when its HP reaches below 50%. This problem is further compunded by Archeops's weaknesses to common priority moves such as Aqua Jet, Bullet Punch, and Ice Shard. As a Stealth Rock setter, Archeops has a poor matchup against most common entry hazard users, such as Crustle, Rhydon, and Seismitoad.

Offensive Taunt + Roost
########
name: Offensive Taunt + Roost
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Roost
move 3: Acrobatics
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Defeatist
item:
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Taunt prevents entry hazards, status moves, and recovery from the likes of Audino, Uxie, and Weezing in order to let Archeops function as a psuedo-stallbreaker as well as a strong attacker. Roost provides a reliable form of recovery and works well in tandem with Taunt to break down defensive cores. Acrobatics is a strong STAB move that deals heavy damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Earthquake provides great coverage, hitting Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-types that resist Acrobatics, such as Rhydon, Klinklang, and Lanturn. Heat Wave can be used if your team struggles with Ferroseed, but it is generally not worth it.

Set Details
========

A Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment are used to outspeed base 106s, such as Ninetales, Typhlosion, and Liepard. Maximum Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible. Not holding an item doubles the power of Acrobatics.

Usage Tips
========

Archeops functions best as an anti-lead early on to prevent entry hazards from the likes of Qwilfish and Garbodor and status from the likes of Uxie and Weezing. However, Archeops has a poor matchup against other common entry hazard setters, such as Seismitoad, Crustle, and Rhydon as the former threatens Archeops with a STAB Scald and the latter two threaten to KO Archeops with a STAB Rock Blast. Archeops also works well as an early- or mid-game hole puncher, as even some frail Pokemon that resist Archeops's STAB moves, such as Rotom, are hit for a lot of damage. Archeops is generally a safe switch-in to passive Pokemon on defensive teams, such as Audino, which often rely on Knock Off for damage and are severely crippled by Taunt. It is important to know what Pokemon Archeops can use Roost against, such as Taunted Weezing, because Archeops resists Sludge Bomb and Flamethrower, Weezing's two main attacks. Against more offensive Pokemon, Archeops should only use Roost when it cannot be 2HKOed by the foe. Archeops should not take any unnecessary damage, especially if it needs to check threats such as Mismagius and Pyroar.

Team Options
========

With the combination of Taunt and Roost, Archeops is fairly self-sufficient. However, it is important to cover its type weaknesses with teammates, as taking unnecessary damage is problematic. It is notable that this set fits best on more offensive teams. Seismitoad is a good partner because it threatens Rock-type Pokemon with its STAB moves and is immune to Electric-and Water-type attacks thanks to Water Absorb. Seismitoad is also a good teammate because Archeops threatens Grass-types with a strong Acrobatics. Volt Switch or U-turn users such as Lanturn, Mesprit, Liepard, and Rotom are all good partners to bring in Archeops safely. Late-game cleaners or sweepers such as Feraligatr and Lilligant appreciate Archeops's ability to wear down bulky Pokemon with the combination of Taunt and powerful attacks. Entry hazard support from the likes of Seismitoad and Garbodor is helpful to wear down Archeops's switch-ins, notably allowing Archeops to 2HKO defensive Seismitoad after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Rapid Spin or Defog support from Pokemon such as Cryogonal, Sandslash, and Swanna is helpful to preserve Archeops's health.

Bulky Taunt + Roost
########
name: Bulky Taunt + Roost
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Roost
move 3: Acrobatics
move 4: Defog / Earthquake
ability: Defeatist
item:
evs: 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Taunt prevents status moves, recovery, and entry hazards from the likes of Audino, Uxie, and Weezing. Roost allows Archeops to heal off damage taken from attacks and get out of Defeatist range if given the chance; it works extremely well in tandem with Taunt, letting Archeops act as a pseudo-stallbreaker. Acrobatics is an extremely strong STAB move that hits very hard even with minimal Attack investment. Defog is a great support move that clears all entry hazards. However, Earthquake provides good coverage in hitting Steel-types such as Probopass and should be used if Defog is not necessary. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Pokemon that often switch into Archeops, such as Seismitoad and Lanturn. Knock Off is an option to cripple bulky Pokemon that rely on their item, especially Eviolite users such as Togetic and Rhydon.


Set Details
========

Maximum HP investment is used to be able to tank as many hits as possible from the likes of Pyroar and Zangoose. Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature are used to outspeed as many threats as possible, particularly those in the base 100-106 Speed range. 248 HP EVs give an odd HP number, allowing Archeops to switch into Stealth Rock five times if necessary.

Usage Tips
========

Archeops should be used as an anti-lead early on to prevent entry hazards from Pokemon such as Garbodor and Qwilfish and status from the likes of Uxie and Weezing. However, it is important to stay away from other entry hazard setters such as Rhydon and Seismitoad, as Archeops does not fare well against them. Archeops should be used to disrupt common defensive Pokemon such as Weezing, Uxie, Garbodor, and Audino with the combination of Taunt and Roost. Archeops should use Defog when it forces a switch against a foe such as Vileplume or Sawk. Keep Archeops away from status, as it will severely cripple its offensive and defensive capabilities, and residual damage brings Archeops closer to Defeatist range. Archeops should use Roost against a foe that cannot 2HKO it, or to stall out potential Toxic damage. If you predict the opponent to switch to a bulky Pokemon such as Rhydon, Togetic, Lanturn, or Seismitoad, Archeops should cripple it with either Knock Off or Toxic; Knock Off is more helpful agaisnt Rhydon and Togetic because it removes Eviolite. Archeops should use Earthquake to hit Lanturn as well as Steel-types such as Probopass and Klinklang on the switch. Earthquake can also revenge kill weakened Fire-types such as Pyroar and Magmortar.

Team Options
========

Offensive Pokemon such as Ninetales, Articuno, and Pyroar appreciate Defog support from Archeops. Seismitoad is a great partner because it is immune to Electric-type attacks, resists Rock-type attacks, and appreciates the removal of entry hazards. In return, Archeops threatens Grass-types with its strong Acrobatics. Late-game cleaners or sweepers such as Lilligant, Feraligatr, and Ninetales all appreciate entry hazard removal and Archeops's ability to weaken or disrupt defensive Pokemon.

Focus Sash
########
name: Focus Sash
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Endeavor
move 4: Head Smash
ability: Defeatist
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is important on every team, and Archeops is a very reliable setter of it. Taunt prevents opposing entry hazards, status moves, and Defog. Endeavor cripples an enemy by bringing it down to low HP, working particularly well with a Focus Sash to bring the foe down to one HP. Head Smash is a powerful STAB move that hits Ghost-types trying to switch into Endeavor. It also blocks Rapid Spin and Defog due to its heavy recoil, which often KOes Archeops in the process, and can be used to bring in a sweeper safely.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread is simple for a suicide lead Pokemon, maximizing Archeops's Attack and Speed. A Focus Sash is used to guarantee that Archeops will get up Stealth Rock in most scenarios.

Usage Tips
========

Always lead with Archeops to prevent opposing entry hazards and get up Stealth Rock. Ideally, Archeops should prevent opposing entry hazards from the likes of Garbodor, Qwilfish, Uxie, Ferroseed, and Weezing with Taunt, set up Stealth Rock as it is brought down to its Focus Sash, and then cripple a foe with Endeavor before fainting. In addition, Taunt is great against defensive Pokemon when predicting a support, hazard, or status move. However, it is not very useful when facing more offensive Pokemon. Head Smash should be used to hit an incoming Ghost-type trying to block Endeavor or to prevent Rapid Spin and Defog by sacrificing Archeops. If the opponent has a Xatu, Archeops should use Head Smash when it switches in to bounce back Stealth Rock.

Team Options
========

This set fits best on hyper offensive teams with teammates such as Pyroar, Feraligatr, Kangaskhan, and Zangoose, which all appreciate Stealth Rock support to wear down their checks and counters. Ghost-types such as Rotom and Mismagius are good teammates to block Rapid Spin in order to keep up Stealth Rock, while Defiant users such as Pawniard and Primeape deter the use of Defog.

Other Options
########

Archeops has a variety of other coverage and support moves that it can utilize. A mixed set with moves such as Heat Wave and Hidden Power Grass works as an excellent lure to its common checks and counters, but to function effectively it needs Life Orb, which brings Archeops into Defeatist range very quickly. Tailwind can be used to double the Speed of Archeops's teammates for two turns. Aqua Tail hits Rhydon and Steelix but has little use outside of that. Earth Power is an alternative to Earthquake for coverage on physically bulky Rock- and Steel-types. Hone Claws boosts Archeops's Attack to high levels, but Arcehops generally cannot find an opportunity to set up. U-turn gains momentum on forced switches. Lastly, Sky Attack can be used in conjunction with Power Herb for a significantly stronger Flying-type attack, but it can only be used once.

Checks & Counters
########

**Priority**: Aqua Jet from Feraligatr, Samurott, and Carracosta can easily finish off Archeops after some prior damage. Carracosta can easily switch into a resisted Acrobatics and threaten Archeops out with Aqua Jet. Bullet Punch from Hariyama can also pick off a weakened Archeops, but Hariyama cannot switch in safely. Ice Shard is another super effective priority attack that threatens Archeops, most notably from Piloswine, which can also stomach Archeops's hits thanks to its great bulk with Eviolite.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Common Choice Scarf users such as Rotom and Jynx can outspeed Archeops and KO it with their STAB moves. Rotom is generally a safe switch-in for Archeops due to its resisting Flying and being immune to Earthquake, while Jynx can only revenge kill Archeops.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon, such as Sneasel, Tauros, and Floatzel, can easily revenge kill Archeops with their STAB moves; however, they have trouble switching in.

**Bulky Pokemon that Resist Flying**: Pokemon such as Steelix, Rhydon, and defensive Rotom can easily avoid the 2HKO from any of Archeops's attacks and KO in return, but none appreciate losing their Leftovers or Eviolite from Knock Off or being hit with Toxic. Rhydon only has to fear the rare Life Orb Hidden Power Grass and can OHKO Archeops even through Focus Sash with Rock Blast. Lanturn and Klinklang take little damage from Acrobatics and can KO Archeops with their STAB moves, but they are hit hard with Earthquake.

**Status**: All forms of status greatly hinder Archeops. Burn from Scald or Will-O-Wisp halves Archeops's Attack, poison puts a timer on its health and brings it into Defeatist range quickly, and paralysis quarters its high Speed.

**Stealth Rock**: While Archeops can Roost off the damage or Defog Stealth Rock away, switching into it quickly chips away at Archeops's health.
