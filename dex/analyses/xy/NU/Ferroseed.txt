Overview
########
With its unique typing and great defenses, Ferroseed takes a leap to NU as an amazing entry hazard setter. Ferroseed's unique Grass / Steel typing resists nine types and is immune to Poison. This allows Ferroseed to wall some of the strong Water-type threats in NU, such as Feraligatr, Samurott, and Seismitoad, as well as prominent Grass-types such as Ludicolo and Cacturne. Due to the fact that Ferroseed is not fully evolved, it can utilize Eviolite, which is extremely beneficial in boosting its Defense and Special Defense to help it better wall offensive threats. Ferroseed's ability, Iron Barbs, allows it to punish physical attackers, making opponents think twice before attacking. Ferroseed's low Speed is a gift, as it can utilize Gyro Ball well, allowing it to turn its slow Speed into a strength and deal significant damage against speedy opponents. Ferroseed's low HP is also advantageous as it drains more health with Leech Seed from Pokemon with higher HP. A huge weakness that Ferroseed has is its 4x weakness to Fire. Ferroseed also struggles against setup sweepers with Substitute such as Klinklang because it lacks offensive presence, and can also be setup bait.

Moves
========
Spikes are valuable for racking up residual damage every time opponents switch in, as well as breaking Focus Sashes. Stealth Rock should be used if other teammates lack it. STAB Gyro Ball allows Ferroseed to punish naturally faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users. However, Seed Bomb can be used instead of Gyro Ball as a STAB move, dealing huge amounts of damage against offensive threats such as Feraligatr, Floatzel, and Seismitoad. Leech Seed increases Ferroseed's longevity, and is a viable method of recovery. It often applies pressure to opponents to either switch out, or continue to take damage from Leech Seed. Protect can be useful for stalling in conjunction with Leech Seed, and is very useful for scouting opponent's arsenals to determine the appropriate plays. Thunder Wave can be used on switch-ins and can help to rack up Spikes damage by forcing switches. Leech Seed works well with Thunder Wave as it can apply pressure causing opponents to switch, allowing Ferroseed to capitalize with Thunder Wave and cripple dangerous threats such as Typhlosion, Magmortar, and Sawk.

Set Details
========
Maximum HP and Defense investment helps Ferroseed tank a hit or two against physical powerhouses. Ferroseed takes advantage of Eviolite to bolster its Defense and Special Defense, making it a stronger wall. A Relaxed nature helps boost Ferroseed's Defense while also lowering its Speed, which benefits Ferroseed when using Gyro Ball. Alternatively, Ferroseed can invest in HP and Special Defense with a Sassy nature to make it a special wall capable of handling specially oriented Grass- and Water-types.

Usage Tips
========
Start off by setting up entry hazards if possible, as this will apply pressure to the opponent, causing them to think more carefully about switching in and out. If there is no chance to set up hazards at first, start off with Protect to scout out the opponentâ€™s moves. Take full advantage of this to help determine what moves the opponent might have and what you can do to counter it. Set up a Leech Seed after hazards have been set up, and follow it up with Protect. This will help Ferroseed remain in control of the matchup; not only receiving HP each turn but also slowly wearing down opposing Pokemon. Opponents will attempt to switch; being able to determine switch-ins is key for Ferroseed as it can use Leech Seed on an incoming opponent to wear them down or Gyro Ball for damage. Use Gyro Ball after Protect to make sure Ferroseed recovers from any damage taken. Thunder Wave can also be used when opponents switch in to slow them down for setup sweepers. However, it's worth noting that Thunder Wave is somewhat counterproductive with Gyro Ball, so always think about when to utilize both. Being able to predict Poison-type moves is useful, as Ferroseed can be tossed into play, saving teammates such as Lilligan or Granbull from danger.

Team Options
========
Teammates such as Feraligatr and Magmortar are great because of their offensive presence. Feraligatr can sweep teams if it can set up, often getting rid of Ferroseed's checks in the process. Magmortar can sweep severely weakened teams as well. Ghost-types such as Mismagius are wonderful for spinblocking and are immune to Fighting-type attacks. Togetic, Vullaby, and Pelipper are all valuable teammates with Defog in case the field gets scattered with hazards, as Ferroseed dislikes them. Instead of utilizing Defog, Cryogonal and Sandslash may be used as spinners, so that you don't have to get rid of your own hazards. Bulky walls such as Camerupt and Rhydon are useful teammates to allow Ferroseed to switch in safely. Seismitoad is great against Fire-types due to its resistance to Fire, and Ferroseed can wall Grass-types for Seismitoad in return.

Other Options
########
Instead of Thunder Wave, Ferroseed can utilize Toxic to stall out opponents in conjunction with Protect and Leech Seed. Explosion can be used as a kamikaze attack, either crippling or completely taking out an enemy. Curse allows Ferroseed to boost its Attack and Defense while also lowering its Speed, allowing Ferroseed to demolish opponents with Gyro Ball. Bullet Seed in conjunction with Curse helps Ferroseed break through Substitutes and hit opponents such as Seismitoad.

Checks & Counters
########
**Fire-types**: Magmortar can usually KO Ferroseed with a Lava Plume. Typhlosion can OHKO Ferroseed with Eruption or Fire Blast. Camerupt and Pyroar can usually KO Ferroseed with Flamethrower and Fire Blast.

**Taunt**: Taunt is detrimental to Ferroseed, stopping it from using entry hazards, Protect, and status moves. Taunt also leaves Ferroseed susceptible to status, hazards, and leaves it wide open for attacks.

**Substitute**: Substitute users can not only avoid Ferroseed's status moves but also stall out Gyro Ball, leaving Ferroseed as setup fodder. Pokemon such as Klinklang can use Substitute and set up on Ferroseed, then sweep.

**Fighting-types**: Gurdurr, Hariyama, and Sawk can not only utilize Knock Off to get rid of Eviolite, but can also KO Ferroseed with Close Combat, Superpower, and Drain Punch. Hariyama and Gurdurr can carry Guts, so avoid using Thunder Wave or Toxic against them.

**Hidden Power Fire Users**: Hidden Power Fire has now become more common, often seen on Grass-types such as Lilligant and Vileplume. Mesprit also commonly carries HP Fire.

**Xatu**: Thanks to Magic Bounce, Xatu is immune to everything in Ferroseed's arsenal, bar attacks, and can eliminate Ferroseed with Heat Wave. On top of this, Xatu can PP stall Gyro Ball and can whittle Ferroseed's HP down with Night Shade.

**Focus Blast Users**: Pokemon such as Jynx, Raichu, and Ludicolo all carry Focus Blast to counter Steel-types, making them highly dangerous to Ferroseed.
