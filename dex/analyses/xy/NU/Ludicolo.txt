Overview
########

Ludicolo functions best on rain teams, where its access to Swift Swim, Rain Dance, and a 4x resistance to Water-type attacks allow it to both sweep and check specific threats. Ludicolo's Grass typing is very helpful for rain teams, as it means Ludicolo can beat Pokemon that such teams would otherwise struggle with, such as Seismitoad. Its good bulk also means it can set up rain quite easily for both itself and its team. However, while Ludicolo can be quite scary in rain, it's somewhat slow and weak outside of it, leaving it easy to revenge kill. It also has trouble getting past Pokemon such as Dragalge.

Rain Dance Sweeper
########
name: Rain Dance Sweeper
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Rain Dance
ability: Swift Swim
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========

Hydro Pump is Ludicolo's main STAB attack that hits very hard when backed by STAB, Life Orb, and rain. Giga Drain is another good STAB move that can recover HP and make up for the Life Orb recoil. It also hits Pokemon that rain teams can struggle with, such as Seismitoad. Ice Beam is good coverage against Grass-types such as Vileplume, while also hitting Dragon-types such as Dragalge and Altaria for super effective damage. Rain Dance is important for activating Ludicolo's ability and powering up Hydro Pump. It can also assist other Pokemon, such as Kabutops, in sweeping. Scald can be used over Hydro Pump for better accuracy and more consistency, though it is noticeably weaker.

Set Details
========

The EV spread maximizes Ludicolo's Special Attack and Speed, making it hit as hard and as fast as possible. Life Orb helps to boost Ludicolo's damage output while also allowing it to switch moves. Damp Rock can be used if you want more rain turns, though Ludicolo becomes much weaker. Swift Swim doubles Ludicolo's Speed in rain, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon it normally wouldn't and hit them with a powerful attack. A Modest nature allows Ludicolo to 2HKO Lickilicky and Assault Vest Hariyama in rain after Stealth Rock, as well as 2HKO specially defensive Dragalge after a bit of prior damage. A Timid nature, however, can be used to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Typhlosion and Pyroar under rain.

Usage Tips
========

On rain teams, Ludicolo acts as a main rain sweeper and a backup Rain Dance setter. As a stand alone sweeper, it's better to use Ludicolo as a mid- or late-game sweeper once entry hazards have been set and the opponent's team is weakened. It can also be used early-game to remove a counter for another Pokemon. Overall, however, Ludicolo is a very simple Pokemon: just set up Rain Dance and then use the appropriate move depending on the situation.

Team Options
========

Good Rain Dance setters such as Liepard, Volbeat, and Meowstic-M pair well with Ludicolo to support its sweep. Uxie can set up rain as well as Stealth Rock, and it can use U-turn or Memento to safely bring in Ludicolo or another Swift Swim sweeper. Spikes setters such as Accelgor and Qwilfish can lay down Spikes to aid Ludicolo's sweep. Spikes can allow Ludicolo to 2HKO Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Hariyama, and Dragalge, making setters very helpful. Good Swift Swim sweepers that make for good teammates include Life Orb Seismitoad, Swords Dance Kabutops, and Shell Smash Carracosta, the last of which has Solid Rock to ease its setup and Aqua Jet as a form of priority. Lastly, Electivire is a solid teammate to break certain walls such as Ferroseed and Vileplume, which could otherwise stop Ludicolo from sweeping.

Other Options
########

A SubSeed or specially defensive set with Leech Seed is possible, utilizing Rain Dish, Leftovers, and Leech Seed to heal large amounts of HP. Focus Blast can be used to nail Ferroseed, though it has little utility otherwise. Finally, a Swords Dance set of Swords Dance / Waterfall / Seed Bomb / Ice Punch is possible, though Ludicolo's lower Attack stat makes the specially offensive set better in most situations.

Checks & Counters
########

**Special Walls / Tanks**: Cryogonal and Articuno can take a hit and have Freeze-Dry to hit Ludicolo for 4x super effective damage. When outside of rain, Audino can switch in, use Knock Off to remove Ludicolo's Life Orb, and then stall out the rain turns with Wish + Protect. Lickilicky can do the same. Mantine can take on Ludicolo and has STAB Air Slash to eventually KO it. Vileplume, while unable to directly switch in, can take an Ice Beam, and has Sludge Bomb to KO. Ferroseed also cannot directly switch in under rain, but it can stall out rain turns and wear down Ludicolo. Ferroseed can also use Thunder Wave to cripple it for the rest of the match. Dragalge can switch into either of Ludicolo's STAB moves and has STAB Sludge Bomb to KO, but Ice Beam only 3HKOes a healthy Dragalge.

**Faster Pokemon**: As Ludicolo is slow outside of rain, any faster Pokemon can threaten it immensely. Swellow, Dodrio, Sawk, and Archeops are a few examples. Kangaskhan can use its priority Fake Out + Sucker Punch to revenge kill Ludicolo and potentially waste a couple turns of rain. Hariyama can also use Fake Out to waste a turn of rain, take a hit, and can KO afterwards with Close Combat.

**Status**: Paralysis completely shuts down Ludicolo, and other status ailments such as burn and poison can wear down Ludicolo quickly in combination with Life Orb recoil.
