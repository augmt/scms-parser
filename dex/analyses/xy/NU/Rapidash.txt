Overview
########
Although Rapidash faces competition from Flareon, which has better Attack and bulk, it still has some unique traits going for it. Rapidash has a higher Speed stat and access to Wild Charge, which gives it coverage against Water-types. Flash Fire is a great ability that grants Rapidash an immunity to Fire-type attacks while also boosting the power of its own Fire-type moves when hit by one, making Flare Blitz hit extremely hard. Unfortunately, Rapidash has poor longevity due to Flare Blitz and Wild Charge dealing recoil damage and a weakness to Stealth Rock, which limits the amount of times it can switch in.

Moves
========
Flare Blitz is Rapidash's main STAB attack, heavily damaging most Pokemon in the tier that don't resist it, though it has a price of recoil damage. Wild Charge provides great coverage and allows Rapidash to hit Water-types; however, like Flare Blitz, it deals recoil damage. Drill Run is also a useful coverage move, hitting several Pokemon that do not take much damage from Rapidash's other moves, such as Dragalge, Lanturn, and Pyroar. Low Kick allows Rapidash to hit heavy Rock-type Pokemon, such as Golem and Rhydon, harder than Drill Run. Morning Sun should only be used with a Life Orb, which doesn't lock Rapidash into one move; it gives Rapidash a source of recovery, increasing its longevity. Baton Pass is great for gaining momentum.

Set Details
========
Flash Fire is the only ability that should be used, as it provides Rapidash with an immunity and boosts the power of Flare Blitz when hit by a Fire-type move. Life Orb doesn't lock Rapidash into one move like Choice Band does, though it gives Rapidash less power than Choice Band, and Rapidash will be worn down quickly due to taking Life Orb damage in addition to the recoil damage from Flare Blitz and Wild Charge. 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allows Rapidash to outspeed or Speed tie threats in the tier, such as Mismagius, Kadabra, Cryogonal, Typhlosion, and Jynx.

Usage Tips
========
It's best to bring Rapidash in as a revenge killer, as it doesn't want to switch in due to its poor defensive stats unless the foe is using a Fire-type attack or an attack that Rapidash resists. When using Baton Pass, you have to predict when bulky Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Hariyama are switching in, due to them being able to take any of Rapidash's attacks with ease. Morning Sun should only be used against something that is forced out by Rapidash, such as Leafeon, Lilligant, or Cryogonal.

Team Options
========
Pokemon that can remove entry hazards, such as Cryogonal, Kabutops, Swanna, and Sandslash, are appreciated, as Rapidash doesn't appreciate Stealth Rock damage. Entry hazard users such as Garbodor or Crustle are also appreciated, as they allow Rapidash to KO Pokemon with more ease. Pokemon that can take care of bulky Rock-types such as Seismitoad are useful, as they make it easier for Rapidash to clean up. Slow Volt Switch or U-turn users such as Probopass make for good teammates, as they grant Rapidash a safe switch to potentially OHKO the opposing Pokemon. Healing Wish support from Pokemon such as Lilligant, Mesprit, and Mr. Mime is useful, fully healing Rapidash.

Other Options
########
Megahorn can be used to hit Dark- and Psychic-type Pokemon harder. The combination of Sunny Day and Solar Beam allows Rapidash to OHKO Pokemon such as Rhydon and Seismitoad. Hypnosis is an option for putting the opposing Pokemon to sleep to allow Rapidash to get some free damaging turns, but its moderate accuracy prevents it from being viable. Hidden Power Grass can 2HKO Seismitoad on the switch, but it is rather weak. Charcoal can be used over Life Orb or Choice Band to boost the damage output of Rapidash's Fire-type moves by 1.2x, though it doesn't boost Rapidash's coverage attacks, leaving them weaker than usual.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Rock-types**: Defensive Rock-types, such as Rhydon, can tank Rapidash's attacks with ease and retaliate with a super effective Earthquake. Physically defensive Carracosta and Regirock can take a Wild Charge or switch in on a Flare Blitz with ease and proceed to strike back with Rock Slide.

**Fast Pokemon**: Pokemon that outspeed Rapidash, such as Archeops, can easily stop Rapidash with a STAB attack. Archeops can't switch in on Rapidash due to Wild Charge, but it can check it due to its higher Speed stat and Rapidash's poor Defense stat. It can go for Acrobatics, which will easily OHKO Rapidash unless it switches.

**Priority Attacks**: Rapidash has low bulk; as such, priority attacks will quickly KO it. Examples of powerful priority users are Hariyama, Kangaskhan, Pawniard, and Cacturne, though the latter two need to be wary of Rapidash's STAB moves.

**Residual damage**: As Rapidash is vulnerable to all entry hazards and takes recoil from Flare Blitz and Wild Charge, it finds it hard to stay alive.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Seismitoad, Feraligatr and Carracosta, can easily switch into a Flare Blitz and set up on Rapidash after. Carracosta can switch in, take a hit, and retaliate back with Stone Edge or Aqua Jet, the latter of which is an 2HKO; the opponent can also predict the switch and use the turn to get a free Shell Smash.
