Yanma is an effective revenge killer and late-game sweeper, being able to outspeed the entire unboosted tier after a Speed boost. Its STAB moves allow it to hit many fast and frail Pokemon. However, it has loads of weaknesses, is 4x weak to Stealth Rock, and is quite frail. Yanma requires a lot of support to be effective and is reliant on OHKOing opponents so they can't strike back. Due to its lack of boosting moves, Yanma can't get past most bulky Pokemon.

Moves
========

Air Slash is a STAB move that hits Pokemon that don't resist it for solid damage; it also has a chance to flinch, though said chance isn't very reliable. Bug Buzz is another STAB move and can hit through Substitute, which is useful if the foe sets it up while when Yanma goes for Protect. Giga Drain is a great coverage move, hitting many Pokemon which resist Air Slash and Bug Buzz for good damage; it also increases Yanma's longevity by restoring its HP. Hidden Power Ground allows Yanma to hit Steel-type Pokemon such as Klinklang and Steelix at the cost of not being able to OHKO Seismitoad and Rhydon. Protect is used to scout moves during sweeps and guarantee Yanma gets a Speed boost so that it can outspeed the whole unboosted tier.

Set Details
========

A Modest nature and 252 Special Attack EVs allow Yanma to take advantage of its decent base 75 Special Attack. Yanma prefers the Special Attack boost from a Modest nature, as maximum Speed EVs and Speed Boost take care of its Speed. After one Speed Boost, it hits 443 Speed, outspeeding Accelgor and making it the second fastest Pokemon in the tier after Ninjask. The remaining 4 EVs go into Defense rather than HP to prevent Yanma from only being able to switch into Stealth Rock twice. Life Orb lets Yanma avoid being locked into one move, which is helpful for its versatile moveset when sweeping. Speed Boost is the sole reason for using Yanma, as it increases Yanma's Speed by one stage at the end of every turn.

Usage Tips
========

Yanma should only come in as a free switch-in, as it has frail defenses and can't take multiple hits. Stealth Rock cripples Yanma terribly, meaning a rock-free field is necessary. Yanma is best used as a late-game sweeper because it can pick off a weakened offensive team if powerful priority users have been taken out. It's also possible to use Yanma as an early-game attacker to heavily dent or even KO opposing sweepers before a late-game or setup sweeper is brought in. When trying to late-game sweep, Yanma needs to avoid specially defensive Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Audino, which can take hits when healthy, Wish the damage away, and hit Yanma hard. Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mesprit and Uxie are forced out by Yanma, not wanting to get hit by Bug Buzz, giving it a free turn to get a Speed boost. Yanma can 2HKO threats such as Pyroar and Steelix with Hidden Power Ground after Stealth Rock damage and has a chance to 2HKO Rotom after Stealth Rock damage with Giga Drain.

Team Options
========

Yanma appreciates Rapid Spin users such as Cryogonal, Sandslash, and Kabutops because they can keep the field clear of Stealth Rock. Cryogonal can also switch into special Ice- and Electric-type attacks that would OHKO Yanma. Kabutops can come in on Fire-types and threaten them out with Aqua Jet. Sandslash can take Electric- and Rock-type attacks due to its Ground typing. Defog users such as Pelipper and Swanna can assist by removing entry hazards; however, they share weaknesses with Yanma and will remove your own hazards as well. Defensive Xatu synergizes well with Yanma, as it can bounce back Stealth Rock with its ability Magic Bounce and gain momentum with U-turn; it also reflects all status moves that Yanma lures, such as Thunder Wave.

Thick Fat users such as Grumpig and Miltank can switch into Fire- and Ice-type attacks, which Yanma is weak to. Both Pokemon are capable of using Heal Bell to remove crippling statuses and can absorb status moves themselves. Yanma's main job is to threaten opposing sweepers, a job bulkier and slower sweepers on your team, such as Feraligatr, Golurk, and Granbull, appreciate. Yanma works well with wallbreakers such as Magmortar, which can switch into Fire-type attacks and hit back extremely hard. A slow Volt Switch, U-turn, or Baton Pass user such as Lanturn allows Yanma to get a free switch-in without having to sacrifice a teammate. Nasty Plot + Baton Pass Togetic can set up to give Yanma a boost in Special Attack and a free switch-in with its slow Baton Pass.

Other Options
########

Yanma can use Substitute to protect itself from incoming status moves from non-Prankster Pokemon without fear of being OHKOed. However, Substitute causes Yanma to lose a significant amount of health, which it often can't afford because it is easily worn down. Yanma has access to Tailwind, which can be used as a final effort to support the team before Yanma faints. This tends to be a sacrificial move,though, as Yanma is extremely unlikely to pull it off without being OHKOed. U-turn can allow Yanma to switch in counters against Pokemon it struggles with, but it is best left to other users, as Yanma's physical attack is lackluster, so U-turn will not be doing much damage. Hypnosis is a useful option for Yanma, either to shut down a switch-in or to let it outspeed a counter with Protect + Speed Boost and shut them down safely. Hypnosis also allows Yanma to rack up damage against opponents with its attacks; however, its poor accuracy makes it unreliable.

Checks & Counters
########
**Bulky Pokemon**: Bulky Pokemon such as Assault Vest Hariyama, Audino, and Lickilicky can take hits that Yanma fires off and hit Yanma hard. Anything that Yanma cannot 2HKO on the switch threatens it; Yanma is unable to beat most bulky Pokemon, and due to its frailty, these walls can even 2HKO or OHKO back.

**Priority Moves**: Priority users can check Yanma, though no priority user in the tier is capable of OHKOing Yanma unboosted without prior damage. The best checks to Yanma include Sucker Punch Pawniard and Kangaskhan, as well as Quick Attack Toxic Boost Zangoose, all of which can tank a hit from relatively high health if they are not able to OHKO with priority. Aqua Jet users such as Feraligatr and Kabutops can check Yanma, but they need to be careful of Giga Drain if they fail to KO it.

**Stealth Rock**: Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock, such as Archeops, Probopass and Crustle, are all problems for Yanma. Stealth Rock is pretty much a hard counter to Yanma, as Yanma can only switch into it twice and will most likely be KOed by unresisted attacks afterwards.

**Status**: Paralysis ruins Yanma's Speed stat, which it is heavily reliant on due to its poor defensive stats. Burn and poison wear Yanma down, shortening its lifespan to the point where it can easily be revenge killed by priority attacks.
