Overview
########

With access with to the amazing ability Contrary as well as Superpower to make use of it, Malamar can quickly gather boosts while attacking, making it a real pain after just a few turns. Malamar has impressive bulk when fully invested, granting it easy setup opportunities versus slower walls; it also has fantastic coverage options which aid it greatly once it has set up. However, Malamar's lackluster typing leaves it with no resistances and a 4x weakness to Bug, which can easily be taken advantage of. Its rather low Speed stat makes it difficult to sweep, as Malamar will often be taking hits before attacking. On top of that, its most spammable move, Superpower, only has 8 PP, which can be taken advantage of with Protect and Pressure.

RestTalk
########
name: RestTalk
move 1: Superpower
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
ability: Contrary
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 244 SpD / 12 Spe
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Superpower provides Malamar with a 120 Base Power Fighting-type attack, and is Malamar's best way of utilizing Contrary, as it makes Malamar bulkier and stronger. Knock Off is a strong STAB move once Malamar has boosted, and it is very helpful early-game for removing the items of Malamar's switch-ins, making them easier to wear down throughout the rest of the game. Rest restores Malamar's health and allows it to take advantage of the bulk it gains from Superpower. Rest also cures status aliments, specifically poison and burn, preventing them from crippling Malamar. Sleep Talk prevents Malamar from becoming a sitting duck for the turns that it is asleep, and it also allows Malamar to continue boosting without using up Superpower's rather low PP, which helps alleviate the pressure it faces against bulkier teams.

Set Details
======

By maxing out Special Defense, combined with Superpower boosts and Rest, Malamar becomes incredibly difficult to KO, especially for slower teams that don't hit as hard. 12 Speed EVs allow Malamar to outspeed 0 Speed Seismitoad and slower walls, as being able to use Rest against Seismitoad before it attacks can be crucial late-game.

Usage Tips
========

It is best to bring in Malamar on Pokemon it can threaten out with Superpower, as they will likely be switched out, allowing Malamar to gain a boost. Typical targets include weakened Normal-, Ice-, or Dark-types, or Pokemon that can't do much after a +1 Defense boost, such as Rhydon that lack Megahorn, Lanturn, or Lilligant. Generally, using Knock Off early in the game if the opponent has a Ghost-type such as Migmagius or Gourgiest is useful, as said Pokemon will be easier to wear down throughout the rest of the match, aiding Malamar's sweeping potential later on. Don't try to set up more than what is necessary if the opponent still has a Bug-type or a Pokemon such as Samurott or Rhydon with Megahorn, as they will force Malamar out regardless of how many boosts it has. If Malamar can predict Defog from something harmless, such as Mantine, Prinplup, or Lumineon, switching in will grant Malamar an evasion boost, making it even harder to deal with.

Team Options
========

Steel-types such as Steelix, Probopass, and Klinklang are helpful teammates, as they can switch into the Bug-type attacks that Malamar attracts. A Mantine lure such as Ancient Power or Rock Slide Mega Camerupt or a Fighting-type with Thunder Punch is also very useful, as Mantine often carries Haze which will remove Malamar's boosts. Pairing up Malamar up with Pokemon that also use Fighting-type attacks, such as Sawk, Hariyama, or Kecleon, can be useful, as they each wear down the opponent's switch-ins for Malamar throughout the game.

Three Attacks
########
name: Three Attacks
move 1: Superpower
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Psycho Cut
move 4: Substitute / Rest
ability: Contrary
item: Leftovers / Chesto Berry
evs: 248 HP / 148 SpD / 112 Spe
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Superpower provides Malamar with a 120 Base Power Fighting-type move, which is its best way of utilizing Contrary, as Superpower makes Malamar bulkier and stronger at the same time. Knock Off is a strong STAB move once Malamar is boosted, as it removes items and hits almost everything that resists Superpower for neutral damage. Psycho Cut gives Malamar an easy way of getting around Poison-types that would otherwise give it trouble, including Weezing, Vileplume, and Garbodor, all of which are cleanly 2HKOed after a Superpower boost. The last slot is up to preference. Substitute is recommended, as it allows Malamar to avoid status such as burn, pseudo-status such as Leech Seed and confusion, as well as giving Malamar a barrier to hide behind, making it more difficult to revenge kill. Rest along with a Chesto Berry is also an option, as it prevents Malamar from being whittled down by slower teams and entry hazards; however, Malamar only gets one chance at using Rest without worry.

Set Details
======

The given EV spread allows Malamar's Substitutes to survive weak moves from the likes of Weezing, Vileplume that lack Moonblast, Seismitoad, Mantine, Poliwrath, and Ferroseed. However, if Rest is chosen over Substitute, a simple spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe with an Adamant nature is the most effective, as Malamar no longer needs to worry about having its Substitutes survive weak attacks, and maximum Speed investment allows it to outspeed the common Calm Mind Xatu set as well as maximum base 70 Speed Pokemon. Leftovers is used with Substitute to increase longevity, as Life Orb combined with Substitute wears down Pokemon very quickly and makes it much harder for Malamar to make use of the Defense boosts from Superpower.

Team Options
========

Steelix makes for a fantastic partner for Malamar, capitalizing on almost everything that Malamar struggles with. For example, Togetic and Scyther both beat Malamar, but lose just as easily to Steelix. Other problematic Pokemon for offensive Malamar include Mantine, Granbull, and Bug-type coverage moves on offensive Pokemon. These troublesome Pokemon can be taken care of with Magmortar or other Fire-types with Hidden Power Electric, and having a Substitute up can help Malamar avoid being revenge killed by Bug-type Pokemon and moves.

Other Options
########

A Choice Scarf set is usable, though it is completely overshadowed by Malamar's other sets. It does, however, have the ability to utilize Malamar's nifty supportive movepool consisting of Switcheroo, Destiny Bond, and Topsy-Turvy. Rock Slide can be used to nail counters such as Togetic, Scyther, and Mantine on the switch. A defensive set with Infiltrator, Toxic, and Topsy-Turvy can be effective when played correctly, but generally Malamar is better off using a Contrary set. Topsy-Turvy is, sadly, very difficult to fit on any Contrary movesetâ€”offensive or defensive. Calm Mind plus RestTalk is a fun set to try, but is nothing more than a gimmick when compared to the consistency of the main set.

Checks & Counters
########

**Togetic**: Togetic can easily switch in on a Superpower and has a decent chance to 3HKO Malamar with Dazzling Gleam. Togetic should be cautious of Knock Off, as it will weaken Togetic's ability to support other members of the team, but Malamar itself is never breaking though Togetic.

**Bug-type Pokemon**: Bug-type Pokemon, specifically Bulky Swords Dance or Choice Band Scyther, can easily switch into Malamar, only fearing the nearly non-existent Rock Slide and can immediately threaten it out with a STAB U-turn.

**Bug-type Coverage Moves**: Pokemon in NU are commonly carrying Bug-type coverage moves such as Megahorn or Signal Beam to deal with Malamar. Rhydon, Samurott, Mesprit, Uxie, and Xatu are some examples.

**Mega Audino**: Mega Audino is a more defensively orientated approach at dealing with Malamar, and is commonly seen on stall. It obviously has trouble switching in before it has Mega Evolved, as it will still a pure Normal-type. However, once it has Mega Evolved, Dazzling Gleam has a chance to 3HKO, and Malamar has trouble doing anything in return without a few boosts. Mega Audino can even make use of Skill Swap on its set to fully cripple Malamar and force it out.

**Unaware Quagsire**: Unaware Quagsire can easily switch in on anything Malamar wants to do, then proceed to either Encore it into one move or set up on it with Curse. Without Encore or Curse, however, Quagsire actually has a lot of trouble dealing with Malamar, as Earthquake and Scald do very little damage, and Malamar can Rest off any status, then proceed to simply PP stall by not selecting Sleep Talk while asleep.
