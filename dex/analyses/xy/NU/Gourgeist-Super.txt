Overview
########

Gourgeist-XL is one of the most physically bulky Pokemon in the NU tier, with a rather impressive base 122 Defense and a solid base 85 HP. This extra bulk makes it worth using over its smaller counterparts. Gourgeist-XL is not exactly a sitting duck either, as it has a solid base 100 Attack and a decently powerful STAB move to back it up. Its typing is very unique, giving it resistances to common attacking types such as Water and Ground and immunities to Fighting and Normal. However, this typing does give it weaknesses to common types such as Dark, Fire, and Flying. Another big issue with Gourgeist-XL is its lack of reliable recovery, which makes it prone to being worn down. Its abilities are also useless, with the exception of the somewhat situational Frisk. Gourgeist-XL also faces competition for a team slot with its smaller formes, Vileplume, and Ferroseed, which have a bit more utility.


Physical Wall

name: Physical Wall
move 1: Seed Bomb
move 2: Will-O-Wisp
move 3: Leech Seed
move 4: Pain Split / Protect
ability: Frisk
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Seed Bomb is Gourgeist-XL's strongest reliable STAB move that beats the Water- and Ground-types Gourgeist-XL generally walls. A Ghost-type STAB move can be run instead of Seed Bomb; however, Shadow Sneak is too weak and Phantom Force gives the opponent a free turn. Will-O-Wisp is used to cripple Pokemon that normally get walled by Gourgeist-XL, such as Kangaskhan. Leech Seed and Pain Split are some of Gourgeist-XL's only forms of recovery; alternatively, Protect can be used over Pain Split to stack up burn and Leech Seed damage and to scout moves on Choice-locked Pokemon. Rock Slide can be used to hit Ice-, Fire-, and Flying-types on the switch.

Set Details
========

The EV spread maximizes Gourgeist-XL's physical bulk. Leftovers is useful for passive recovery, and Frisk is the most useful of Gourgeist-XL's abilities, allowing Gourgeist-XL to scout which item the foe is carrying.

Usage Tips
========

Gourgeist-XL is severely crippled by Knock Off, so it's best to not try walling something that likely has it. It is best sent out on something it can wall, such as Feraligatr without Ice Punch and the majority of Stealth Rock leads. However, some of these Pokemon can carry coverage moves that beat Gourgeist-XL, such as Fire Blast Tauros. Also, don't use Will-O-Wisp or Leech Seed if you predict that a Pokemon immune to it is going to switch in.

Team Options
========

Gourgeist-XL is better on bulkier teams, as it loses momentum on offensive ones. A Pokemon that resists Fire-type moves is needed, as Fire-type Pokemon are immune to Will-O-Wisp. Specifically, Thick Fat Hariyama is a great partner for Gourgeist-XL, as it can sponge Fire-, Ice-, and Dark-type attacks. Rock-types such as Rhydon are good teammates, as they beat Fire- and Flying-types and can do decently against Ice-types. Gourgeist-XL also appreciates cleric and Wish support from Pokemon such as Audino and Lickilicky, allowing Gourgeist-XL to wall for as long as possible. A Rapid Spinner or Defogger is also appreciated, as Gourgeist-XL gets worn down by entry hazards.

Other Options
########

Gourgeist-XL can use a SubSeed set, though that is better suited to Gourgeist-S as it has a higher base Speed. A Choice Band set with Shadow Sneak, Rock Slide, Seed Bomb, and Explosion can be used, though this set faces competition from other offensive Grass- and Ghost-types. Gourgeist-XL has a colorful special movepool which includes Giga Drain, Focus Blast, and Fire Blast, though its pitiful base 58 Special Attack makes these moves bad options. Gourgeist-XL can also be a surprisingly decent Trick Room setter, as it can use Explosion to safely bring in a Trick Room sweeper once Trick Room is up. However, this set is generally inferior to the physical wall set outside of dedicated Trick Room teams.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Gourgeist-XL has trouble with Fire-types due to their immunity to Will-O-Wisp and the fact that most are specially offensive. Fire-types can also take its STAB moves relatively well, but will likely hate taking a Rock Slide.

**Offensive Pressure**: Due to Gourgeist-XL's lack of recovery outside of Leech Seed and Pain Split, it's very easy to wear down, though Leech Seed + Protect can mitigate this.

**Dark-types**: Dark types carry Knock Off, which severely cripples Gourgeist-XL. However, they generally don't like getting burned.

**Taunt**: Taunt prevents Gourgeist-XL from spreading burns and using Leech Seed. However, depending on the user, Taunt users can be crippled by a burn on the switch, and most won't like taking a Seed Bomb.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types are immune to Leech Seed and don't take much damage from Seed Bomb. Moreover, several of them have super effective coverage moves against Gourgeist-XL, such as Ludicolo, or can set up in Gourgeist-XL's face, such as Ferroseed and Lilligant. However, some Grass-types such as Cacturne are crippled by burn.

**Xatu**: Xatu bounces back Gourgeist-XL's Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp while dealing a hefty amount of damage with Heat Wave. It can also set up Tailwind and dual screens while Gourgeist-XL is in play, due to Gourgeist-XL's Grass-type moves not doing much. However, Xatu can't really take Rock Slide or a Ghost-type STAB move unless it's a defensive variant.

**Other Ghost-types**: Other Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Haunter can cripple Gourgeist-XL and do not mind being burned. They also can do a hefty amount of damage to it, but can be Leech Seed fodder with proper prediction. However, physical Ghost-type attackers such as Golurk or Dusknoir can't beat Gourgeist-XL under most circumstances.

**Ice-types**: Gourgeist-XL is one of the only spinblockers that loses to Cryogonal. Jynx also beats Gourgeist-XL and can be used as setup fodder for Substitute + Nasty Plot sets.

**Flying-types**: While most of the Flying-types used in NU are physically based, they can still beat Gourgeist-XL under certain circumstances. For example, Archeops can run Heat Wave on mixed sets. Swellow also won't get affected much by a burn due to its ability, Guts. Specially offensive Flying-types such as the previously mentioned Xatu and Chatot can beat Gourgeist-XL relatively easily.
