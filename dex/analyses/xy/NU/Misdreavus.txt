Overview
########

Misdreavus is a pivot and spinblocker for balanced teams due to its Ghost typing and ability, Levitate. Misdreavus's bulk stems from its compatibility with Eviolite, differentiating it from Mismagius. Misdreavus has an amazing support movepool, which includes Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, Heal Bell, Perish Song, and Taunt; when combined with its good Speed, its movepool makes it a useful defensive Pokemon. However, Misdreavus has no recovery moves outside of Pain Split and Rest. Also, because of its low offensive presence, it is harder for Misdreavus to check Fighting-types, which usually run Knock Off.

Moves
========

Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers, such as Feraligatr and Kangaskhan, making Misdreavus harder to break past; its residual damage is useful against defensive Pokemon, as it can allow Misdreavus to use the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Taunt to prevent foes from healing and wear them down. Shadow Ball is a STAB move that hits most offensive Pokemon that don't resist it, bar Normal-types, for decent damage. Taunt stops defensive Pokemon from healing and can let Misdreavus avoid being statused; it is also useful against entry hazard users, such as Garbodor, Rhydon, and Roselia. Pain Split is Misdreavus's most reliable recovery move. Foul Play can be used to do more damage to Normal-types such as Swellow and Zangoose, which Misdreavus can't otherwise touch, and Bouffalant, which is a huge threat to most defensive, balanced, and stall teams. Finally, Perish Song can prevent sweepers such as Xatu from setting up.

Set Details
========

Eviolite boosts Misdreavus's defenses greatly, giving it a niche over Mismagius, which is faster and stronger. 16 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Misdreavus to outrun max Speed Adamant Sandslash, giving Misdreavus even more of an edge when switching in to spinblock against it and crippling it with Will-O-Wisp before it goes for Knock Off. The Speed investment also allows Misdreavus to outspeed bulkier Feraligatr variants and minimum Speed Xatu. The rest of the EVs are put into Defense to let Misdreavus check Ground- and Fighting-types better, as well as the majority of physically attacking Rapid Spin users. Misdreavus can also run a faster spread with 64 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Slurpuff.

Usage Tips
========

Misdreavus can't really spinblock by itself against Kabutops or Cryogonal; however, it can act as a decent pivot switch into Rapid Spin before going into something that can take them out. Misdreavus beats Sandslash quite easily, as it outspeeds Sandslash and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp or 3HKO it with Shadow Ball, which 2HKOes Sandslash after Stealth Rock damage. Misdreavus is a decent switch-in to multiple physical attackers, such as Tauros, slower Feraligatr variants, and Klinklang. Misdreavus can also take any move that isn't Knock Off from Zangoose, Sawk, and Gurdurr and is therefore a reliable answer to those Pokemon.

Team Options
========

Audino and Lickilicky make good teammates for Misdreavus because they can cover most of Misdreavus's weaknesses and provide Wish and cleric support. Entry hazard users, such as Rhydon, Garbodor, Qwilfish, and Roselia, appreciate Misdreavus's ability to reliably block spinners. Pokemon that don't mind taking Knock Off, such as Granbull and Poliwrath, can help alleviate Misdreavus's weakness. Checks to offensive Normal-types, such as Rhydon and Steelix, help against Zangoose and Swellow, which can freely switch into Misdreavus and threaten it with Knock Off and Brave Bird, respectively. Kangaskhan is also threatening, as it can 2HKO Misdreavus on the switch with a small amount of prior damage. Checks to Fire-types, such as Seismitoad, Hariyama, and Dragalge, are also appreciated, as they can switch into those that Misdreavus tends to bait in; Hariyama also checks Cryogonal, which is a huge problem for Misdreavus.

Other Options
########

Other options such as Heal Bell can be used; however, Pokemon that do the job better, such as Audino, are usually already paired with Misdreavus. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple fast offensive Pokemon. Nasty Plot and Calm Mind are options for a bulky sweeper set; however, Mismagius takes up this role a lot better due to its higher offensive stats. Perish Song and Mean Look can be used to deal with bulkier Pokemon by trapping them in and forcing them to faint with Perish Song. Thunderbolt hits Pokemon such as Feraligatr, Archeops, and Samurott harder than Shadow Ball. Magic Coat bounces back entry hazards and status moves which are targeted at Misdreavus. Hex deals more damage than Shadow Ball when the foe is statused, which works well with a Toxic Spikes user.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Fire-type Pokemon such as Pyroar and Typhlosion can come in quite easily on most of Misdreavus's moves and threaten it with their powerful STAB moves. Pyroar is immune to any move Misdreavus commonly carries and can do heavy damage to Misdreavus with Fire Blast.
**Knock Off**: Knock Off users, such as Liepard and Sawk, can remove Misdreavus's Eviolite and severely hamper its defensive capabilities. Most of them, however, fear Will-O-Wisp on the switch and must be careful switching in. Gurdurr is the exception, as it actually enjoys the burn due to Guts.
**Normal-types**: Normal-type Pokemon such as Zangoose and Swellow can come in for free on any Misdreavus not using Foul Play and threaten it with their powerful attacks. Lickilicky is another stellar switch-in to Misdreavus, as it is immune to Taunt and can pass a Wish to a teammate or cure status with Heal Bell.
**Special Attackers**: Almost any bulky Pokemon that doesn't fear a burn too much is a decent check to Misdreavus, as it is quite prone to being worn down by repeated attacks because it has no reliable recovery moves. Cryogonal is a perfect example, as it can hit Misdreavus moderately hard with Freeze-Dry or Ice Beam while healing off any damage taken from Shadow Ball with Recover.
