Overview
########

Swoobat's ability, Simple, allows it to become an effective sweeper when combined with Calm Mind. This is backed up by a high Speed stat and good movepool, which allows it to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame and have great neutral coverage. However, Swoobat has pitifully low bulk and a poor defensive typing, limiting its chances to set up. This is made even worse by its Stealth Rock weakness, making it hard for Swoobat to survive even neutral hits. Three of the types that Swoobat is weak to boast priority moves, specifically Ice Shard, Sucker Punch, and Shadow Sneak, making Swoobat easy to revenge kill. Swoobat is also very weak without boosts, so it relies a lot on setting up.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Stored Power
move 3: Heat Wave
move 4: Roost / Substitute
ability: Simple
item: Kee Berry / Salac Berry
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

With Simple, Calm Mind gives Swoobat +2 Special Attack and Special Defense in one turn. Stored Power is Swoobat's main STAB attack, reaching 100 Base Power after one Calm Mind boost and 140 Base Power after one Calm Mind boost and the boost from its item. Heat Wave hits Steel-types, including Steelix and Klinklang, which resist its Psychic-type STAB moves, while also providing good neutral coverage. Roost offers recovery; this is important because Swoobat gets worn down fast due to its low defenses. Alternatively, Substitute lets Swoobat block status and priority moves and get down to Berry activation range more easily.

Set Details
========

252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature give Swoobat maximum Speed, allowing it to outspeed as much as possible, while 252 Special Attack EVs are used to increase Swoobat's power. The remaining 4 EVs go into Defense rather than HP to allow Swoobat to activate its item after three Substitutes. Simple lets Swoobat double the stat boosts gained from Calm Mind and its Berry. Kee Berry lets Swoobat take physical hits better, making it less vulnerable to priority while boosting the power of Stored Power. Salac Berry also boosts Stored Power, but gives Swoobat a Speed boost in order to outspeed everything, including Choice Scarf users. Roost should be used with Kee Berry, as with increased defenses, Swoobat can make use of recovery, while Salac Berry should be used with Substitute, because without the Defense boost, Swoobat will be vulnerable to priority. Substitute also allows for quicker usage of the Salac Berry.

Usage Tips
========

If running Kee Berry, Swoobat should be sent in on a resisted physical hit, to activate the boost. If this is not possible, both sets should be brought in after a KO into something it forces out, such as Garbodor, in order to set up Calm Mind boosts. Swoobat should only take weak or resisted hits in order to activate its Kee Berry, as it is OHKOed by plenty of stronger neutral attacks. Swoobat should be careful when up against a physical attacker, as even after a Defense boost, it still takes a lot of damage from strong physical attacks. Setting up on special attackers is preferred, as Swoobat can constantly raise its Special Defense; however, it should be careful of status moves such as Lilligant's Sleep Powder. Substitute should be used to block status or to get down to Salac Berry range if required.


Team Options
========

Swoobat has a weakness to Stealth Rock, so it appreciates Rapid Spin users, such as Kabutops and Sandslash, or Defog users, such as Togetic, as partners. Rapid Spinners are preferred, however, as Swoobat also appreciates entry hazards from setters such as Crustle or Ferroseed, as they wear down foes. Strong Fighting-types, such as Sawk and Hariyama, make for good partners, as they beat Dark-types and Kangaskhan. Swoobat appreciates Pursuit trappers such as Sneasel and Liepard, as they can trap and weaken bulky Psychic-types that wall it, such as Musharna and Uxie; in return, Swoobat removes Fighting-types.

Other Options
########

Swoobat has a decent movepool, but it has difficulty fitting other moves. Giga Drain hits Rhydon and Seismitoad harder, but Stored Power already hits them neutrally. Air Slash hits Pangoro super effectively, whilst hitting Psychic- and Dark-types harder than Heat Wave. Signal Beam hits Psychic- and Dark-types harder and for super effective damage. A Choice Specs set with Trick could be used for more immediate power, but nearly every other Psychic-type does this better.

Checks & Counters
########

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon such as Swellow and Sneasel can outspeed and deal heavy damage to Swoobat with their STAB moves, even after a Defense boost. Choice Scarf users, such as Primeape and Rotom, can outspeed and KO Swoobat with a bit of previous damage. However, if Swoobat is boosted at full health, it is able to live a hit from all of these Pokemon and OHKO them all in return; a Substitute will also prevent the faster Pokemon from KOing Swoobat. In addition, Swoobat can outspeed all of those Pokemon after a Salac Berry boost.

**Bulky Pokemon**: Defensive Pokemon, such as Audino and Uxie, can live boosted hits and retaliate. However, Swoobat can live hits from most common walls after boosting its own Defense and use Substitute to block status. Phazing moves such as Lickilicky's Dragon Tail and Grumpig's Whirlwind will force Swoobat out; in addition, Whirlwind passes through Substitutes. Specially defensive Rhydon can live a hit and deal a lot of damage to Swoobat with its Rock-type STAB moves or phaze it out with Roar.

**Paralysis**: Swoobat's main niche is its Speed, so paralyzing it makes it very easy to revenge kill. Musharna has the bulk to live even a boosted hit and paralyze Swobat with Thunder Wave, while Liepard's Thunder Wave will always move first due to Prankster. Body Slam from Pokemon such as Lickilicky can paralyze Swoobat and do a decent amount of damage. Thunder Wave will be blocked if Swoobat has a Substitute up, but most Thunder Wave users of the move can break its Substitute.

**Priority**: Swoobat is weak to Ice Shard, Shadow Sneak, and Sucker Punch, meaning priority users such as Sneasel and Kecleon can easily revenge kill Swoobat. Other priority moves, such as Feraligatr's Aqua Jet and Kangaskhan's Fake Out, can also deal heavy damage to Swoobat. This won't work if Swoobat has a Substitute up or has boosted its Defense; previous damage is required to score the KO.
