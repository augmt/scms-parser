Overview
########

Accelgor's high Speed make it a perfect Spikes lead, as this guarantees that Accelgor will be able to set up one or two layers of Spikes and prevent enemies from setting up by using Encore. Accelgor has access to Final Gambit, allowing it to make sure entry hazards stay around against spinners and Defoggers. It is also a surprisingly strong special attacker with Life Orb. Accelgor's main weakness is its frailness, as it will go down to any competent attacker. It also faces competition as an entry hazard setter from Crustle and Qwilfish, and the offensive set faces a lot of competition from popular special attackers such as Mesprit and Mismagius. Accelgor also requires offensive support to prevent enemy entry hazard removal after using Final Gambit.

Suicide Lead
########
name: Suicide Lead
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Encore
move 3: Bug Buzz / Energy Ball
move 4: Final Gambit
ability: Unburden
item: Focus Sash
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Spikes is the reason to use Accelgor, as Accelgor is almost always capable of setting up at least one layer, which helps break down opposing Pokemon and discourage constant switching. Encore discourages opposing setup sweepers and entry hazard setters from setting up on Accelgor. Bug Buzz 2HKOes Xatu and is a powerful all-purpose STAB move that keeps Accelgor from being completely shut down by Taunt. Alternatively, Energy Ball hits several prominent entry hazard setters, such as Seismitoad and Rhydon. Final Gambit faints Accelgor, keeping the team's momentum and preventing Defog and Rapid Spin from being used; it can also deal a lot of damage if used while Accelgor is at full health, OHKOing common spinners such as offensive Cryogonal and Kabutops.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed investment boosts Accelgor's already good Speed and can allow it to set up more layers of Spikes. Max Special Attack investment makes Accelgor deal more damage, and minimal bulk allows Accelgor to use Unburden more reliably. Unburden and Focus Sash work together to allow Accelgor to move really quickly if its Focus Sash is broken. Even without HP investment, Final Gambit will do plenty of damage if Accelgor is at full health. Alternatively, Max HP and Speed investment can be used to increase Accelgor's Final Gambit damage and allow it to take stray attacks and set up against defensive Pokemon easier.

Usage Tips
========

Spikes Accelgor is very straightforward. Lead with it, and use Spikes to wear down the enemy team. Using Final Gambit to suicide when it appears the enemy is preparing to use Defog or Rapid Spin can help keep entry hazards up for a couple more turns or the whole battle. Using Encore against enemy Stealth Rock users forces them to switch out and gives Accelgor more time to act; it also prevents setup moves, but remember Klinklang outspeeds Accelgor after setting up and will not be hit by Encore. The attacking move will rarely be used, as an additional layer of Spikes will often be the better option, but Bug Buzz is useful for hitting Xatu as it switches in and preventing it from bouncing back Spikes. If Accelgor carries Energy Ball, it can surprise Seismitoad and Rhydon, allowing teammates to bypass their checks.

Team Options
========

Ghost-types block Rapid Spin, so Accelgor appreciates offensive Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Rotom as teammates. Stealth Rock support is mandatory to wear down threats immune to Spikes; Rhydon and Mesprit do this while hitting hard. Golurk can also use Stealth Rock and block Rapid Spin, but loses to all common Rapid Spin users. Some common leads such as Crustle match up very well against Accelgor, and having a teammate such as Rampardos to limit these leads' entry hazards is crucial. Defiant Pokemon, most notably Pawniard and Primeape, gain +2 Attack from Defog, punishing those that use it without regard. In general, wallbreakers and teammates that can keep up offensive pressure such as Kangaskhan, Zangoose, and Feraligatr all make for great teammates. These Pokemon also tend to force an immediate reaction, further applying Spikes damage on the opposing Pokemon. In addition, U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Swellow and Rotom become even better choices with Spikes on the field.


Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Bug Buzz
move 2: Focus Blast
move 3: Energy Ball / Giga Drain
move 4: Spikes / Encore
ability: Sticky Hold
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========

Bug Buzz is Accelgor's strongest STAB move that hits a lot of Pokemon hard. Focus Blast helps Accelgor break through some Steel- and Rock-types, such as Probopass, and is its strongest move against enemy Fighting-types. Energy Ball can be used to deal with several bulky Ground-types, specifically Seismitoad and Rhydon, and is its best move against Ghost-types. Giga Drain is an alternative to Energy Ball that allows Accelgor to recover some HP and mitigate some of the recoil of Life Orb. Spikes allows Accelgor to wear down the walls that it has problems getting through and helps it deal damage with the switches that it forces. However, it is often difficult to find time for offensive Accelgor to use Spikes, and alternatively, Encore allows Accelgor to buy free turns against non-attacking moves.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Accelgor to break through a lot of Pokemon and hit harder and faster. Life Orb further boosts all of Accelgor's attacks, and can't be removed with Knock Off, Trick, or Switcheroo due to Sticky Hold. Modest is the preferred nature, as it ensures an OHKO on Swellow and the 2HKO on Gurdurr with Focus Blast while giving Accelgor a much better chance to OHKO Samurott and Rhydon and 2HKO offensive Mismagius with Energy Ball. However, a Timid nature allows Accelgor to outspeed certain threats, such as maximum Speed Choice Scarf Mesprit and +1 Jolly Dragon Dance Feraligatr.

Usage Tips
========

Bug Buzz is Accelgor's best attack and should be used liberally. Focus Blast, on the other hand, should be used sparingly, as the poor accuracy can be a problem. Accelgor is strong enough to 2HKO a lot of defensive Pokemon such as Vileplume and Gurdurr, but it is often not strong enough to OHKO Pokemon with neutral Bug Buzz. It is also frail and easily revenge killed by priority; this causes offensive Accelgor to have a hard time cleaning up, especially against common bulky offense teams. Instead of trying too hard to preserve Accelgor, use it to blast holes in the enemy team. Accelgor does very well against common Stealth Rock users, such as Seismitoad, Rhydon, and Mesprit, so if it can't really do much against the opponent's team, your best bet is to lead with it and set up as many Spikes as you can while beating most entry hazard setters with its offensive pressure. Having Accelgor on your team restricts enemy options for leads, especially if they cannot handle Spikes; use this to your advantage even if your Accelgor is not a suicide lead variant. If Accelgor carries Encore instead of Spikes, use it to discourage enemy setup moves. Switching into a strong sweeper is a dangerous proposition, but with correct prediction, Accelgor will outspeed majority of Pokemon and lock them into a non-attacking move with Encore. However, be careful of setup sweepers such as Shift Gear Klinklang and Swords Dance Feraligatr that can move before the Encore and OHKO Accelgor.

Team Options
========

Although Accelgor can set Spikes to help it wear down walls, it doesn't help it take out Flying-types, which can be a dangerous problem. For instance, Rotom-S resists all of Accelgor's moves and is immune to Spikes. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Rhydon, Seismitoad, or Ferroseed is a must. Rapid Spin support from Kabutops is appreciated to let Accelgor switch more liberally, but is not required as Accelgor already does a good job at applying offensive pressure to common Stealth Rock users. Bulky Rotom is a good pivot and excels at keeping entry hazards in play. Hariyama completely nullifies offensive Accelgor, so Weezing and Vileplume are great options to keep it in check. Offensive teammates such as Kangaskhan and Feraligatr appreciate Accelgor's potential to blow holes in the opposing team and can provide Spikes support.

Other Options
########

Accelgor's coverage options are rather barren. Knock Off is a good utility move that annoys all switch-ins, but it does minimal damage. U-turn is generally a good move, but Accelgor is weak to Stealth Rock and rarely forces switches. Sludge Bomb is its best move against Fairy-types, but is useless otherwise. Hidden Power Rock hits both Fire- and Flying-types, hitting the likes of Scyther especially hard. Finally, Yawn forces switches and puts counters to sleep, but Accelgor is too frail to use it effectively.

Checks &amp; Counters
########

**Utility**: Defog, Rapid Spin, and Taunt prevent Accelgor's primary job of using Spikes.

**Strong Priority Attacks**: Feraligatr, Kangaskhan, and Kecleon can limit Accelgor to one layer of Spikes with a strong STAB attack and a priority move.

**Rock Blast**: Multi-hit moves, especially Rock Blast, from Pokemon such as Crustle and Rhydon OHKO the lead variant even with Focus Sash, limiting Accelgor to one layer of Spikes.

**Special Walls**: Hariyama, Togetic, and Mantine shut down offensive Accelgor; Mantine and Togetic even have Defog to remove Spikes.

**Pokemon That Resist Bug-type**: Flying-, Poison-, and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Rotom-S, Drifblim, and Garbodor resist every move on the offensive set.

**Choice Scarf Users**: As long as they're faster, Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-S and Pyroar are a problem for the offensive set. Choice Scarf Pokemon can also use neutral moves to bypass Focus Sash and prevent Accelgor from laying down a second layer of Spikes.
