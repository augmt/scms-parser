Overview
########

At first glance, there seems little reason to use Ariados over other Sticky Web users, which have a greater offensive presence, a better movepool, or both. However, Ariados does have a saving grace: Toxic Spikes. With Toxic Spikes, Ariados has a way to put pressure on the opponents, slowly wearing them down. This, in combination with Sticky Web slowing the opponent down, means that Ariados is great at assisting its teammates at beating bulkier offensive teams.

However, even with Toxic Spikes, Ariados's flaws are still very apparent. Firstly, Ariados is very slow, even being outsped by Pokemon such as Crustle, meaning it will usually be KOed before it can set up a second entry hazard. Secondly, grounded Poison-types such as Vileplume and Garbodor and Rapid Spin users such as Cryogonal and Sandslash are extremely common and make Ariados less effective. Ariados's main flaw, however, is the fact that it faces serious competition from other Sticky Web users. Leavanny has a better STAB combination and higher Speed, and Kricketune has Taunt, Endeavor, and Knock Off. Overall, though, if you're looking for a Sticky Web user that can help its team deal with bulky offensive threats such as Feraligatr, give Ariados a try.

name: Sticky Web + Toxic Spikes
move 1: Sticky Web
move 2: Toxic Spikes
move 3: Megahorn
move 4: Sucker Punch
ability: Insomnia
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Sticky Web lowers the opposing team's Speed, helping slower teammates move first. Toxic Spikes allows Ariados to differentiate itself from other Sticky Web users and gives it a way to wear down the opposing team. Megahorn is a powerful STAB attack that gives Ariados a way to deal good damage to Pokemon weak to it, such as Uxie. Lastly, Sucker Punch allows Ariados to get off a final hit against attackers, should it need to.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Ariados to set up its entry hazards as quickly as possible and hit hard once it has accomplished this goal. Focus Sash practically guarantees that Ariados will survive a single hit and be able to set up at least one entry hazard. Finally, Insomnia means Ariados can set up entry hazards even in the face of Sleep Powder.

Usage Tips
========

Don't set up Toxic Spikes if your opponent has a grounded Poison-type on their team, as it will make them close to useless. Ariados works best as a lead, setting up Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes as soon as possible, and should be played differently depending on the nature of the opposing team. For example, against offensive teams, setting up Sticky Web and then a layer of Toxic Spikes is optimal, and against more defensive teams Ariados should be preserved until grounded Poison-types have been removed and then set up Toxic Spikes. It is only necessary to set up one layer of Toxic Spikes against offensive teams, as Pokemon on such teams do not tend to last long enough to require the badly poisoned effect that a second layer of Toxic Spikes cause. One layer also puts more immediate pressure against these teams by doing more damage within the first couple of turns than two layers would do.

Team Options
========

Powerful Pokemon with average Speed such as Zangoose, Bouffalant, Kangaskhan, Samurott, and Magmortar all appreciate Ariados's Sticky Web support. As Ariados does not set up Stealth Rock, offensive Stealth Rock users such as Mesprit, Golem, and Steelix all make good partners. Pawniard is a good partner, as it discourages the use of Defog, which removes Ariados's entry hazards. On a similar note, Ghost-types such as Mismagius, Rotom, and Golurk can all spinblock, protecting Ariados's entry hazards.

Other Options
########

Poison Jab is an option for a secondary STAB move that hits Togetic, though it doesn't hit anything else notable that Megahorn doesn't hit harder. Giga Drain is also an option to deal good damage to Rhydon, a possible lead against Ariados. Swarm can power up Megahorn once Focus Sash has been used, though this leaves Ariados extremely vulnerable to Pokemon with Sleep Powder, such as Vivillon. Foul Play is an option to hit Swords Dance sweepers that try to boost against Ariados. Finally, Baton Pass can be used to allow a teammate to switch in safely, though it has very limited uses.

Checks & Counters
########

**Taunt**: Taunt users such as Archeops and Mismagius can render Ariados close to useless.

**Xatu**: Xatu can block Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes with Magic Bounce, though it doesn't like taking Megahorn or Sucker Punch.

**Rapid Spin and Defog**: Pokemon such as Cryogonal, Sandslash, Pelipper, and Togetic can remove Ariados's entry hazards with Rapid Spin and Defog, respectively.

**Grounded Poison-types**: Grounded Poison-types such as Vileplume, Garbodor, and Muk can absorb Ariados's Toxic Spikes.

**Ditto**: Ditto can transform into Ariados and set up a Sticky Web of its own, neutralizing the effects.

**Faster Attackers**: In general, faster attackers such as Samurott, Archeops, and Pyroar can all outspeed and 2HKO Ariados, limiting it to only one entry hazard.

**Kangaskhan**: Kangaskhan can use Fake Out to break Ariados's Focus Sash and follow with a Return to KO Ariados, preventing it from setting up any hazards.

**Rock Blast**: Rock Blast from the likes of Jolly Crustle and Rhydon can outspeed and KO Ariados through Focus Sash.
