Overview
########
Lickilicky faces a lot of competition in NU. In a support role, Audino sticks out as a much better option, as despite Lickilicky's greater bulk, Audino's access to Regenerator means it can pivot in and out much more easily. In an offensive role, Bouffalant is generally a better option thanks to its much better offensive stats and stronger movepool. Still, Lickilicky's access to Dragon Tail and inability to be Taunted thanks to Oblivious give it a niche as a defensive Pokemon.

Moves
========
Wish works well in conjunction with Lickilicky's great HP stat to restore its teammates' health and its own. Protect ensures that Lickilicky receives the recovery from Wish and makes it more difficult for special attackers to break through it. Additionally, Protect is great for scouting which move a Choice-locked Pokemon will use. Body Slam is a good STAB move for the third slot, as it deals decent damage with a good chance to paralyze. However, Knock Off is a good option that has solid utility and allows Lickilicky to beat the special Ghost-types that it walls. Finally, Dragon Tail is the best move in the last slot to phaze enemy setup sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage. However, on certain teams, Heal Bell is a more useful move to let Lickilicky act as a cleric.

Set Details
========
The given EVs maximize Lickilicky's special bulk, allowing it to take hits from some of the strongest special attackers in the tier. Leftovers offers passive HP recovery and lets Lickilicky regain HP with Protect. Oblivious is Lickilicky's best ability, preventing it from being Taunted. Own Tempo is situational, only preventing the much rarer confusion, while Cloud Nine is illegal in combination with Wish. A Careful nature further enhances Lickilicky's special bulk.

Usage Tips
========
The best time to switch Lickilicky in is when your team is threatened by a special attacker. Then, proceed to heal either Lickilicky or a teammate with Wish. Body Slam should be used primarily to spread paralysis and break Substitutes, while Knock Off should be used to remove items from opposing Pokemon. Dragon Tail should be used when a foe attempts to set up on Lickilicky or simply in order to rack up hazard damage on the opposing team. Lickilicky likes to keep its own Wishes in order to stay at a decent amount of health, allowing it to switch in later if needed.

Team Options
========
Lickilicky fits best with teammates that lack recovery and appreciate its ability to pass Wishes, including Uxie, Rhydon, and Poliwrath. Bulky Pokemon that resist Fighting are excellent teammates to cover Lickilicky's lone Fighting-type weakness. Granbull deserves a special mention for its high physical bulk and access to Heal Bell, which frees up the slot for Dragon Tail on Lickilicky. An entry hazard user such as Ferroseed or Qwilfish is greatly appreciated, especially if Lickilicky is running Dragon Tail, to help wear down the opposing team. A second Wish passer is also helpful if using Lickilicky on a stall team, as Lickilicky is often reliant on its own Wish and cannot pass the healing to teammates well.

Other Options
########
A Choice Band set with Return, Power Whip, Knock Off, and Explosion is a decent option for Lickilicky because of its surprise factor and solid power. A Swords Dance set is the most notable other set, but it is slow, can be revenge killed after setting up, and doesn't have much coverage, and Bouffalant is a much better Swords Dance user. In terms of other moves, Lickilicky has a huge movepool with many special options, including Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, Surf, Ice Beam, and Focus Blast, but it lacks a good special STAB move. Toxic is a fine option on Lickilicky as well.

Checks & Counters
########
**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types, such as Sawk, Primeape, and Hariyama, can usually take care of Lickilicky nicely with their super effective STAB moves. Gurdurr gets a special mention, as it can take all of Lickilicky's moves and use it as setup fodder, though it does not like to lose its Eviolite to a Knock Off.

**Klinklang**: Klinklang can use Substitute to avoid being phazed by Dragon Tail and proceed to set up with Shift Gear. Its Substitutes are also not broken by Body Slam, meaning it usually sets up for free.

**Entry Hazards**: Most entry hazard users, such as Ferroseed, Rhydon, and Crustle, have nothing to fear from Lickilicky and can set up hazards against it. This makes it harder for Lickilicky to heal its teammates, as it must use most of its Wishes on itself because of the entry hazard damage.

**Status**: Without Heal Bell or a cleric on the team, Lickilicky can be easily worn down by moves such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp from defensive Pokemon that it has no hope of breaking past.

**Strong Attackers**: Pokemon with high power, such as Choice Specs Typhlosion, Pyroar, and Dragalge, can break through Lickilicky if entry hazards are on the field or if Lickilicky is afflicted with status and therefore unable to use Protect to stall for Leftovers recovery.
