Overview
########

Stunfisk has a very good, unique Ground / Electric typing which gives it key resistances to common Flying- and Rock-type moves. Additionally, it possesses the base stats required to be able to be used as a good defensive Pokemon. Stunfisk also has access to certain supporting status moves. However, Stunfisk has its flaws. Stunfisk is vulnerable to special sweepers that hit it super effectively, such as Jynx, Sceptile, and Samurott.

Defensive Support
########
name: Defensive Support
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Rest / Toxic
move 3: Discharge
move 4: Earth Power / Scald
ability: Static
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 168 Def / 88 SpDef
nature: Bold


Moves
========

Stealth Rock is the obvious choice for hazard support to assist sweepers on the team. Toxic is an option that hinders the opponent by inflicting poison. Rest can be used for recovery if there is a Heal Bell or Aromatherapy user on the team, as Stunfisk is pretty useless if it is asleep. Because all of these moves are rendered useless by Taunt, Stunfisk needs Scald or Discharge to still have a chance to inflict status upon the opponent even when under the effects of Taunt. Earth Power is an option that allows Stunfisk to hit Electric-types, which cannot be paralyzed.

Set Details
========

Mixed defensive EVs allow Stunfisk to withstand hits from both the physical and special side. Meanwhile, Static is the only ability Stunfisk should use. It doesn't need Limber as Stunfisk is already immune to being paralyzed by its typing, and Sand Veil is banned because of the evasion clause. Static does grant an extra chance to paralyze the opponent when it makes contact. Leftovers is the best item choice on Stunfisk, as it appreciates extra recovery.


Usage Tips
========

This set's primary function is to assist the team's sweepers by afflicting status on threats and setting up Stealth Rock. That being said, your first goal when sending out Stunfisk should be to set up Stealth Rock. When that's done, Stunfisk's objective is to wear down opponents with status or attacks. Always keep in mind that Stunfisk is one of the slowest things in the tier with base 32 Speed.

Team Options
========

Slower, powerful Pokemon such as Feraligatr, Samurott, Luxray, Ursaring, and Zangoose greatly benefit from Stunfisk's paralysis support. The use of Ghost-types is recommended to block Rapid Spin. Pokemon such as Sceptile, Mantine, and Ludicolo all are able to switch in on the Water- and Ground-type attacks that Stunfisk is weak to and retaliate with powerful super effective STAB moves.


Other Options
########

Other options include Yawn as an option to phaze opponents and wear them down faster with the damage from Stealth Rock. Thunder Wave is also an option but is redundant alongside Static and Discharge. Infestation can be used to deal chip damage and trap the opponent. Finally, Sludge Bomb or Sludge Wave can be used as coverage options against Fairy-types.

Checks &amp; Counters
########
**Special Attackers with Super Effective Moves**: Pokemon such as Jynx, Samurott, Sceptile, and Lilligant are all able to easily take out Stunfisk with their powerful super effective STAB moves.
**Taunt**: Taunt stops Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Rest.
**Special Walls**: Special walls like such as Audino and Togetic have enough bulk to take a hit from Stunfisk and negate its presence with moves such as Rest and Heal Bell.
**Heal Bell**: Heal Bell renders the status spread by Stunfisk worthless.
