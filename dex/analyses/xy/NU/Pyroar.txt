Overview
########
Pyroar is a very threatening special attacker in NU; its base 106 Speed allows it to outspeed the majority of the metagame, and it can hit very hard thanks to its good Special Attack and powerful moves. Pyroar's Normal typing makes it the best offensive check in the tier to Ghost-types, such as Mismagius, and gives it a strong secondary STAB move that can hit a lot of Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves for neutral damage. Pyroar also has the room to run some neat support moves such as Taunt and Will-O-Wisp on its sets, and its ability, Unnerve, can stop Berry users such as Slurpuff. However, Pyroar is quite frail, and common priority moves such as Mach Punch and Aqua Jet KO it with ease; this is further compounded by its weakness to Stealth Rock, making it extremely easy to check. It also struggles to differentiate itself from other Fire-type attackers such as Typhlosion, over which it only has its access to a Normal-type STAB move.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Hyper Voice
move 3: Hidden Power Grass
move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Flamethrower
ability: Unnerve
item: Life Orb / Choice Specs
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Fire Blast is Pyroar's main STAB move and hits everything that doesn't resist it very hard. Hyper Voice is its secondary STAB move, complementing Fire Blast by hitting Water- and Dragon-types, which are usually switched into Fire-types, very hard. Hidden Power Grass is chosen in the third slot, as it smacks Rhydon and Kabutops really hard; it also hits Seismitoad on the switch. However, you should be careful when using this move, especially if you are running Choice Specs, because being locked into this move can give your opponent setup opportunities. Will-O-Wisp is the move that should be used in the last slot if Pyroar is using Life Orb, as it cripples common switch-ins to Fire-types such as Hariyama and Rhydon and provides Pyroar with a way of hitting Sucker Punch users before they heavily damage it. It also greatly wears down some checks to Pyroar that have no reliable recovery and do not appreciate taking residual damage, such as Dragalge. Flamethrower should be used with Choice Specs, as it can be quite useful as a reliable Fire-type STAB move thanks to its perfect accuracy.

Set Details
========

Special Attack and Speed are maximized to make the most of Pyroar's offensive capabilities; the leftover EVs are put into Defense to reduce Stealth Rock damage. Life Orb is the main item on this set, giving Pyroar a sizable power boost. While it wears down Pyroar a bit faster than Choice Specs, it allows Pyroar to not switch out as often. Choice Specs another great option, as it doesn't deal recoil damage; furthermore, Pyroar uses Fire Blast most of the time, making the ability to switch moves unneeded. Unnerve is the ability of choice, as Moxie is completely useless because Pyroar doesn't have usable physical moves, while Rivalry is very unreliable. Unnerve can come in handy by stopping Slurpuff's Unburden from activating, as well as preventing Occa Berries from working.

Usage Tips
========

Pyroar is a decent switch-in to Ghost-types such as Mismagius thanks to its immunities to Will-O-Wisp and Ghost-type moves; once you switch Pyroar in, it can start firing off powerful attacks. Just spam Pyroar's STAB moves or try to hit an incoming Rock-type or Hariyama with Will-O-Wisp. Be careful of getting locking into Hidden Power Grass when using Choice Specs, as Pyroar can be rendered setup fodder.

Team Options
========

Because most of Pyroar's switch-ins are grounded and do not have reliable recovery, entry hazard setters make for good partners. Crustle is one of the best entry hazard leads on hyper offensive teams and can easily set up Stealth Rock and Spikes. Rampardos is another decent partner, being able to almost always set up Stealth Rock while stopping entry hazard leads such as Crustle; it also has the ability to weaken Rock-types trying to switch into its Rock-type STAB moves with Earthquake or Superpower, making them susceptible to Pyroar's attacks. On more balanced teams, Ferroseed and Roselia can set up entry hazards on Water-types, which check Pyroar. Rapid Spin support is very helpful for Pyroar, as it lets it switch in multiple times. Sandslash and Cryogonal both have decent synergy with Pyroar offensively and defensively; as such, they are good choices for teammates. Switch-ins to the Water-types that check Pyroar are good partners; good examples of those for offensive teams are Sceptile, Lilligant, and Dragalge. Feraligatr and Samurott appreciate Water-types being weakened by Hyper Voice, so they make for good partners. They also get a setup opportunity if Pyroar is KOed by a Rock-type. Bulky Ground- and Water-types such as Seismitoad and Rhydon can check Rock-types and set up Stealth Rock or scare them out. Pokemon that are checked by Mismagius, such as Mesprit, are also decent partners, as Pyroar is a stellar switch-in to it and can proceed to put a lot of offensive pressure on the opposing team.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Flamethrower / Overheat
move 2: Fire Blast / Overheat
move 3: Hyper Voice
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Endeavor
ability: Unnerve
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Flamethrower is a reliable Fire-type STAB move, hitting Pokemon that do not resist it decently hard. Fire Blast has immediate power and does not force Pyroar out, so it is chosen for the second slot. However, Overheat can be used in the first two slots, as it is extremely powerful, and unlike Fire Blast, it always OHKOes Slurpuff at 75% health, as well as +1 Lilligant without any prior damage. Hyper Voice is a moderately strong secondary STAB move, hitting most Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves, such as Water- and Fire-types, for neutral damage. Hidden Power Grass hits Barbaracle for super effective damage, which is quite important due to Choice Scarf Pyroar being one of the few Pokemon that still outspeed it even after it has boosted. It can also be used to hit other Rock-types such as Rhydon, Carracosta, and Kabutops on the switch. Endeavor can dent Pyroar's checks if it has taken some damage, which can help put something into priority range or just take it out with Toxic Spikes support. However, use it only if your team has other ways to get around Barbaracle.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed investment are used for maximum offensive prowess and to let Pyroar revenge kill as many things as possible. Unnerve is Pyroar's best ability and can be useful to stop Slurpuff from activating Unburden; it also nullifies Occa Berries.

Usage Tips
========

Generally, Pyroar should just use the strongest move against its target; however, be careful when picking a move, as being locked into Overheat and Hidden Power Grass can be quite dangerous if the opponent has a setup sweeper such as Feraligatr or Bouffalant. If Pyroar carries Overheat, it can revenge kill Slurpuff even if it has set up. Be careful while switching into Lilligant if Sleep Clause is not active, as Sleep Powder can stop revenge killing attempts. Pyroar is also a decent check to Klinklang, as it can survive a +1 Return with Stealth Rock up if Klinklang is not using Life Orb, even surviving a Life Orb Return if Stealth Rock is not on the field.

Team Options
========

Grass- and Dragon-types such as Dragalge and Sceptile are good partners, as they can deal with bulky Water-types, which easily wall Choice Scarf Pyroar. Bulky Ground-types such as Seismitoad are excellent checks to Rock-types and can set up Stealth Rock to weaken the opposing team. Sandslash appreciates Pyroar forcing out Grass-types and can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards on your side of the field, granting Pyroar more opportunities to switch in. Spikes support is nice to have, with the switches Pyroar tends to force. Good Pokemon for the job are Roselia and Ferroseed if Pyroar is used on more balanced teams, and Crustle if it is used on more offensive ones. Cryogonal is another decent partner, being able to threaten Water-types such as Seismitoad with Freeze-Dry, while also providing Rapid Spin support. Wallbreakers such as Sawk also help this set greatly, threatening special walls that wall Pyroar and forcing anything that wants to come in to take massive damage from a coverage move. Pokemon that are checked by Mismagius, such as Mesprit, are also decent partners, as Pyroar can easily switch into Mismagius and can proceed to put a lot of offensive pressure on the opposing team.

Other Options
########

Pyroar can effectively use Solar Beam, either with a Sunny Day set in a sun team or with a Power Herb. However, Pyroar doesn't offer any particular benefits to sun teams, and Life Orb Hidden Power Grass gets most of the KOs Solar Beam gets and can be used more than once and out of sun. Pyroar is also an effective Substitute user and can use a Substitute + 3 attacks set with Expert Belt or a Substitute + Endeavor set. Expert Belt is another item that can be used, as it lets Pyroar bluff a Choice set and hit the switch-in very hard. Taunt is a legitimate option too, as it lets Pyroar stop some entry hazard setters and Defog users. Dark Pulse is the only other coverage move Pyroar gets, but it is useless most of the time, as its only target is the rare Lampent. Finally, a physical Moxie set might look tempting, but Pyroar has no good Fire-type physical STAB move and has a very mediocre Attack stat.

Checks &amp; Counters 
########

**Bulky Fire-types**: Specially defensive Flareon is one of the best counters to Pyroar, as it can take most hits from Pyroar very well and stall it out with Wish + Protect. Camerupt can also take most hits from Pyroar and set up Stealth Rock or just KO it with Earthquake. Lampent resists every move Pyroar usually carries and can set up Calm Mind or Trick Room on it.

**Bulky Water-types**: Seismitoad can take most hits from Pyroar other than Hidden Power Grass, force it out, and set up Stealth Rock, but it doesn't have reliable recovery and can't take Hyper Voice too well. Lanturn can also take some hits and gain momentum with Volt Switch or 2HKO Pyroar with Scald.

**Rock-types**: Rhydon and Regirock can take most hits, but they fear Will-O-Wisp and Hidden Power Grass. Archeops outspeeds Pyroar, takes neutral damage from Hidden Power Grass, and OHKOes Pyroar with Stone Edge or Earthquake.

**Faster Pokemon and Priority Users**: Faster Pokemon, such as Sceptile and Tauros, and Choice Scarf users, such as Mesprit and Sawk, can deal a lot of damage or just straight out KO Pyroar before it can fire off a hit, making them decent checks. Priority users such as Gurdurr, Kabutops, and Feraligatr can pick Pyroar off with Mach Punch and Aqua Jet, respectively.

**Special Walls**: Dragalge and Audino can take most of the hits Pyroar fires off, especially from the Choice Scarf set, and are good pivots in general.

**Residual Damage**: Entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, are a great way to pressure Pyroar, as it is forced out quite easily. It also commonly carries Life Orb, reducing its lifespan considerably.
