Overview
########

Thanks to Quilladin's great physical bulk and access to Spikes, it can check or wall many prominent physical attackers in the tier, including Feraligatr, Kangaskhan, Klinklang, and multiple Fighting-types. Its unique ability, Bulletproof, lets it set up on the most threatening walls in the tier, Vileplume and Ferroseed, by making it immune to "ball" and "bomb" moves. Quilladin also has access to reliable recovery in Synthesis and phazing in Roar, giving it an advantage over its rival, Ferroseed. However, its poor special bulk makes it weak to many common special attackers. Quilladin also lacks offensive presence and is setup bait without Roar. Finally, it faces tough competition from other Grass-type walls, such as Tangela and Vileplume, and other Spikes setters, such as Roselia and Ferroseed, which perform their respective roles better.

Spikes
########
name: Spikes
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Wood Hammer
move 3: Synthesis
move 4: Roar
ability: Bulletproof
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Spikes makes it easier for sweepers on your team to clean by dealing decent amounts of damage to Pokemon switching in. Wood Hammer is a STAB move that deals decent amounts of damage even when hitting neutrally; Quilladin takes only minimal recoil damage either way. Synthesis recovers health, increasing Quilladin's longevity. Roar phazes foes, preventing Quilladin from being rendered setup bait. It is also very useful for racking up Spikes damage. Quilladin can run Taunt over Roar to stop entry hazard setters and setup sweepers, notably Bouffalant, from setting up alongside it; additionally, with a few Speed EVs, Quilladin can outspeed and Taunt common walls before they can move.

Set Details
========

The HP and Defense EVs, along with an Impish nature, maximize Quilladin's physical bulk, letting it survive a Brave Bird from Swellow or an Acrobatics from Archeops. They also allow it to more easily tank hits from other physical attackers, such as Kangaskhan, Klinklang, and Hariyama. A spread of 200 HP / 56 Atk / 252 Def can be used so that Wood Hammer always breaks 188 HP / 60 Def Uxie's Substitute. Eviolite boosts Quilladin's defenses by 50%, greatly increasing its overall bulk. With Bulletproof, its unique ability, Quilladin becomes immune to all "ball" and "bomb" moves, including the common Sludge Bomb, Focus Blast, and Shadow Ball.

Usage Tips
========

Quilladin can be used throughout the game to set up entry hazards and take neutral or resisted physical attacks. Even though Quilladin can take Knock Off with ease thanks to its great physical bulk, try to avoid getting Eviolite Knocked Off, as without it, Quilladin's defensive capabilities are greatly lowered. Try to set up Spikes on physical attackers whose STAB attacks are either weak or resisted by Quilladin, such as Feraligatr, Rhydon, Golem, and Golurk. Quilladin can also switch into defensive Vileplume, taking negligible damage from its attacks and getting a free turn to set up; however, beware of the rare Hidden Power Fire, which can deal serious damage to Quilladin.

Team Options
========

Quilladin works well on balance and stall teams because of the physical bulk and entry hazards it provides. Pokemon such as Dragalge, Assault Vest Hariyama, Poliwrath, Camerupt, and Seismitoad can take Fire-type moves for Quilladin. The first three can also take Bug-type moves, and Hariyama can take Ice-type moves. Rhydon, Golem, and Steelix are good teammates because they can take on Flying-types for Quilladin and also set up Stealth Rock, which complements Quilladin's Spikes; in return, Quilladin can take Water-, Grass-, and Ground-type moves. Probopass is a great partner because it covers Quilladin's Ice, Bug, and Flying weaknesses, while Quilladin covers its Ground weakness. Quilladin appreciates Wish support, as it likes to be at full health and Synthesis is not always enough, and cleric support from special walls such as Audino and Lickilicky helps it with both this issue and its weakness to special moves; Quilladin can take physical moves for them. Spinblockers such as Mismagius, Golurk, and Rotom prevent Quilladin's Spikes from being removed by Rapid Spin users, while Defiant Pokemon such as Pawniard and Purugly can deter Defog. In a similar vein, most offensive Pokemon, including Feraligatr, Typhlosion, Slurpuff, and Tauros, enjoy Spikes's residual damage, which makes it easier for them to sweep, wallbreak, or clean. Finally, as Quilladin is setup fodder for hazard setters, spinners such as Cryogonal and Sandslash can keep your side of the field clear. Cryogonal can also take Ice-type moves and special attacks, while Sandslash sets Stealth Rock, which complements Spikes.

Other Options
########

The combination of Leech Seed and Protect can be used instead of Synthesis as an alternate source of recovery, with Protect being able to scout foes' moves as well. However, using this makes Quilladin unable to beat Vileplume and Ferroseed, which are immune to Leech Seed, though it can still set up on them. Toxic can be used to wear down walls. Rock Slide hits troublesome Fire- and Flying-types, though its coverage is situational.

Checks & Counters
########

**Xatu**: Xatu easily shuts down Quilladin, resisting Wood Hammer courtesy of its Flying typing while bouncing back Spikes and Roar thanks to Magic Bounce.

**Fire-types**: Typhlosion, Pyroar, Magmortar, Flareon, Rapidash, Simisear, and Ninetales can all OHKO Quilladin with their STAB moves. Defensive Camerupt and Torkoal dent it with their STAB moves while taking minimal damage from Wood Hammer, and Torkoal can also spin away Spikes.

**Ice-types**: Cryogonal can threaten Quilladin with its STAB moves while also spinning away Spikes. Jynx, Rotom-F, Articuno, and Glaceon can outspeed and easily OHKO Quilladin with their STAB moves. Articuno also resists Wood Hammer. However, Jynx and Cryogonal can't switch in because Wood Hammer OHKOes them after Stealth Rock damage, and without Life Orb, Jynx requires prior damage to KO Quilladin.

**Flying-types**: Swellow, Dodrio, and Archeops can 2HKO a healthy Quilladin with their STAB Flying-type moves, though Archeops cannot switch in very easily because Wood Hammer causes it to fall into Defeatist range. Vivillon and Swanna threaten to OHKO Quilladin with STAB Hurricane; additionally, the former 4x resists Wood Hammer, while the latter can Defog away Quilladin's Spikes. Chatot and Rotom-S can 2HKO Quilladin with their respective STAB moves. Defensive Pelipper can 2HKO Quilladin with Air Slash after Stealth Rock and proceed to Defog away its Spikes.

**Special Attackers**: Because of Quilladin's horrendous Special Defense, many special attackers, such as Mesprit, Xatu, and Slurpuff, can deal a lot of damage to it with their Fire-type coverage moves. After Shell Smash, Gorebyss can OHKO Quilladin with Ice Beam, and Ludicolo and Samurott can finish a weakened Quilladin with Ice Beam, but Gorebyss and Samurott dislike Wood Hammer. Accelgor threatens it with Bug Buzz and can take Wood Hammers thanks to its Grass resistance.

**Bouffalant**: Bouffalant can switch into Wood Hammer thanks to Sap Sipper and proceed to deal massive damage with Megahorn, with Choice Band variants OHKOing Quilladin.

**Status**: Toxic and Will-O-Wisp make Quilladin's job much harder. The former puts it on a timer, while the latter does the same and also forces it to use Roar or switch out because anything can set up on a weakened Wood Hammer.

**Knock Off**: Although Quilladin can tank even STAB Knock Offs, much of its bulk comes from its item, Eviolite; as such, Knock Off is detrimental to Quilladin.
