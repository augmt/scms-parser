Overview
########
In a tier filled with special attackers, Frogadier stands out thanks to its ability, Protean, which grants it STAB on all of its attacks. But this isn't all; Frogadier is fast with a decent offensive presence, has a great coverage movepool, and the ability to use U-turn to keep up offensive momentum. However, it has a crippling flaw in that it is frail and thus easily revenge killed by faster attackers, Choice Scarf carriers, and priority attacks.

Protean Attacker
########
name: Protean Attacker
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Grass Knot
move 4: U-turn / Hidden Power Fire
ability: Protean
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Timid

Moves
========
Hydro Pump is Frogadier's most powerful attack, and it deals heavy damage against Fire-types, Rock-types, and Ground-types. Ice Beam offers excellent coverage alongside Hydro Pump, hitting Grass-types that resist Water-type attacks, and also nailing Dragon- and Flying-types; it is also a more accurate way of dealing with Ground-types. Grass Knot is Frogadier's most powerful option against Pokemon such as Feraligatr and Seismitoad, which would easily take any of its other attacks. In the last moveslot, U-turn is Frogadier's means of maintaining momentum and scouting, whereas Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Ferroseed, which takes little damage from any of Frogadier's other coverage options.

Set Details
========
Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs are vital for allowing Frogadier to hit quickly and powerfully. A Naive nature enhances Frogadier's Speed while not lessening the damage output from U-turn, but a Timid nature is the way to go if you choose not to opt for U-turn in the final slot. A Life Orb offers a much-appreciated power boost that lets Frogadier net KOs with greater ease, and, as it is already frail, it doesn't really mind the recoil damage.

Usage Tips
========
As its defenses are lacking, your best bet is to bring Frogadier in either after a teammate has been KOed, or via a slow and bulky Volt Switch, U-turn, or Baton Pass user. Frogadier should use U-turn to gain offensive momentum, should an appropriate opportunity arise. Additionally, U-turn can prove to be a very useful move to use early-game for momentum or scouting when Frogadier is not yet ready to try and sweep. While it might seem appealing to use Protean's defensive benefits, Frogadier is rather frail, and this combined with Life Orb damage means that Frogadier is still going to be taken out rather easily, even if it resists its foe's attack. Priority users, faster opponents, and special walls should ideally be disposed of before attempting to sweep, given that Frogadier cannot take hits well at all.

Team Options
========
A slow and bulky user of Volt Switch, U-turn, or Baton Pass can tank a hit and proceed to bring Frogadier in unscathed. Examples of these Pokemon include Probopass and Togetic. Frogadier appreciates having teammates that can set up entry hazards; this will give it an easier time KOing its opponents, and will punish any foes switching in after Frogadier has forced the opponent's ally out. For example, Grass Knot is a guaranteed OHKO on Feraligatr after Stealth Rock. As it can set up Stealth Rock in addition to sporting the aforementioned slow Volt Switch, Probopass is definitely a teammate worth considering. Given that Frogadier is going to be switching in and out of the field with U-turn a fair amount, entry hazards will serve to wear it down quickly, especially in conjunction with Life Orb recoil. For this reason, Frogadier likes having Rapid Spin or Defog support. Examples of Pokemon who can provide this support include Sandslash and Togetic. Frogadier benefits from Sticky Web support, as this allows it to outspeed foes it normally couldn't, and blast them with its coverage attacks. Some examples of Sticky Web users are Leavanny and Ariados. Physical wallbreakers like Sawk can prove useful for taking out the special walls that sponge Frogadier's attacks.

Other Options
########
Surf, with its perfect accuracy, is a more reliable alternative to Hydro Pump; however, Frogadier prefers the greater raw power that Hydro Pump has to offer. Dark Pulse can be used for its coverage against Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Mesprit and Mismagius. Frogadier also has access to Toxic Spikes. As it is fast and can force switches, it shouldn't have many problems getting a layer of Toxic Spikes down and weakening its counters for itself and its teammates. Finally, Taunt is a possibility for shutting down opposing walls.

Checks and Counters
########
**Special Walls**: Special walls like Lickilicky and Audino are happy to take hits from Frogadier all day and can knock it out with few problems.

**Faster Attackers**: Faster attackers and Choice Scarf carriers can swiftly revenge kill a frail Pokemon like Frogadier before it gets the chance to attack them, especially as Frogadier is going to have taken some recoil from its Life Orb.

**Priority Attackers**: Priority attackers will trouble a fast and frail Pok√©mon such as Frogadier; it will not enjoy being badly dented or KOed before it can attack them.

**Entry Hazards**: Entry hazards, in addition to Life Orb recoil, will result in Frogadier getting worn down quickly as it switches in and out of the field.

**Special Tanks**: Specially bulky attackers like Lanturn or Assault Vest Hariyama can prove problematic for Frogadier, given that it may struggle to damage them significantly, and their offensive presence will easily overwhelm its lacking defenses.
