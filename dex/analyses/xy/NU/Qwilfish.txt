Overview
########
Qwilfish has a solid defensive typing that gives it key resistances to Fighting- and Water-type moves, and allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes, although its typing gives it a weakness to Ground- and Electric-type moves. It also possess good abilities in the form of Intimidate and Swift Swim, the former of which allows it to check some Pokemon in the tier such as Sawk, Hariyama, and Granbull. Qwilfish also has access to a variety of moves such as Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Thunder Wave, Taunt, Explosion, Pain Split, Waterfall, and Poison Jab. Access to such moves means Qwilfish makes an ideal entry hazard-stacking Pokemon for offensive and defensive teams alike. Although Qwilfish has good Speed, Attack, and Defense coupled with Intimidate, it has a pitiful Special Defense stat that prevents Qwilfish from checking Pokemon it otherwise could, such as Samurott, Omastar, and Typhlosion.

Hazards Support
########
name: Hazards Support
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Pain Split
move 3: Waterfall / Scald
move 4: Taunt / Thunder Wave
ability: Intimidate
item: Black Sludge
evs: 252 HP / 232 Def / 24 Spe
nature: Impish / Bold

Moves
========
Spikes is the most important move on this set, as it allows Qwilfish to stack entry hazards against the opposing team, inflicting residual damage on all grounded Pokemon. Pain Split, along with Qwilfish's low HP stat, allows Qwilfish to recover some of its HP against healthier opponents. Waterfall is a good STAB move, and Scald is a weaker STAB option that is useful for its 30% chance of burn, which can cripple a lot of the physical attackers. In the last slot, Taunt can prevent some walls like Audino from using Wish + Protect, also allowing Qwilfish to break stall to an extent. Additionally, Taunt can prevent Defog. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple sweepers such as Sawk and Slurpuff. Toxic Spikes is an option to stack more entry hazards. Poison Jab is a usable STAB option over Waterfall, and Haze can be used to remove all stat boosts on setup sweepers.

Set Details
========
Speed investment allows Qwilfish to outspeed base 55 Speed Pokemon such as Exeggutor and Golurk, as well as max Speed Adamant Torterra. That allows Qwilfish to set an extra layer or possibly Taunt them, preventing hazards, although it can be dangerous as all 3 of them have super effective moves to hit Qwilfish. Maximum HP is used to maximize bulk, with the rest of the EVs put into Defense to take physical attacks better together with Intimidate. Black Sludge is used for passive recovery. If Waterfall or Poison Jab are chosen over Scald, then the nature should be Impish. Otherwise, using a Bold nature is better.

Usage Tips
========
Qwilfish can be used as a lead for entry hazard-stacking defensive teams to set up hazards as early as possible and stop opposing leads such as Omastar and Garbodor from setting up with Taunt. Additionally, it can be used throughout the game for its ability to set up hazards more than one time with Pain Split, and also to check threats such as Sawk, Feraligatr, Hariyama, and Granbull. Qwilfish uses the combination of Spikes, Pain Split, and Taunt to set up entry hazards as much as possible and stay at a healthy amount of HP, and Taunt also stops opponents from using Defog.

Team Options
========
Spinblockers, such as Spiritomb and Mismagius, are good teammates for Qwilfish to block the opponent's Rapid Spin and keep the hazards on their field. Phazers go well with Qwilfish for their ability to force switches and inflict residual damage from the entry hazards; examples include Dragon Tail Lickilicky, Roar Rhydon, and Roar Steelix. The latter two can also set up Stealth Rock, which compliments Qwilfish's hazards, and are immune to Electric-type attacks with their Ground typing, Seismitoad is another Ground-type that learns Stealth Rock.

On more balanced teams, some sweepers such as Electivire, Typhlosion, and Feraligatr appreciate the entry hazards that Qwilfish sets. Wish support from Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Audino can help keep Qwilfish around, and they also have good synergy with Qwilfish for their ability to stomach special attacks, while Qwilfish can switch into the Fighting-types that Lickilicky and Audino struggle against. Finally, Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Tangela can switch into Electric-type attacks.

Suicide Lead
########
name: Suicide Lead
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Toxic Spikes
move 4: Explosion
ability: Intimidate
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
Spikes is a good entry hazard that can be stacked up to three times. Taunt prevents the opponent from setting up hazards with Pokemon such as Garbodor and Omastar, and also prevents Defog. Toxic Spikes is another type of entry hazard that inflicts poison upon switch in. Using Explosion before the opponent can Defog or Rapid Spin will cause the attempt to remove hazards to fail, and it also inflicts decent damage. Waterfall can also be used as a STAB option.

Set Details
========
Focus Sash allows Qwilfish to survive a hit and be more likely to set up at least two layers of entry hazards. Intimidate helps Qwilfish set up by allowing it to take some weaker physical hits, and max Speed investment with a Jolly nature is used to be as fast as possible to set up entry hazards. Max Attack investment is used to boost Qwilfish's damage output from Explosion.

Usage Tips
========
Qwilfish is usually used as a lead for hyper offense teams that rely on stacking entry hazards, so leading with it is usually the best option. If the opponent's lead is something that could potentially set up, such as Probopass with Stealth Rock, then Taunt can be used to prevent that. When using Toxic Spikes, sometimes it's better to lay down one layer as poison inflicts more damage on a shorter notice than toxic poison, and that is best against offensive teams. Against more defensive teams with walls such as Audino or Lickilicky, it's better to have two layers. Use Explosion against a potential Rapid Spinner or a Defogger to prevent entry hazards from being removed.

Team Options
========
Pokemon on offensive teams that appreciate Qwilfish's entry hazards support make good teammates. These Pokemon include sweepers such as Ludicolo, Pyroar, Typhlosion, Slurpuff, Feraligatr, and Electivire. Stealth Rock users also go well with Qwilfish as their hazards compliment one another. Mesprit and Magnet Pull Probopass are good Stealth Rock setters that fit on offensive teams. Finally, wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Pyroar, Typhlosion, Magmortar, and Choice Band Granbull can break walls more easily with the support Qwilfish's entry hazards bring.

Other Options
########
Qwilfish can effectively utilize a set with Swords Dance, Poison Jab, Waterfall, and Explosion to attempt a sweep on its own or lure some walls like Vileplume and KO with Explosion at +2, but Swords Dance is illegal with Aqua Jet and Intimidate. A Swift Swim set with Rain Dance, Waterfall, Poison Jab, and Explosion can fit on rain teams to set up Rain Dance and then use Explosion to bring another sweeper in safely. Additionally, Qwilfish can utilize a set with Life Orb using its special moves such as Hydro Pump and Sludge Bomb, but Qwilfish's Special Attack is rather poor. An all-out attacking set with Intimidate can bluff a support set while still checking threats such as Sawk and Hariyama. Finally, Qwilfish can use Choice Scarf set with Waterfall, Poison Jab, and Explosion to act as a revenge killer, but it's weak without any boosts.

Checks & Counters
########
**Psychic-types**: Psychic-type attacks are super effective on Qwilfish; as such, most Psychic-type Pokemon can stop Qwilfish. Kadabra and Xatu are good at this, the latter especially because it can use Magic Bounce to reflect Qwilfish's own hazards back at it, and the former is unaffected by hazards thanks to Magic Guard. Mesprit can also use its STAB Psychic to KO Qwilfish.

**Special Attackers**: Because of Qwilfish's poor Special Defense stat, any strong special attacker can stop it in its tracks. Seismitoad, Rotom-N, Rotom-F, Mismagius, and Sceptile can all damage Qwilfish for a lot with their STAB attacks. Cryogonal and Articuno both can carry Freeze Dry, which is super effective against Qwilfish. Additionally, Seismitoad has Water Absorb and resists Poison-type moves while having Earth Power to hurt Qwilfish.

**Defog/Taunt**: Although Qwilfish can carry Taunt to stop Defog, most Defoggers such as Mantine and Pelipper are immune to its hazards and can come in later and remove them with ease. Faster Taunt users can also stop Qwilfish in its tracks; those include Mismagius, Samurott, and Liepard.
