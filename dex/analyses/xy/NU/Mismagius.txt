Overview
########

Mismagius is a very prominent threat in the NU metagame thanks to its versatility and great Speed and Special Attack stats. Thanks to its access to Taunt and Destiny Bond, Mismagius is an effective stallbreaker and revenge killer. Mismagius's typing and ability grants it three immunities and a fair amount of resistances, allowing it to take on most entry hazard setters and block Rapid Spin. Mismagius can utilize an offensive or a defensive set, being able to either break down defensive teams or punch holes in more balanced teams. Thanks to Levitate, Mismagius is immune to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web, which is very beneficial for an offensive Pokemon. However, Mismagius has very a subpar Defense stat, meaning it cannot take repeated hits without being worn down quickly.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Dazzling Gleam
move 4: Nasty Plot / Destiny Bond
ability: Levitate
item: Colbur Berry / Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Taunt is a very useful move that stops defensive and offensive offensive Pokemon from setting up. Shadow Ball is Mismagius's most powerful STAB move, hitting most of the tier for neutral damage. Dazzling Gleam provides great coverage, hitting the Dark-types that resist Shadow Ball and dealing decent amounts of damage to Normal-types. Nasty Plot boosts Mismagius's Special Attack to incredibly high levels, allowing it to punch large holes in the opponent's team. Destiny Bond can be used to take down a slower threat, and works well in tandem with Taunt.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature is to Speed tie with opposing Pokemon with base 105 Speed or lower. Maximum Special Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible. A Colbur Berry allows Mismagius to survive Dark-type moves such as Knock Off, Sucker Punch, and Pursuit once. However, Mismagius is very frail, so it might not be able to survive some STAB Dark-type attacks from the likes of Pawniard and Liepard, even with the Colbur Berry. Alternately, Life Orb can be used for more power.

Usage Tips
========

With Taunt, Mismagius works as an effective anti-lead to prevent entry hazards from being set up. Mismagius should also be used throughout the battle to prevent the opponent from setting up, as well as stopping defensive Pokemon from phazing it out after a Nasty Plot. Shadow Ball is generally Mismagius's best attacking option, as it has very good neutral coverage. Dazzling Gleam should be used if the opponent has a Dark-type you anticipate to switch in, and it hits Normal-types trying to absorb Shadow Ball. If Mismagius is using Nasty Plot, use it when you know Mismagius can take a hit or two from the opponent or on a predicted switch. If Mismagius is using Destiny Bond, use it when you know Mismagius is about to faint to remove a threat, which can potentially open up an opprotunity for Mismagius's teammates to sweep.

Team Options
========

Mismagius functions best on offensively based teams with entry hazard support. Crustle, Accelgor, Rampardos, and Qwilfish make for good partners. Late-game cleaners or setup sweepers that appreciate Mismagius's ability to wear down defensive Pokemon include Kangaskhan, Pawniard, Feraligatr, Slurpuff, and Lilligant.

Stallbreaker
########
name: Stallbreaker
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Will-O-Wisp
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Pain Split
ability: Levitate
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 40 Def / 216 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Taunt is very useful to prevent entry hazards, status, and boosting moves from being used. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and spreads residual damage upon switch in. Shadow Ball is a fairly powerful STAB move, hitting Psychic-types such as Mesprit and Uxie. Pain Split is a decent form of recovery which also depletes the opponents HP.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature and 216 Speed EVs are used to outspeed positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Typhlosion and Ninetales, if Mismagius needs to get a hit off with Shadow Ball in a dire situation. This also allows Mismagius to outspeed the majority of boosting sweepers to Taunt them, stopping them from setting up. Maximum HP is used to take hits relatively well, and the remaining 40 EVs are put into Defense to take physical attacks better, especially from burned opponents. Leftovers is important to have residual recovery throughout the battle.

Usage Tips
========

Mismagius works best early-game with Taunt to prevent entry hazards, status moves, or recovery. Will-O-Wisp should be used against physical attackers mainly, but it is also useful to spread residual damage and wear down defensive Pokemon. Pain Split should be used when Mismagius is low on HP. Use Shadow Ball when the opponent can be OHKOed or 2HKOed, or to hit incoming Fire-types aiming to absorb a Will-O-Wisp. Make sure to keep Mismagius away from status ailments, particularly Toxic and Thunder Wave, as they will put a timer on Mismagius's survivability and cripple it.

Team Options
========

This set functions well on balanced teams with entry hazard setters such as Seismitoad, Steelix, Garbodor, Roselia, and Rhydon to make use of Mismagius's ability to block Rapid Spin. Gurdurr is a good teammate because it sets up Bulk Up boosts on Dark-types, which are problematic for Mismagius. Klinklang can set up on burned physical attackers. Calm Mind Uxie can also set up more easily if Mismagius has burned or worn down the opponent's Dark-types.

Other Options
########

Mismagius can use a Choice Specs set with Trick and Nasty Plot to boost after it has gotten rid of its item. Alternately, a Choice Scarf can be used in the same fashion but act as a more effective revenge killer as opposed to acting as a wallbreaker. Calm Mind is an option to increase Mismagius's Special Defense while setting up, but the immediate power of Nasty Plot is generally more useful. Perish Song can be a nice choice on the stallbreaker set to threaten boosting sweepers such as Calm Mind Uxie and Xatu. Hex can be used over Shadow Ball on the stallbreaker set, as it has much greater power than Shadow Ball against burned opponents. Thunderbolt can be used for a different form of neutral coverage alongside Shadow Ball, but misses out on most Dark-types. Energy Ball can be used to hit Water- and Ground-types such as Seismitoad, Rhydon, Lanturn, Feraligatr, Sandslash, and Kabutops. Hidden Power Fighting is an option, as it does provide almost perfect coverage; however, it forces Mismagius to use an imperfect Speed IV, so Mismagius won't be able to Speed tie with other base 105 Speed Pokemon. However, it does have some merits of being able to OHKO Pawniard, hit Pyroar harder than any of Mismagius's other coverage moves, and 2HKO Audino with a Life Orb and after a Nasty Plot boost.

Checks & Counters
########

Bear in mind that if Mismagius is carrying Destiny Bond, it can remove some of its checks and counters by using the move before fainting to support the team.

**Pyroar**: Pyroar can switch in to all of Mismagius's attacks with the exception of Hidden Power Fighting and deal massive damage in return with Fire Blast.

**Fire-types**: Other Fire-types with a good Special Defense stat can check the stallbreaker set, as they are immune to Will-O-Wisp.

**Dark-types**: Even with a Colbur Berry equipped, Mismagius often cannot handle strong Dark-type attackers such as Pawniard, Liepard, Pangoro, Cacturne, and Sneasel. However, all of these cannot switch in safely,
as they will take a significant amount of damage from Dazzling Gleam.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Choice Scarf users such as Rotom, Jynx, and Mesprit can all revenge kill Mismagius if it is worn down and they get a free switch.

**Strong Physical Attackers**: Strong physical attackers that can take a hit from Mismagius such as Choice Band Torterra, Feraligatr, Kangaskhan, and Hariyama can all OHKO Mismagius with some prior damage. However, these Pokemon won't enjoy taking a Will-O-Wisp.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster threats such as Archeops and Sceptile can outspeed and revenge kill a weakened Mismagius.
