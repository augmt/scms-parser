Overview
########
Lanturn is a great support and offensive Pokemon; it can gain momentum with Volt Switch, which can be beneficial to the team. Its abilities, Volt Absorb and Water Absorb, are useful, as they allow Lanturn to gain back HP when hit by a Electric- or Water-type move, respectively, but Volt Absorb is preferred because Lanturn is already resistant to Water-type attacks. It has a unique Water / Electric typing, which gives it resistances to Steel-, Flying-, Ice-, and Fire-type moves; its typing is only shared this with its pre-evolution, Chinchou and Rotom-W, which is in OU. Although it has access to support moves such as Thunder Wave and Heal Bell, it lacks reliable recovery apart from the subpar Rest.

Supportive Pivot
########
name: Supportive Pivot
move 1: Scald
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Heal Bell
move 4: Toxic / Thunder Wave
ability: Volt Absorb
item: Leftovers
evs: 40 HP / 252 Def / 216 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========
Scald is a reliable STAB move that helps Lanturn's poor Defense by crippling physical attackers with burn, halving their Attack. Having Volt Switch on Lanturn can allow it to gain momentum for your team when used effectively, and the fact that Lanturn has no Speed EVs ensures Lanturn will take hits and allow a frail Pokemon to come in after. Heal Bell is to keep Lanturn's teammates clear of status. Toxic aids Lanturn against problematic Pokemon such as Seismitoad, which has no problem dealing with the moves used on this set due to its typing and Water Absorb ability. Thunder Wave can also be used to spread paralysis on the opposing team.

Set Details
========
A Calm nature allows Lanturn to take hits better and still invest EVs in Defense to take hits from both sides. Leftovers is used, as Lanturn has unreliable recovery, and Rest isn't used all too much. The lack of Speed EVs allow a slow Volt Switch which means that Lanturn takes the damage before using Volt Switch and gives the Pokemon coming in a free switch. Lanturn can also consider running a Bold nature, which lets it avoid getting 2HKOed by Life Orb Magmortar's Earthquake without Stealth Rock on the field.

Usage Tips
========
This set is to be used as a bulky pivot. Lanturn is used to gain momentum for the team with Volt Switch; however, you'll have to be cautious with when to use it, due to the ubiquity of Seismitoad. Lanturn is also used for spreading burns with Scald and keeping the team free of status with Heal Bell. It is quite bulky overall, due to the EVs that are invested in both Defense and Special Defense. Lanturn allows frail Pokemon on the team to come in and set up if needed; they can then potentially sweep or clean up the rest of the battle. This sort of strategy and usage is preferred on balanced or offensive teams.

Team Options
========
Lanturn struggles to damage Grass-types, so support from bulky Grass-types with access to recovery, such as Tangela, Roselia, and Vileplume, is really appreciated. Bulky Torterra works well with Lanturn, due to its Ice-, Fire-, and Flying-type weaknesses being easily covered by Lanturn. Torterra can take physical hits well and has access to Stealth Rock; this can be advantageous, due to the opponent having to keep switching out from Lanturn and the teammate that comes in through Volt Switch. Weezing has access to Levitate and can take Grass-type attacks. Cryogonal is a good specially defensive wall that can also take Grass-type hits and is immune to Earthquake; it can also remove hazards with Rapid Spin.

Scyther has excellent synergy with Lanturn, thanks to its Flying / Bug typing that gives it a 4x resistance to Grass-type attacks. Scyther also has access to Roost and can gain momentum similarly to Lanturn with its STAB U-turn, forcing Pokemon to switch or take a hard hit; this forms an effective VoltTurn core. Hard hitters such as Zangoose really like the slow Volt Switch, which can be used to switch a hard hitter in on a Pokemon that is most likely going to be scared out, therefore giving it a free turn to set up.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Scald / Hydro Pump
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Thunderbolt
ability: Volt Absorb
item: Choice Specs
evs: 196 HP / 252 SpA / 60 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
Scald has 100% accuracy and the chance to burn your foe, whereas Hydro Pump has more power than Scald if you're willing to risk the chance of the attack missing. Volt Switch is used for gaining momentum. Ice Beam is to ensure that Lanturn is not walled by Dragon- and Grass-types, which resist both of Lanturn's STAB moves. Hidden Power Grass is to catch the unsuspecting Seismitoad. Thunderbolt, however, is also another option for a hard-hitting Electric-type STAB move which doesn't force Lanturn to switch out.

Set Details
========
Choice Specs, a Modest nature, and maximum Special Attack investment ensures that Lanturn hits as hard as possible. Volt Absorb is instead of Water Absorb, as Lanturn already resists Water-type attacks. The 60 Speed EVs are to outspeed neutral Seismitoad and be able to check it with Hidden Power Grass; however, you don't want to be switching Lanturn in on it unless you're sure it is going to use Scald.

Usage Tips
========
This set should be used as an offensive pivot. The momentum of Volt Switch is still there and although it may be faster with those 60 Speed EVs invested, loads of Pokemon will still outspeed Lanturn, allowing it to take the hit and let another Pokemon come in unscathed. Lanturn doesn't want to take too many hits though, but you'll soon find it has more durability than other Choice Specs users. This set, similar to the supportive pivot set, can be used on offensive and balanced teams.

Team Options
========
Lanturn pairs with Lilligant and Exeggutor which can absorb Ground- and Grass-type attacks and get a Quiver Dance, Sleep Powder, or a hard hit off against the foe. Flying-types such as Xatu, Vivillon, and Swellow appreciate Lanturn as it absorbs Electric-type attacks, which they are weak to. Due to Lanturn having Volt Switch it can easily be effective on a VoltTurn team. Scyther can form a VoltTurn core with Lanturn with U-turn; you'll be able to keep momentum as the opponent fears the attacks and is forced to switch constantly. Torterra can set up Stealth Rock while the opponent is continually forced to switch; whittling away their health slowly.

Other Options
########
Surf can be used on Lanturn as it hits harder than Scald but doesn't have the chance to miss like Hydro Pump does. RestTalk can be used with a bulky EV spread and Scald + Volt Switch, allowing Lanturn to recover HP. However, this set is completely walled by Seismitoad. Hidden Power Fire is an option as it allows Lanturn to fry Ferroseed that think they can switch in safely. Agility can also be used to raise Lanturn's Speed; however, the fact that slow Volt Switches are really useful and you'll be switching out anyway can really put this to waste.

Checks & Counters
########
**Grass-types**: Special Grass-types, such as Sceptile, Exeggutor, and Roselia, don't mind the burn from Scald and resist both of Lanturn's STAB moves. They'll easily take any attack provided Lanturn isn't running the Choice Specs set. They threaten out Lanturn with their STAB Grass-type moves and easily work around it by setting up Substitutes and entry hazards.

**Ground-types**: The only Ground-type that can counter Lanturn is Seismitoad with its Water Absorb ability, but others can't switch in due to Scald; none enjoy taking a super effective hit and risking the chance of a burn. Ground-types faster than Lanturn, such as Torterra, Golurk, and offensive Rhydon with Earthquake, can check it or force it to switch out.

**Lanturn**: Without Hidden Power Grass or Toxic, Lanturn can be walled by opposing Lanturn.

**Hard hitters**: Choice Band Sawk, Zangoose, Life Orb Kabutops, and Kangaskhan can easily 2HKO or OHKO Lanturn due to their raw power.

**Entry Hazards**: Entry hazards should be kept off the field when Lanturn is trying to Volt Switch and gain momentum, or you'll find that Lanturn won't be able to keep switching in and out, as Leftovers isn't reliable enough to gain back the HP lost from entry hazards.
