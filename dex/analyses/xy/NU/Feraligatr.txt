Overview
########

Feraligatr is an excellent and very consistent sweeper in the NU metagame. It has access to boosting moves in Swords Dance and Dragon Dance, which are backed up by powerful priority in Aqua Jet. Its Water typing and great bulk give it ample opportunities to set up. Feraligatr also has great coverage options in moves such as Ice Punch, Earthquake, and Superpower that allow it to beat different threats for its team. While it doesn't really have any glaring flaws, Feraligatr is troubled by Grass-types such as Vileplume, Tangela, and Ferroseed. Feraligatrâ€™s base 78 Speed stat unfortunately leaves it just short of outspeeding base 80 Pokemon, and it is somewhat reliant on setting up, which can be a problem if it is low on health. Despite these small flaws, Feraligatr is still one of the best choices when considering a sweeper for a team.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Aqua Jet
move 4: Ice Punch / Return
ability: Torrent
item: Lum Berry / Mystic Water
evs: 184 HP / 252 Atk / 72 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Swords Dance is a powerful setup move that gives Feraligatr's already impressive power a boost, allowing it to bypass walls such as Audino. Waterfall is Feraligatr's most reliable STAB move that hits Pokemon such as Rhydon and Piloswine for super effective damage, and it comes with a handy flinch chance that, while not something to rely on, can secure a KO. Aqua Jet is an important move in Feraligatr's arsenal, as it allows Feraligatr to revenge kill weak offensive threats and not fall prey to them itself. Aqua Jet can also be backed up by Torrent and a Swords Dance boost, which would make it stronger than a neutral Return. Ice Punch is an option that offers great coverage and lets Feraligatr hit Grass-types such as Vileplume as hard as possible. Return is another option with moderately high Base Power that gives Feraligatr a more reliable way to hit Water-types such as Seismitoad, Ludicolo, and other Feraligatr; it also grants a neutral hit on the aforementioned Grass- and Dragon-types.

Set Details
========
Because Sheer Force is an unreleased ability for Feraligatr, Torrent is its only option. It powers up STAB Water-type moves when Feraligatr is low on health, allowing Feraligatr to do massive damage even without a Swords Dance boost. Lum Berry allows Feraligatr to avoid crippling status from the likes of Audino and Uxie. On the other hand, Mystic Water makes Feraligatr's Water-type moves more powerful, and it is overall more useful than Life Orb, as Feraligatr can make better use of its bulk without the HP loss. The given EVs allow Feraligatr to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding max Speed base 55 Pokemon such as Cacturne and uninvested base 80 Pokemon such as Mesprit. Alternatively, one can run 112 Speed EVs in order to outspeed max Speed base 60 Pokemon such as Pawniard, however, this comes at the cost of bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Set up Swords Dance whenever an opportunity arises, such as against Pokemon that are 4x weak to Water like Rhydon or Camerupt or against weak walls such as Audino. Feraligatr can set up on most weak super effective hits and neutral attacks, which it can easily use to its advantage in order to activate Torrent's boost. One may also start breaking through bulky foes with powerful Waterfalls and coverage moves and clean up the opposing team's frail sweepers with boosted Aqua Jets. Feraligatr can break through Vileplume if it uses Swords Dance on the switch, then uses Swords Dance once again as it survives Giga Drain, and then uses the appropriate coverage move for the KO. However, Feraligatr cannot accomplish this against the bulkier Tangela unless it is weakened. Remember to not set up when the opponent has fast offensive threats that can heavily damage Feraligatr, such as Jynx or healthy Grass-types such as Lilligant.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support is very important, and as Feraligatr works well on both offensive and balanced teams, any Stealth Rock or Spikes user will work. Suicide leads such as Garbodor, Crustle, Archeops, and Qwilfish work well on offensive teams, while Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Rhydon, and Roselia are fit for more defensively oriented teams. Healing Wish support from Lilligant or Mesprit is hugely beneficial, as it gives Feraligatr another lease on life if it gets massively crippled and allows the player to play it with more risk. Mesprit is a fantastic partner for Feraligatr, as it can easily punch holes in the opponent's team with its versatile movepool and set up Stealth Rock. Physically based Mesprit can use Knock Off to cripple physically defensive walls such as Ferroseed and Seismitoad to make them easier for Feraligatr to break through, and specially based Mesprit can defeat them with Hidden Power Fire and Energy Ball, respectively. Additionally, Grass-types are great teammates for Feraligatr, as they can easily take on the foe's Water-types and hit opposing Grass-types with their coverage moves. Faster ones like Lilligant and Leafeon work well, while Pokemon such as Vileplume and Tangela offer support with their bulk and decent offensive presence. Fire-type Pokemon such as Pyroar, Typhlosion, and Magmortar can get rid of Grass-types such as Vileplume and heavily damage Water-types such as Poliwrath with their coverage options. Finally, Probopass can trap Ferroseed, thanks to Magnet Pull, and 2HKO it with Hidden Power Fire.

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Ice Punch
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Torrent
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Dragon Dance gives Feraligatr a Speed boost at the cost of less attacking power compared to Swords Dance. At +1, however, Feraligatr outspeeds every Pokemon below base 125 Speed, including Rotom. Waterfall is once again used for its reliability, and the flinch chance is even more useful thanks to the increase in Speed. Ice Punch is important coverage for Grass-types, hitting Lilligant and Leafeon before they even have a chance to move, while also threatening Dragon-types. Finally, Earthquake allows Feraligatr to reliably damage opposing Water-types such as Lanturn.

Set Details
========

Torrent is the standard ability and becomes even more useful on this particular set, as it gives more sting to a +1 Feraligatr. Life Orb is the preferred item, as it gives much more power to Feraligatr's coverage moves. The given EVs maximize Feraligatr's Speed and attacking prowess. Adamant is the optimal nature, as it increases Feraligatr's damage output while still retaining its ability to outspeed most of the tier, only missing out on outspeeding Pokemon such as Swellow and Accelgor. However, Jolly can be used at the cost of some power if you need Feraligatr to outspeed the aforementioned two, as well as Choice Scarf users such as Adamant Sawk and Modest or Adamant Mesprit.

Usage Tips
========

Dragon Dance Feraligatr is a very simple and straightforward late-game cleaner. The premise is to only use Dragon Dance when Feraligatr is able to clean up the remnants of the opposing team by setting up on Ground- or Rock-types such as Rhydon, Golem, or Probopass. Alternatively, it can choose to boost in a pinch to break through a physically defensive Pokemon.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support is crucial in order to score more KOs. Leads such as Accelgor and Garbodor can set Spikes easily, and Pokemon such as Mesprit, Seismitoad, and Ferroseed are also good entry hazard setters. Lilligant or Mesprit may provide Healing Wish support, which gives Feraligatr another opportunity should it be crippled. Mesprit works as a great partner for Feraligatr due to its access to Stealth Rock and wide movepool that allows it to cover a variety of threats. Physically based Mesprit can use Knock Off to cripple physically defensive walls such as Ferroseed and Seismitoad to make them easier for Feraligatr to break through, and specially based Mesprit can defeat them with Hidden Power Fire and Energy Ball, respectively. Grass-types such as Lilligant, Tangela, Vileplume, and Leafeon can aid Feraligatr by handling Water-types and heavily damaging other Grass-types with their coverage moves. Alternatively, Pyroar, Typhlosion, and Magmortar are examples of Fire-types that can get rid of Grass-types such as Vileplume and heavily damage Water-types such as Poliwrath with their coverage options. Probopass with Hidden Power Fire can trap Ferroseed with Magnet Pull and remove it from play.

Other Options
########

Substitute gives Feraligatr more room for prediction and provides a shield against opposing status moves, giving it utility against walls for setup opportunities, particularly Ferroseed. However, forgoing coverage generally makes it fare worse against stall and balanced teams, which may have Pokemon that resist or are immune to Feraligatr's moves. Superpower is also an option that handily takes care of Ferroseed, a huge thorn in Feraligatr's side, but it comes at the expense of undesirable stat drops, and it also provides inferior coverage compared to Feraligatr's other moves. Frustration can be used over Return to take advantage of Ditto that run the default maximum happiness. A possible item option is Rindo Berry or Wacan Berry, as they can let Feraligatr set up on some of its Grass- and Electric-type checks and counters, respectively. Finally, 192 Speed EVs is another EV spread option that allows Feraligatr to outspeed Modest Samurott and Ludicolo.

Checks &amp; Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Faster offensive Grass-types such as Lilligant, Leafeon, and Gourgeist-S can check the Swords Dance set, but they must be wary of Dragon Dance variants, as Feraligatr will easily outspeed and damage them heavily with Ice Punch. Ludicolo 4x resists Feraligatr's STAB moves and does well against it. Slower, more defensive Grass-types such as Ferroseed, Tangela, and Gourgeist-XL can also take on Feraligatr easily, as the latter two can take Ice Punch well. Vileplume and Cradily serve as shakier checks, but can otherwise handle other variants lacking Ice Punch.

**Pokemon immune to Water-type attacks**: Poliwrath and Jynx are examples of Pokemon immune to Water-type attacks that can check Feraligatr easily, as they cannot be hit by priority Aqua Jet; the former can phaze out Feraligatr's boosts with Circle Throw, and the latter can put non-Lum Berry variants to sleep with Lovely Kiss or 2HKO with Psychic. Seismitoad can also reliably check Feraligatr and damage it with a Ground-type STAB move.

**Powerful attackers**: Powerful attackers can pressure Feraligatr very easily, especially special attackers, which can take advantage of its weaker Special Defense stat. In particular, Electric-types such as Rotom and its formes can use STAB moves to cripple or outright eliminate Feraligatr.

**Status moves**: Status of any kind can severely hamper Feraligatr, and while Lum Berry somewhat fixes this problem, it only works once.

**Revenge killers**: Revenge killers can get rid of Feraligatr if they have a healthy combination of decent bulk and Speed. Mesprit has a boatload of options, such as Energy Ball, to swiftly remove it, while Kangaskhan can use priority moves to remove a weakened Feraligatr.
