Overview
########

Liepard's access to a wide variety of moves boosted in priority by Prankster, such as Encore, Thunder Wave, Rain Dance, and Sunny Day gives it numerous options to support its team. Offensively, it can provide further support with a fast Knock Off and U-turn or even pull off surprise sweeps with a Nasty Plot set, increasing its utility and versatility. Unfortunately for Liepard, its terrible frailty often forces a lot of mind games when trying to switch in and use its utility moves. It also suffers from having only average power, leaving it unable to break through most bulky Pokemon by itself, and a bit of four-moveslot syndrome, never having quite enough moveslots to fit all the moves it wants.

Offensive Pivot
########
name: Offensive Pivot
move 1: Knock Off
move 2: Encore
move 3: Sucker Punch / Thunder Wave
move 4: U-turn
ability: Prankster
item: BlackGlasses
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
Knock Off serves as Liepard's best STAB attack, boasting solid power and great utility in removing the foe's item. Prankster Encore is an incredible asset to Liepard, allowing it to disrupt momentum and punish opposing setup. Sucker Punch is a powerful priority move that allows Liepard to pick off weakened threats. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can be used as a single-use safety net against faster foes, sacrificing Liepard to provide a near-guaranteed stop to any one sweeper, but it is hard to find room for it. Finally, U-turn is used as a way to grab momentum and escape walls that Liepard can't break through, sharing particularly good synergy with Encore. Pursuit is an option to trap troublesome Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Mesprit and Rotom, but like Thunder Wave, Liepard often does not have room for it.

Set Details
========
Black Glasses is the item of choice, boosting the power of Liepard's Dark-type moves while not having Life Orb's nasty recoil. A Jolly nature makes the best use of Liepard's excellent Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed everything up to base 105s and hit them with Knock Off or U-turn. An Adamant nature is a possibility, allowing Liepard to still outspeed everything up to base 91s such as Rotom and Chatot, while still being able to hit many Pokemon that fall between those Speed tiers with Sucker Punch. However, this is mostly undesirable due to the unreliable nature of Sucker Punch.

Usage Tips
========
Liepard is best played as an offensive support Pokemon, working to secure a win from its teammates. The combination of Knock Off and U-turn serves as a great way to cripple and weaken bulky Pokemon, making it easier to wear away at them throughout the match. Encore is used to lock Pokemon into setup or recovery moves, allowing Liepard to bring a teammate in safely with U-turn or use Knock Off. Prankster Encore is also quite useful in dire situations against dangerous setup sweepers, threatening to lock them into a move and stop their sweep; however, be cautious of Liepard's frailty, as a misprediction will often lead to its demise. Sucker Punch picks off faster threats, while Thunder Wave is best used as a last resort against a single sweeper: Liepard can come in, sacrifice itself to paralyze the foe, and allow a teammate to revenge kill it.

Team Options
========
Some of Liepard's best teammates include those that can complete a Psychic / Dark / Fighting core, with Pokemon such as Mesprit and Gurdurr helping cover each other's weaknesses and threaten their checks. Poison-types such as Garbodor and Vileplume also make for ideal partners, sharing good synergy with Liepard while providing good defensive pivots to fall back on due to Liepard's frailty. Physical attackers and setup sweepers also love the support Liepard brings in Knock Off and Encore; Belly Drum Slurpuff in particular is an excellent partner, capitalizing on Liepard's ability to weaken walls and open up setup opportunities while in return setting up on the Fighting-types that can beat Liepard.

Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Copycat
move 4: Encore / Substitute
ability: Prankster
item: Leftovers
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Access to Nasty Plot alongside Prankster Copycat allows Liepard to serve as an exceptional sweeper. Despite its frailty, Liepard can still find a sufficient amount of setup opportunities thanks to its good offensive typing, scaring out common Psychic- and Ghost-types and using these turns to get Nasty Plot boosts. Dark Pulse is Liepard's most reliable special STAB move, packing decent all-around coverage and usable power. Prankster Copycat finds a unique niche on this set in its ability to copy Dark Pulse after a KO, effectively giving Liepard an 80 Base Power priority move to bypass faster Pokemon. The choice of moves in the last slot generally comes down to preference. Encore can free up extra turns to set up a Nasty Plot and gives Liepard more use throughout the game, while Substitute eases prediction and acts as a safety cushion against Pokemon that can survive Dark Pulse. Running both Substitute and Encore and replacing Copycat is also an option but leaves Liepard significantly more vulnerable to faster Pokemon, as Liepard's Substitutes aren't difficult to break.

Set Details
========
Leftovers gives Liepard passive recovery, allowing it to make more Substitutes while cushioning blows such as Kangaskhan's Fake Out and granting some recovery against passive damage. Black Glasses is usable when running Encore, but even Encore variants often prefer Leftovers to maximize the number of times Liepard can switch into entry hazards. Timid is the preferred nature, allowing Liepard to outspeed and reliably hit as many Pokemon as possible with Dark Pulse without having to rely on Copycat. However, a Modest nature is an option if threats falling between base 95 and 105 Speed aren't an issue.

Usage Tips
========
Liepard generally shouldn't attempt to sweep until late-game, when bulky Pokemon that resist Dark are removed, as it can't do much to threaten them. Until then, Liepard's teammates should try and weaken these Pokemon throughout the match to the point where Liepard can overwhelm them and sweep. If Substitute is used, it should generally be used before trying to set up with Nasty Plot, as Liepard's frailty doesn't leave much room for mispredictions. Because Copycat copies the last move used, if Dark Pulse fails to KO a slower Pokemon, you will want to use Dark Pulse again rather than Copycat. Lastly, in addition to Encore's utility for grabbing free setup turns, it can be used to stop dangerous setup sweepers in a similar fashion to Liepard's other sets, but this should be done only if necessary, as it's best to avoid risky plays when trying to sweep with Liepard.

Team Options
========
Liepard makes an excellent fit on Psychic / Dark / Fighting cores, with Pokemon such as Mesprit and Hariyama sharing a great blend of offensive and defensive synergy with Liepard. Garbodor is another prime candidate to pair with Liepard, covering all of its weaknesses while providing useful support in the form of Spikes, which serves as a great way to whittle away at Liepard's checks because most of them lack reliable recovery. Qwilfish and Roselia also work well for similar reasons. Mismagius is another useful partner, as it is able to spinblock and wear down defensive cores with Taunt, Nasty Plot, and Destiny Bond while sharing good type synergy with Liepard. Liepard appreciates support from powerful wallbreakers such as Sawk and Typhlosion that are able to punch holes into teams so that Liepard can clean up.

Weather Support
########
name: Weather Support
move 1: Rain Dance / Sunny Day
move 2: Encore
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: U-turn
ability: Prankster
item: Damp Rock / Heat Rock
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
Prankster allows Liepard to serve as an exceptional weather setter, almost ensuring it can set up weather at least once per match. Prankster Encore helps Liepard set up weather multiple times throughout the match by opening up free turns against defensive Pokemon. Knock Off is a decently strong STAB move and provides further support in removing the items of Pokemon such as Hariyama and Audino that act as good checks to weather teams. Finally, U-turn allows Liepard to gain momentum and bring in a weather sweeper, maintaining the fast pace of weather teams. Thunder Wave is a useful utility move to spread paralysis, but Liepard is generally too strapped for moveslots to fit it in.

Set Details
========
Damp Rock and Heat Rock correspond with their respective weathers, providing weather sweepers with maximum turns to deal damage. Maximum Speed investment combined with Prankster almost guarantees at least one round of weather, letting Liepard outprioritize even opposing priority such as Zangoose's Quick Attack. An alternative spread with 0 Speed EVs and IVs and a Speed-hindering nature can be used to get the slowest U-turn possible, allowing a greater chance for sweepers to come in unscathed, but Volbeat and Uxie accomplish this better due to their lower Speed and greater bulk, respectively. Maximum HP investment allows Liepard to survive weaker hits, giving it a slightly easier time setting up weather. Maximum Attack investment can give some extra power to Knock Off and U-turn, but it's mostly unnecessary.

Usage Tips
========
As with the nature of weather teams, Liepard's playstyle is very fast-paced and dependent on momentum. It should attempt to set up weather as soon as possible, then U-turn out quickly in order to preserve as many weather turns as it can. Encore also aids this, freeing up turns to set up or use U-turn while not forcing Liepard's teammates to take a hit on the switch. Knock Off should be used sparingly, as it often wastes turns and disrupts momentum for Liepard's team, but it can be useful for finishing off weakened opponents. Late-game, Liepard can serve as a sacrificial pivot to get up one last round of weather before fainting and bringing in a teammate.

Team Options
========
Weather sweepers are obvious assets to this variant of Liepard, with Swift Swim Pokemon such as Ludicolo, Seismitoad, and Kabutops fitting well on rain teams and Chlorophyll Pokemon such as Victreebel, Exeggutor, and Sawsbuck working on sun teams. Fast Water- and Fire-types such as Swanna or Typhlosion also benefit greatly from rain and sun, respectively, which significantly amplify the power of their STAB moves. Alternative weather setters, such as Uxie, are also useful for weather teams to have, as Liepard often does not stick around very long and the extra insurance is appreciated.

Other Options
########
Liepard has access to several unique coverage options that can be used to lure in and eliminate common checks, such as Play Rough for Fighting-types, Gunk Shot for Fairy-types, and Seed Bomb for Seismitoad and Rhydon. Trick with a Choice item can be used to cripple walls, but there's rarely any room for it and Liepard has other ways of weakening defensive cores. Taunt can prevent foes from setting up, but Encore already discourages this while providing more all-around utility. Hone Claws boosts Liepard's Attack, but it lacks efficiency due to only giving a +1 boost.

Checks and Counters
########
**Fighting-types**: Gurdurr and Hariyama are adept answers to Liepard, resisting all its common moves and OHKOing in return with their STAB moves, the former even threatening it with Mach Punch if it tries to U-turn out. Gurdurr, however, dislikes losing its Eviolite, and must be wary of being locked into Bulk Up against more aggressive players.

**Defensive Fairy-types**: Granbull hard counters nearly all Liepard variants, resisting its STAB moves and U-turn and threatening it with Play Rough. Togetic is also a solid check, though it hates Knock Off.

**Pawniard**: Pawniard resists Dark, is neutral to U-turn, and can fight back with STAB Iron Head, but should be cautious about being Encored into Swords Dance or Sucker Punch or losing its Eviolite.

**Residual Damage and Status**: Entry hazards and damage from poison or burn can wear down Liepard throughout the course of a match due to its tendency to switch a lot. Pokemon with Rocky Helmet or the ability Iron Barbs, such as Garbodor and Ferroseed, also receive mentions for their ability to punish the use of Knock Off and U-turn.
