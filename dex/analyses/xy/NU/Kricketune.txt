Overview
#######

Kricketune has been given another chance at success with a new move: Sticky Web. It's the best setter of Sticky Web in the tier, due to access to Taunt and Endeavor unlike its faster competition, Leavanny, giving it far more utility throughout the game. A decent base 85 Attack stat also allows it to have decent offensive presence. Outside of that, though, Kricketune remains fairly one-dimensional due to its mono-Bug typing, frailness, and mediocre stats all around, making its use very limited, yet effective.

move 4: Knock Off
ability: Technician / Swarm
item: Focus Sash
evs: 4 Def / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Sticky Web is the most important move on the set, reducing the Speed of all grounded Pokemon by one stage, giving new lease to slower sweepers and nullifying the effectiveness of many revenge killers. Taunt prevents opponents from setting up on Kricketune, or removing entry hazards with Defog. Endeavor serves to severely cripple foes once Kricketune has activated its Focus Sash, and is a massive deterrent to walls. Knock Off is a utility move that removes the foe's item, hits Ghost-types, and finishes off weakened foes, particularly scoring a hit on Xatu switching in to bounce back Sticky Web. Alternatively, Bug Bite and X-Scissor are both STAB options, with the added bonus of hitting Dark-types, if the item removal effect of Knock Off isn't needed.

Set Details
========

The ability is up to personal preference, and is only relevant if one runs a STAB move on Kricketune. Technician is used with Bug Bite to boost its low Base Power, while Swarm is paired with X-Scissor to deal strong damage when Kricketune is low on HP. Focus Sash is the optimal item, as Kricketune will usually lead against other teams, and it allows it to survive one hit and be able to set up Sticky Web easily. The EVs on the set are simple, maximizing Speed in order to set up Sticky Web and utilize Taunt first, with the rest being poured in Attack to make Kricketune's attacks sting a bit more. HP investment is not needed as the lower the HP, the more effective Endeavor is against other threats. It's important to use a Jolly nature, as it allows Kricketune to outspeed Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Slurpuff, Barbaracle, Qwilfish, and Cacturne. These are important Pokemon to beat, as Taunt can prevent them from setting up, and ensures that Sticky Web can be set up.

Usage Tips
========

Keep in mind what Kricketune's goal is setting up Sticky Web for its teammates. As such, it is wise to usually lead with it. Be wary of other leads such as Archeops and Qwilfish which can prevent Kricketune from doing its job easily by virtue of a faster Taunt. Kricketune can also be preserved later on in the game in order to abuse its utility moves, Endeavor and Knock Off. Take advantage of Sticky Web by utilizing Pokemon that benefit from it, particularly strong wallbreakers and slow sweepers.

Team Options
========

It's wise to use wallbreakers such as Zangoose, Rhydon, and Samurott, as they benefit immensely from Sticky Web support and can easily dismantle opposing teams with faster Pokemon. Rotom and Mismagius are examples of Ghost-types that can prevent Rapid Spin and beat the only Magic Bouncer in the tier, Xatu. Another particularly effective teammate is Pawniard, as it can sweep with its powerful STAB moves, backed up by a boosting move in Swords Dance. Additionally, it helps combat Defog from foes by hitting hard with Defiant-boosted attacks.

Other Options
########

Kricketune really should not be running anything else apart from what has already been mentioned above, but it has some really niche options at its disposal. While Kricketune's pretty weak, Swords Dance gives its attacks more sting, and Kricketune may even be able to abuse it under its own Sticky Web. For coverage, it has options such as Aerial Ace and Brick Break. It can also support teammates by virtue of moves such as Heal Bell, which removes crippling status for teammates, and Perish Song, which forces switches and deters set up.

Checks &amp; Counters
########

**Multi-hit attacks**: Moves such as Rock Blast, Gear Grind, and Icicle Spear can break through Focus Sash and KO Kricketune.

**Faster Taunt users**: As previously mentioned, Archeops, Qwilfish, and Liepard can prevent Sticky Web from being set up and render Kricketune useless.

**Pawniard**: Opposing Pawniard can take advantage of Kricketune's Sticky Web and abuse Defiant-boosted attacks every time it switches in.

**Rapid Spin and Defog users**: In the event that Kricketune has set up Sticky Web, Rapid Spin and Defog users such as Kabutops and Articuno can remove the entry hazard easily.
