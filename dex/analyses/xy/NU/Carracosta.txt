Overview
########
Carracosta's resilient Defense and deadly Attack are strong reasons as to why it's one of the deadliest Shell Smash sweepers in NU. On top of this, Carracosta has three incredible abilities in Solid Rock, Sturdy, and Swift Swim, allowing Carracosta to tank strong hits, survive fatal blows, or double its Speed under rain. Carracosta is best known for its access to Shell Smash and Stealth Rock, allowing it to be a deadly sweeper or an entry hazard setter. Carracosta edges out other Shell Smash users such as Barbaracle due to its access to Aqua Jet and slightly better physical bulk. In addition to this, Solid Rock is another reason why Carracosta is preferred over Barbaracle. However, Carracosta's low Speed leaves it prone to status and getting Taunted, preventing the use of crucial moves such as Shell Smash and Stealth Rock. Carracosta cannot hide its glaringly low Special Defense either, as it is weak against special attackers such as Mesprit, Mismagius, and Samurott.

Shell Smash
########
name: Shell Smash
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Aqua Jet
ability: Solid Rock
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
Shell Smash is Carracosta's ace in the hole, allowing its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed to spike up two stages, making it extremely dangerous and allowing it to become a strong offensive sweeper. Waterfall is a very reliable STAB move that's great for dealing huge damage and has a 20% chance to flinch opponents as well. Waterfall can be great for dealing with Rhydon, Hariyama, and Sandslash. Stone Edge is very strong against opponents that resist Water-type moves, and is useful against Lilligant and Vileplume. Aqua Jet is used to pick off weakened targets without risking any unnecessary damage.

Set Details
========
Maximized Attack and Speed investment is used to allow Carracosta to sweep opponents with relative ease. Equipped with a Life Orb, Carracosta can yield maximum damage output at the cost of lowering its HP. However, Carracosta can also utilize a Lum Berry if any pesky status effects such as paralysis or burn are inflicted while it's setting up. In addition to that, Carracosta can also capitalize on its strong defenses by using Weakness Policy; tanking a hit and allowing it to become a scary offensive presence. An Adamant nature with a Life Orb and Shell Smash gives Carracosta a chance to potentially OHKO Weezing after Stealth Rock. Alternatively, a Jolly nature may be used to spike Carracosta's Speed, allowing it to outspeed priority users such as Liepard after a Shell Smash and nail it with its own priority Aqua Jet. Lastly, Sturdy may also be used in conjunction with Weakness Policy instead of Solid Rock to prevent Carracosta from fainting and allow it to survive any hit while setting up.

Usage Tips
========
Send out Carracosta mid- to late-game; it functions well as a mid- and late-game sweeper when threats such as special Grass-types are gone, entry hazards are taken care of, and when there aren't any prominent Fighting-types around. Set up Shell Smash on the turn it's sent out, but be very wary of Thunder Wave users and avoid setting up on them. Switch immediately if they are Thunder Wave users as they'll more often than not paralyze Carracosta, making it a sitting duck against opponents. Spamming Waterfall and Stone Edge works, but Waterfall is more reliable as it has more accuracy. Use Stone Edge only when it's needed, as relying on Stone Edge is very risky, considering its imperfect accuracy. Hit weakened foes with Aqua Jet; it'll save Carracosta HP and get rid of targets without taking unnecessary damage.

Team Options
========
Teammates such as Garbodor are great for Carracosta. Unlike Ferroseed, Garbodor isn't complete setup bait and can utilize Spikes / Toxic Spikes, while also covering Grass-types fairly well. Electivire can be great as well, boosting its Speed from any Volt Switch users or Thunder Wave users. Offensive sweepers, such as Swords Dance Feraligatr and Lilligant, are great partners as Carracosta benefits from their typings. Magmortar is also a great partner for dealing with Grass-types. Carracosta can shield it from strong Water-types while it removes special Grass-types. Choice Band Torterra is a great teammate as it not resists Ground-type moves, but also hits like a truck. Mesprit also works as a great partner because of its bulkiness. Carracosta can switch to Mesprit in case a Water- or Grass-type come into play, and it can proceed to neutralize both with Energy Ball and Hidden Power Fire respectively.

Stealth Rock
########
name: Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Scald
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Toxic / Knock Off
ability: Solid Rock
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Relaxed

Moves
========
Stealth Rock is a powerful entry hazard that causes residual damage and breaks Focus Sash. Scald is not only great for coverage against Rock- and Fire-types, but is also great for punishing opponents with a burn, lowering their HP and their Attack. Rock Slide is Carracosta's most reliable offensive move that can do the most damage against opponents. Alternatively, Stone Edge can be used instead of Rock Slide for even more damage, but it is less accurate. Toxic can be used to break down strong walls; because of Carracosta's strong Defense, it can tank a few attacks while an opponent gets whittled down by poison damage. Coupled with Stealth Rock, Toxic can cause opponents to switch repeatedly, causing them to get damaged by entry hazards and status. Alternatively, Knock Off may also be used as a means for Carracosta to get rid of useful items that the opponent has, such as Eviolite, Assault Vest, Choice items, and Life Orb. Finally, Aqua Jet can be used instead of Toxic or Knock Off to pick off weakened threats and to avoid unnecessary damage.

Set Details
========
Carracosta will need maximum HP and Defense investment to tank attacks from opponents while it sets up Stealth Rock. Leftovers are necessary for recovery, allowing Carracosta to regain HP every turn. A Relaxed nature works perfectly to strengthen Carracosta's Defense as well. Instead of Leftovers, Rocky Helmet can also be used to punish physical attackers, Flying-types, Pokemon with U-turn, and Knock Off users.

Usage Tips
========
Carracosta's role is that of an entry hazard setter; it's designed to set up hazards and tank hits for teammates as well. Set up Stealth Rock immediately, as getting Stealth Rock up immediately is crucial because it will help pressure the opponent and cause them to think about their decisions on what to switch in and out. Spam Scald as much as possible, as fishing for burns is great for residual damage and crippling physical attackers. Throw Toxic out on walls, threats, or predicted switch-ins; this will apply yet another layer of pressure as the opponent will have to deal with Stealth Rock and be concerned with the fact that their switch-in might get poisoned. Use Stone Edge when Carracosta needs to damage a foe significantly.

Team Options
========
Offensive teammates such as Feraligatr and Magmortar work wonders for Carracosta, as they'll enjoy switching into it when a strong threat is out. Feraligatr and Magmortar can sweep easier with entry hazards and weakened foes thanks to Carracosta. Spinblockers such as Mismagius and Golurk are useful to prevent the loss of hazards. Garbodor is also useful as it can utilize hazards as well and can deal with Grass-types easily.

Other Options
########
Although Carracosta is a physical sweeper, it can also become a special sweeper by utilizing Shell Smash, Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power Grass. Shell Smash allows it to gain the necessary +2 Special Attack and Speed boost that it desires. Hydro Pump is Carracosta's best Water-type STAB moves, as with 110 Base Power, it's extremely powerful. Ice Beam is useful to damage Grass-types such as Lilligant and Vileplume significantly. Hidden Power Grass is reliable against other Water-types such as Floatzel and Lanturn that resist Hydro Pump and Ice Beam. Solid Rock is necessary to reduce damage for Carracosta. A Life Orb allows Carracosta to significantly damage opponents. Alternatively, a Lum Berry can be used on this set in case of any dangerous status effects. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed with either a Timid nature (for extra Speed) or a Modest nature (for extra special damage output) can also work. Carracosta can also use Earthquake as well, for great damage and reliable accuracy. Carracosta can also utilize Swift Swim on rain teams to double its Speed on top of a Shell Smash, making it 4x faster than its original Speed. Lastly, Carracosta can make great use of a White Herb when setting up with Shell Smash, canceling out all negative stat drops while retaining the boosts.

Checks & Counters
########
**Electric-types**: Pokemon such as Rotom are soft checks to Carracosta, dealing dangerous amounts of damage with Volt Switch and Thunderbolt. Electivire is also a soft check as well because of its damage output. Lastly, Raichu is also a soft check as it can force Carracosta out or deal significant damage towards it. Lanturn is a great check due to Water Absorb, limiting Carracosta's moves.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Lilligant are soft checks against Carracosta as they can force Carracosta out. Lilligant is a good check as it outspeeds +2 Carracosta and takes an Aqua Jet relatively easily. Ludicolo is a great soft check due to its resistance to Water moves and access to Giga Drain and Leech Seed. Ferroseed is a great counter to Carracosta; not only does Ferroseed resist all of Carracosta's moves, it also punishes it with Iron Barbs and Gyro Ball, making Carracosta's +2 Speed a disadvantage.

**Fighting-types**: Gurdurr is a good check because of its strong defenses. Gurdurr can regain its HP with Drain Punch, making Carracosta its personal punching bag. Sturdy Sawk can live any hit from Carracosta provided there are no entry hazards on Sawk's side of the field and OHKO in return.

**Water-types**: Seismitoad is a strong counter to Carracosta because it is immune to Water-type attacks due to Water Absorb, and on top of that, it naturally resists Rock-type moves, making it more than capable of taking out Carracosta. Poliwrath, for the same reasons mentioned, can also take out Carracosta with ease.

**Status**: Burn leaves Carracosta useless as an offensive attacker, while paralysis makes it a sitting duck prone to special Grass-types.

**Special Attackers**: Jynx is a good soft check due to Dry Skin; however, it can be outsped if it is not careful and take a Stone Edge. When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Jynx can outspeed Carracosta and take it out with Focus Blast or Psychic. Samurott is a good check as it is able to utilize Grass Knot against Carracosta and take it out while it resists Waterfall and Aqua Jet. Mesprit is a good check because of its natural bulk: an Energy Ball from Mesprit can OHKO Carracosta; with a Choice Scarf, Mesprit is extremely deadly as it easily outspeeds Carracosta. Carracosta doesn't like to switch in on special attackers as it has a hard time against them.
