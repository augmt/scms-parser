Overview
########

Torterra's great STAB combination backed by a strong base 109 Attack stat allows it to hit most Pokemon in the tier for at least neutral damage. Torterra's typing is also good defensively, resisting the EdgeQuake combination and having an immunity to Electric. Torterra is very versatile, as it can effectively run a Choice Band set to wallbreak, a tank set to reliably set up Stealth Rock, and even a late-game Rock Polish sweeper. As a Stealth Rock user, Torterra has a great match-up against most opposing entry hazard setters, notably Rhydon, Seismitoad, Garbodor, and Crustle. Unfortunately, Torterra is weak to common Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-type moves, notable users of which include Magmortar, Archeops, and Cryogonal, respectively.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Wood Hammer
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Crunch / Bullet Seed
ability: Overgrow
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Wood Hammer is Torterra's most powerful Grass-type STAB move, and while its recoil can be crippling, its damage output is significantly greater than Seed Bomb's. Earthquake is Torterra's Ground-type STAB move, hitting Poison- and Fire-types that resist Wood Hammer, such as Garbodor and Typhlosion. Stone Edge hits Flying-types that resist Grass, such as Xatu and Rotom-S. Crunch hits Gourgeist and Exeggutor harder than any of Torterra's other attacks. Alternatively, Bullet Seed can be used to break through Sturdy users, such as Golem.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature are used to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment lets Torterra outspeed as many threats as possible, and a Jolly nature can also be used to outspeed Adamant Pawniard and Feraligatr. Overgrow is more useful than Shell Armor, as gaining a significant boost to Torterra's Grass-type moves in a pinch can be very helpful. Choice Band amplifies Torterra's Attack stat to incredible levels, greatly increasing its damage output.

Usage Tips
========

This set is best used as a wallbreaker, so one can use Torterra's defensive typing to switch it into resisted attacks. Earthquake is generally a safe attack to use if the opponent doesn't have a Flying-type or a Levitate user. Wood Hammer should be used more sparingly, as there are a significant number of Pokemon that resist Grass in the tier. Stone Edge should be used on a predicted Flying-type switch in, such as Xatu or Scyther. Crunch is best used to hit Gourgeist or Exeggutor on the switch, as they don't fear any of Torterra's other moves. Bullet Seed, while not often needed, should be used only as an anti-lead function against Sturdy users, such as Golem.

Team Options
========

Setup sweepers such as Feraligatr and Slurpuff are good partners to take advantage of this set's wallbreaking ability. A bulky Steel-type is helpful to cover Torterra's weakness to Ice- and Flying-type attacks. Volt Switch and U-turn users, such as Lanturn and Liepard, are useful to bring Torterra in safely. Entry hazard support from the likes of Garbodor and Crustle are very useful in helping to wear down Torterra's switch-ins. Creating a Fire / Water / Grass core with Torterra is very beneficial, as the other Pokemon cover Torterra's weakness to Fire- and Ice-type attacks. Lanturn is a good example, and other options include Kabutops, Pyroar, and Typhlosion. Assault Vest Hariyama is a great teammate that can also handle Fire- and Ice-types, but it unfortunately adds another a Flying-type weakness. Healing Wish support from the likes of Mesprit can give Torterra a second opportunity to punch holes in the opponent's team.

Tank
#########
name: Tank
move 1: Wood Hammer
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stealth Rock
move 4: Synthesis
ability: Overgrow
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Wood Hammer hits like a truck against anything that does not resist it and threatens most opposing entry hazard setters including Rhydon and Seismitoad. Earthquake hits Poison- and Fire-types that resist Wood Hammer, such as Qwilfish and Typhlosion. Stealth Rock is important on every team to wear down opposing Pokemon when they switch in, and Torterra finds many opportunities to set it up thanks to its good bulk and STAB move combination. Synthesis provides a reliable form of recovery, mitigating Wood Hammer recoil and any other damage Torterra might have taken.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP investment capitalizes on Torterra's respectable bulk and type resistances. Maximum Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible. Alternatoveely, a physically defensive spread with an Impish nature can be used, but the lack of offensive presence is problematic.

Usage Tips
========

Thanks to Torterra's great STAB combination, it forces a decent amount of switches against opposing entry hazard users, allowing it to set up Stealth Rock. Synthesis should be used when Torterra is below 50% HP to recover HP when needed. However, it is sometimes possible to utilize Synthesis to gauge the damage of a foe's attack. If the foe fails to 2HKO Torterra, Torterra might be able to beat the foe one-on-one. Wood Hammer and Earthquake should be used to hit their appropriate targets. An opposing Pokemon immune to Ground-type attacks paired with a bulky Pokemon that resists Grass can force Torterra into unfavorable situations.

Team Options
========

Ghost-types, such as Mismagius and Rotom, can block Rapid Spin and keep Stealth Rock on the opponents side of the field. Defiant users, such as Pawniard and Primeape, are also good choices to deter foes from using Defog. Bulky Water- and Steel-types are helpful to cover Torterra's weaknesses to Ice, Fire, and Flying. Klinklang is a notable Steel-type that appreciates Stealth Rock to help it potentially sweep. Garbodor is a good partner to set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes alongside Torterra's Stealth Rock and, in return, Torterra can handle most Ground-types that threaten Garbodor.

Rock Polish
########
name: Rock Polish
move 1: Rock Polish
move 2: Wood Hammer
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Stone Edge
ability: Overgrow
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Rock Polish increases Torterra's subpar Speed to exceptional levels, allowing it to outspeed most of the unboosted tier. Backed by a Life Orb, Wood Hammer and Earthquake hit extremely hard while providing great coverage. Stone Edge is a great coverage move to hit Flying-types, such as Scyther, Rotom-S, and Xatu.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment are used to outspeed positive-natured Choice Scarf Sawk, Mesprit, and Rotom after a Rock Polish. However, an Adamant nature can be used for a boost in power. Life Orb greatly increases Torterra's damage output. Overgrow is more useful than Shell Armor, as it can be very helpful to get a boost to Wood Hammer in a pinch.

Usage Tips
========

Torterra should set up Rock Polish on Pokemon that it forces out, such as Seismitoad and Probopass. Don't try to sweep until Torterra's checks and counters have been weakened, as it will not be able to break through them. However, it might be wise to use Rock Polish early- to mid-game to put offensive pressure on the opponent, possibly clearing the way for another teammate to sweep or clean.

Team Options
========

Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Sawk or Choice Specs Typhlosion are a great help to this set, as they can ease Torterra's late-game sweep by wearing down bulky Grass-types. Entry hazard support from the likes of Crustle and Accelgor are important to wear down Torterra's checks and counters. Volt Switch or U-turn users, such as Lanturn and Liepard, are useful to bring Torterra in safely. Assault Vest Hariyama is a great teammate, as it can also handle Fire- and Ice-types; however, it adds another Flying-type weakness. Healing Wish support from the likes of Mesprit can give Torterra a second opportunity to sweep.

Other Options
########

Seed Bomb can be used over Wood Hammer for a less powerful Grass-type move without recoil. Swords Dance is an option to pressure more defensive teams, while Roar can be used with a defensive set to phaze out setup sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage. Toxic cripples the bulky Grass-types that Torterra struggles with. A Double Dance set with Swords Dance and Rock Polish can be used, but the lack of a coverage move is not optimal.

Checks & Counters
#########

**Grass-types**: Defensive Grass-types, such as Tangela and Gourgeist, can stomach hits from Torterra fairly well, and the latter only has to fear Crunch from the Choice Band set. Also, more offensive Grass-types, such as Lilligant and Sceptile, can check Torterra, as they resist both of its STAB moves and often carry Hidden Power Ice.

**Ice-types**: Ice-types, such as Cryogonal, Sneasel, and Piloswine, threaten to KO Torterra with their STAB moves but cannot switch in easily.

**Fire-types**: Many Fire-types, such as Typhlosion, Magmortar, and Pyroar, resist Wood Hammer and can easily KO Torterra with their respective STAB moves but cannot switch into Earthquake.

**Flying-types**: Flying-types, such as Scyther, Rotom-S, Xatu, and Vivillon, are immune to Earthquake and most resist Wood Hammer. However, they must watch out for Stone Edge on the switch.

**Weezing**: Unlike other Poison-types, Weezing not only resists Wood Hammer but is also immune to Earthquake thanks to Levitate and can cripple Torterra with Will-O-Wisp.

**Status**: Will-O-Wisp halves Torterra's Attack, rendering it useless, whearas poison puts a timer on Torterra's longevity.
