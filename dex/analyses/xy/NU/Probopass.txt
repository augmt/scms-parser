Overview
########

Probopass is a reliable Stealth Rock setter. Volt Switch allows Probopass to function as a good pivot, coming in, taking hits, and then Volt Switching out. Probopass also has useful abilities: Sturdy allows it to survive super effective hits from full health, while Magnet Pull allows it to trap and KO other Steel-types. Probopass has good typing matchups against Fairy- and Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mesprit that lack Hidden Power Fighting; however, Probopass is weak to many common types, including Fighting, Ground, and Water. Probopass also has a low Speed stat, meaning it is outpaced by many common offensive threats. Probopass is also pretty weak offensively, so it must rely on support moves such as Toxic to wear opponents down and Volt Switch to pivot out into better matchups.

Offensive Pivot
########
name: Offensive Pivot
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Thunder Wave
move 3: Power Gem / Flash Cannon
move 4: Earth Power
ability: Magnet Pull
item: Leftovers
evs: 172 HP / 252 SpA / 84 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Volt Switch is used to gain offensive momentum and allows Probopass to act as a pivot. Thunder Wave is used to check faster offensive threats and makes them easier to revenge kill. Power Gem is a strong, reliable STAB move that hits Fire- and Flying-types for super effective damage. Flash Cannon is also a strong STAB move that is used to deal super effective damage to Fairy-types such as Granbull. Earth Power is for hitting the majority of Steel-types super effectively.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack investment gives Probopass maximum power. Investing 84 EVs into Speed allows Probopass to outspeed Pokemon that have base 50 Speed, such as Hariyama and Regirock, and the rest of the EVs are put into HP for bulk. A Modest nature is used for more Special Attack, while Leftovers is used for passive recovery and to allow Probopass to bluff a support set. Magnet Pull is used to trap other Steel-types, although this is not the focus of the set.

Usage Tips
========

Probopass should be brought in as a pivot on an attacking Pokemon that has STAB types it resists or is neutral to, like a Fire- or Poison-type, and then use Volt Switch into a better matchup. Use Thunder Wave on faster offensive threats so that other teammates can outpace and easily revenge kill them. Be wary around strong attackers and of switching in repeatedly, as Probopass has no recovery outside of Leftovers and is fairly easy to wear down. If Probopass is needed to check a threatening offensive Pokemon, then keeping Probopass at high health is important.

Team Options
========

Pokemon such as Granbull that benefit from having Steel-type Pokemon out of the way are good teammates for Probopass. Fast offensive Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Sceptile, and Samurott that Probopass can pivot out into are also good teammates. Pokemon to handle Fighting- and Ground-types, such as Vileplume and Gourgeist-S, are also good teammates. Entry hazard setters such as Accelgor and Crustle are good teammates, as they limit the opponent's switching.

Stealth Rock
########
name: Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Power Gem / Flash Cannon
move 4: Toxic / Thunder Wave
ability: Sturdy
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Stealth Rock allows for chip damage and is good for breaking Focus Sash and limiting switches. Volt Switch is good for gaining momentum after setting up Stealth Rock and for pivoting out into better matchups. Power Gem is a good STAB move that hits hard when Probopass needs to attack. Flash Cannon is also a good STAB move that is used to hit Fairy-types such as Mega Audino. Toxic allows Probopass to rack up damage quickly on anything that tries to stay in on it. Thunder Wave cripples speedy offensive Pokemon by quartering their Speed and making them easy for Probopass's teammates to KO.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP and Special Defense investment allows Probopass to take multiple special attacks. Leftovers is used for passive recovery.

Usage Tips
========

Force out special attackers with Probopass and use Volt Switch on the switch or hit the incoming switch-in with a Toxic. Be wary of special attackers carrying Earth Power and Focus Blast. Set up Stealth Rock as soon as possible, though leading with Probopass isn't always advisable as it has a bad matchup against most Stealth Rock leads. When switching Probopass in for the first time, set up Stealth Rock on the switch and then hard switch out into an appropriate check or counter to what the opponent switches in.

Team Options
========

Spikes setters such as Accelgor and Quilladin are good to have, as entry hazard damage racks up. Probopass is also a good switch-in to cover Accelgor's and Quilladin's Fire weakness. Offensive Grass-type Pokemon, such as Sceptile and Serperior, can be good to Volt Switch out to on physical Water-type Pokemon that switch into Probopass. Spinblockers such as Gourgeist-S and Mismagius are good to ensure that Stealth Rock stays on the field. A good core in NU is Hariyama, Vileplume, and Probopass due to the synergy that they posses.

Offensive Trapper
########
name: Offensive Trapper
move 1: Earth Power
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Flash Cannon
move 4: Hidden Power Fire
ability: Magnet Pull
item: Air Balloon / Leftovers
evs: 172 HP / 252 SpA / 84 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Earth Power is the primary move used on this set, as it hits the majority of Steel-types quite hard. Volt Switch is used for switching out of unfavorable matchups and for using Probopass as a pivot. Flash Cannon is a powerful STAB move that allows Probopass to deal with Mega Audino. Hidden Power Fire allows Probopass to 2HKO a trapped Ferroseed.

Set Details
========

Air Balloon is used so that Pokemon that rely on Earthquake to hit Probopass, such as Steelix, cannot KO Probopass with Earthquake. Leftovers gives Probopass passive recovery and allows Probopass to bluff a support set, though Probopass must be wary of Earthquakes from the Pokemon it is trying to trap if using Leftovers. Maximum Special Attack investment allows Probopass to deal as much damage as possible, while 84 Speed allows it to outspeed base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Hariyama and Regirock. The rest of the EVs are put into HP so that Probopass has some bulk to take hits from faster Pokemon. A Modest nature is used for more Special Attack.

Usage Tips
========

Switch Probopass in on Steel-types such as Klinklang, Steelix, Ferroseed, and opposing Probopass to trap and beat them. While this variant of Probopass still has great bulk, it is worn down fairly quickly, so be wary of switching it in multiple times if you still need to trap a Steel-type. If running Leftovers, Probopass can bluff a support set and Volt Switch out, but be wary when trying to trap Steelix as it can survive an Earth Power and KO Probopass with Earthquake. Air Balloon is a dead giveaway to an offensive trapper set, so avoid leading with Probopass if you see a Steel-type in Team Preview that you want to trap.

Team Options
========

Granbull benefitS from having Steel-type Pokemon out of the way. Feraligatr benefits from Ferroseed, its premier counter, being trapped and taken out. As Probopass doesn't run Stealth Rock on this set, a good entry hazard setter such as Accelgor or Crustle is suggested, along with a spinblocker such as Gourgeist-S and Mismagius. Pokemon to handle Fighting- and Ground-types, such as Vileplume and Gourgeist-S, are also appreciated.

Other Options
########

A Choice Specs set is an option for more power, but Probopass appreciates the passive recovery from Leftovers and the ability to switch between moves. Magic Coat can be used on the defensive set to bounce back Spikes or Stealth Rock, but it is a bit gimmicky and requires some prediction. Taunt can be used to stop slower Pokemon from setting up, but because of Probopass's low Speed, Taunt isn't advisable. Magnet Rise is an option to stop Pokemon from hitting Probopass with Ground-type moves. Dazzling Gleam can be used on offensive variants to hit Fighting-types super effectively. Pain Split is an option to allow Probopass to regain health, albeit unreliably.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ground-types**: Ground-types such Rhydon and Seismitoad are immune to Volt Switch and can hit Probopass hard with a STAB Ground-type move.

**Hidden Power Ground**: Special attackers sometimes carry Hidden Power Ground specifically for Probopass, as Probopass is otherwise a good stop to special attackers such as Cryogonal and Vivillon.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Hariyama, Gurdurr and Sawk can all OHKO Probopass. Sawk, in particular, has Mold Breaker to negate Sturdy.

**Water-types**: Water-types such as Feraligatr, Ludicolo, and Samurott can all hit Probopass hard with their super effective STAB moves.
