Overview
########

Huntail's intimidating looks shouldn't fool you; it is very underwhelming. At first glance, Huntail's access to both Shell Smash and Baton Pass allows it to provide a huge support role, while its mixed attacking stats allow it to hit hard. All of these traits may seem great until you realize that Huntail has enormous competition: Gorebyss. Gorebyss is simply better than Huntail in every way possible. While Huntail seems on par with Gorebyss, Gorebyss has a much higher Special Attack stat than Huntail, allowing it to pull off its own sweep and defend itself better. Huntail also lacks any other options that are not either very situational or just plain bad, meaning that it is outclassed in its best role. Huntail's only advantage over Gorebyss is its ability to hit Cryogonal harder after a Shell Smash, which in itself is situational.

SmashPass
########
name: SmashPass
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Waterfall
move 4: Substitute / Ice Beam
ability: Water Veil
item: White Herb
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Naive

Moves
========

Shell Smash boosts all of Huntail's attacking stats by two stages. Baton Pass is then used to pass these boosts to a teammate. Waterfall can deal some good damage after a Shell Smash, but it is mainly used to stop Huntail from being Taunt bait. Substitute allows Huntail to be safe when setting up Shell Smash, and it is also passable to a teammate with Baton Pass. Ice Beam, however, can hit Grass-types hard after a Shell Smash, and is used over Ice Fang due to the fact that the latter is rather weak and most Grass-types in the tier are physically defensive.

Set Details
========

Water Veil is the preferred ability to prevent burns from crippling Huntail. A White Herb negates the defensive drops from Shell Smash, preventing the Baton Pass receiver from being too vulnerable to attacks. 252 HP EVs add onto Huntail's overall bulk. 252 Speed EVs with either nature maximize Speed. Use a Jolly nature with Substitute and a Naive nature with Ice Beam.

Usage Tips
========

Free switches are the best way to get Huntail in. Liepard can use Prankster Encore on an opponent to force a switch, while Uxie's Memento can weaken the opponent to force them to either switch or hit Huntail with weak attacks. Huntail should pass its boosts to Pokemon that check the opponent's Pokemon in order to ensure that they can come in safely. Lastly, Huntail should pass boosts mid- or late-game, as the recipient will be very susceptible to priority and being worn down if it attempts to sweep early-game.

Team Options
========

Uxie makes a great partner for Huntail. It can provide dual screens support in order to make passing Shell Smash boosts a lot easier, and Uxie can then force switches using Memento. Xatu is also an amazing partner for Huntail. Xatu's high Special Attack stat allows it to be very threatening thanks to its access to Stored Power, which is extremely strong with all of the boosts accumulated by Shell Smash. Xatu's access to Magic Bounce also prevents phazing from Roar and Whirlwind, ensuring that it can stay in longer. Grass- and Electric-type resists make good Shell Smash recipients, as Huntail will usually be targeted with those attacks. Lastly, powerful recipients such as Kangakhan, Feraligatr, Magmortar, and Samurott are all extremely potent after a Shell Smash boost.

Other Options
########

Huntail lacks any other usable options. Super Fang seems appealing for crippling opponents, but Huntail has no space for it. Crunch can hit Mesprit for good damage, but it has no use outside of that. Sucker Punch can be used for a priority attack, but Huntail outspeeds most opponents after a Shell Smash anyways, and it is illegal with Water Veil and Shell Smash. Lastly, a Swift Swim set is usable, but once again, Gorebyss outclasses Huntail in this.

Checks & Counters
########

**Taunt**: Faster Taunt users can stop Huntail from setting up Shell Smash, reducing Huntail's offensive potential.

**Revenge Killers**: Choice Scarf users such as Rotom can hit Huntail hard with a STAB attack, while Choice Scarf Jynx can hit it with Lovely Kiss.

**Phazing**: Haze and Roar force Huntail out, causing it to lose its boosts from Shell Smash, allowing Pokemon like Vileplume to easily switch in.

**Liepard**: Liepard's Prankster Encore can render Huntail useless.
