Overview
########
Pelipper is one of the few good Defog users in NU. It has a good defensive typing, good physical bulk, and access to reliable recovery in Roost. Its typing grants it resistances to Bug-, Fighting-, Fire-, Steel-, and Water-type attacks and an immunity to Ground-type attacks, too. Pelipper is unfortunately 4x weak to Electric-type attacks, and with Pokemon such as Rotom and Electivire around, that could be a problem for Pelipper. Its abilities, Keen Eye and Rain Dish, aren't too useful. Pelipper is outsped by most sweepers, making it hard to take a hit and then Roost the damage away; switching in becomes even more of a problem due to it being weak to Stealth Rock.

Moves
========
Defog is essential on Pelipper, as it's a great support move for the rest of the team by removing hazards from the field. Roost allows Pelipper to recover Stealth Rock damage, keep its HP high, and stall out opposing Pokemon in tandem with Toxic. Scald is a reliable Water-type STAB move which has a 30% chance of burning opponents. Burns are really appreciated, allowing it to survive hits from the physical side better. Toxic allows Pelipper to damage Grass- and Water-type Pokemon, which resist Scald, or Seismitoad, which is immune to Scald thanks to Water Absorb. Hurricane is a Flying-type STAB move which allows Pelipper to hit the many Grass-type Pokemon in the tier which don't mind getting burned, such as Lilligant, Vileplume, and Sceptile; however, the risk of missing is an issue. U-turn is another option, as it allows Pelipper to gain momentum on predicted switches from Pokemon not wanting to take a super effective move or risk getting burned.

Set Details
========
The EVs are standard, allowing Pelipper to withstand a good amount of physical hits before needing to use Roost. Keen Eye is unfortunately the only ability that should be used due to Rain Dish not being compatible with Defog. Leftovers provides Pelipper with a small amount of passive recovery each turn. A Bold nature, in tandem with maximum Defense investment, maximizes Pelipper's Defense.

Usage Tips
========
Roost should be used to keep Pelipper above 50%-60% health, as it is a vital Pokemon on the team to clear hazards and stall opposing Pokemon out. You want to switch Pelipper into Pokemon it can counter, such as Feraligatr and Poliwrath, which don't appreciate getting burned from Scald or taking a Hurricane, respectively. When against them, Pelipper wants to use Defog to remove hazards, Toxic to stall Pokemon out, or Scald predicting the switch in hope of getting a burn and damage on the incoming Pokemon. Pelipper is a physically defensive wall and should rarely switch into a special attack unless it's resisted and Pelipper is at a good amount of health; instead, bring Pelipper in on physically attacking Pokemon, as that allows it to Roost or Defog. With Toxic, Pelipper threatens Seismitoad, keeping it from coming in and causing problems with Water Absorb.

Team Options
========
Defensive Grass-type Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Vileplume, and Roselia make good partners, as they resist Electric-type attacks. Ferroseed gets a special mention for also resisting Rock-type attacks, meaning it resists both of Pelipper's weaknesses. Offensive Fire-type Pokemon such as Typhlosion and Pyroar appreciate Pelipper as a teammate due to it being able to take Water- and Ground-type attacks aimed towards them and providing Defog support. Ground-type Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Golem, and Golurk are immune to Electric-type attacks, which allows them to come in and hit the Electric-types back hard; they also resist Rock-type attacks. Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Audino which are weak to Fighting-type attacks appreciate Pelipper as a teammate, as it is an easy switch-in to Fighting-type attacks due to resisting them and its high Defense.

Other Options
########
Tailwind is an option, as it allows Pelipper to help its teammates by boosting their Speed. However, it isn't too practical due to its short duration. Knock Off allows Pelipper to remove items from opposing Pokemon, crippling walls and Pokemon with a Choice item. Air Slash can be used as it is more reliable than Hurricane and has a 30% chance to flinch. A Life Orb + Rain Dish set may seem like a good idea, but it is completely outclassed by Swanna; you don't want to use Rain Dish anyways as it is incompatible with Defog.

Checks & Counters
########

**Electric-types**: Electric-type Pokemon such as Electivire, Rotom, and Lanturn don't appreciate a Toxic or a burn from Scald, but can come in on Defog and OHKO Pelipper with their Electric-type moves due to its 4x weakness to them. Without a Ground-type Pokemon, Rotom can be a problem, as it can use Volt Switch to either OHKO Pelipper or gain momentum on a Pokemon switching in.

**Fast Special Attackers**: Fast special attacking Pokemon such as Mesprit and Mismagius can OHKO Pelipper once it has been damaged by Stealth Rock. Modest Life Orb Mesprit can take a Scald and scare Pelipper out with Psychic, which can OHKO Pelipper after switching in on Stealth Rock.

**Taunt**: Taunt users such as Qwilfish and Mismagius can force Pelipper to spam Scald or Hurricane since it won't be able to Defog, Roost, or Toxic; they are especially effective when Pelipper is trying to use Defog or Roost. Qwilfish forces Pelipper to switch out, giving Qwilfish a chance to set up Toxic Spikes and Spikes.

**Water Absorb**: Water Absorb users such as Seismitoad don't appreciate a Toxic but can wall Pelipper if it isn't running Hurricane or U-turn; they force Pelipper to switch out or try to stall them out with Toxic if it is being run. Seismitoad has no problem using Pelipper switching out to get Stealth Rock up again or use Toxic on the incoming Pokemon.

**Status**: Status such as poison and burn can wear down Pelipper, putting it 2HKO range from Pokemon that it would normally wall; sleep prevents it from doing anything; and paralysis can prevent Pelipper from using Defog or Roost due to a problematic Pokemon switching in on the turn it can't act due to paralysis.
