Overview
########

With two great offensive types in Dark and Ice, an amazing Speed tier, and a relatively good Attack stat, Sneasel is a good Pokemon in the NU metagame. It also has access to the coveted Knock Off, and it even has priority in the form of Ice Shard. However, depending on whether it uses Life Orb or Eviolite, it lacks bulk or power, respectively. It has pitiful defensive stats and five weaknesses, and is further hindered by its weakness to Stealth Rock.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Knock Off
move 2: Pursuit
move 3: Ice Punch
move 4: Ice Shard
ability: Inner Focus
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Knock Off is a great STAB choice for any Dark-type, and Sneasel is no different. Boosted by Life Orb, Knock Off can take out lots of threats or severely damage and cripple them by removing their items. Pursuit is used to catch Pokemon switching out off-guard, and when boosted, it really packs a punch. Ice Punch is a great secondary STAB move with great coverage, hitting Grass-, Flying-, and Ground-types hard, while also getting good neutral damage on anything resisting Knock Off. Ice Shard is another Ice-type move, but it has priority, which allows Sneasel to hit faster Pokemon such as Sceptile and Swellow which would otherwise beat it. Ice Shard also allows it to pick off weakened opponents that carry Choice Scarf or carry priority moves. Low Kick can be used used to round off its coverage and hit troublesome Steel-types such as Steelix and Pawniard hard, while also having a chance to OHKO Hariyama at +2, which would otherwise resist both of Sneasel's STAB moves.

Set Details
========

A Jolly nature is used because Sneasel's Speed tier is just so important. Life Orb is used to increase damage output so that Sneasel hits just about everything hard. Finally, the ability of choice is Inner Focus because it can block flinches from the likes of Fake Out, while its other abilities don't offer much benefit.

Usage Tips
========

Entry hazards should be removed because Sneasel is vulnerable to them, especially Stealth Rock. Sneasel should not be switching into attacks, even resisted ones, as it is very frail. Sneasel likes picking off opponents as a revenge killer, as it isn't going to be sweeping many teams. It can also be used as a nice hole-puncher mid-game, as it hits really hard. Knock Off should always be the first option to use. Prediction is key, however, as Sneasel doesn't want to be switching in and out often.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that set entry hazards make good teammates because they give Sneasel an easier time picking off opponents. Accelgor, Crustle, and Roselia make good teammates for this role. For example, after Stealth Rock damage, Swellow is OHKOed by Ice Shard. Pokemon that can beat Fighting-types, especially Poliwrath, work well. Psychic-types are good for this role, as they beat Fighting-types for Sneasel, while Sneasel beats Ghost-types for them. Poison-types make for good teammates, as they can deal with Granbull, which is a huge threat to Sneasel. Garbodor and Qwilfish can switch into Bug-, Fighting-, and Fairy-type moves, set up hazards, and lure in Psychic-types for Sneasel to switch into. Vileplume makes for a good choice, as it can put threatening foes to sleep and beat Rock-types and Poliwrath. Psychic-types such as Exeggutor and Mesprit can deal with physical walls and appreciate Sneasel weakening special walls with Knock Off and Pursuit. Hazard removers work well as teammates, as Sneasel does not appreciate hazards. Swanna and Kabutops are good options for this role because they both resist Sneasel's Fire-type weakness, and Swanna resists its Fighting-type weakness. Lastly, status absorbers such as Gurdurr, Hariyama, and Roselia work well as they don't mind burn, paralysis, or poison very much.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Ice Punch / Ice Shard
move 4: Ice Shard / Low Kick
ability: Inner Focus
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance allows Sneasel to boost up its Attack to extremely high levels and tear through teams. Knock Off is a great STAB choice for Sneasel. Boosted by Swords Dance, Sneasel can take out or severely damage lots of threats, and cripple them by removing their items. Ice Punch is a great secondary STAB move with great coverage, hitting Grass-, Flying-, Dragon-, and Ground-types hard. Ice Shard is another Ice-type move, but is a priority move, so it can hit faster Pokemon such as Sceptile and Swellow which would otherwise beat Sneasel. It also allows Sneasel to pick off weakened opponents that carry Choice Scarf or may have their own priority. Low Kick is used to round off the coverage and hit Steel-types that pose a threat, such as Steelix and Pawniard.

Set Details
========

252 EVs go into Sneasel's best stats, Speed and Attack, to maximize them, while the remaining 4 EVs are put in Defense instead of HP to minimize Stealth Rock damage. A Jolly nature is used because Sneasel's Speed tier is very important. An Adamant nature can be used if you don't mind the Speed loss and want the power boost. Eviolite is used to provide just enough bulk to reliably set up. Inner Focus is the ability of choice and is used to block flinch chances from the likes of Fake Out.

Usage Tips
========

Do not stay in against Fighting-types, as Sneasel has a very bad matchup against them. Take out any Fighting-types before attempting a sweep. Always switch in as little as possible, as Sneasel really hates residual damage. Set up on bulky Pokemon that may not be attacking, or on predicted switches. Eviolite gives enough bulk for Sneasel to use Swords Dance and rip a team apart. Mid-game, Sneasel can still do work by spamming Knock Off and softening up opponents, so don't feel restricted to sweeping late-game.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that set entry hazards, such as Crustle, Roselia, and Accelgor, make for good teammates as they give Sneasel an easier time picking off opponents. For example, after two layers of Spikes, a Swords Dance-boosted Ice Punch will always OHKO Sawk. Pokemon that can beat Fighting-types, especially Poliwrath, work well. Psychic-types are good for this role, as they beat Fighting-types for Sneasel, while Sneasel beats Ghost-types for them. Poison-types make for good teammates, as they can deal with Granbull, which is a huge threat to Sneasel. Garbodor and Qwilfish are able to switch into Bug-, Fighting-, and Fairy-type moves, set up hazards, and lure in Psychic-types for Sneasel to switch in on. Vileplume makes a good choice as it beats Rock-types, Poliwrath, and can put threatening foes to sleep. Psychic-types such as Exeggutor and Mesprit can deal with physical walls and appreciate Sneasel's ability to weaken special walls with Knock Off and Pursuit. Hazard removers work well, as Sneasel does not appreciate hazards. Swanna and Kabutops are good options, as Swanna resists Sneasel's Fighting-type weakness, while both resist it's Fire-type weakness. Finally, status absorbers such as Gurdurr, Hariyama, and Roselia work well as they do not mind burn, paralysis, or poison.

Other Options
########

Sneasel does not have very many useful alternate options. Poison Jab can be used to hit Fairy-types, but Ice Punch will suffice most of the time. Taunt can be used to stop stall, but Sneasel would usually rather have coverage. A Choice Band set can be used, but Sneasel appreciates the ability to change moves. Focus Sash can be used effectively to ensure a Swords Dance boost, but should be used as a late-game cleaner only. Lastly, Fake Out can be used to hit faster opponents, but Ice Shard usually works just as well, and is boosted by STAB.

Checks & Counters
########

**Poliwrath**: Poliwrath is the biggest counter to Sneasel, as it resists both of Sneasel's STAB moves, takes little damage from Low Kick, and can either OHKO Sneasel with a STAB Fighting-type move or set up on it.

**Steelix**: Steelix is very physically bulky, takes minimal damage from any of Sneasel's moves bar Low Kick, and can OHKO Sneasel with a Steel-type STAB move. 

**Granbull**: Granbull is one of the biggest checks to Sneasel, as it resists Sneasel's main STAB move, Knock Off, and has Intimidate to lower Sneasel's Attack. It can always OHKO with a super effective Play Rough in return.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Choice Scarf Sawk, Choice Scarf Primeape, Hariyama, and Gurdurr can all reliably beat Sneasel with a super effective STAB move. The first two have trouble switching in, however, as they do not appreciate losing their item, or taking an Ice Punch.

**Bulky Pokemon**: Any Pokemon that is able to take a hit and retaliate, such as Seismitoad, Garbodor, Bouffalant, or Feraligatr can typically OHKO Sneasel with ease.

**Status**: Status significantly hinders Sneasel, as burns halve its Attack, paralysis slows it down greatly, and poison whittles its health down.

**Priority**: Gurdurr's Mach Punch, Feraligatr's and Samurott's Aqua Jet, Hariyama's Bullet Punch, and Kangaskhan's Fake Out can all quickly KO Life Orb Sneasel.
