Overview
########

Sneasel is one of the best offensive Pokemon in NU thanks to its high base 115 Speed, allowing it to outrun almost the entire unboosted metagame including, most importantly, Archeops. Sneasel also has a decent Attack stat, which, when combined with its Speed, makes it a solid late-game cleaner. Access to STAB Knock Off and STAB priority gives Sneasel plenty of powerful utility, allowing it to remove opposing items and pick off weakened Pokemon. However, Sneasel is fairly frail, so it finds it difficult to switch in and set up against opposing offensive pressure without an Eviolite. Sneasel is also susceptible to all entry hazards, so it needs a lot of support to enter the battlefield and sweep. However, with the right support, Sneasel is an offensive powerhouse capable of sweeping entire teams.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Ice Shard
move 4: Icicle Crash / Low Kick
ability: Inner Focus
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance boosts Sneasel's Attack to immense levels, allowing it to function as a sweeper. Knock Off is a reliable STAB move that removes the foe's item and is Sneasel's main STAB move due to its high power and perfect accuracy. The move fares very well against the Psychic-types of NU, such as Xatu and Mesprit. Ice Shard is a STAB priority attack that nails faster foes such as Swellow, +1 Lilligant, and Choice Scarf Rotom-S. Icicle Crash can be used for a more powerful Ice-type STAB move against Archeops, Cacturne, Vileplume, and unboosted Lilligant. If you dislike the chance to miss, Ice Punch can be used, but the drop in power is noticeable. Alternatively, Low Kick nails Steel-types, Normal-types, and, most importantly, Hariyama, which resists Sneasel's STAB moves thanks to Thick Fat.

Set Details
========

Full investment in Speed and Attack maximizes Sneasel's potential to sweep. Eviolite provides it with just enough bulk to set up against weaker foes. Life Orb can be used to boost Sneasel's offensive presence, but the item wears Sneasel down quickly and makes it tougher to set up a Swords Dance. Inner Focus prevents Sneasel from flinching due to Fake Out from the likes of Hariyama and Kangaskhan.

Usage Tips
========

Try to set up on a Pokemon that Sneasel can force out, preferably a Psychic-type or a defensive Pokemon, as Sneasel can only afford to take one hit as it sets up a Swords Dance. Even though most Psychic-types run Signal Beam, Eviolite allows Sneasel to survive a single Signal Beam and set up a Swords Dance. If Sneasel cannot force its foe out, it can only set up if the foe lacks high offensive stats or a status-inducing move such as Toxic. Try to bring Sneasel in the battlefield after a teammate faints or with a U-turn or Volt Switch in order to prevent it from taking too much damage as it enters. Once it has set up, Sneasel is free to use its STAB attacks, though it should usually use Ice Shard against faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users. The combination of a +2 Knock Off and Ice Shard is enough to 2HKO Sawk on the switch, but it does negligible damage to Hariyama, Gurdurr, and Poliwrath. Icicle Crash will not save Sneasel against Gurdurr, which will threaten Sneasel with a STAB Mach Punch.

Team Options
========

A wallbreaker such as Zangoose or Typhlosion can weaken the opposing team so that Sneasel can have an easier time cleaning up. Typhlosion also enjoys having Hariyama weakened by Sneasel's Low Kick, allowing Typhlosion to spam its Fire-type moves more effectively. Psychic-types such as Mesprit can check the Fighting-types that Sneasel struggles with. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Mantine and Claydol can give Sneasel a much easier time switching in. Vileplume handles the Rock-, Fairy-, and Fighting-types that wall Sneasel and can aid Sneasel's sweep by putting foes to sleep with Sleep Powder. Entry hazard setters such as Garbodor can wear down opposing Pokemon in order to aid Sneasel in its attempt at a late-game sweep, and a status absorber such as Gurdurr prevents burn, poison, and paralysis from cutting Sneasel's sweep short.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Knock Off
move 2: Icicle Crash / Ice Punch
move 3: Ice Shard
move 4: Pursuit / Low Kick
ability: Inner Focus
item: Life Orb / Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Knock Off is a powerful and reliable STAB move that removes opposing items and hits several important Pokemon in NU hard including Uxie and Mismagius. Icicle Crash is another strong STAB attack that hits the offensive powerhouses Archeops and Scyther and can cause a foe to flinch before it can deal serious damage to Sneasel. It also hits Garbodor without making contact, so Sneasel does not take chip damage from Garbodor's Rocky Helmet or Aftermath. Alternatively, Ice Punch can be used for its perfect accuracy. Ice Shard gives Sneasel a strong priority move to deal with Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-S, as well as faster Pokemon such as Swellow. Pursuit is used on a predicted switch to deal serious damage to Mesprit, Cryogonal, Jynx, and Xatu, whereas Low Kick nails Hariyama in addition to Steel- and Normal-types.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed investment allows Sneasel to outspeed much of the unboosted metagame in addition to Archeops. Full Attack investment alongside Life Orb allows Sneasel to deal major damage and switch attacks, though Choice Band can be used if higher power is desired over the ability to change moves. Moreover, Choice Band does not wear Sneasel down with recoil damage.

Usage Tips
========

This set is primarily used as a revenge killer or a mid-game wallbreaker. Keep entry hazards off the field at all times, as Sneasel does not like residual damage. Moreover, as Sneasel lacks Eviolite, it should not be switching into any attacks; always bring it in on a free switch. When facing a Psychic- or Ghost-type, be sure to Pursuit trap it should you be running the move. Otherwise, use Knock Off to cripple the predicted switch-in.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard setters such as Crustle can wear down opposing Pokemon, making it easier for Sneasel to KO them. Fighting-types such as Hariyama appreciate Sneasel's ability to Pursuit trap Psychic-types, particularly Uxie and Musharna. Garbodor also enjoys having Xatu Pursuit trapped so that it can set up entry hazards more easily. Psychic- and Flying-types such as Mesprit and Rotom-S, respectively, check the Fighting-types that give Sneasel a hard time. Poison-types such as Garbodor and Vileplume have good defensive synergy with Sneasel, as they cover Fighting-, Bug-, and Fairy-type moves while Sneasel covers Psychic-type moves. Entry hazard removers such as Claydol and Prinplup make it easier for Sneasel to switch in and out of the battlefield, which it will be doing often.

Other Options
########

Poison Jab or Iron Tail can be used to hit Granbull and Mega Audino, both of which wall Sneasel otherwise. Taunt can cripple foes attempting to give Sneasel a status problem, but Sneasel often can't afford to give up an attacking move for it.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Fighting-types**: Common Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, Hariyama, and Poliwrath are all major issues for Sneasel. Gurdurr's STAB Mach Punch OHKOes even Eviolite Sneasel, while Hariyama and Poliwrath resist both of Sneasel's STAB attacks. However, Gurdurr cannot switch into Sneasel or else it risks losing its Eviolite, and Hariyama is still hit hard by Low Kick.

**Fairy-types**: Mawile hard walls all of Sneasel's moves and threatens it with Play Rough. Mega Audino and Granbull both take pitiful damage from all of Sneasel's moves bar the rare Iron Tail or Poison Jab. All three Fairy-types can effortlessly switch in on even a +2 Sneasel.

**Priority Users**: Sneasel's frailty and bad defensive typing leave it vulnerable to priority attackers such as Mach Punch Gurdurr, Aqua Jet Samurott, and Fake Out Kangaskhan. However, Eviolite helps mitigate this weakness somewhat. Moreover, Sneasel resists Sucker Punch and has STAB priority of its own, so priority users must have a significant amount of health to threaten Sneasel.

**Bulky Pokemon**: Without a boost, Sneasel fails to break through several bulky Pokemon such as Weezing, Carracosta, Bouffalant, Quagsire. All four Pokemon can switch into Sneasel as it uses Swords Dance. Weezing can burn Sneasel and wear it down with Flamethrower. Carracosta and Bouffalant both can take a +2 Knock Off and OHKO Eviolite Sneasel with Stone Edge. Quagsire bypasses any stat boosts Sneasel accumulates thanks to Unaware, and it can Toxic stall Sneasel easily.

**Status Ailments**: All status problems hinder Sneasel's ability to sweep. Weezing can switch in on Sneasel and use Will-O-Wisp to cut its damage output in half. Liepard and Lanturn can use Thunder Wave to make Sneasel's high Speed useless; Liepard outspeeds Sneasel because of Prankster and Lanturn can take a Knock Off from Sneasel easily. Toxic from defensive Pokemon such as Quagsire wears Sneasel down quickly, and as long as Sneasel cannot break through the Toxic staller, the poison damage will KO it quickly.
