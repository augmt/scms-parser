Overview
########

Ninjask is the fastest Pokemon in the NU metagame and can use its Speed to outspeed almost everything. Coupled with Infiltrator and a STAB U-turn it becomes a very competent revenge killer and pivot that can revenge kill boosted threats even without a Choice Scarf. However, thanks to non-existent defenses, a barren movepool, and a huge Stealth Rock weakness, Ninjask rarely gets to switch in against threats and requires a decent amount of support to function at its best. It also competes with Choice Scarf Scyther for a slot on a team; Ninjask has a significantly stronger U-turn and outspeeds most of the same threats, but it lacks Technician to boost its low-powered moves.

########
name: Revenge Killer + Pivot
move 1: U-turn

move 3: Aerial Ace
move 4: X-Scissor
ability: Infiltrator
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

U-turn is used to grab momentum or keep the momentum on your side. Final Gambit helps stop sweepers, but with Ninjask's HP, it doesn't net many OHKOs. Aerial Ace is the only physical Flying-type STAB move that Ninjask has access to; but it is weak, so it only hits hard when it's super effective. X-Scissor is Ninjask's strongest attack, which makes it the best option for late-game cleaning. Night Slash is used to hit Ghost-types, but it is not incredibly useful otherwise.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are used to hit as hard and be as fast as possible. With a Jolly nature, Ninjask outspeeds Pokemon with base 90 Speed at +1 such as Lilligant. A spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe and an Adamant nature can be used for the extra power while still being able to outspeed Pokemon with base 80 Speed at +1 with a neutral nature and slightly stronger Final Gambit, but the decrease in Speed is easily noticeable. Infiltrator ignores Reflect and can hit through Substitute, making it the most useful ability because Ninjask won't stay in a lot, and Choice Band boosts Ninjask's Attack to maximize its damage output.

Usage Tips
========

Keep Stealth Rock away from Ninjask's side of the field, as Ninjask can't switch in as long as Stealth Rock is up without weakening its Final Gambit. Ninjask should mainly use U-turn to build momentum when it is in against Pokemon such as Malamar that Ninjask forces out. Rocky Helmet can quickly wear down Ninjask, so have a partner that can lure in the Rocky Helmet user and remove it with Knock Off. Final Gambit is best used on foes that Ninjask can't knock out with any of its other moves and when it is too risky to U-turn out. However, don't use Final Gambit on Pokemon such as Hariyama or anything else with a large HP stat unless they're severely weakened, as it doesn't do much damage to them. Avoid switching Ninjask in on attacks, as even 4x resisted moves such as Close Combat still do a lot of damage. Similarly, most Pokemon that commonly carry priority moves are able to hit Ninjask for either neutral or super effective damage, so they can pose a threat to Ninjask even if they don't outspeed it.

Team Options
========

Xatu is a great partner for Ninjask, as it prevents Stealth Rock while Ninjask can deal with the Dark-types that threaten Xatu. However, be careful, as they do share several weaknesses. If you aren't using Xatu, it is mandatory to have Rapid Spin or Defog support from Pokemon such as Claydol and Prinplup if you want Ninjask to switch in more than twice and keep its Final Gambit as strong as possible. Water-types, such as Seismitoad and Samurott, that benefit from Ninjask being able to remove the Grass-types that threaten them are also good partners. Fighting-types such as Sawk, Hariyama, and Gurdurr can take out the Steel-types that Ninjask can't touch and threaten most Stealth Rock setters with their super effective STAB moves. The aforementioned Fighting-types enjoy the pressure Ninjask puts on Psychic-types in return.

Other Options
########

A set with Swords Dance, Baton Pass, and Speed Boost could be used, but it is unreliable at passing boosts and will more than often contribute very little to the battle. It is possible to use Toxic to wear down some of Ninjask's more common switch-ins, whereas Sleep Talk could be used if you want to use Ninjask to absorb sleep.

Checks & Counters
########

**Stealth Rock**: Stealth Rock is Ninjask's biggest fear, as its opportunities to switch in are limited at best with Stealth Rock up and it is worn down incredibly fast, making it far less useful during the battle.

**Rocky Helmet**: Pokemon using Rocky Helmet such as Garbodor, Weezing, and Xatu can easily wear Ninjask down simply by switching in as it U-turns out, weakening its Final Gambit and discouraging Ninjask from using U-turn before the Rocky Helmet is removed.

**Pokemon That Resist Bug-type Moves**: Anything with passable defenses and a typing that resists Bug-types, excluding Fighting- and Ghost-types, can generally come in on anything Ninjask tries to attack with, such as Mega Audino, Weezing, and Klinklang. However, Ninjask can still U-turn out.

**Priority**: The only priority moves that Ninjask resists are Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, so priority users without these moves such as Kangaskhan, Sneasel, and Samurott can deal large amounts of damage.

**Physically Bulky Pokemon**: Pokemon with high Defense such as Regirock, Garbodor, Weezing, and Rhydon take very little damage from any of Ninjask's attacks, and they each have some way to take advantage of a Choice-locked Ninjask; by using Stealth Rock, Spikes, or other status moves, for example.
