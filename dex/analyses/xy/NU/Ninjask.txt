Overview
########

Ninjask is a mixed bag of tricks. On one hand, it has a good ability in Speed Boost, access to both Swords Dance and Baton Pass, and a blazing base 160 Speed, making it the ideal Baton Passer in NU. On the other hand, it is the literal definition of Taunt bait, and it is extremely frail, making it hard to find free turns for it to use Swords Dance. Alongside this, Ninjask can be shut down in other ways apart from Taunt, such as Stealth Rock or phazing, all of which can be found within the tier.

Baton Pass
########
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Protect
move 4: Swords Dance / X-Scissor
ability: Speed Boost
item: Leftovers / Mental Herb
evs: 248 HP / 220 Def / 36 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Protect stalls for a turn, which gives Ninjask a free boost to its Speed thanks to its ability, Speed Boost. Substitute also allows for protection for a turn, and can be passed along with Baton Pass. Swords Dance is used not to boost Ninjask's power, but to pass the boost along with Baton Pass. Baton Pass is the most important move on the set, as it passes along the Attack and Speed boosts that Ninjask gains. X-Scissor can be used over Baton Pass to stop Ninjask from being Taunt bait, although it will not be doing much damage and Ninjask can simply switch out.

Set Details
========

Speed Boost is the ability of choice because it is the only reason that Ninjask has a niche in the metagame, as it synergizes well with Baton Pass. 36 Speed EVs allow Ninjask to outspeed Jolly Swellow at +1 Speed. 220 Defense EVs and an Impish nature boost Ninjask's Defense by a lot, while 248 HP EVs are dropped into bulk, which allows Ninjask to switch into Stealth Rock twice. Leftovers provides passive recovery from Substitute. A Mental Herb stops Ninjask from being Taunt bait, but is less needed as Ninjask outspeeds all Taunt users. However, it allows Ninjask to set up a Substitute and accumulate more Speed boosts.

Usage Tips
========

The combination of Substitute + Protect can make for many free turns, each giving a free boost to Speed. Ninjask is best used as a lead, as while opposing Pokemon may set up hazards, Ninjask can find a free turn to use Swords Dance. If this is not the case, Ninjask should only use Swords Dance when behind a Substitute. Baton Pass should be used whenever Ninjask has accumulated enough boosts, although it is recommended to Baton Pass once it has reached +2 Attack and +2 Speed.

Team Options
========

Slower offensive recipients such as Samurott, Kangaskhan, Electivire, Feraligatr, Golurk, and Pangoro can all take advantage of either the Attack or Speed boosts, making them good partners. Defog or Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Togetic or Sandslash are great, as Ninjask can then switch in multiple times to use Baton Pass without worrying about Stealth Rock.

Other Options
########

Ninjask really should not be using anything apart from its Baton Pass set, as all of its other options are easily outclassed by that set. A Choice Band or Life Orb Infiltrator set can be used, but Ninjask lacks the movepool to use it effectively. A Swords Dance set can be used, but Ninjask is too frail to set up without a Substitute. Flash is a very niche option to lower the opponent's accuracy, potentially allowing for more free turns for Ninjask.

Checks and Counters
########

**Taunt** Ninjask usually outspeeds most Taunt users, but if it ever finds itself Taunted, it is instantly rendered useless as it cannot use any of its moves. Taunt also limits Ninjask to passing only one Speed Boost, unless a Mental Herb is being held.

**Phazing** Roar and Whirlwind can break through Substitute and hit through Protect. These moves cause Ninjask to lose all of its boosts. Haze also removes all of Ninjask's boosts.

**Strong STAB Attacks** As Ninjask is extremely frail, any strong STAB attack will easily OHKO it. These attacks are also a threat to the recipient, as Ninjask usually finds itself passing boosts before the opponent attacks.

**Trick Room** Trick Room makes Ninjask move last, making it harder for it to set up effectively, while also nerfing any recipients without priority attacks.

**Stealth Rock** Stealth Rock takes half of Ninjask's health away, which is bad for Ninjask as it finds itself switching out often.

**Multi-hit Moves** Users of these type of moves, such as Rhydon, can break its Substitute and hit Ninjask very hard afterwards.
