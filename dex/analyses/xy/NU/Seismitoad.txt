Overview
########

Seismitoad is very effective at tanking hits thanks to its great Water / Ground typing, which gives it only one weakness to Grass, and solid 105 / 75 / 75 bulk. Seismitoad is also a very reliable Stealth Rock setter due to its ability to check common threats such as Typhlosion and Feraligatr. Water Absorb is a great ability that complements Seismitoad's bulk and somewhat makes up for its lack of recovery. Seismitoad is also quite versatile, being able to effectively use an offensive Swift Swim sweeper set and either a physically or specially defensive set. However, Seismitoad is pressured by the various Grass-types in the tier, such as Vileplume, Exeggutor, Lilligant, and Tangela. In addition, Pokemon that Seismitoad would normally wall often carry Hidden Power Grass to hit it with. Seismitoad is also worn down fairly quickly by status ailments and entry hazards due to its lack of reliable recovery.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Scald
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Knock Off / Toxic
ability: Water Absorb
item: Leftovers
evs: 200 HP / 252 Def / 56 SpD
nature: Relaxed

Moves
========

Seismitoad is a reliable Stealth Rock setter due to its good defensive typing and ability to tank hits well. Scald is a fairly strong Water-type STAB move that can cripple physical attackers and spread burns on the opposing team. Earthquake is Seismitoad's strongest physical Ground-type STAB move that deals a good amount of damage to most foes that do not resist it. Knock Off provides useful utility, as it removes the item of opposing Eviolite users such as Ferroseed and Togetic and weakens strong attackers by removing their Life Orb or Choice item. Knock Off also hits Cryogonal, which is immune to Earthquake thanks to Levitate and takes little from Scald due to its high Special Defense stat. Alternatively, Toxic can be used in the last moveslot to wear down Grass-types that switch in.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread maximizes Seismitoad's overall bulk and lets it to hit an important Leftovers number with its HP stat. Maximum Defense investment is used to take hits from the likes of Feraligatr and Kabutops, and a Relaxed nature is used to increase Seismitoad's Defense at the expense of its average Speed stat so as not to decrease the damage output of Earthquake. Use a Bold nature if you're using Earth Power and Toxic instead of physical attacks. The remaining EVs are put into Special Defense to round out Seismitoad's bulk. A specially defensive EV spread of 200 HP / 56 Def / 252 SpD with a Sassy nature is also an option, as it allows Seismitoad to better handle threats such as Typhlosion while still retaining some physical bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Seismitoad should use its great bulk to tank hits early on and set up Stealth Rock to support the team. It is often helpful to switch into Choice-locked Pokemon, such as Pyroar and Typhlosion, that are locked into a Fire-type move, or pivoting into a Volt Switch from Rotom in order to fire off an attack or set up Stealth Rock. It should be noted that letting Seismitoad take unnecessary damage early-game just to set up Stealth Rock is not beneficial in most situations, especially if Seismitoad needs to check threats such as Typhlosion and Kabutops later in the game. However, it is important to scout for Hidden Power Grass from the likes of Typhlosion and Pyroar by pivoting out into teammates. Scald is generally the safest attack to go for, as it deals decent damage thanks to STAB and has a chance to burn the foe. While Seismitoad can generally take Ice-type attacks decently well, it should stay away from Pokemon with Freeze-Dry, such as Cryogonal and Articuno, as it is 4x weak to the attack.

Team Options
========

Fire-types, such as Typhlosion, Magmortar, and Pyroar, make for great partners, as they resist both Grass-type attacks and Freeze-Dry. In addition, they also appreciate the Stealth Rock that Seismitoad sets up, as it helps them wear down their switch-ins and achieve some crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs. Seismitoad can switch into Water-type attacks thanks to Water Absorb and it threaten Rock- and Ground-types with its STAB moves. Grounded Poison-types such as Dragalge and Garbodor can absorb Toxic Spikes, which cripples Seismitoad, and set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes alongside Seismitoad's Stealth Rock to further pressure the opponent. Roselia and Vileplume are good partners, as they also absorb troublesome Toxic Spikes, can heal off status conditions with Aromatherapy, and threaten out Grass-types with their STAB Sludge Bomb. Ferroseed is another entry hazard setter that appreciates Seismitoad's ability to check Fire-types. Bouffalant makes for a great partner, as it gains an Attack boost from the Grass-type attacks which threaten Seismitoad thanks to its ability, Sap Sipper. As Seismitoad is vulnerable to all forms of residual damage, Wish passers and clerics such as Audino and Lickilicky make great partners, as they can replenish Seismitoad's HP and heal off status conditions.

Rain Dance Sweeper
########
name: Rain Dance Sweeper
move 1: Rain Dance
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Stealth Rock / Sludge Bomb
ability: Swift Swim
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Rain Dance boosts the power of Seismitoad's Hydro Pump and doubles its Speed, allowing it to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame. Hydro Pump is the chosen Water-type STAB move, as it hits extremely hard in the rain when backed by Life Orb. Earth Power provides good coverage, hitting Pokemon such as Jynx, Dragalge, Lanturn, Garbodor, and opposing Seismitoad. The filler move that Seismitoad picks in the last moveslot helps to weaken a variety of checks to common Pokemon on rain teams. Stealth Rock is preferred, as it is necessary on every team and Seismitoad finds many opportunities to set it up. However, it may be difficult to find a chance to set up both Rain Dance and Stealth Rock, so Sludge Bomb is a good option to hit Grass-types such as Tangela, Ludicolo, Sceptile, and Lilligant with. Focus Blast easily 2HKOes Ferroseed, and Rock Slide has niche coverage against Pokemon such as Jynx, Cryogonal, Mantine, and the rare Articuno.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread and a Modest nature maximizes Seismitoad's Speed and damage output. However, a Timid nature lets Seismitoad outspeed Timid Ludicolo and Adamant Kabutops both in and outside of rain, as well as Modest Mesprit and Modest Samurott outside of rain. Life Orb gives a significant boost in power to Seismitoad's moves. Alternately, Damp Rock can be used to extend the amount of rain turns provided by Rain Dance at the cost of power. If Rock Slide is chosen in the last slot, a Rash nature should be used to increase Seismitoad's Special Attack while preserving its Attack at the expense of its Special Defense.

Usage Tips
========

Seismitoad should be used early-game or as a lead to set up Rain Dance and Stealth Rock. However, it is important to remember that Seismitoad cannot easily check Feraligatr without Water Absorb. Once rain has been set up, Hydro Pump is generally the safest attack, as it heavily dents Vileplume and other Pokemon that resist it. Earth Power is a more accurate STAB move than Hydro Pump and should be used to finish off weakened foes and Pokemon such as Dragalge, Garbodor, and opposing Seismitoad. Seismitoad should use its chosen coverage move, either Sludge Bomb, Focus Blast, or Rock Slide, to hit the appropriate target on the switch.

Team Options
========

This set is best used on fully offensive rain teams with other rain setters, such as Liepard and Uxie, as they keep rain on the field, which powers up Seismitoad's Hydro Pump. Liepard utilizes Prankster to set up rain with priority, while Uxie uses its incredible bulk to setup rain multiple times, provide momentum with U-turn, and cripple a foe with Memento. Other Swift Swim abusers, such as Kabutops and Ludicolo, are great partners that can take advantage of the rain that Seismitoad sets up.

Other Options
########

An offensive Stealth Rock set with Water Absorb and three attacking moves from the choice of Hydro Pump, Earth Power, Sludge Bomb, and Grass Knot acts as a balanced medium between the two sets that provides utility and offensive pressure. A SubToxic set can be used to lure in Seismitoad's typical checks and counters and wear them down.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Ferroseed, Vileplume, and Sceptile all threaten to KO Seismitoad with their STAB moves and generally have an easy time switching into Seismitoad. Ferroseed should watch out for Knock Off, however.

**Residual Damage**: Entry hazards and repeated hits from attackers quickly wear down Seismitoad due to its lack of recovery.

**Status**: Seismitoad is vulnerable to status, as it will lose HP very quickly. Poison and burn damage will eventually take its toll, which means you either have to play Seismitoad very carefully or pair Seismitoad with a cleric.

**Specially Bulky Pokemon**: Audino, Lickilicky, and Mantine can all comfortably switch into any of Seismitoad's attacks. The former two don't mind being statused with Toxic thanks to their access to Heal Bell, while Mantine is a more reliable check to the Rain Dance set.
