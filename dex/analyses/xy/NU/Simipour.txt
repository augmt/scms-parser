Overview
########

Simipour is one of the few Pokemon in NU with access to Nasty Plot, which allows it to boost its Special Attack and fire off powerful attacks. With wide coverage options such as Ice Beam and Focus Blast, Simipour is quite a difficult Pokemon to switch into. Simipour's base 101 Speed stat is very useful because it allows it to outspeed the crowded base 100 Speed tier. However, Simipour has pathetic bulk and even some neutral hits can KO it. Simipour is just average and struggles to stand out among other Water-types such as Samurott, Feraligatr, and Lanturn. When offensive pressure is applied, Simipour is not always able to boost its Special Attack, thus leaving it quite weak and walled by a plethora of Pokemon. Both of Simipour's abilities rely on certain conditions to be met and neither of them are reliable enough to be consistent. While a base 101 Speed stat is great, it leaves a lot to be desired, as it allows Simipour to be easily revenge killed by any Choice Scarf Pokemon or those faster than it such as Mismagius, Pyroar, and Sceptile.

Moves
========

Simipour is the only Water-type in the tier with access to Nasty Plot, a move that allows it to enhance its Special Attack to threatening levels. Hydro Pump is Simipour's primary STAB move and is quite spammable, denting even bulky walls when at +2. Ice Beam rounds off Simipour's coverage by hitting Dragon- and Grass-type Pokemon which resist Hydro Pump. Focus Blast hits Normal-types such as Lickilicky and Audino hard and also allows Simipour to muscle past Ferroseed. Alternatively, Hidden Power Grass allows Simipour to hit opposing Water-types, such as Seismitoad and Lanturn, for super effective damage. Grass Knot, however, can be used because it has the possibility to be stronger; it's often less reliable than Hidden Power Grass, though, because it does pitiful damage against foes such as Lanturn that are not very heavy.

Set Details
========

Running maximum Speed and Special Attack investment is crucial to ensure that Simipour is as fast and powerful as possible. Running a Modest nature is never advised because, in doing so, Simipour loses the ability to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon. Thus, a Timid nature is always the nature of choice. Investing in bulk is also not a wise option because, even when invested, Simipour is still pitifully frail. A Life Orb is necessary to boost Simipour's damage output; the recoil from Life Orb is beneficial because it brings Simipour into Torrent range quicker and Simipour won't survive many hits anyway, making Leftovers moot. A Lum Berry could be of use to protect Simipour from harmful status just once, but the power that Life Orb provides is missed. Torrent allows Simipour to fire off insanely powerful Hydro Pumps before it faints, though it's not very reliable. Gluttony alongside a Salac or Petaya Berry could see a niche use, but it's generally not advised to run these sets because they are difficult to pull off and are not consistent.

Usage Tips
========

Simipour is fairly simple to use: attack with appropriate coverage as needed. Be sure to not set up too early or Simipour will be forced out by its checks and counters. Setting up on predicted switches is helpful because it is a free turn for Simipour and a +2 Special Attack Simipour can create problems for the opponent. Scouting for Choice Scarf users before setting up is important because these Pokemon are able to revenge kill Simipour. Watch out for Thunder Wave, as this will slow down Simipour and cause it to be practically useless. It's crucial to remember that Simipour is very fragile, so keeping it out of harm's way is important; be sure to get it in safely via a slow U-turn, Volt Switch, or Baton Pass. Using your best judgement as to when to begin setting up is also an important thing to note when using Simipour; setting up early in the match to break down walls in order to allow Simipour or a teammate to sweep late-game is a possibility, as is saving Simipour for later in the match to sweep after its teammates have done the wallbreaking.

Team Options
========

Simipour appreciates powerful wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Sawk, as teammates because these Pokemon can break down walls for Simipour and allow it to sweep later in the match. Feraligatr makes for a good partner, as the two can pressure each other's checks and counters. Spikes support from Garbodor or Crustle is helpful to further accumulate the opponent's entry hazard damage, slowly wearing them down for Simipour. For example, with Spikes support, Simipour can OHKO Dragalge at +2 and OHKO Poliwrath with a boosted Focus Blast. Knock Off support from the likes of Pawniard and Liepard is appreciated, as Knock Off removes opposing Pokemon's Leftovers and Eviolite, further wearing them down. Healing Wish Mesprit can bring in an injured Simipour and give it another shot at sweeping. Mesprit also stands out because it has access to both Stealth Rock and U-turn for safe pivoting and entry hazard support. Electric-types such as Electivire can break down bulkier Water- and Grass-types such as Lanturn, Ferroseed, and Roselia, respectively, all of which would otherwise beat Simipour.

Other Options
########

Thanks to Simipour's Speed stat, a Choice Scarf can be utilized to outspeed the crowded base 100 Speed Choice Scarf users. Similarly, a Choice Specs set is viable thanks to Simipour's high powered moves; however, this is not advised because Simipour enjoys switching moves. Knock Off could be used to remove Eviolite and Leftovers to allow Simipour to more easily break through bulkier Pokemon. Sets utilizing Gluttony and a Berry + Substitute / Acrobatics could be used, but these are usually not as viable as a Nasty Plot set. Endeavor could possibly be used on a gimmicky set to bring an opponent down to low health, but it's not going to work that often. Superpower can be used over Focus Blast because it breaks through special walls, though it's not exactly super powerful. Taunt is another option to aid in Simipour's stallbreaking and allows it to be a bit more comfortable when setting up. A physical set that consists of Waterfall, Low Kick, and Rock Slide is also an option, but the low power of these moves and Simipour's inability to boost its Attack stat make this an unadvised option.

Checks &amp; Counters
########

**Bulky Pokemon**: Normal-types with high Special Defense such as Lickilicky and Audino can shrug off Simipour's attacks, though they must watch out for Focus Blast. Uxie can stomach Simipour's attacks and threaten it in return with Thunder Wave. Ferroseed must watch out for Focus Blast, but otherwise it is able to stop Simipour. Dragalge is able to stomach Simipour's unboosted Ice Beam with ease and force it out with Dragon Tail. It should be noted that, thanks to Simipour's coverage moves, not many Pokemon can directly switch in on it.

**Water-types**: Lanturn shrugs off Simipour's STAB attacks and Qwilfish can stomach a hit and paralyze Simipour, crippling it. Most other Water-types have to watch out for Simipour's Grass-type attacks, but bulky Water-types like Lanturn are usually able to stomach the hits. When Simipour chooses to run Focus Blast instead, however, more options begin to open up that include Seismitoad and Poliwrath. Boosted attacks are always tough to switch into, though.

**Grass- and Electric-types**: Grass-types resist Hydro Pump, though both Grass- and Electric-types have to watch out for coverage moves when switching ins. Choice Scarf Lilligant can outspeed Simipour easily and KO it with its Grass-type STAB moves, Ludicolo outspeeds it in rain and hits it with Giga Drain, Sceptile outspeeds it naturally and KOes with its Grass-type STAB moves, Choice Scarf Rotom can outspeed it and KO it with Electric-type STAB moves, and Vileplume can stomach a hit and hit Simipour hard with Giga Drain, among others.

**Strong Offensive Pokemon**: Most attacks will KO Simipour due to its pathetic 75 / 63 / 63 defenses. Simipour has to watch out for both physical and special attacks from Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Slurpuff, Kabutops, Cryogonal, Gurdurr, and Sawk. However, it's very important to note that none of these Pokemon can switch in safely and are better off revenge killing or coming in through safer means such as U-turn or Volt Switch.
