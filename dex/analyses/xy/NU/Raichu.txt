Overview
########

Raichu is a great choice for an Electric-type in NU thanks to its high Speed, decent Special Attack, and good movepool. It has a plethora of good coverage moves to use alongside its Electric-type STAB moves, such as Grass Knot and Focus Blast. It also has access to Volt Switch, allowing it to quickly gain momentum for your team. It even has access to Nasty Plot to clean up weakened teams. Its ability, Lightning Rod, allows it to absorb Volt Switch and Thunder Wave for a Special Attack boost, and can be used in conjunction with Encore to create setup opportunities. Sadly, it is rather frail, especially on the physical side, falling to many powerful STAB attacks, and has few resistances by virtue of its typing. However, despite these small flaws, Raichu is still a great speedy Electric-type

Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Grass Knot / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Encore / Focus Blast
ability: Lightningrod
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Nasty Plot doubles Raichu's Special Attack, allowing it to clean up weakened teams with ease. Thunderbolt is a powerful, reliable STAB move, and is what Raichu should be using most often when attempting a sweep. Grass Knot nails Ground-types that are immune to Thunderbolt rather hard, as many of them are heavy. However, Hidden Power Ice can be used if you can't afford to lose to Grass-types, such as Vileplume, Exeggutor, and Roselia, and Dragon-types, such as Dragalge. Keep in mind that it deals much less damage to the likes of Rhydon and Seismitoad, however. Encore is useful, as it can create setup opportunities thanks to Raichu's high Speed. That being said, Focus Blast is also a viable option that allows Raichu to hit Audino, Probopass, Ferroseed, and Cryogonal for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

The given EVs maximize Raichu's Speed and Special Attack, which it relies on as a sweeper. Life Orb is the chosen item to boost Raichu's average Special Attack and net some important KOs Raichu wouldn't get without it. A Timid nature is preferred over a Modest nature to outspeed threats such as Pyroar, Liepard, and Mismagius. Finally, Lightning Rod is the chosen ability to get the occasional Special Attack boost and absorb Thunder Wave and Volt Switch for the team.

Usage Tips
========

Do not set up Nasty Plot too early, before all of Raichu's counters are removed or weakened, or you will be wasting valuable momentum as Raichu will likely be forced out the next turn. Try to set up on something that can't hurt Raichu or Raichu can force out. Use Encore on moves such as Stealth Rock or Electric-type moves so the opponent will be forced to switch, allowing Raichu to easily acquire a Nasty Plot boost.

Team Options
========

Pokemon such as Typhlosion and Ludicolo appreciate the removal of the special walls Raichu beats. Raichu can also lure in Rock-types such as Rhydon and KO them with Grass Knot or Focus Blast, making it easier for Pokemon such as Swellow and Kangaskhan to damage the opponent's team. Offensive Ice-types such as Sneasel and Cryogonal make for good teammates, as they can pressure and remove Pokemon such as Vileplume and Dragalge. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Regirock and Seismitoad is useful to put some damage on opponents, making it easier for Raichu to sweep. Flying-types and Levitate users can switch in on the Ground-type moves aimed at Raichu. On a similar note, Water- and Flying-types can bait Electric-type moves for Raichu to come in on.

All Out Attacker
########
name: All Out Attacker
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Grass Knot
move 4: Focus Blast
ability: Lightningrod
item: Choice Specs / Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Thunderbolt is Raichu's most reliable STAB move and is very easy to spam if opposing Ground-types, Volt Absorb users, and Lightning Rod users are removed. Volt Switch is great for gaining momentum for your team, also turning a potentially nasty situation into an advantageous situation if a counter switches in. Grass Knot hurts Ground-types, which are immune to Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, and works especially well because many Ground-types are heavy. Focus Blast provides good coverage and allows Raichu to hurt Pokemon such as Audino, Probopass, Ferroseed, and Cryogonal.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Raichu's Special Attack and Speed, allowing it do a lot of damage. Choice Specs allows Raichu to hit hard right off the bat and clean up late-game once Pokemon with immunities to Electric-type moves have been removed, while Life Orb can be used if the ability to switch moves is more important than a bit of extra power. Lightning Rod is the chosen ability for its Thunder Wave and Volt Switch blocking utility and the potential to gain a Special Attack boost from Electric-type moves. A Timid nature is used to maximize Raichu's Speed, allowing it to outspeed as much as possible.

Usage Tips
========

Volt Switch should be used often during the early-game to gain momentum and wear down Raichu's counters. It is best to try to predict the switch-in as well as possible as Raichu isn't particularly strong without a boost. Be wary of Ground-types and Pokemon with abilities that grant them an immunity to Electric-type moves, especially if you're running Choice Specs, as it can lose a lot of momentum for your team if you predict incorrectly.

Team Options
========

Pokemon with access to Volt Switch or U-turn such as Primape, Liepard, Probopass, and Uxie can form a VoltTurn core with Raichu. Entry hazards are nice to have, as they make wallbreaking and wearing down Pokemon much easier. Rhydon, Ferroseed, and Accelgor are all good setters of Stealth Rock and Spikes, respectively. Also, hazard control from Pokemon such as Cryogonal, Sandslash, and Kabutops is nice to allow Raichu to switch in and out more with Volt Switch. Similarly, Xatu can prevent hazards from being set thanks to its ability Magic Bounce. Frail sweepers that appreciate a free switch in from Volt Switch such as Zangoose and Vivillon make for good teammates, too.

Other Options
########

A physical set, especially with Choice Band or Life Orb, seems like a good idea, but the two best moves to use with it, Volt Tackle and Extreme Speed, are illegal together. A Choice Scarf set similar to the All Out Attacker set seems viable, but it is incredibly weak and is generally not recommended. Signal Beam can be used to hit Grass-types harder, but it is hard to fit onto a set in favor of Raichu's other moves. Hidden Power Ice can be used over Grass Knot on the All Out Attacker set to hit Grass- and Dragon-types, but it is better just to Volt Switch out most of the time. Similarly, Hidden Power Grass can be used over Grass Knot to hit Lanturn slightly harder, but it's usually worth putting that responsibility on another teammate. Finally, a set with Rain Dance and Thunder is usable, but there are better rain setters.

Checks & Counters
########

**Lanturn**: Lanturn stands out as Raichu's best counter as it blocks Volt Switch thanks to Volt Absorb, is not 2HKOed by a +2 Grass Knot, and can wear Raichu down with Scald.

**Dragalge**: Dragalge takes little damage from Raichu's moves bar a +2 Hidden Power Ice, which only has a chance to 2HKO defensive variants, and can do major damage back.

**Camerupt**: Thanks to its Fire typing, Camerupt doesn't take much damage from Grass Knot or Hidden Power Ice, and can KO Raichu with Earth Power or Earthquake.

**Revenge Killers**: Common Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Tauros can KO Raichu with ease. Pokemon with a higher base Speed stat, such as Swellow and Sneasel, can also do massive damage.

**Priority**: Liepard's Sucker Punch and Feraligatr's Aqua Jet can KO Raichu with prior damage thanks to Raichu's low Defense.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types wall most of Raichu's sets unless it chooses to run Hidden Power Ice.
