Overview
########

Mightyena has a unique ability in Moxie, which boosts its Attack every time it takes out a foe. This creates a snowball effect that can allow Mightyena to sweep weakened teams. Mightyena's low Speed does hold it back, although it does have a powerful priority STAB move in Sucker Punch to somewhat mitigate this. Mightyena was gifted with the move Play Rough this generation, which gives it much needed coverage to hit Fighting- and Dragon-type Pokemon hard. However, Mightyena has really bad overall stats; it is very frail and its Attack is pitiful without a Moxie boost. However, with the right support, it can become a very threatening late-game cleaner.

Moves
========

Sucker Punch is a strong priority move that allows Mightyena to mitigate its somewhat low Speed. Crunch is another STAB move, which might seem a bit redundant, but it is much more reliable than Sucker Punch and the better option versus slower Pokemon. Play Rough gets great coverage all-around, hitting Fighting-type switch-ins and other Dark-types. Fire Fang is useful because it 2HKOes Pawniard and nails Ferroseed.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Mightyena to be as fast and powerful as possible. Investing in bulk is unwise because Mightyena's bulk is fairly pitiful, and if it invests in bulk, it is often too weak and outsped by many other Pokemon. Life Orb increases Mightyena's power, although Lum Berry is viable to avoid a crippling Will-O-Wisp or Toxic. Adamant is the nature of choice because it increases Mightyena's power, which it so desperately needs. A Jolly nature is not advised because nothing notable is outsped and this leaves Mightyena missing a lot of power.

Usage Tips
========

Mightyena is a very simple Pokemon to use: use the appropriate coverage move to hit its foes super effectively. Don't attempt to sweep too early because Mightyena is too weak to sweep entire teams by itself. Mightyena should wait until its teammates wear down the opposing team until Mightyena has a shot at sweeping. Do not keep Mightyena in on bulkier Pokemon; it's not powerful enough to break through them. Finally, be very careful when using Sucker Punch, as the opponent might use a status move or set up a Substitute.

Team Options
========

Sticky Web helps to make up for Mightyena's somewhat lacking Speed and allows an easier time for it to sweep; Pokemon such as Kricketune and Leavanny can both set up Sticky Web and take Fighting-type moves that threaten Mightyena. Pokemon that can wear down the opposing team such as Magmortar, Electivire, and Pangoro also make for good partners. Sawk has decent synergy with Mightyena and is a very powerful wallbreaker. Entry hazard support from Crustle and Omastar is great to wear down bulkier Pokemon throughout the match. Granbull is also a good partner, as it has good defensive synergy with Mightyena, can spread paralysis, and can keep Mightyena status-free with Heal Bell.

Other Options
########

Mightyena's movepool is quite lacking, although there are a few other notable options. Substitute blocks status and eases prediction for Mightyena, while also forcing the opponent to attack to break Mightyena's Substitute, allowing it to use Sucker Punch without worry. Howl is Mightyena's only Attack boosting move, but it's a small boost and it takes up a valuable moveslot. Ice Fang or Thunder Fang can be used for coverage, hitting Grass- and Water-types respectively. Taunt seems viable, although Mightyena is too slow and not bulky enough to utilize it to its full potential. Facade is an interesting option to take advantage of status, but is fairly weak otherwise.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types resist Crunch and Sucker Punch while also having super effective STAB moves to use against Mightyena. Most Fairy-types also have the bulk to take Mightyena's attacks.

**Bulky Pokemon**: Pokemon that have any reasonable bulk can simply shrug off Mightyena's attacks
as they are lacking in power before attaining boosts from Moxie.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types resist Crunch and can easily pick off Mightyena with their STAB moves. However, they must watch out for Play Rough.

**Status**: All kinds of status cripple it: Will-O-Wisp cripples it and cuts its Attack, Thunder Wave leaves it outsped by everything, and Toxic sets it on a timer. Some Pokemon that can inflict status include Spiritomb and Audino.

**Priority**: Any faster priority move causes Sucker Punch to fail and Mightyena lacks the bulk to take any strong priority.
