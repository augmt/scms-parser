Overview
########

Hippopotas find its place in NU as a very reliable sand setter, and the only one with Sand Stream. A decent defensive typing, access to Stealth Rock, and reliable recovery in Slack Off makes it a reliable, albeit specific, team supporter. However, due to its low base stats, it's fairly frail even when invested, and is prone to being set up on unless it runs a phazing move. Its typing leaves Hippopotas weak to common special Water- and Grass-type moves. Because of the unique support it gives, it only fits on a certain type of team and fails to do much other than set up sand.

Sand Support
########
name: Sand Support
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Toxic / Earthquake
move 3: Whirlwind
move 4: Slack Off
ability: Sand Stream
item: Smooth Rock / Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Stealth Rock gives Hippopotas entry hazards support, and damages Flying-types, which are immune to Earthquake. Whirlwind can phaze out anything that tries to set up on Hippopotas and racks up hazard damage. Yawn can be used instead of Whirlwind to force switches. It's more unreliable, but it can spread sleep and help bring in team members safely on predicted double switches or on sleeping Pokemon. Slack Off is reliable recovery and ensures that Hippopotas stays healthy thoughout the game. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-types decently hard, but it should rarely be used, as Hippopotas has a low Attack stat. Toxic can be used as a more reliable way to damage the opposing team.

Set Details
========

Smooth Rock extends the turns of sand from five to eight, which in most situations is preferable over the extra bulk from Eviolite. Sand Stream is mandatory, as it is the only reason to use Hippopotas. Eviolite can be used over Smooth Rock to give Hippopotas better overall bulk. However, Eviolite forces Hippopotas to switch in more to keep up sand.

Usage Tips
========

Hippopotas is used for the support it gives its team, so it should be in as little as possible when sand is already up to avoid wasting sand turns. However, it can still set up Stealth Rock or take on weaker physical attackers if needed. Note that even with defensive investment Hippopotas is fairly frail, so avoid strong attackers and powerful moves. When switching Hippopotas in make sure it will survive the entry hazards damage as Sand Stream activates after hazards damage.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that work well with Hippopotas can take advantage of the sand it brings. Sand Rush users such as Stoutland and Sandslash are a must, as they become dangerous sweepers with boosted Speed under sand. Rock-types such as Cradily, Rhydon, and Carracosta get their Special Defense boosted by the sand, allowing them to more effectively do their jobs. Other options to consider are Pokemon with Sand Veil such as Cacturne that benefit from the evasion boost that sand gives it. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Dragalge that resist common Grass- and Water-type moves aimed at Hippopotas can support it. A Pokemon with Sandstorm can be used to relieve the pressure on Hippopotas. While it is not mandatory as Hippopotas can function without it, Rapid Spin or Defog support helps it to switch in more times throughout a game.

Other Options
########

Hippopotas doesn't have much else to offer. A set with Bulldoze is possible to lower the opponent's Speed for a bit more team support. Sandstorm can also be used to beat opposing weather starters that try to remove the sand that Hippopotas sets up.

Checks & Counters
########

**Weather Starters**: Opposing weather starters can replace the sand Hippopotas sets up with a different weather.

**Entry Hazards**: As Hippopotas will be switching in and out a lot, it's easy to wear it down with Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Stealth Rock as it has no passive recovery.

**Special Attackers**: Any powerful special attacker will take Hippopotas out in a few hits, even with neutral STAB moves. Most Pokemon with a special super effective move can easily deal with it.

**Super Effective Moves**: Both physical and special super effective moves can easily take non-Eviolite Hippopotas out.
