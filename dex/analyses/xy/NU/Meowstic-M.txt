Overview
########

Meowstic has awesome support options that, when coupled with Prankster, make it a great addition to hyper offensive teams. However, Taunt stops it right in its tracks and renders it setup fodder. Furthermore, the common Defog clears Meowstic's dual screens. Meowstic faces stiff competition from Uxie as a dual screener because it has higher bulk and access to moves such as U-turn and Memento. Meowstic is also very weak offensively.

move 2: Light Screen

Moves
========

Reflect and Light Screen are the most important moves on the set, and they halve the damage taken from physical and special attacks, respectively. This allows Meowstic-M to support its teammates by letting them set up with ease. The third moveslot is a toss up. Yawn allows Meowstic-M to force some switches, and lets it set up more easily, though Thunder Wave cripples foes and its effects are instant. The last moveslot is also a matter of preference. Psychic hits harder most of the time, though Psyshock can be useful for getting past Pokemon such as Dragalge and Hariyama. Yawn can also be used in this moveslot as it allows you to be much more selective of what foe gets inflicted with what, and Meowstic-M is very weak without investment. However, if you choose to opt for Yawn over an attacking move, it will make Meowstic-M very susceptible to Taunt.


Set Details
========

The given EV spread maximizes Meowstic-M's ability to take physical hits and allows it to set up more easily. However, a specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD can be used to allow Meowstic-M switch into powerful attackers such as Magmortar with more ease. Light Clay increases the amount of turns Reflect and Light Screen are up. A Bold nature is used to further increase Meowstic-M's physical bulk.


Usage Tips
========

Use Thunder Wave or Yawn often to cripple opposing Pokemon; this serves as an emergency check to dangerous threats. In addition, use Reflect and Light Screen often to support your team's setup sweepers. If you opt for Yawn, after setting up dual screens, Meowstic-M can force an opposing Pokemon out.


Team Options
========

Meowstic-M is a great choice on hyper offensive teams as it is the only Pokemon in the tier with both Prankster and dual screens. Setup sweepers such as Linoone, Gorebyss, and Klinklang really appreciate the support Meowstic-M provides.


Other Options
########

Meowstic-M can use other moves such as Toxic and Torment, though Thunder Wave is more useful in many cases and Torment is somewhat gimmicky. An offensive or Calm Mind set can also be used, but it is highly outclassed by the likes of Uxie and Mesprit. Safeguard is another interesting choice, preventing your team from status for a few turns. Meowstic-M can also be used as a weather setter, having access to priority Sunny Day and Rain Dance, though it is rather outclassed in such roles by Liepard and Volbeat, as they both have access to Encore and U-turn. Trick can also be used to switch items with the foe.


Checks &amp; Counters

**Taunt** Taunt users such as Liepard stop Meowstic-M right in its tracks and render it setup fodder.
