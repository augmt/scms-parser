Overview
########

Exeggutor has multiple niches. It can make use of the wonderful ability Harvest to stall out threats, or it can take advantage of the sun with Chlorophyll and potentially sweep teams. It also has decent bulk, allowing it to withstand quite a few hard hits when invested appropriately. The one main downfall of Exeggutor is its weakness to common attacking types, such as Dark, Fire, and Bug. One of its sets can also be almost entirely destroyed by faster Taunt users, of which there are many, as it has a mediocre base 55 Speed.​


LumRest
########
name: LumRest
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Psychic
move 4: Rest
ability: Harvest
item: Lum Berry
evs: 248 HP / 152 SpA / 108 Spe
nature: Modest


Moves
=====

Sleep Powder lets Exeggutor put one of the opposing Pokemon to sleep, which is always a positive in any battle. With a strong STAB move in Psychic, Exeggutor is able to hold its own when need be, and gain back health with its other STAB move, Giga Drain. Rest allows Exeggutor to recover back to full health when it's getting low on HP. Rest also lets it remove any statuses that it might have been afflicted with.


Set Details
========

108 Speed EVs allow Exeggutor to outspeed uninvested Lanturn, which can come in and otherwise severely cripple Exeggutor. With 248 EVs put into HP, Exeggutor is able to survive harder hits. The remaining EVs are put in Special Attack so that Exeggutor is able to hit hard with its two STAB moves, potentially racking up a few KOs. Lum Berry prevents Exeggutor from picking up a status effect. With the Harvest ability, Exeggutor has an essentially infinite supply of Lum Berries, which works well with Rest.

​
Usage Tips
========

Though Exeggutor is somewhat bulky, try not to send it out recklessly, and act according to the situation you are faced with. This particular set works well as a status absorber, as it effectively has a limitless supply of Lum Berries. It can switch in on a status move such as Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave, heal itself with the Lum Berry, and then proceed to either attack the opposing Pokemon or act as a pivot.



Team Options
========

With Sleep Powder, Exeggutor is able to pave the way for setup sweepers such as Klinklang and Mismagius to come in and tear through the opposing team. Another great thing to have on the team would be a cleric such as Togetic or Granbull which can switch in on a Bug- or Dark-type move and cure any status Exeggutor might have if its Lum Berry is Knocked Off. Granbull can switch into moves that could devastate Exeggutor. A bulky Water-type such as Seismitoad is also a good switch-in to Fire-type attacks. Seimitoad is also capable of setting up Stealth Rock, which is always beneficial to any team.


Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Psychic / Psyshock
move 2: Leaf Storm
move 3: Giga Drain
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Sleep Powder
ability: Chlorophyll
item: Choice Specs
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest


Moves
=====

Leaf Storm and Psychic are Exeggutor's two strongest STAB moves, with Giga Drain for scenarios in which lowering Special Attack is not favorable and the opposing Pokemon resists or is immune to Psychic. Psyshock is an alternative for special walls. Hidden Power Fire covers foes that resist both of Exeggutor's STAB moves, most notably Ferroseed. Hidden Power Fire can also hit other unsuspecting Steel-type Pokemon such as Klinklang. Sleep Powder can be used over Hidden Power Fire, as it is a great stop to setup sweepers such as Mismagius and Feraligatr.


Set Details
========

252 Special Attack EVs give Exeggutor the strongest possible attacks. 252 Speed EVs let Exeggutor outspeed most Pokemon when under the sun; however, Exeggutor also benefits from these EVs when there is no sun, as they allow it to outspeed any uninvested base 85 Speed Pokemon, such as Feraligatr. The remaining 4 EVs are placed into Defense to allow Exeggutor to potentially survive more attacks. Choice Specs boosts the amount of damage that will be dealt.


Usage Tips
========

While Chlorophyll Exeggutor is typically run with a sun user, it does not have to be under the sun to be effective. However, keep in mind that once Exeggutor is locked into a move, it is easy to play around, so choose the move that would best fit the upcoming scenario. When setup sweepers are present, it is better to use Psychic instead of Leaf Storm unless the opposing Pokemon resists it, as once Exeggutor is at -2 Special Attack, it is no longer threatening, and this can provide momentum to the opponent. However, when dealing with certain walls such as Probopass and Audino, Leaf Storm is the better move to use as it can 2HKO them after entry hazard damage.


Team Options
========

Even though Exeggutor is not entirely reliant on sun, having a sun setter such as Volbeat, Liepard, or Uxie is greatly appreciated. Liepard and Volbeat are both Prankster users that can easily set up sun for Exeggutor, and Uxie can set up sun as well as Stealth Rock, which is great to have. As with all Pokemon that attempt to sweep, having entry hazard support is always beneficial, as it allows for Exeggutor to be able to 2HKO Pokemon it would otherwise be unable to. Without hazards up, Exeggutor has no chance of 2HKOing Probopass, whereas with Stealth Rock and two layers of Spikes, Leaf Storm is always a 2HKO. Seismatoad is a great Pokemon to set up Stealth Rock, as it is quite bulky, and its one weakness is a type that Exeggutor can switch into. For Spikes, Accelgor is a great choice, as with Focus Sash it is capable of getting up two layers of Spikes almost every time.


Chlorophyll Sweeper
########
name: Chlorophyll Sweeper
move 1: Solar Beam
move 2: Psychic / Psyshock
move 3: Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Sunny Day / Sleep Powder
ability: Chlorophyll
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
=====

Exeggutor under the sun should not be messed around with, as it has access to Solar Beam, a powerful 120 Base Power STAB move with no repercussions, aside from the fact that it is only truly usable during the sun. It also has another powerful STAB move in Psychic, which can hit a lot of the things that Grass-type moves cannot. Psyshock is an alternative to use against special walls. For Steel-types, Hidden Power Fire is able to take advantage of the sun boost as well. Because this particular set is not locked into a move with Choice item, Exeggutor has the option of running Sunny Day itself, but this can be replaced with Sleep Powder to cripple one of the opposing Pokemon if you have other Sunny Day users.


Set Details
=========

With 252 Speed EVs, very few things are able to outspeed Exeggutor in the sun, letting it hit many Pokemon for heavy damage before they get a chance to strike back. 252 Special Attack EVs maximize its damage output. Life Orb lets Exeggutor deal massive damage without being locked into a move, allowing for more versatility.


Usage Tips
========

Exeggutor's main role with this set is to deal as much damage as it can, with or without the sun. Even though Exeggutor isn't entirely decimated by priority, some priority users, most notably Kangaskhan, can ruin Exeggutor's chances of sweeping. Try to take out these Pokemon before attempting a sweep with Exeggutor. If you run Sleep Powder over Sunny Day, be sure that you have a Pokemon dedicated solely to setting up sun, such as the Uxie or Liepard.

Team Options
========

If Exeggutor is unable to set up sun on its own, or you decide to run Sleep Powder over Sunny Day, it would be best to carry a Pokemon that can set up sun for it. Liepard and Volbeat both have access to Prankster Sunny Day, while Uxie can set up both sun and Stealth Rock, which is always beneficial to Exeggutor. It is recommended to have hard-hitting Pokemon such as Typhlosion and Victreebel that benefit from the sun, as both of these Pokemon are great when coupled with Exeggutor.


SubSeed
#######
name: SubSeed
move 1: Leech Seed
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Psychic
move 4: Sleep Powder / Giga Drain / Hidden Power Fire
ability: Harvest
item: Sitrus Berry
evs: 252 HP / 148 Def / 108 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

This particular set is designed to stall out threats. Leech Seed whittles away at the opposing Pokemon's health while letting Exeggutor recover any damage it takes over the course of the battle. Substitute lets Exeggutor reduce the amount of damage it takes, allowing it to stall out the opponent. Psychic gives Exeggutor a powerful STAB move for situations when it is unable to stall out the opponent with Leech Seed. The fourth slot is a choice between Giga Drain, Sleep Powder, and Hidden Power Fire. Giga Drain allows for more recovery on Exeggutor's part, while Sleep Powder lets it incapacitate an opposing Pokemon and stall it out while it's asleep. Hidden Power Fire is for coverage against Steel-types.


Set Details
========

With the given Speed EVs, Exeggutor is able to outspeed uninvested Lanturn. With maximum investment in HP, Exeggutor can take more hits. The HP stat also stays an even number, which allows the Sitrus Berry to kick in after two Substitutes. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense to allow Exeggutor to better combat Feraligatr and other physical attackers. Sitrus Berry takes advantage of Harvest, acting as a great source of recovery that is nearly infinite. A Bold nature allows Exeggutor to take even more physical hits and theoretically increase its longevity.


Usage Tips
========
The primary goal of this set is to whittle away at the opposing Pokemon's health while coming out with a respectable amount of HP. The first thing that should be done is set up a Substitute, as it allows Exeggutor to take any hit and set up a Leech Seed. If running Sleep Powder, the first priority might be to use that beforehand, as it will render a Pokemon useless while Exeggutor can set up a Substitute while they switch out. If you feel Exeggutor needs to be more specially defensive, switch the Defense EVs into Special Defense and switch the nature to Calm.

Team Options
========

Bulky Fairy-type Pokemon are extremely helpful to Exeggutor, as they are able to eat up most moves that are super effective against Exeggutor. Having a status absorber is also helpful to this set, as Exeggutor has no method of removing status. Alternatively, a cleric such as Togetic can be used, as it can easily switch in on most moves that would decimate Exeggutor and proceed to Heal Bell away any status. A Pokemon that can inflict status itself would also be great to have, as it can either assist in gradually whittling away at the opposing Pokemon's HP so that Exeggutor can better stall out opposing Pokemon or prevent a Pokemon from outspeeding Exeggutor. Miltank fits this role well, as it can paralyze or poison any other Pokemon. Having a bulky wall that works well with Exeggutor is ideal, as this keeps Exeggutor relatively healthy without having to sacrifice one of your Pokemon. Probopass works great in this role, as it can easily take Bug-type attacks and doesn't suffer too much from most Dark-type attacks. Exeggutor is able to switch in on the Water-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves that bother Probopass. Grounded Posion-types such as Muk and Garbodor are nice to have for Exeggutor, as they can absorb Toxic Spikes and hit the opposing team hard.


Other Options
########

Exeggutor has the potential to run a variety of various sets, such as a dual screens setter and a Wish passer. However, if you are looking for a strong variant of Exeggutor, you can easily give it a Choice Band, Wood Hammer, and Low Kick. You can swap Choice Specs for Choice Scarf to boost Exeggutor's Speed. However, you can also bluff a Choice item by instead giving Exeggutor a Miracle Seed to catch opponents off-guard. Exeggutor also works well with a Life Orb on a Trick Room team, as it is slow.


Checks & Counters
########

**Priority Attackers**: Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak easily counter the Chlorophyll set, as Exeggutor is not very bulky.

**Fast/Prankster Taunt**: Any fast Taunt user prevents SubSeed Exeggutor from setting up a Substitute or a Leech Seed. As such, Liepard is a great counter for the SubSeed set, as it can easily Taunt turn one, preventing any setup moves, and is immune to Exeggutor's STAB Psychic-type moves. However, against the offensive sets, Taunt is irrelevant.

**Xatu**: A great counter for either of the sets is Xatu, as Magic Bounce prevents the setup set from getting anywhere, and Xatu resists Chlorophyll Exeggutor's STAB moves and can easily dispose of any variant of Exeggutor with Heat Wave.

**Status Users**: If Exeggutor is not behind a Substitute, poison and paralysis are very crippling for it, as Exeggutor on its own has no form of removing such statuses. Toxic Spikes can often prove fatal for Exeggutor unless it is holding a Lum Berry.

**Steel-types**: If offensive Exeggutor does not carry Hidden Power Fire, Steel-types have a relatively easy time disposing of it as they resist both its STAB moves.

**Cryogonal**: While it would not want to switch directly into a hard-hitting move from Exeggutor, once Cryogonal is in safely it can use its powerful STAB Ice-type moves to either OHKO Exeggutor or force it out.
