Overview
########
Magmortar is a very powerful special wallbreaker in NU, with a very high Special Attack stat that allows it to muscle past very bulky Pokemon such as Audino. It also has a wide variety of coverage moves, such as Thunderbolt, Focus Blast, Earthquake, and Psychic, to hit its common switch-ins. It also has a great ability in Vital Spirit, giving Magmortar an immunity to sleep-inducing moves from the likes of Vivillon, Vileplume, and Jynx.

However, Magmortar faces a lot of competition as a Fire-type from Typhlosion and Pyroar; the former has a more reliable STAB move and the latter has better utility. Magmortar low Speed leaves it outsped by common threats such as Mismagius, Electivire, and Archeops. Magmortar is also susceptible to all forms of entry hazards, in particular Stealth Rock.

Moves
========
Fire Blast is Magmortar's most powerful special STAB move and deals massive damage to anything that does not resist it. Thunderbolt is used to hit Water- and Flying-types, such as Samurott, Pelipper, and Archeops, for super effective damage. Earthquake provides great coverage against Pokemon that can easily take the first two attacks, such as Lanturn, Dragalge, Flareon, and Probopass. Hidden Power Grass hits Rock- and Ground-types such as Seismitoad and Rhydon, while Focus Blast hits bulky Normal-types, such as Audino and Lickilicky, that can comfortably switch in on Magmortar's other attacks.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible, and maximum Speed investment is used to outspeed base 80 Pokemon. A Mild nature is chosen to bolster Magmortar's Special Attack while not taking away from Earthquake's damage output and preserve its better defense stat. Life Orb is used to give all of Magmortar's attacks a significant boost in power. An Expert Belt can be used to bluff a Choice item and not take recoil after each attack. A Hasty nature is an option to outspeed Adamant Sawk, Timid Mesprit, and opposing Magmortar.

Usage Tips
========

Magmortar is used best as a revenge killer against slower opponents, especially those lacking a priority attack. Double switches are beneficial to get Magmortar in safely to fire off an attack. Magmortar excels against slower teams, as it can break through many common defensive Pokemon with the proper coverage moves. Even though Magmortar has decent Special Defense, it is best to not let it take hits, because it already gets worn down quickly between entry hazard damage and Life Orb recoil.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support is very beneficial to Magmortar to wear down its switch-ins, and it helps Magmortar achieve feats such as a very high chance to OHKO Audino after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Garbodor, Qwilfish, and Crustle are all good teammates to set up entry hazards. Rapid Spin support is important to keep Magmortar healthy; Cryogonal, Kabutops, and Sandslash are all great partners for this position. Late-game cleaners that appreciate Magmortar's wallbreaking ability are also good teammates. Feraligatr, Lilligant, Swellow, and Mismagius are all good examples. Due to Magmortar's subpar Speed, Thunder Wave support from the likes of Liepard, Probopass, Uxie, or Qwilfish is appreciated to help Magmortar deal with faster threats.

Other Options
########

A Choice Scarf set can be used to catch some faster Pokemon off guard, but the power loss is significant. A set with Belly Drum and Mach Punch can be used, but it is fairly gimmicky and situational. Psychic is an option to hit Hariyama while still retaining coverage on Dragalge. Substitute can be used to take advantage of the various switches that Magmortar forces, but Magmortar generally needs as many coverage moves as possible.

Checks & Counters
########

**Faster Pokemon**: Due to its subpar Speed, Magmortar can be stopped by some NU's faster Pokemon, such as Archeops, Sawk, Electivire and Kangaskhan.

**Thick Fat Pokemon**: Thick Fat Pokemon such as Hariyama and Grumpig take little damage from Magmortars Fire-type attacks and are not weak to Magmortar's coverage moves. Hariyama can take any move Magmortar goes for and OHKO it with Close Combat after one round of Life Orb Recoil.

**Entry Hazards**: Magmortar is quickly worn down by entry hazards alongside Life Orb recoil, in particular Stealth Rock.

**Priority**: Due to Magmortar's poor Defense, it is susceptible to priority attacks from the likes of Kangaskhan, Feraligatr, Kabutops, Pawniard, and Gurdurr.
