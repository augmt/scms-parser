Overview
########

With its high Speed and Attack stats, Dodrio makes for a hard-hitting hole-puncher. Along with its powerful STAB attacks, Return and Brave Bird, it has access to the coveted Knock Off. However, it faces huge competition from other Normal-types, such as Kangaskhan, Swellow, and Zangoose, has low defenses, and is weak to Stealth Rock; it is also completely walled by Rock- and Steel-types.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Return
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Quick Attack
ability: Early Bird
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Brave Bird is Dodrio's main STAB move, hitting extremely hard with a Choice Band, while Return is the other STAB option that is a bit more reliable, as it doesn't deal recoil damage, and provides decent coverage. Knock Off is one of the only reasons to use Dodrio, as it is a powerful attack and utility move that removes threatening opponents' items, such as Rhydon's Eviolite, as well as hitting Rotom for super effective damage. Lastly, Quick Attack can be used as a hard-hitting priority move to finish off faster, weakened Pokemon.

Set Details
========

The EVs used maximize Dodrio's Attack and Speed, its best and most important stats. Choice Band is the best item to give Dodrio, letting it act as a wallbreaker and clean through teams with its extremely powerful STAB attacks. A Jolly nature lets Dodrio outspeed or Speed tie with relevant Pokemon, such as Rotom, Jynx, Xatu, Typhlosion, Ninetales, Kangaskhan, and Electivire. However, an Adamant nature can be used to hit harder and still lets Dodrio outspeed Jolly-natured base 85 Speed Pokemon such as Sawk. It can also get important OHKOs on Pokemon such as Mesprit and Dragon Dance Feraligatr. Early Bird is the only ability worth using, and allows Dodrio to wake up quickly if it's ever put to sleep.

Usage Tips
========

Try to remove entry hazards for Dodrio, as it does not appreciate taking Stealth Rock damage. Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon should be removed beforehand so that Dodrio can have an easier time picking off the opponent's Pokemon. Dodrio's most powerful move is Brave Bird; hence, it should be used most of the time. Return is a more reliable STAB move, and should be used whenever Brave Bird's recoil is not wanted. Always predict switch-ins, and use Knock Off to cripple Pokemon such as Rhydon and Rotom, as Dodrio does not want to be caught off guard and helpless. Use Dodrio mid- to late-game for best results, as you'll want Dodrio as a hole-puncher and revenge killer that can easily take out slower opponents.

Team Options
========

Steel-types such as Steelix and Pawniard make for good teammates, as they can beat threatening Rock- and Ice-type Pokemon for Dodrio. Additionally, Steelix can set up Stealth Rock, and Dodrio appreciates its ability to wear down Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon. Ground-types work especially well with Dodrio, as they are able to take out Electric-, Steel-, and Rock-types, which are Dodrio's main counters, with great ease. Additionally, Ground-types appreciate Dodrio's ability to take out Grass-types. Sandslash is one of Dodrio's best teammates, as it can also Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock, which Dodrio dislikes. Water-type Pokemon such as Feraligatr and Gorebyss that can set up on Steel- and Rock-types are good teammates, as they can eliminate Dodrio's biggest threats. In particular, Kabutops and Swanna make for good teammates, as they can help prevent Dodrio from taking Stealth Rock damage with Rapid Spin and Defog, respectively. Finally, Guts users such as Gurdurr and Hariyama make for good teammates, as they can absorb status, and can beat Steel- and Rock-types that give Dodrio trouble.

Other Options
########

Dodrio has quite a varied movepool that includes support moves, boosting moves, and even reliable recovery. Agility can be used to allow Dodrio to outspeed any unboosted threat, though such a set would miss the sheer power of Choice Band. Baton Pass can be used if Dodrio uses boosting moves such as Acupressure or Agility. Taunt can be used to effectively stop walls, but Dodrio is too frail to utilize it properly. Pursuit can be used to catch Pokemon switching out off guard, but Knock Off is usually the superior choice. Roost can be used for a reliable source of recovery, but Dodrio would almost always rather just punch holes in its opponents. Dodrio can use some other items effectively. A Life Orb can be used to hit almost as hard as Choice Band, while allowing it to switch moves. Its recoil, however, is almost always detrimental for Dodrio. Finally, a Choice Scarf set can be used as a revenge killer, but that role is typically done better by other Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom and Pyroar.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Bastiodon, Probopass, Steelix, and Klinklang can all switch in on Dodrio, and take relatively little damage from any of its moves. Bastiodon and Probopass can status it and wear it down, while Steelix can quickly take it out with an attacking move. Additionally, Klinklang can even render it setup bait, and proceed to sweep.

**Rock-types**: Rock-types such as Kabutops, Carracosta, Regirock, Rhydon, and Golem can switch into and tank any of Dodrio's attacks. Carracosta can use Dodrio as setup bait, while the other three can either set up Stealth Rock or quickly dispose of it with a STAB Rock-type move. Kabutops and Golem cannot switch in too many times, however, as they are worn down quite easily.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon such as Archeops, Swellow, Scarf Typhlosion, Choice Scarf Rotom, and Sneasel can all outspeed Dodrio and easily revenge kill it with their hard-hitting respective STAB moves. They cannot switch in most of the time, however, as they take loads of damage from Dodrio's attacks.

**Status**: Burns from Pokemon such as Weezing, paralysis from Pokemon such as Lanturn and Granbull, and poison from any walls all hinder Dodrio, halving its Attack, drastically cutting its Speed, and wearing it down gradually, respectively.
