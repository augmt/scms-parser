Overview
######

Golurk hits a variety of threats hard thanks to its base 124 Attack and good coverage, which let it function as an effective wallbreaker with Choice Band. Aside from that, its natural bulk allows it to tank some hits and play the role of a bulky, offensive Stealth Rock setter. Golurk is the only spinblocker that can use Stealth Rock in NU. It is also one of the few Pokemon that can effectively use a physical Ghost-type move, namely Shadow Punch, which is boosted by Iron Fist. Golurk's Speed is terrible, so watch out for faster threats. It's weak to a lot of different types as well and lacks reliable recovery, so Golurk is not that hard to overwhelm.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Shadow Punch
move 3: Ice Punch
move 4: Drain Punch
ability: Iron Fist
item: Choice Band
evs: 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Earthquake is the most powerful attacking option; Golurk gets STAB from the attack and hits almost anything really hard. It also has access to Shadow Punch, which is a STAB move that is boosted by Iron Fist and grants coverage against common Pokemon with Levitate, such as Mesprit and Mismagius. Ice Punch is used to hit Grass- and Flying-types very hard. Drain Punch offers coverage against a lot of types, including the Dark-types that Golurk is weak to.

Set Details
========

Investing 136 EVs in Speed allows Golurk to outspeed everything up to Adamant Sawk if Sticky Web is up. This also includes Adamant Feraligatr, Timid Samurott, Timid Ludicolo, and Modest Magmortar. Jolly Carracosta is an example of a Pokemon that can be outrun without Sticky Web. 252 Attack EVs, Choice Band, and a boosting nature gives Golurk the ability to deal a lot of damage, even to Pokemon that resist its attacks.

Usage Tips
========

Send in Golurk when one of its teammates has just been KOed, or use it as an anti-lead to stop setup. Golurk also makes for a good switch-in option to some Pokemon thanks to its three immunities. Double switching to get free switch-ins against slower Pokemon isn't very hard, and this is a great way to steal back momentum.

Team Options
========

Pokemon with Sticky Web or Thunder Wave are great teammates; Golurk has terrible Speed, and when Sticky Web or Thunder Wave support is present, it is able to take advantage of the foe's lowered Speed and get the first attack in. Pokemon that can take out Water-types that threaten Golurk, such as Ludicolo, Ferroseed, and Meganium, are good partners. Examples of other good teammates are Gurdurr and Lilligant; Gurdurr beats up Dark-types, while Lilligant can set up on Water-types. Ice- and Fire-types such as Jynx and Magmortar will be good too, because they can take care of Flying- and Bug-types respectively, as well as Grass-types, since most of them resist Earthquake. Pokemon that set entry hazards also make great teammates, such as Garbodor, Crustle, and Qwilfish, because Golurk is a spinblocker.

Stealth Rock
########
name: Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Shadow Punch
move 4: Ice Punch / Fire Punch / Drain Punch
ability: Iron Fist
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Stealth Rock effectively negates the effect of Sturdy and Focus Sash, and it can also inflict a hefty chunk of damage against Pokemon with a weakness to Rock on the switch. Earthquake is Golurk's main STAB move, dealing a ton of damage to pretty much any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Shadow Punch a secondary STAB option boosted by Iron Fist and deals heavy damage to Psychic-types and several Levitate users such as Mesprit, Haunter, and Xatu. Ice Punch is boosted by Iron Fist and is a great option for coverage. Fire Punch grants coverage against Grass- and Ice-type Pokemon which Golurk is weak to, and it gets a boost from Iron Fist as well, 2HKOing defensive Vileplume and Ferroseed. Drain Punch covers Dark-types and gives Golurk a form of recovery.

Set Details
========

252 HP EVs add to Golurk's impressive natural bulk. 252 Attack EVs in combination with the Adamant nature allow Golurk to hit very hard, even against physically defensive Pokemon. Iron Fist powers up most of Golurk's punching moves. Leftovers gives Golurk some passive recovery and boosts its longevity. However, a No Guard set with Dynamic Punch and Stone Edge can be used to mess with opposing Stealth Rock leads and force switches. A physically defensive EV spread can be used in combination with an Impish nature to stop offensive Normal-types such as Zangoose, Ursaring, and Tauros. Colbur Berry can be really good to lure in Dark-types and makes Golurk a great check to Zangoose, which is really hard to come by.

Usage Tips
========

This set is best used as a lead that sets up Stealth Rock early-game to punish switches. Golurk's three immunities and ability to force out certain threats with its power also give it multiple opportunities to switch in and set up the entry hazard. Switching Golurk into Rapid Spin is also good; it prevents the opponent from removing your entry hazards from the field.

Team Options
========

Fire-types that can switch into Will-O-Wisp are good teammates; they can also help deal with Grass-types if Golurk runs Drain Punch in the last moveslot. Pokemon such as Hariyama or Granbull that can switch into Knock Off also work well; a Knock Off can easily KO Golurk. In addition, anything that can set up more hazards works great, because this way you rack up even more entry hazard damage on opponents. Pokemon that take advantage of common switch-ins such as Feraligatr and Samurott are also handy.

Other Options
########

Assault Vest can be used on Golurk for more special bulk, but it only allows the use of damaging moves, so it can't set up Stealth Rock. However, this set can't wallbreak and is far outclassed by the Choice Band set. Thunder Punch grants coverage against Water-types (especially Pelipper) and gets boosted by Iron Fist. Rock Polish is an option to boost up Golurk's Speed in an attempt to sweep. Yache or Passho Berry can be used to halve the damage done by Ice- or Water-type moves, respectively. Protect is decent for scouting out the opponent, and Magic Coat is a good option to bounce back Will-O-Wisp and opposing entry hazards.

Checks & Counters
#######

**Physically Bulky Pokemon**: Pokemon such as Weezing and Tangela can take Golurk's hits well and simply stall it out or kill it directly.

**Will-O-Wisp**: Will-O-Wisp is threatening to Golurk, as it lowers Golurk's Attack stat and whittles its HP down.

**Fast, Offensive Pokemon**: Faster, offensive Pokemon with super effective attacks, such as Lilligant and Cryogonal, can quickly get rid of Golurk by KOing it with their STAB attacks. However, they must watch out for Golurk's powerful coverage attacks.
