Overview
########

Uxie has good defensive stats that allow it to pull off both specially and physically defensive spreads, meaning that it can wall significant portions of the metagame. It has good base Speed for a defensive utility Pokemon, which means it can outspeed Pokemon it is walling and use a utility move or threaten them out with an attack. Uxie is extremely versatile, being able to run multiple viable sets; this versatility leads to unpredictability and allows Uxie to fulfill multiple roles on any given team. Its versatility stems from its access to multiple support moves such as Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, Memento, weather moves, and dual screens. However, Uxie has mediocre offensive stats and is largely outclassed by Mesprit in any offensive role; the only good offensive set that Uxie can pull off is a bulky Calm Mind set.

Defensive Utility
########
name: Defensive Utility
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Thunder Wave
move 3: Psychic
move 4: U-turn
ability: Levitate
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Relaxed

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is for chip damage, to break Focus Sashes, and to check Fire- and Flying-types. Thunder Wave is good for crippling fast Pokemon and is a general nuisance to opposing teams. Psychic is a good STAB move for when Uxie needs to stay in and attack. U-turn is for gaining momentum and allows Uxie to function as a bulky pivot. Heal Bell is an option to remove status from Uxie and its teammates, while Knock Off is a good utility move that removes important items such as Leftovers or Choice items. Yawn can be used to force switches and gain momentum with U-turn, or to put a Pokemon to sleep.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP and Defense EVs let Uxie take as many physical hits as possible. A Relaxed nature further increases Uxie's Defense, allows for slower U-turns, and doesn't decrease the power of either of its attacks. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Sassy nature can be used to let Uxie take as many special hits as possible. Leftovers is used for increased longevity, and Levitate is Uxie's only ability, allowing it to avoid Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web.

Usage Tips
========

Uxie can function as a lead, setting up Stealth Rock and then U-turning out into an appropriate Pokemon to gain momentum. Use Thunder Wave on fast offensive threats to make them easier for the rest of your team to deal with. Uxie can also be used as a pivot, switching in, taking a hit, and then U-turning out into an appropriate check or counter. Be wary of switching in multiple times, as Uxie has no reliable recovery and gets worn down fairly easily through multiple hits.

Team Options
========

Spikes setters such as Ferroseed, Quilladin, and Qwilfish can set up Spikes alongside Uxie's Stealth Rock. Spinblockers such as Gourgeist-S and Mismagius prevent the opponent from spinning away Stealth Rock and Spikes. Wish users such as Lickilicky and Audino are good teammates for Uxie, as they can pass Wishes to Uxie, solving its lack of reliable recovery.

Substitute + Calm Mind
########
name: Substitute + Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Psyshock
move 4: Giga Drain
ability: Levitate
item: Leftovers
evs: 184 HP / 64 Def / 36 SpA / 224 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Calm Mind boosts Special Defense and Special Attack, allowing Uxie to become both bulky and strong. Substitute is used to dodge status, and Uxie's Substitute can occasionally take multiple hits before breaking, increasing Uxie's longevity. Psyshock is a STAB move that inflicts physical damage, allowing Uxie to beat Pokemon that try to set up Calm Mind boosts alongside it. Giga Drain provides good neutral coverage, while giving Uxie a way to recover HP that is faster than the passive recovery of Leftovers. Dazzling Gleam is a good coverage move, providing Uxie with perfect neutral coverage except against Steel-types. Thunderbolt allows for neutral coverage against Steel-types, while Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Steel-types harder, especially Ferroseed.

Set Details
========

184 HP EVs and 64 Defense EVs let Uxie's Substitute take a Knock Off from Audino and Gyro Ball from Ferroseed without breaking, while also providing a Leftovers number. 224 Speed EVs with a Timid nature let Uxie outspeed max Speed Rotom and other base 90 Speed Pokemon. 36 Special Attack EVs give Uxie a chance to 2HKO Feraligatr with Giga Drain. Alternatively, a spread of 184 HP / 48 Def / 100 SpA / 176 Speed with a Timid nature can be used so that Uxie can outspeed and OHKO Jolly Choice Band Sawk at +1 with Psyshock, while still preventing Audino from breaking Uxie's Substitute with Knock Off.

Usage Tips
========

Uxie should be brought in against Pokemon that cannot break its Substitute, such as Audino and other defensive Pokemon. Against more offensive teams, Uxie should be brought in late-game to set up against a Pokemon that cannot do much to it. Try to get at least three Calm Mind boosts before attempting a sweep, because Uxie's stopping power is pretty low without any boosts. Watch out for status, as it will decrease Uxie's longevity; use Substitute on a predicted status move to create a free turn for Uxie to start setting up. Avoid Knock Off, as Uxie needs its Leftovers to recover health while setting up. Uxie can regain health with Giga Drain when it is ready to sweep.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard setters such as Accelgor and Crustle help to limit the opponent's switches and can allow Uxie to set up a sweep earlier against weakened opponents. Clerics such as Audino and Vileplume make good teammates for Uxie, as they can remove any unwanted status from Uxie. Uxie appreciates Knock Off absorbers such as Granbull and Slurpuff, as the removal of Leftovers is detrimental to Uxie's ability to sweep.

Dual Screens
########
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Memento
move 4: U-turn / Stealth Rock
ability: Levitate
item: Light Clay
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

With Light Clay, Reflect reduces the amount of damage received from physical moves for eight turns; this helps to minimize damage dealt to teammates from physical attackers, increasing longevity and allowing various Pokemon to set up. Similarly, with Light Clay, Light Screen reduces the amount of damage received from special moves for eight turns. Memento reduces the foe's Attack and Special Attack by two stages and also knocks Uxie out, preventing the opponent from using Defog to remove the screens it has just set up. U-turn is useful for gaining momentum after setting up screens and can allow Uxie to set up screens later on in the match. Stealth Rock can be used for chip damage and for breaking Focus Sashes and Sturdy.

Set Details
========
The standard defensive spread of maximum investment in HP and Defense allows Uxie to take as many physical hits as possible. A Bold nature further increases Uxie's Defense, and Light Clay is used to increase the length of screens time from five turns to eight turns.

Usage Tips
========

Dual Screens should be set up early on in the game; if Uxie is running Stealth Rock, make sure to set up screens first to minimize the damage that Uxie takes while setting up. If Uxie is still above 60% health after setting up screens, U-turn out into a sweeper or an appropriate check; however, if Uxie is below 40% health, use Memento, send out a sweeper, and begin setting up. If a Pokemon that has Defog switches in, such as Pelipper, Mantine, or Swanna, use Memento on it to prevent it from using Defog on Uxie. Then send out a Pokemon that threatens the Defog user or can set up on it; the opponent will be forced to choose whether to use Defog or to switch out.

Team Options
========

Setup sweepers such as Belly Drum Slurpuff and Swords Dance Feraligatr appreciate the extra turns to set up that Uxie creates with dual screens and Memento. If Uxie is not running Stealth Rock, entry hazard setters such as Crustle and Accelgor provide chip damage and break Focus Sashes and Sturdy, making it easier for sweepers to do their job.

Weather Setter
########
name: Weather Setter
move 1: Sunny Day / Rain Dance
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Memento
move 4: U-turn / Psychic
ability: Levitate
item: Heat Rock / Damp Rock
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Sunny Day allows sun abusers to sweep, while Rain Dance allows rain sweepers to sweep. Stealth Rock is used for chip damage and to break Focus Sashes and Sturdy. Memento is used to gain momentum after setting up weather and Stealth Rock, but it knocks Uxie out. U-turn acts similarly to Memento, but it allows Uxie to possibly set up weather later on in the match. Psychic is a STAB move if Uxie should need to attack.

Set Details
========

The standard defensive spread of 252 HP EVs, 252 Defense EVs, and an Impish nature allows Uxie to take as many physical hits as possible. Heat Rock and Damp Rock increase the length of their respective weather from five turns to eight turns.

Usage Tips
========

Uxie should set up Stealth Rock on the first turn and weather on the second turn. After setting up weather, Uxie should use U-turn if above 60% health so as to allow it to possibly set up weather again late-game, or Memento if low on health to gain momentum for a weather sweeper.

Team Options
========

Teammates for Rain Dance Uxie include alternate rain setters such as Liepard for priority weather late-game, and rain sweepers such as Ludicolo, Gorebyss, and Seismitoad. When Uxie is placed in a sun team, its teammates should include an alternate weather setter such as Liepard or Volbeat for priority weather late-game, and sun sweepers such as Victreebel, Typhlosion, Sawsbuck, and Pyroar.

Other Options
########

Other options for Uxie include running a Trick set with either Choice Band, Choice Scarf, or Choice Specs. Uxie can also run offensive sets with the aforementioned Choice items; however, these sets are largely outclassed by Mesprit. Foul Play can be used on defensive sets as a way to prevent physically offensive Pokemon such as Feraligatr from setting up on Uxie. Magic Coat can be used to bounce back an opposing team's entry hazards and statuses. A ChestoRest set can be used for recovery; however, Uxie struggles to find room for Rest and loses out on the passive recovery of Leftovers. Toxic and Yawn are other status options that can be used over Thunder Wave; Yawn can force switches or put an opposing Pokemon to sleep, while Toxic can quickly wear down opposing walls. Uxie can be used as a Trick Room setter with Memento and Stealth Rock. An anti-lead set with Power Herb and Solar Beam can be used to lure in and KO opposing Stealth Rock setters such as Seismitoad and Rhydon.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dark-types**: Dark-type Pokemon such as Liepard, Pawniard, and Sneasel can threaten Uxie with a powerful Knock Off, removing its Leftovers and dealing massive amounts of damage to it. Liepard can Encore Uxie into a utility move and U-turn out, providing momentum for the opposing team. Pawniard can set up on Uxie, gain a +2 Attack boost thanks to Defiant if Uxie tries to use Memento on it, and hurt it with a STAB Knock Off; however, Pawniard does not appreciate taking a U-turn. Sneasel can seriously injure Uxie with Knock Off or trap it with Pursuit.

**Taunt**: Faster Taunt users such as Archeops, Mismagius, and Liepard can all prevent Uxie from doing its job; however, they must already be on the field to prevent Uxie from using one utility move.

**Status**: Uxie has no form of reliable recovery, so status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Toxic wear it down quickly. Many Pokemon that Uxie likes to switch in on, such as Vileplume, Dragalge, Garbodor, and Qwifish, can all inflict status on Uxie, quickly wearing it down.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-type Pokemon such as Mismagius and Golurk can hurt Uxie with their STAB moves. Mismagius can Taunt Uxie to prevent it from using any of its utility options, and proceed to use Nasty Plot and threaten to KO Uxie with Shadow Ball. Golurk is immune to Thunder Wave and can either hit Uxie hard with a STAB Shadow Punch or set up Stealth Rock on the switch.
