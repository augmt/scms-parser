Overview
########

Roselia has many useful qualities and is a good choice for teams in need of a Spikes user. It has good Special Attack and Special Defense backed up with a great defensive typing. It also has access to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes. It can also absorb Toxic Spikes and act as a great status absorber thanks to its ability, Natural Cure. However, Roselia is very dependent on Eviolite, and Knock Off users are very common in the metagame. It also has a poor Defense stat, and is overshadowed by Vileplume, which sports higher offensive stats.


Utility
########
name: Utility
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Sludge Bomb
move 4: Rest / Synthesis
ability: Natural Cure
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Calm


Moves
========

Roselia can set up Spikes easily thanks to its good defensive typing. Toxic Spikes can also be used in this slot, as on stall teams, it is very valuable. Giga Drain is a great STAB move, allowing Roselia to deal decent damage as well as recover a bit of HP. Sludge Bomb provides great neutral coverage alongside Giga Drain and serves as the secondary STAB attack. The last move is a toss-up. Rest allows Roselia to regain all of its HP, and thanks to Natural Cure, it can wake up by switching out. However, Synthesis can also be used to regain HP in a single turn without needing to worry about sleep, though its PP is lacking.


Set Details
========

The given EV spread maximizes Roselia's ability to take most special attacks. Eviolite is the only item that should be used, as it boosts Roselia's decent bulk to higher levels. A Calm nature is used to allow Roselia to take on special attacks even better.


Usage Tips
========

Try not to switch Roselia into Knock Off users, as losing Eviolite will hinder its defensive capabilities greatly, and because of Roselia's poor Defense stat, try not to switch Roselia into super effective physical attacks as they will have a high chance of OHKOing it. In addition, try to use Rest or Synthesis sparingly, as against defensive teams, the recovery will be very valuable. Use Spikes often when you have the chance, as Roselia can wall most special attackers and cause switches.


Team Options
========

Bulky Water-types such as Poliwrath and Seismitoad are great partners because they have good defensive synergy with Roselia, and they can switch into Fire-type attacks aimed at it, and in return, Roselia can switch into the Grass-type moves directed at them. In addition, Pokemon with high Defense such as Steelix, which can also set up Stealth Rock, make great partners because they can switch into the physical attacks that Roselia has trouble taking. Wish passers such as Audino and Lickilicky are great partners because they can increase Roselia's longevity without it needing to use Rest or Synthesis as often as it otherwise would. Pokemon that appreciate Spikes to secure certain KOs such as Feraligatr, Calm Mind Spiritomb, and Mespirit make great partners.


Other Options
########

Sleep Powder allows Roselia to put a foe to sleep and render it setup fodder. Toxic Spikes can be used instead of Spikes to cause residual damage, though Poison-types such as Vileplume and Qwilfish can quickly remove them by switching in. An offensive set can be used as well, though it is highly outclassed by Vileplume, which sports higher Special Attack. Likewise, a physically defensive set of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD can also be used to wall more physical attackers, but it isn't as effective. Aromatherapy can be used to cure status for Roselia's team. Roselia can also use a lead set with max Speed EVs with Focus Sash and Spikes, though it is somewhat outclassed by other options, such as Crustle, which has Sturdy, Qwilfish, which has Taunt and is faster, and Omastar, which has access to Stealth Rock and Spikes.


Checks &amp; Counters
########

**Steel-types** Steel-types such as Pawniard and Ferroseed can cause a lot of trouble for Roselia as they resist both of its STAB moves. The former can set up Swords Dance, while the latter resists both of Roselia's STAB moves and can set up entry hazards alongside it.

**Poison-types** Poison-types such as Weezing and Dragalge resist both of Roselia's STAB attacks and can wear it down.

**Cryogonal** Cryogonal can threaten Roselia with its Ice-type STAB moves or remove all the entry hazards Roselia may have set with Rapid Spin, and can switch into Roselia with ease thanks to its high Special Defense.

**Knock Off** Knock Off users can remove Roselia's Eviolite, permanently hindering its ability to take hits.

**Xatu** Xatu can use its ability, Magic Bounce, to deflect Spikes that Roselia tries to set up or force it out with its STAB attacks, though it takes a lot of damage from Sludge Bomb on the switch.

**Powerful Physical Attackers** Powerful physical attackers such as Zangoose and Sawk can target Roselia's poor Defense and hurt it a lot.

**Fire-types** Fire-types such as Pyroar and Magmortar can force Roselia out with their powerful STAB attacks.
