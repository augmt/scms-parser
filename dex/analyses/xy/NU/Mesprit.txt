Overview
########

Mesprit is the most versatile Pokemon in NU thanks to its outstanding movepool both offensively and supportively backed by solid all-around stats. It can be used for many roles, such as a wallbreaker with Life Orb, Choice Band, or Choice Specs, a revenge killer with Choice Scarf, and a win condition with Calm Mind. Mesprit also provides invaluable team support with Stealth Rock and Healing Wish, the latter of which can heal a weakened teammate and give them another chance to break through the opposing team. Unfortunately, Mesprit's pure Psychic typing provides few resistances as well as weaknesses to common attacking types such as Dark, Bug, and Ghost. Mesprit is also fairly slow for an offensive Pokemon, which is problematic in a tier crowded with fast attackers. Despite Mesprit's wide coverage movepool, it struggles immensely with fitting the best four moves into its moveset.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Psychic / Psyshock
move 2: Signal Beam 
move 3: Hidden Power Fire / Energy Ball
move 4: Healing Wish / Calm Mind
ability: Levitate
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========

Psychic is a strong STAB move that hits anything that does not resist it for significant damage. However, Psyshock is useful to hit specially bulky Pokemon, such as Hariyama and Cryogonal, and is useful in Calm Mind wars. Signal Beam provides very useful coverage against Dark- and Psychic-types such as Malamar, Liepard, Cacturne, Sneasel, Uxie, and Musharna. Signal Beam is also useful in Calm Mind wars, as it hits most Calm Mind users for super effective damage and is quite powerful after a boost. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types such as Ferroseed, Pawniard, and Klinklang for solid damage. Alternately, Energy Ball targets bulky Ground- and Water-types such as Rhydon and Seismitoad. Healing Wish restores a weakened teammate and is particularly useful to give setup sweepers another chance to sweep. Alternatively, Calm Mind boosts Mesprit's Special Attack and Special Defense to high levels, giving it an easier time breaking through bulky Pokemon. Ice Beam and Thunderbolt can be used to hit Flying-types such as Scyther and Xatu, as well as Torterra in the former's case and Mantine in the latter's case. Their better neutral coverage compared to Energy Ball make them solid alternatives when running Calm Mind.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread maximizes Mesprit's Speed and offensive presence. A Modest nature gives a significant boost in power, notably allowing Mesprit to 2HKO non-Mega Audino with Psyshock 70% of the time after Stealth Rock damage. However, a Timid nature allows Mesprit to outspeed opposing neutral-natured Mesprit, Adamant Zangoose, and Adamant Kangaskhan. Life Orb provides additional power, but other items, such as Lum Berry to avoid a status condition once or Leftovers for longevity, are solid choices if using Calm Mind.

Usage Tips
========

Mesprit is best used as an early-game wallbreaker thanks to its amazing coverage and high Special Attack. Correct prediction when utilizing Mesprit's coverage moves is key to wallbreaking when in situtations such as hitting Malamar with Signal Beam or Ferroseed with Hidden Power Fire on the switch. Try to set up entry hazards as soon as possible, especially if using Calm Mind, to help wear down defensive Pokemon for a sweep. Mesprit should avoid unnecessary damage and status conditions, as it already gets worn down fairly quickly between Stealth Rock damage and Life Orb recoil. The best use of Healing Wish can often vary from matchup to matchup. Most often, it should be used to heal a setup sweeper mid- or late-game, giving it a second chance to sweep. Alternatively, it can be helpful to heal a Choice Scarf user to clean up versus offensively-based teams or to save a teammate that would otherwise faint from entry hazard damage.

Team Options
========

Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Hariyama are great teammates for Mesprit because they put immense pressure on Dark-types, which are problematic for Mesprit especially if it is not running Signal Beam. Setup sweepers such as Lilligant, Samurott, Mismagius, Sneasel, and Ninetales greatly appreciate Healing Wish support from Mesprit to give them a second chance to break holes in the opposing team. Fast special attackers such as Pyroar and Lilligant pair well with Calm Mind sets, as they appreciate Mesprit's wallbreaking ability.

Stealth Rock
########
name: Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Healing Wish / U-turn
move 3: Psychic / Psyshock
move 4: Signal Beam / Energy Ball
ability: Levitate
item: Leftovers / Colbur Berry
evs: 92 HP / 252 SpA / 164 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is essential for every team, and Mesprit finds many opportunities to set it up thanks to its solid offensive presence and bulk. Healing Wish is another excellent support move that restores teammates, which is particularly helpful for setup sweepers. Alternatively, U-turn can be used to pivot out on a predicted switch and maintain offensive momentum. Psychic is preferred for Mesprit's STAB move for its higher power, but Psyshock hits specially bulky Pokemon such as Cryogonal and Hariyama significantly harder. Signal Beam targets Psychic- and Dark-types, such as Musharna, Exeggutor, opposing Mesprit, Sneasel, Liepard, and Malamar. On the other hand, Energy Ball hits opposing entry hazard setters such as Seismitoad, Sandslash, and Rhydon. Ice Beam hits Xatu and Torterra and is very helpful for luring in the former as it is a common switch-in for Mesprit. Future Sight is an alternate STAB move that hits significantly harder than Psychic and Psyshock and is helpful to lure in Dark-types for teammates.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread with a Timid nature maximizes Mesprit's offensive presence while allowing it to outspeed neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon such as opposing Mesprit. Another EV spread of 80 HP / 252 SpA / 176 Spe with a Modest nature can be used to outspeed neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Samurott and Ludicolo. You can use maximum Special Attack and Speed investment as well, but the extra bulk is often very helpful. Leftovers provides passive recovery, while a Colbur Berry can be used to soften up a Dark-type attack, particularly Knock Off, as it activates before being removed. Life Orb can be used for more power alongside a spread of maximum Special Attack and Speed.

Usage Tips
========

Mesprit's main goal is to get up Stealth Rock whenever it can. Considering Mesprit's typing and coverage, which give it a good matchup versus most entry hazard setters, it can lead fairly well. Try to keep Mesprit alive for a while, as it is pretty resilient and can set up Stealth Rock a few times in the match if necessary. Mesprit's moderately slow U-turn against fast Pokemon is also nice for offensive teams to get a wallbreaker in safely. The usage of Healing Wish can be tricky to figure out depending on the situation. In most cases, it is best to revive a setup sweeper to give it a second chance to sweep, but it can also be helpful to bring back a Choice Scarf user to clean up against an offensive team. Healing Wish is also useful to revive a teammate that would otherwise faint to entry hazards.

Team Options
========

Garbodor and Crustle are great partners for Mesprit to form an entry hazard-stacking core, as their Spikes and Toxic Spikes work alongside Mesprit's Stealth Rock to wear away at opposing teams. In addition, Garbodor resists Bug-type attacks for Mesprit and tends to lure in Psychic- and Ground-types that Mesprit can set up on or attack. Zangoose and Swellow are also great teammates, as they appreciate entry hazard support from Mesprit as well as the slow U-turn to get their status Orbs activated. Choice Specs Swellow can lure in and defeat or severely weaken Steel-types such as Klinklang with a powerful Heat Wave, which is very helpful for Mesprit. As with most Psychic-types, bulky Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Gurdurr are solid teammates to handle Dark-types such as Sneasel, Pawniard, and Liepard.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Zen Headbutt
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Healing Wish / Trick
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Zen Headbutt is a strong STAB move that has a chance to flinch opposing Pokemon. U-turn is used for gaining momentum, and allows Mesprit to pivot. Knock Off is a good utility move, removing items and hitting opposing Psychic-type Pokemon hard. Healing Wish is used when Mesprit is about to faint to fully heal a teammate; it is also good to note that entry hazard damage is applied after the Pokemon is fully healed. Trick can be used instead to cripple defensive walls that Mesprit might not be able to break past. Fire Punch can be used to 2HKO defensive Ferroseed.

Set Details
========

The standard offensive spread of maximum Attack and maximum Speed is used. Levitate is Mesprit's only ability, allowing it to avoid Ground-type attacks, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web. An Adamant nature is used to give Mesprit a higher Attack stat, as Choice Scarf already allows Mesprit to outspeed most relevant threats; alternatively, a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Sawk.

Usage Tips
========

Mesprit should be brought in against weakened opponents to revenge kill them. It can also be used as a pivot, coming in and forcing out an opposing Pokemon and then U-turning into an appropriate check or counter. U-turn is best used early-game when walls are still healthy; check to see if Mesprit can 2HKO a physical wall with Zen Headbutt before using U-turn. Use Trick to cripple defensive walls coming in to counter Mesprit; also use Trick if against a more defensive team, as being able to switch moves is much more beneficial if you don't have to outspeed anything. This set requires a bit of prediction: if the opponent has a physical wall, use either Knock Off or the appropriate coverage move predicting the physical wall to come in. If running Healing Wish's recovery, Mesprit's teammates can play more aggressively, as they have Healing Wish support to fall back on if they get injured.

Team Options
========

Bulky Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Gurdurr as well as Fairy-types such as Granbull make for good teammates, as they resist Dark-type moves which Mesprit is weak to. Entry hazard setters such as Crustle, Cacturne, and Garbodor tend to bait in in other Psychic-types, allowing Mesprit a free switch so it can force them out with a powerful Knock Off or U-turn. Priority users such as Pawniard, Kangaskhan, Gurdurr, and Samurott can be used to check Pokemon that outspeed Mesprit after a boost, such as Shell Smash users, Quiver Dance users, and Rock Polish users. Seismitoad, Poliwrath, Gourgeist-Super, and Encore Liepard are recommended, as Shell Smash users such as Barbaracle and Gorebyss still outspeed Choice Scarf Mesprit after a boost.

Special Scarf
########
name: Special Scarf
move 1: Psychic / Psyshock
move 2: Thunderbolt / Signal Beam
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Healing Wish / Trick
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Spa / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Psychic is a powerful STAB move that hits Pokemon with weaker Special Defense, such as Gurdurr, Garbodor, and Mawile, harder than Psyshock. Psyshock is a slightly weaker STAB move that hits Pokemon with lower Defense, such as Hariyama and Cryogonal, harder than Psychic. Thunderbolt hits Flying- and Water-type Pokemon that commonly look to switch into Mesprit, such as Xatu and Mantine. Thunderbolt is also useful for picking off fast threats, such as Archeops and Swellow, which Mesprit outspeeds with Choice Scarf. Signal Beam hits opposing Dark-type Pokemon such as Liepard and Malamar for super effective damage. U-turn is great for revenge killing weakened Pokemon and nabbing momentum when the foe switches out. Healing Wish is a great move for bringing a weakened teammate back to full HP late-game. Trick can cripple bulky support Pokemon such as Mantine and Regirock. Ice Beam hits targets similar to those of Thunderbolt but trades the ability to hit Water-types for the ability to hit Grass-types such as Lilligant and Exeggutor. Energy Ball is a more niche option, as it specifically hits Pokemon that are 4x weak to it, such as Seismitoad and Rhydon. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Steel-type Pokemon that give Mesprit trouble, such as Pawniard and Ferroseed.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment gives Mesprit the ability to outpace a good portion of the tier with Choice Scarf and still hit relatively hard. Thanks to Choice Scarf, Mesprit acts as a great revenge killer, outpacing fast threats such as Swellow and Archeops. A Timid nature allows Mesprit to outpace threats with Speed boosts such as Chlorophyll Exeggutor, Shell Smash Crustle, Rock Polish Rhydon, and neutral-natured Choice Scarf Sawk and Lilligant; however, a Modest nature can be used if more power is desired. Levitate gives Mesprit a really useful Ground-type immunity that allows it to freely switch into Earthquake from the likes of Seismitoad, Rhydon, and Archeops.

Usage Tips
========

Mesprit should spend the majority of its time revenge killing the opponent's Pokemon or using U-turn to gain momentum on switches. Thanks to its natural bulk, typing, and Levitate, Mesprit can act as a pivot into Fighting-, Psychic-, and Ground-type attacks. Healing Wish should be used when important teammates need to be restored to full HP to preserve a win condition. If the opponent has bulky Pokemon that easily switch into Mesprit, using Trick can limit their effectiveness throughout the game. Before Mesprit's Choice Scarf has been revealed, it can nab surprise KOs early-game.

Team Options
========

Fairy- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Granbull, Gurdurr, and Hariyama resist Dark-type attacks and can threaten out Pokemon such as Liepard and Pawniard, which scare Mesprit. Entry hazard setters such as Regirock, Crustle, and Garbodor can help turn 2HKOs into OHKOs by weakening the opposing team with Stealth Rock and Spikes. Mesprit appreciates physical attackers such as Sawk, Archeops, and Mawile, which can break down specially defensive walls such as Lickilicky and Audino. Mesprit can fit well on more offensive teams that find themselves needing a little more Speed, which value a pivot and revenge killer. Thanks to Healing Wish, Mesprit also pairs well with setup sweepers, as it can give them a second chance at a sweep after they weaken the opponent's team.

Other Options
########

Mesprit has a plethora of other coverage and utility moves it can use. An offensive Trick Room set can be used, as having a slow U-turn to get into a wallbreaker is very helpful. An offensive Rain Dance set has some merit due to Mesprit's access to Thunder to attack and Healing Wish to support sweepers, but Uxie's greater bulk is generally more useful. A set with Light Screen and Reflect is passable but also generally outclassed by Uxie. Magic Coat bounces back entry hazards and status moves. Hidden Power Fighting OHKOes Pawniard and heavily damages Probopass while still maintaining solid coverage on most other Steel-types. Toxic cripples bulky Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Mantine, but Mesprit is generally better off with a coverage move. A physical Stealth Rock set can be used for a slightly stronger U-turn, but it is outclassed by the special Stealth Rock set due to Mesprit's more useful special attacking movepool.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Steel-types**: Bulky Steel-types are often problematic for Mesprit, as they resist its STAB moves and only fear Hidden Power Fire, which can easily be scouted for. Probopass and the rare Bastiodon are especially hard stops to most Mesprit sets due to their neutrality to Hidden Power Fire, only fearing the occasional Hidden Power Fighting. Pawniard can survive a hit and deal a solid chunk back to Mesprit with Knock Off, but it has to be wary of Hidden Power or Colbur Berry variants.

**Bulky Psychic-types**: Opposing physical Mesprit is a great check to Mesprit because it only fears Knock Off and Signal Beam, while it can hit back with a strong Knock Off, or U-turn of its own for solid damage and gain momentum. Uxie, Musharna, and Beheeyem are also good at checking Mesprit, though they need to watch out for Signal Beam and invested U-turn. Xatu can take most hits from Mesprit and cripple it with Thunder Wave, but must be wary of Signal Beam, Ice Beam, or Thunderbolt.

**Scyther**: Scyther is the only relevant Pokemon with Bug-type STAB moves and can deal massive damage to or OHKO Mesprit with either Bug Bite or U-turn, and it has the bulk backed by Eviolite to shrug off most hits bar an Ice Beam or Thunderbolt.

**Dark-types**: Dark-types such as Malamar, Liepard, and Sneasel are solid checks to Mesprit due to their Psychic immunity and their super effective STAB moves against Mesprit, but they all must be wary of Signal Beam. Liepard and Sneasel are faster and can Pursuit trap Mesprit, and the former can lock Mesprit into an unfavorable move with Encore.

**Hard Hitters**: Despite Mesprit's solid bulk, hard-hitting Pokemon such as Typhlosion, Mismagius, Pyroar, and Zangoose have little trouble revenge killing Mesprit with their strong attacks.
