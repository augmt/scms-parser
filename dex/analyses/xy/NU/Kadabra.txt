Overview
########
Kadabra is a solid revenge killer thanks to its great Speed and ability; Magic Guard grants it the niche of coming in with a Focus Sash intact even in the face of entry hazards or weather damage. Furthermore, Kadabra's movepool includes good coverage and support options. However,  horrendous defenses mean that Kadabra is hard-pressed to take even resisted hits well, and it is incredibly susceptible to priority attacks. In addition, Kadabra faces serious competition for a teamslot from Mesprit, which boasts far superior bulk, a considerably better movepool, and greater power as it can afford to run Life Orb, which Kadabra cannot.

Moves
========
Psychic is Kadabra's most powerful STAB move. Psyshock is an alternative STAB option used to hit the specially defensive Pokemon on their weaker Defense stat. Hidden Power Fighting and Hidden Power Fire are both for hitting the Steel-types that resist Kadabra's other coverage moves. With Hidden Power Fighting, you can hit Pawniard, Probopass, and Bastiodon, whereas Hidden Power Fire hits Ferroseed. Dazzling Gleam preys on the Dark-types that are immune to Kadabra's STAB and hits Dragon-types for super effective damage too. In the last slot, Encore can be used to lock an opponent into a boosting move or even Sucker Punch, allowing Kadabra to escape the field unscathed and potentially providing a teammate with a setup opportunity.

Set Details
========
Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs let Kadabra make the most of its only good stats. Kadabra needs a Timid nature in order to outspeed most of the unboosted Pokemon in the tier. With Kadabra's poor defenses, a Focus Sash is the ideal item. With it, Kadabra can survive an otherwise fatal hit and retaliate, and thanks to Magic Guard, Kadabra doesn't risk having its Focus Sash broken by weather damage or entry hazards.

Usage Tips
========
Use Encore if the foe uses a boosting move, status move, or Sucker Punch, and proceed to switch out to a teammate that can use this as a setup opportunity. Bring Kadabra in to revenge kill after a teammate has fainted, or bring it in if you predict a move that you can Encore to turn the foe into setup bait.

Team Options
========
Kadabra appreciates having Fighting-types such as Sawk, Gurdurr, and Hariyama on the team; they offer a resistance to Dark-type attacks and can muscle their way past NU's premier special walls, such as Audino and Regice. Pokemon such as  Gorebyss and Carracosta are also good teammates as they can take advantage of free turns that Kadabra's Encore can provide in order to set up.

Other Options
########
A Life Orb cranks up Kadabra's damage output, and Magic Guard means that it doesn't have to worry about recoil. However, Kadabra prefers its Focus Sash to keep it from falling to any hit, and Mesprit is a generally superior Life Orb user thanks to its better bulk. Kadabra can force a switch and proceed to set up a Substitute to shield itself from any attacks that trouble it, which eases prediction. It also provides insurance against faster foes. However, Substitute is counteractive with a Focus Sash, so it should only see use on a Life Orb set. Calm Mind is a possibility for bolstering Kadabra's offenses to insane levels in order to try to sweep, but Kadabra's pitiful bulk makes it difficult to set up. Energy Ball's coverage is handy for disposing of foes such as Seismitoad and Rhydon. Signal Beam hits Grass-types and opposing Psychic-types, while Shadow Ball also hits Psychic-types and is a bit stronger. Trick can be used with an item such as a Flame Orb or a Choice Scarf in order to cripple an opposing Pokemon, but this deprives Kadabra of the more consistently useful Focus Sash. Foul Play can hit a +2 Feraligatr for more damage than any of Kadabra's other attacks. Finally, Thunder Wave can be used to potentially stop an opposing sweeper.

Checks and Counters
########
**Special Walls**: Kadabra struggles against special walls. Regice can take any hit from Kadabra and easily 2HKO it with Ice Beam, and Lickilicky is comfortable to take a couple of hits and prey on Kadabra's horrendous defenses.

**Priority Users**: Priority users pose a threat to Kadabra; this is due to its combination of poor defenses and reliance on Focus Sash to survive. Examples of these include Kangaskhan, Piloswine, and Pawniard. With both priority Fake Out and Sucker Punch, Kangaskhan can easily handle Kadabra, though Encore can save it from Sucker Punch. Thanks to Eviolite, Piloswine's bulk is bolstered to levels where it can take multiple hits from Kadabra. In addition, Piloswine packs a priority attack in Ice Shard, which means that it can strike first and KO a weakened Kadabra before it gets the chance to attack. Pawniard's Sucker Punch is problematic for Kadabra, and it sports an immunity to Kadabra's STAB moves.
