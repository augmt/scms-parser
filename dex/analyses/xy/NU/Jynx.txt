Overview
########
Jynx epitomizes the phrase "glass cannon". One one hand, it is capable of revenge killing, wallbreaking, or even sweeping, and it can incapacitate counters with Lovely Kiss. Access to Dry Skin lets it switch into Water-type moves and check many Water-type attackers, and access to Nasty Plot means that Jynx can attempt a sweep. Furthermore, a decent dual STAB type combination and a wide movepool ensure that Jynx is a versatile threat to contend with. On the other hand, Jynx suffers from poor bulk, especially on the physical side, and its typing leaves it with plenty of weaknesses to common attacking types and the omnipresent Stealth Rock. Finally, it has a lot of problems with priority attackers as it will take a lot of damage from Fake Out or Mach Punch, or even get OHKOed by Bullet Punch, Shadow Sneak, and Sucker Punch.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Lovely Kiss
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Psychic / Psyshock
move 4: Nasty Plot / Focus Blast
ability: Dry Skin
item: Life Orb / Focus Sash
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Lovely Kiss cripples counters and gives Jynx free turns to set up. Ice Beam is Jynx's main STAB move and gets great coverage. Psychic is Jynx's secondary STAB move. Psyshock is another STAB option that Jynx can run in order to hit specially defensive Pokemon on their weaker Defense stat. Nasty Plot raises Jynx's Special Attack to extremely high levels, allowing it to sweep or punch holes in the opponent's team. Focus Blast can be used instead of Nasty Plot for more coverage, though foregoing Nasty Plot means that Jynx loses out on a lot of wallbreaking power and the potential to sweep.

Set Details
========
4 Special Defense EVs mean that Jynx is left at an odd number of HP, ensuring it can switch into Stealth Rock five times. A Timid nature is essential; as Jynx is so frail, it certainly will not want to be taking a hit before it can act, so it is best that Jynx gets the jump on as many foes as possible. A Life Orb ups Jynx's damage output, and it is so frail that the recoil damage isn't too big an issue. Focus Sash can be opted for to allow Jynx to survive a hit that would otherwise KO it. Given that Jynx is severely lacking in the defenses department, it risks easily being KOed, so a Focus Sash acts as reliable insurance. Dry Skin is the chosen ability as it allows Jynx to force out most Water-types because it grants an immunity to their STAB moves.

Usage Tips
========
This set is best used mid-game to punch holes in the opponent's team. Focus Sash variants of Jynx should usually lead, unless your opponent has a lead that will easily be able to to beat Jynx one-on-one. Nasty Plot should be used when Jynx forces a foe out. Use Lovely Kiss when you predict a switch-in from a counter or when you require a turn of setup.

Team Options
========
Jynx appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Crustle and Accelgor in order to net crucial KOs. Hazards wear Jynx down quickly, so being able to remove said hazards is a favourable, though for Jynx equipped with a Focus Sash, this support is not mandatory because Jynx functions as an anti-lead. Pokemon such as Kabutops and Sandslash can do this. Fighting-types such as Sawk, Ground-types such as Sandslash, and Fire-types such as Typhlosion are good teammates, as they are able to deal with the Steel-types that resist Jynx's STAB type combination. Allies capable of preventing entry hazards from being set up in the first place, such as Taunt + Life Orb Samurott, Taunt Mismagius, and Choice Band Mold Breaker Sawk are also worthy of consideration.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Ice Beam
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Lovely Kiss / Focus Blast
move 4: Trick
ability: Dry Skin
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Ice Beam is Jynx's main STAB attack, capable of dealing good damage. Psychic is an additional STAB attack that complements Ice Beam's coverage rather nicely. Psyshock is a possibility for hitting specially defensive opponents on their weaker Defense stat, though in most cases, running Psychic is preferable as it inflicts more damage against the opponents that Choice Scarf Jynx has the niche of being able to revenge kill, such as +2 Carracosta, Kabutops, weakened Feraligatr, and +2 Gorebyss. Lovely Kiss allows Jynx to quickly incapacitate a foe should it need to do so. Focus Blast is a strong coverage attack that hits Steel- and Dark-types for great damage. Trick is used to cripple defensive Pokemon trying to switch into Jynx. A special wall such as Lickilicky will have its utility reduced if a Choice Scarf is forced upon it. If one should opt for Psyshock, Energy Ball is a viable coverage option to run as it enables Jynx to reliably beat the aforementioned Water-types that it couldn't with Psyshock.

Set Details
========
For a fast and frail offensive Pokemon such as Jynx, maximum Speed and Special Attack investment is the way to go, as this makes Jynx hit hard and outspeed as many threats as possible. A Timid nature allows Jynx to reach maximum Speed, outspeeding other Choice Scarf carriers such as Sawk and Speed tying with Primeape. A Choice Scarf allows Jynx to outspeed the entirety of the unboosted metagame and serve as a potent revenge killer. Dry Skin makes Jynx immune to Water-type attacks, offering switch-in opportunities and an immunity to Aqua Jet, a move that would otherwise trouble Jynx.

Usage Tips
========
Jynx should be brought in to revenge kill after an ally has fainted or if you predict a Water-, Ice-, or Psychic-type attack. Be careful with what you lock yourself into, or your opponent can get a free setup opportunity. Jynx can be used as a lead to swiftly prevent entry hazards with Lovely Kiss. Trick should be used when you predict a special wall switching in, as it certainly will not enjoy having to hold a Choice Scarf. Trick can also be used to lock an opponent into an attack, which can potentially allow one of Jynx's teammates to set up and sweep.

Team Options
========
Jynx appreciates teammates capable of providing a slow U-turn or Volt Switch so it can come into play without taking a hit. Pokemon such as Probopass can provide this. As Jynx can easily remove Grass-types such as Vileplume, Water-type allies such as Feraligatr and Kabutops will benefit from the removal of the aforementioned Grass-types. Fighting-, Ground-, and Fire-types such as Sawk, Sandslash, and Typhlosion, respectively, are able to dispatch the Steel-types that tank Jynx's STAB combination. Pokemon such as Kabutops or Sandslash that can remove hazards are a must so that Jynx can keep switching into play without losing a chunk of its health every time. Teammates that can prevent the setup of entry hazards can come in handy too. Examples of these are Taunt + Life Orb Samurott, Taunt Mismagius, and Choice Band Mold Breaker Sawk.

Other Options
########
Substitute can shield Jynx from bothersome hits and status conditions. Shadow Ball is a coverage option for hitting Pokemon such as Musharna, Mismagius, and Uxie harder than any of Jynx's other moves. Calm Mind can serve to bolster Jynx's special bulk in addition to its offensive presence, though Jynx's poor HP and physical bulk mean that Nasty Plot is a superior choice. Taunt can shut down walls and stop opposing leads from setting up entry hazards, though Jynx is usually better off just putting them to sleep. In a similar vein, Magic Coat can deflect hazards back at the team of an opponent attempting to set them up and can deflect moves inducing statuses such as paralysis that could serve to hinder Jynx. Wish can increase Jynx's longevity and restore an ally's health, though Jynx's frailty and lacking HP mean that there are Pokemon better suited to such a role. Jynx can function as a speedy cleric with Heal Bell, though it can't afford to spare the moveslot and cannot take hits very well at all. A dual screens set with Light Clay is a possibility, though it is outclassed by bulkier Pokemon with more utility such as Uxie or Audino.

Checks & Counters
########
**Priority Attackers**: Jynx hates priority attackers, as they can easily revenge kill it due to its lacking bulk. Examples of troublesome priority attackers are Pawniard, Liepard, Kangaskhan, Hariyama, and Gurdurr.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Pawniard, Probopass, and Bastiodon can tank Jynx's STAB attacks without fear. They only have to be wary of Focus Blast.

**Special Walls:**: Pokemon with great special bulk, such as Musharna, Audino, and Uxie, can absorb hits from Jynx, but dislike being put to sleep.

**Entry Hazards**: Entry hazards are problematic for Jynx, as they deprive it of HP and break its Focus Sash upon entering the field. Stealth Rock in particular is a huge issue, stripping away a rather hefty 25%.
