Overview
########

Great Attack and solid bulk with Eviolite make Gurdurr a threatening Fighting-type. Bulk Up allows Gurdurr to improve its power and bulk even further, turning it into a fearsome sweeper. Access to great STAB moves in Drain Punch and Mach Punch allows Gurdurr to bolster its longevity and revenge kill faster Pokemon, respectively. Guts turns crippling status problems into an advantage by boosting Gurdurr's Attack stat, preventing burns from cutting its sweep short. Knock Off and Ice Punch give Gurdurr a way to threaten or cripple various Pokemon that resist Fighting. On the downside, Gurdurr's low Speed leaves it overreliant on Mach Punch to deal with many faster threats. Even with Eviolite, Gurdurr cannot withstand many powerful special attacks with its low Special Defense stat. It also faces competition as a bulky Fighting-type with Hariyama, which boasts better special bulk and a resistance to Fire- and Ice-type moves.

Bulk Up
########
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Drain Punch
move 3: Mach Punch
move 4: Knock Off / Ice Punch
ability: Guts
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Bulk Up is a great boosting move, raising Gurdurr's Attack and Defense and allowing it to sweep and take hits better. Drain Punch is a reliable STAB attack that prevents Gurdurr from being worn down as easily. Mach Punch helps Gurdurr act as a revenge killer and allows it to fare better against faster Pokemon. Knock Off is the best option in the fourth slot to remove foes' items and to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types for massive damage. Alternatively, Ice Punch can be used to hit Vileplume and Scyther harder.

Set Details
========

The EVs and nature are standard for a bulky physical sweeper. Eviolite makes Gurdurr a good physical tank and patches up its low Special Defense. Guts is typically the best ability, as it allows Gurdurr to absorb status problems for the team and prevent a stray Will-O-Wisp or Scald burn from ruining its sweep.

Alternatively, a specially defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD and a Careful nature could be run in order to make the most of Gurdurr's mixed bulk. Another spread of 248 HP / 176 Atk / 84 Spe with an Adamant nature allows Gurdurr to outspeed Pokemon with base 50 Speed, most notably Audino. Yet another option is a spread of 252 HP / 136 Atk / 60 Def / 60 SpD, which provides Gurdurr with some extra special bulk and lets it avoid the 2HKO from Silk Scarf Kangaskhan's Double-Edge after Stealth Rock damage.

Usage Tips
========

In the early game, use Knock Off on predicted switches to weaken your opponent's checks to Gurdurr. It's fine to set up on Pokemon that resist Fighting if they cannot do much back to Gurdurr, such as against Qwilfish without Taunt, but do not set up on special attackers, as Gurdurr cannot afford to take many special hits even with the aid of Eviolite. Moreover, Gurdurr dislikes Toxic even with Guts, as it is not meant to be switched out often. As such, defensive Pokemon that carry Toxic, such as Seismitoad, do not always make good setup fodder.

Team Options
========

A Psychic-type such as Mesprit can deal with bulky Poison-types, such as Vileplume and Garbodor, that threaten Gurdurr. A Ghost-type such as Mismagius can beat the Psychic-types that Gurdurr cannot defeat. Gurdurr pairs well with bulky Rock- and Steel-types, such as Rhydon and Steelix, as they wall the physical Flying-types that beat Gurdurr, such as Archeops and Scyther. Especially if running the faster spread, this set works well alongside Swords Dance + Baton Pass Leafeon and Scyther, as they allow Gurdurr to replace Bulk Up with Ice Punch in order to break its checks more easily. Liepard provides Gurdurr with Pursuit support to trap the Psychic-types that check it, as well as Knock Off to wear down some of Gurdurr's checks, such as Weezing.

Sweepers such as Lilligant and Swellow appreciate having Gurdurr around to Knock Off their checks. This puts pressure on them to switch in, as most checks to Gurdurr have no reliable recovery outside of Leftovers, with the exceptions of Musharna, Xatu, and Mega Audino. Frail offensive Pokemon such as Jynx enjoy Gurdurr's ability to take on physical Normal-types, such as Kangaskhan and Bouffalant.

Other Options
########

Iron Fist is an alternative ability that is more consistent than Guts but with a significantly lesser benefit that leaves Gurdurr vulnerable to burns, so Guts is typically the better option. Stone Edge is a coverage option that hits Scyther and Rotom-S hard, while Poison Jab can be used to hit Fairy-types, such as Mega Audino and Granbull. An all-out attacking set with Mach Punch, Drain Punch, Knock Off, and Ice Punch / Poison Jab / Stone Edge is viable as well. However, Gurdurr will typically miss having Bulk Up, as it needs a boost to deal significant damage.

Checks & Counters
########

**Poison-types**: Bulky Poison-types, such as Garbodor and Vileplume, wall Gurdurr's STAB moves and don't mind Knock Off too much.

**Fairy-types**: Mega Audino and Granbull are nightmares to Gurdurr. Audino can survive two +1 Poison Jabs and force it out with Dazzling Gleam, while Granbull will cut Gurdurr's Attack with Intimidate and threaten it with Play Rough. Both of the aforementioned Fairy-types are also faster than Gurdurr.

**Psychic-types**: Fast Psychic-types, such as Mesprit and Xatu, will deal serious damage to Gurdurr before it can use Knock Off. Mesprit OHKOes Gurdurr, while Xatu 2HKOes it and will usually survive a Knock Off followed by a Mach Punch. However, neither can safely switch into Gurdurr due to the threat of Knock Off.

**Offensive Pressure**: Gurdurr really needs a boost in order to be used to its fullest potential. Despite its bulk, enough repeated hits will wear it down and prevent it from reliably setting up. Its low Speed and reliance on Drain Punch are easy to take advantage of as well.

**Special Attackers**: Due to Gurdurr's low Special Defense even with Eviolite, it won't stand up to powerful special attacks such as Typhlosion's Eruption or Samurott's Hydro Pump.
