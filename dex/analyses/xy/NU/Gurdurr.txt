Overview
#######

With a good Attack stat and solid bulk backed by Eviolite, Gurdurr is an extremely threatening Fighting-type. Its access to STAB Drain Punch allows it to heal itself, and Mach Punch gives it useful priority, which allows it to damage faster attackers such as Pyroar. Guts is a fantastic ability that allows Gurdurr to benefit from status moves, giving it a significant boost in Attack when inflicted with status. With the buff to Knock Off, Gurdurr has a reliable way to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types and also cripple switch-ins. Faster Pokemon are problematic for Gurdurr, however, especially those that resist Mach Punch.

Moves
======

Drain Punch is a powerful STAB move that provides recovery to keep Gurdurr healthy throughout the battle. Mach Punch is a good form of priority to hit faster Pokemon such as Zangoose and Pyroar. Knock Off provides great coverage, hitting Ghost- and Psychic-types, which resist Gurdurr's STAB moves, while also removing foes' items. Bulk Up boosts Gurdurr's Attack and Defense, making it progressively harder to whittle down and making it able to sweep, but Ice Punch provides an alternate form of coverage to hit bulky Grass-types such as Vileplume if using Iron Fist.

Set Details
=========

Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature are used to let Gurdurr hit as hard as possible. Maximum HP investment is helpful to capitalize on Gurdurr's good bulk coupled with an Eviolite. Alternately, an EV spread of 252 HP / 136 Atk / 120 SpD can be used to avoid the 2HKO from Cryogonal's Ice Beam and to have more bulk overall. 84 Speed EVs are an option to outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Vileplume. Eviolite boosts Gurdurr's defenses by 50%, greatly increasing its overall bulk. Guts is the preferred ability to benefit from status ailments, which would cripple Gurdurr otherwise. However, Iron Fist is viable to give a permanent boost in power to Gurdurr's punching moves, but it adds susceptibility to status ailments.

Usage Tips
=========

Gurdurr should not set up if the opponent has a bulky Pokemon that resists its moves, such as Vileplume or Slurpuff, as it usually cannot break through them. Knock Off is generally the best move to go for early-game to hit the opponent's Gurdurr checks, weakening them for other teammates. Ice Punch should be used on predicted switches to hit Grass-types such as Vileplume on the switch. Gurdurr is a great switch-in to Scald and Will-O-Wisp, as burn will make Gurdurr stronger and gain more HP back with Drain Punch. However, Gurdurr should avoid Toxic, as the increasing residual damage is very detrimental to Gurdurr. If using Iron Fist, it is important to keep Gurdurr away from all forms of status ailments. As Gurdurr is worn down easily, don't switch it in recklessly, even into things it can check.

Team Options
===========

Poison- and Steel-types such as Garbodor and Klinklang make for good teammates, as they are able to pressure Fairy-types, such as Slurpuff and Granbull, which are problematic for Gurdurr. Garbodor provides entry hazard support for Gurdurr, while Klinklang shares similar checks and counters. Pawniard is a notable Steel-type that also shares similar checks and counters with Gurdurr and gains an Attack boost from Granbull's Intimidate, a common switch-in to Gurdurr. Psychic-types such as Mesprit are helpful to handle Poison-types such as Vileplume and Weezing, which check Gurdurr. They also lure in Dark-types, which Gurdurr can set up on. Thunder Wave support from the likes of Liepard and Uxie allows Gurdurr to outspeed and heavily damage many of its checks, such as Mesprit and Uxie.

Other Options
########

Poison Jab hits Fairy-types, such as Slurpuff and Granbull, for super effective damage, but Gurdurr has trouble fitting it into its moveset. Stone Edge hits Flying-types such as Pelipper and Scyther. Taunt stops clerics and Defog users from using their support moves, but Gurdurr prefers having its coverage moves.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Gurdurr is hard countered by Fairy-types, notably Granbull, which can switch into Drain Punch or Knock Off and 2HKO Gurdurr with Play Rough. Slurpuff is a big issue for Gurdurr, as Slurpuff can set up on it.

**Poison-types**: Bulky Poison-types such as Vileplume and Garbodor resist Gurdurr's STAB moves and don't particularly care about being hit with Knock Off. In particular, Garbodor is a problem for Gurdurr, as it can quickly wear Gurdurr down with Rocky Helmet and Aftermath damage, while Vileplume can heal off damage taken and hit Gurdurr on its weaker Special Defense stat.

**Offensive Checks**: Fast Psychic- and Flying-types such as Mesprit and Vivillon resist Gurdurr's STAB moves and threaten to KO it with their special attacking moves. However, both of these must be wary of a Knock Off on the switch.

**Offensive Pressure**: Due to Gurdurr's low Speed stat and reliance on Drain Punch for recovery, it can be quickly overwhelmed by repeated hits and residual damage, as it needs time to set up before hitting hard.
