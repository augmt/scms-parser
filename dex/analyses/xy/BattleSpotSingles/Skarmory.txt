Overview
########

Skarmory's very useful resistances granted by its Steel / Flying typing, its high defense, and its reliable recovery make it a great check to many physically attacking Pokemon, and its support options make it a great addition to a bulkier stall team. However, Skarmory can easily be broken by almost any sort of special attacker, and physical Fire-types will be able to eventually muscle their way through its defenses. It's also quite slow and passive, meaning it greatly damages momentum when used on a non-stall team. However, it is still a great addition to most stall teams.

Defensive
########

item: Rocky Helmet / Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Roost keeps Skarmory healthy throughout the match and prevents Skarmory from being worn down. It also removes Skarmory's Flying type for the turn, giving Skarmory resistances to Rock and Ice while also giving weaknesses to Ground and Fighting. Toxic is Skarmory's main way of dealing damage, allowing it to simply use Roost and stall until the foe faints. Stealth Rock is another option, helping to wear down opposing switch-ins; however, Toxic is better to take down an individual target. Whirlwind combos well with Stealth Rock, as it forces the foe out. It is also useful for removing boosting Pokemon, especially Minimize users, as it ignores evasion boosts, Substitutes, and Protect. Drill Peck is the main STAB attack, and Iron Head is an alternate option that hurts Rock- and Fairy-types more and has a chance to flinch slower attackers. Brave Bird can also be used, as it is more powerful. However, it gives recoil, which can put Skarmory into 2HKO range against certain attackers, and forces Skarmory to use Roost more often. It also prevents Skarmory from keeping Sturdy active.

Set Details
========

The EVs are straightforward: maximum HP and maximum Defense help to make Skarmory as bulky as possible. Rocky Helmet is to deal passive damage; as Skarmory is used to check physical attackers, it will be hit with contact moves very often. Leftovers is an alternate option if another Pokemon is already using the team's Rocky Helmet. Sturdy is the best ability, as it makes Skarmory immune to OHKO moves and allows Skarmory to survive any hit from full health and use at least one move.

Usage Tips
========

Skarmory is rather straightforward: just bring it in against unboosted physical attackers that are not Fire-types, such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Kangaskhan, or Tyranitar, or against passive stall Pokemon such as Cresselia or Hippowdon. Toxic is the main move you will want to use most of the time to assure that the opposing Pokemon is taking damage each turn. Once the foe is poisoned, Roost to heal the damage until the opposing Pokemon switches out or faints. If it tries to boost, use Whirlwind to remove it. If you opt to use Stealth Rock over Toxic, use Whirlwind whenever possible to force switches and cause your opponent's Pokemon to take entry hazard damage. Use an attack to finish off a low-HP foe, or if the foe is already poisoned and you do not yet need to Roost.

Although Roost is an all-around a good move, in some cases it can make Skarmory more vulnerable. Roost removes Skarmory's Flying type for the remainder of the turn, which gives it resistances to Rock and Ice, but also makes it weak to Ground and Fighting. This means that slower Ground and Fighting attackers such as Rhyperior or Conkeldurr will be able to hit Skarmory with a more powerful attack on the turn it uses Roost. In these cases, using Roost will require some predictions to minimize the damage Skarmory takes.

Team Options
========

Skarmory greatly appreciates bulky partner Pokemon that can help it form a stall core. Its most common partner is Chansey, which can take any special attack for Skarmory. Slowbro, Gliscor, and Venusaur are other common stall Pokemon that have good synergy with Skarmory. For more bulky offensive partners, Latias likes having opposing strong physical attackers removed and can also take some special hits for Skarmory. It also greatly appreciates having Tyranitar and Cresselia removed by Skarmory. Tyranitar itself is a good partner as well, as it can also take special hits and has good type synergy with Skarmory. More offensive Pokemon, such as Salamence, Volcarona, or Greninja, benefit from having the opposing team worn down by Toxic or Stealth Rock. However, as Skarmory is a more defensive Pokemon, it can often be a liability to an offensive team's momentum.

Other Options
========

Swords Dance is an option to make Skarmory more offensive so it can use its STAB moves such as Iron Head or Brave Bird. Keen Eye might seem like a good option at first to counter evasion strategies, but it is inferior to Sturdy, as Whirlwind already ignores evasion boosts. Spikes is generally inferior to Stealth Rock, as it takes several turns to set up. However, on a full stall team it can sometimes be worth it. Taunt is another option to use against opposing stall teams, along with 132 Speed EVs for Skarmory to outspeed and Taunt Cresselia. Iron Defense is also an option to double Skarmory's Defense, making it even harder to wear down. However, this strategy is susceptible to critical hits and it can be hard to find a moveslot to use for it.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Heatran or Charizard can stop Skarmory easily with their powerful Fire attacks. Even physical Fire-types, such as Talonflame or Blaziken, will be able to muscle through Skarmory with a boost.

**Electric-types**: Rotom, Manectric, and Zapdos can all take out Skarmory with a powerful Electric attack. They can also gain momentum against Skarmory's team with Volt Switch.

**Special Attackers**: Although they might not hit Skarmory super effectively, any kind of strong special attacker, such as Hydreigon, Aegislash, Greninja, or Gengar, will deal a load of damage to it. Gengar especially can Mega Evolve and trap Skarmory or one of its partners, putting a big hole in Skarmory's stall core.

**Taunt**: Taunt users such as Sableye and Talonflame can disable Skarmory and then use it as an opportunity to set up.

**Lures**: Physical attackers that Skarmory normally counters, such as Garchomp, Kangaskhan, or Tyranitar, can lure it in and then use a surprise special attack. However, this is quite rare.
