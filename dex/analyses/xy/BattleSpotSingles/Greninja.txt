Overview
########

Greninja might seem like an unassuming, mediocre Pokemon on the surface, but just like a real ninja, it's hiding a deadly weapon under its unassuming appearance in the formidable Protean! Protean gives Greninja STAB on every one of its attacks, making it deceptively powerful, and Greninja's high Speed and diverse attacking movepool let it revenge kill dangerous threats such as Garchomp and punish most offensive switch-ins. However, Greninja isn't very versatile on the item front; it's forced to use either Life Orb or Focus Sash, restricting the item options of your team. Greninja's defenses are rather subpar, and its typing will usually only protect it from Sucker Punch and situational attacks via Protean typing changes. Greninja also has a difficult time covering the whole metagame with just four moveslots, and with the moves it has, Greninja will often just miss out on a KO against healthy Pokemon. All of these aspects combined mean that Greninja must be played with care, or else it will simply waste a Pokemon and item slot. Greninja might not be the easiest Pokemon to use, but don't let your guard down, because Greninja is a Pokemon that is worth more than the sum of its parts. Protean is still an excellent ability that gives out game-changing rewards with good prediction, thanks to its type-changing properties giving Greninja the chance to survive moves that would normally OHKO it. This means that a well-played Greninja is among the most deadly assassins in the Battle Spot Singles metagame, so giving a Greninja a contract for your team is a fine choice as long as you're prepared for its flaws.


All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Ice Beam
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Gunk Shot
move 4: Low Kick / Grass Knot / Water Shuriken / Hydro Pump
ability: Protean
item: Life Orb
evs: 20 Atk / 236 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Timid

Moves
========

Ice Beam is Greninja's main tool of assassination, allowing Greninja to OHKO most Pokemon 4x weak to Ice, KO physically defensive Hippowdon, and have a 68% chance of OHKOing Zapdos. While Dark Pulse doesn't hit as many targets super effectively, it allows Greninja to 2HKO Cresselia and Aegislash (though you should watch out for Weakness Policy) and OHKO Mega Gengar. Greninja might have a low Attack stat, but Gunk Shot makes Greninja an effective mixed attacker. It OHKOes Azumarill and Sylveon and 2HKOes offensive Rotom-W, Pokemon that would otherwise counter Greninja. Because Greninja also survives a Belly Drum-boosted Aqua Jet at full health, it can be an effective emergency check to Belly Drum Azumarill. Gunk Shot also gives Greninja a Fighting resistance, meaning that users of Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave can no longer check Greninja.

The final moveslot depends heavily on what you need Greninja to cover for your team. Low Kick rounds out the set well, doing at least 79% to minimum HP Mega Kangaskhan. It also allows Greninja to OHKO Tyranitar and Bisharp and 2HKO specially defensive Ferrothorn. If you're more worried about Suicune, Grass Knot is an effective way to stop it from setting up, with Grass Knot even having a chance to 2HKO Suicune after it has used Calm Mind once. As a bonus, it will also still 2HKO Tyranitar. Grass Knot does laughable damage to the lightweight Rotom-W, though, so if you care to do more damage to Rotom-W, you can use Hidden Power Grass at the cost of being able to beat Suicune. Water Shuriken might seem like a strange choice, as Greninja is already extremely fast. However, it allows Greninja to snipe Blaziken and Talonflame when they are around half their health (which is especially useful because it means Talonflame will be OHKOed after Stealth Rock damage). Water Shuriken will also prevent Pokemon with Fighting-type priority from OHKOing Greninja before it does anything, allowing Greninja to deal some damage before it gets KOed. If your team needs some extra firepower, consider Hydro Pump. Hydro Pump is Greninja's most powerful weapon, OHKOing Heatran and dealing over 70% to the troublesome Mega Mawile, which Greninja will lose to otherwise. If you're paranoid about Hydro Pump's accuracy and don't mind missing out on the OHKO on Heatran, Surf can be used as a reliable move to 2HKO Mega Mawile, while Scald is slightly less powerful in exchange for a burn rate.

If you want a move that can hit both Mega Mawile and Ferrothorn, Hidden Power Fire is also a good option, doing the most to Mega Mawile out of Greninja's tools and OHKOing Scizor and physically defensive Ferrothorn. If Mega Venusaur is a huge problem for your team, Extrasensory can be used to 2HKO it while protecting Greninja from Fighting-type priority. Finally, while U-turn doesn't offer any compelling coverage, it can allow Greninja to be more useful early in the game by giving Greninja the ability to scout the Pokemon your opponent has chosen and perform well against some leads such as Focus Sash Garchomp. One final thing to note about Greninja's complicated move choices: if your team can adequately handle Azumarill, you can elect to replace Gunk Shot with any of the moves listed above.

Set Details
========

Greninja should always run maximum Speed to avoid KOs. Additionally, this Greninja should not be leaving the dojo without a Life Orb, because the extra power is necessary to vanquish many foes in the Battle Spot Singles battlefield. With a Naive nature and 20 Attack EVs, Greninja OHKOes Azumarill with Gunk Shot, and the rest of the 236 EVs go into Special Attack for maximum revenge killing power. If for any reason you decide to make your Greninja a full special attacker, run a Timid nature with maximum Special Attack.

If you plan on running Hidden Power Fire, use an EV spread of 20 Atk / 240 SpA / 248 Spe, because due to Pokemon being level 50 in this metagame, any extra EVs in Special Attack and Speed would be a waste when the Pokemon is forced to have an IV of 30. Finally, an interesting option to consider is to hone Greninja's martial arts skill by running maximum Attack EVs. This gives the ninja frog a 93% chance to OHKO minimum HP Mega Kangaskhan with Low Kick and a guaranteed OHKO on maximum HP Heatran . Ice Beam will still KO all the targets 4x weak to it, but unfortunately, Dark Pulse will lose the guaranteed 2HKO on Cresselia and the OHKO on Mega Gengar and Mega Slowbro.

Usage Tips
========

It's best to keep Greninja hidden in the shadows early in the game; Greninja's defenses leave it OHKOed by many of Battle Spot Singles's powerful offensive Pokemon. Getting Greninja in after a KO is usually the best way for it to enter the battle, and letting Greninja take the stage later in the game when your opponent's team is weary from battle can lead to a clean sweep.

If using Greninja earlier in the game, try to get it in on something it can easily scare out and revenge kill. Pokemon that are weak to Ice such as Garchomp, Mega Salamence, and Zapdos are great candidates for Greninja's assaults. It might seem like a good idea to use Greninja early in the game, but think carefully before you do this: Greninja can't handle any leads that run Focus Sash or powerful priority moves. If using U-turn, Greninja can handle the lead position more comfortably by U-turning slower Focus Sash Pokemon that lack priority, such as Garchomp.

Finally, because Greninja's mere presence can force switches, you can employ the high-risk, high-reward tactic of double switching, which can give your team an edge against defensive switch-ins such as Porygon2 and Suicune.

Team Options
========

The greatest support Greninja's comrades can give it is residual damage. Wearing down the opponent's team can transform Greninja from a simple revenge killer to a terrifying cleaner. The easiest way to support Greninja is to use Pokemon wearing a Rocky Helmet or ones with a contact-damaging ability. Pokemon such as Garchomp, Cresselia, and Zapdos work well here. A big bonus here is that Mega Kangaskhan will fall to Greninja after only one round of Rocky Helmet damage.

Greninja also appreciates sandstorm support from Tyranitar and Hippowdon. Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar share an unfortunate Mach Punch weaknesses with Greninja, but they can effectively switch into Talonflame and also set up on Porygon2 with Taunt and Dragon Dance. Hippowdon, on the other hand, can defeat troublesome, physically based revenge killers such as Blaziken and Choice Scarf Garchomp. Just note that Sand Stream support is a double-edged katana, as Life Orb and sandstorm damage can wear Greninja down to the KO range of priority attacks. The final form of residual damage support is Stealth Rock, which, while difficult to set up, can be especially effective with Greninja, as Stealth Rock puts Talonflame into the KO range of Water Shuriken.

There are some troublesome foes that must be taken into account when hiring Greninja for your team. Porygon2 is near the top of the list, as it is able to effortlessly wall Greninja and either blast the ninja with Tri Attack or destroy its Speed with Thunder Wave. If Greninja isn't running the right moves for it, Mega Mawile will become a terrifying force to face, while Mega Venusaur can use Greninja as an opportunity to stall with Leech Seed. Finally, fast Fighting-type attacks and Talonflame can bypass Greninja's Speed and assassinate it. Mega Gengar is an excellent response to many of Greninja's problems. Mega Gengar haunts Greninja's defensive threats with Shadow Tag, can switch into Fighting-type attacks, and in general can take out fast offensive Pokemon with Destiny Bond. Talonflame also works well, being able to destroy most Fighting-types and Mega Venusaur, and it can also revenge kill Mega Mawile as long as Mega Mawile hasn't used Swords Dance. Other offensive Flying-types such as Mega Salamence also work well against Mega Venusaur and Fighting-type Pokemon. Finally, offensive Fire-types can work well against the troublesome Mega Mawile. Heatran in particular deserves special mention for its ability to handle Talonflame, and it is even able to use Toxic to defeat defensive Porygon2.

One final piece of support worth mentioning is U-turn and Volt Switch. Because Greninja often has trouble switching in, using these moves can let Greninja take the stage. Great Pokemon to consider for this role include Landorus-T, Scizor, Rotom-W, Mega Manectric, and Rotom-H.

Focus Sash
########
name: Focus Sash
move 1: Ice Beam
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Hydro Pump
move 4: Grass Knot / Extrasensory / Hidden Power Fire / Gunk Shot
ability: Protean
item: Focus Sash
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Naive


Moves
========

Ice Beam, while not very strong, still gives Greninja enough firepower to assassinate Garchomp, Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Gliscor. Dark Pulse is even weaker, but it's the only way Greninja will be 2HKOing Aegislash and maximum HP Mega Gengar. Just note that, unfortunately, Cresselia avoids the 2HKO from Dark Pulse. Thankfully, Hydro Pump gives Greninja some much-needed power, letting it OHKO Talonflame and 2HKO Mega Mawile and Heatran. The last slot depends on your team structure and what threats you feel are more important for Greninja's mission. Grass Knot 2HKOes Suicune and Tyranitar, preventing them from setting up, and protects Greninja from Breloom's Spore and Mach Punch if it attempts to revenge kill Greninja. Extrasensory 2HKOes Mega Venusaur and Assault Vest Conkeldurr and protects Greninja from Fighting-type priority. Hidden Power Fire allows Greninja to 2HKO Ferrothorn, and it does more to Mega Mawile than Hydro Pump does. If none of these options sound like a fit for your team, consider Gunk Shot. While Gunk Shot won't OHKO Azumarill, it still does more damage than any of Greninja's other moves and is guaranteed to KO Azumarill after Belly Drum and Sitrus Berry. Low Kick is also an option if your team despises Tyranitar, nabbing an OHKO before it can set up Dragon Dance.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment is the way to go, because Greninja needs as much power as possible to make the best use of Focus Sash. If your team desperately needs an emergency Belly Drum Azumarill check, running Naive with Gunk Shot is needed to defeat Azumarill after a Belly Drum. If running Hidden Power Fire, run 12 HP / 248 SpA / 248 Spe for pure special sets and 12 Atk / 248 SpA / 248 Spe for mixed attacking sets. Because Pokemon in Battle Spot Singles are level 50, running 252 SpA or Spe when using an IV of 30 in both won't give Greninja any extra stat points.

Usage Tips
========

The simplest way to use this Greninja is to lead with it. Greninja has a favorable matchup against prominent Pokemon such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence, and thanks to the Focus Sash, Greninja is less vulnerable to surprise Focus Sash and Choice Scarf users. In the case of Choice Scarf users, Focus Sash Greninja is an excellent scout of them, meaning it can provide your team with valuable information without getting KOed in the process. Keeping Focus Sash Greninja in the shadows for the late-game still has plenty of value, though. Focus Sash allows Greninja to get surprise KOs on sweepers such as Mega Salamence and Talonflame, which can be game-winning events if played well. It also saves Greninja from bad matchups against leads such as Breloom, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Lopunny. If you plan on taking advantage of Focus Sash's surprise value, being reckless with switching Greninja in is usually not a good plan unless you need to make an emergency switch in. One last factor that is important to note is that Focus Sash Greninja is rather weak compared to the more common Life Orb variant, so don't expect Greninja to sweep through teams as well as usual.

Team Options
========

The most important support options Focus Sash Greninja can get are ways to deal with multi-hit Pokemon and Fake Out. This is especially true in the case of Mega Kangaskhan, Breloom, and Mega Lopunny, which are seen as leads. Fast Fighting-types such as Blaziken and Choice Scarf Heracross can scare off Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Lopunny, while Rocky Helmet Cresselia and Zapdos are more reliable switch-ins to them. Breloom can be trickier to deal with because of Spore, but packing leads that deal favorably against Breloom such as Mega Kangaskhan and Lum Berry Garchomp is usually enough. If your team is especially scared of Spore, consider Mega Venusaur and Mandibuzz, which are immune to Spore. Another issue Greninja faces is Sand Stream from Hippowdon and Tyranitar. While neither of these Pokemon has a good matchup against Greninja, the sandstorm damage will ruin Greninja's Focus Sash. The only guaranteed way to deal with this is using Mega Charizard Y or Politoed to make the weather less hostile. Otherwise, consider benching Focus Sash Greninja if you see Tyranitar or Hippowdon. While Focus Sash Greninja is hired for a suicide mission, it still appreciates U-turn and Volt Switch support to ensure a safe passage to the battlefield. Landorus-T, Scizor, Mega Manectric, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H are great partners for this job.

Other Options
########

On the support side of things, Greninja gets access to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. They might seem appealing at first, but because Battle Spot Singles is rather fast-paced, the extra damage they do to grounded Pokemon usually isn't worth the turn required to set them up. Toxic, on the other hand, can work fairly well to cripple Porygon2 and give Greninja a valuable Fighting-type resistance. Rock Slide and Rock Tomb are reasonable offensive options if your team has especially big problems with Mega Charizard Y, and the resistance to Brave Bird can leave Talonflame unable to KO a healthy Greninja. While Shadow Sneak is fairly weak even with the STAB boost, it can be used to get a surprise Fighting immunity and also prevent an OHKO from Mega Gengar's Sludge Bomb or Focus Blast. Choice Specs and Choice Band might seem like great ways to make Greninja into an even more frightening sweeper, but being locked into moves makes Greninja extremely vulnerable to revenge killing. Choice Scarf suffers similar problems, except it leaves Greninja in an even weaker state in exchange for surprise KOs against other Choice Scarf Pokemon. Expert Belt can be used if your team desperately needs another Pokemon to use Life Orb, but the loss in power is significant. Finally, you can elect to use King's Rock with Water Shuriken to get horrifying surprise flinches on your foes, but the loss in power usually isn't worth the cruelty.

Checks & Counters
########

**Porygon2**: Greninja has no hope of breaking through a healthy Porygon2, while Porygon2 can threaten to paralyze Greninja with Thunder Wave, wear it down with Ice Beam, or even obliterate it with a boosted Tri Attack.

**Chansey**: Even mixed Greninja is unable to 2HKO Chansey with Gunk Shot, leaving Chansey able to stop Greninja in its tracks with paralysis and Seismic Toss.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon such as Mega Gengar, Mega Manectric, and Mega Lopunny can easily revenge kill Greninja. Additionally, Choice Scarf users can usually smash through Greninja's poor defenses.

**Talonflame and Blaziken**: Much like Ryu Hayabusa, Greninja has a difficult time with fast birds such as Talonflame and Blaziken. Neither of these two can switch into Greninja easily, but they will outspeed and OHKO Greninja thanks to Gale Wings and Speed Boost, respectively. Just note, both Talonflame and Blaziken are 2HKOed by Water Shuriken.

**Priority Attacks:**: Priority Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Breloom, Conkeldurr, and Mega Lucario will smash Greninja before it even gets the chance to move, which is especially harmful because Greninja is often an Ice- or Dark-type. Note that Greninja can turn the tables on them with smart use of Protean.

**Focus Sash**: Focus Sash is especially problematic for Life Orb Greninja, as failing to OHKO the foe usually means an early grave for Greninja.

**Thunder Wave**: Surprise Thunder Waves can turn Greninja from hero to zero due to losing its excellent Speed tier.

**Mega Mawile**: Hydro Pump and Hidden Power Fire do a lot, but otherwise Greninja can't touch Mega Mawile, while Mega Mawile can use Greninja's fear of Play Rough to set up a Swords Dance.

**Mega Venusaur**: Any Greninja that lacks Extrasensory has no hope of breaking through Mega Venusaur, giving it ample time to set up Leech Seed.

**Mega Kangaskhan**: Mega Kangaskhan fears Low Kick but can otherwise use Fake Out and Double-Edge or Return backed by Parental Bond to make even Focus Sash Greninja a non-issue. Also, Fake Out and Sucker Punch together will destroy Greninja if Protean hasn't changed it into a Dark-or Fighting-type.

**Charizard**: Charizard has no chance of switching into Greninja well, but Mega Charizard Y and Mega Charizard X are not KOed by any of Greninja's moves, giving them the chance to set up a potential sweep with Flame Charge or Dragon Dance.

**Blissey**: Unlike Chansey, Blissey can be 2HKOed by Gunk Shot. However, pure special attacking Greninja are still hopelessly walled, and Blissey has the bonus of being able to carry Shed Shell to nullify Greninja and Mega Gengar partnerships.
