Overview
########

Manectric becomes one of the fastest Pokemon in the metagame after Mega Evolving, only leaving it with very few Pokemon to outspeed it with the exception of Choice Scarf users. It outspeeds common Pokemon such as Greninja, Mega Gengar, Mega Salamence, and Talonflame. Mega Manectric is able to lower the foe's Attack, thanks to its supportive ability Intimidate, so it can survive another hit from certain physically offensive Pokemon. This means that priority moves are less effective at KOing Mega Manectric, as most priority moves are physical. Mega Manectric has access to coverage moves such as Overheat and Hidden Power Ice in order to check or counter threats, with its Speed, Mega Manectric can act as a nice scouter with Volt Switch, allowing it to switch out from foes that pose a huge threat. Mega Manectric's Speed, scouting, and Intimidate combine to weaken physical attackers. Mega Manectric's base 135 Speed allows it to attack first and Volt Switch out after lowering its foe's Attack with Intimidate. This can support a teammate in setting up against the weakened enemy, unless it is battling a Choice Scarf user. Mega Manectric is able to shut down a lot of common offensive Pokemon such as Azumarill. Unfortunately, Mega Manectric takes up a Mega slot.

Moves
========

Thunderbolt is powerful enough to get many 2HKOs on frail Pokemon along with getting rid of Flying- and Water-types. Volt Switch allows for Mega Manectric to get some damage off against the foe before switching out. This is rather helpful against physical attackers when combined with Intimidate, as you can then send out a wall. Overheat is a very powerful Fire-type move and has nice coverage against Grass-, Ice-, and Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Glalie, and Scizor. Flamethrower can be used as an alternative to Overheat, which forces Mega Manectric to use Volt Switch or switch out after a -2 drop in Special Attack. While Flamethrower may not cripple Manectric the same way Overheat does, it should be noted that Flamethrower is a weaker Fire-type move, which means Aegislash can avoid a 2HKO. Hidden Power Ice targets Dragon- and Ground-types such as Dragonite, Hydreigon, and Landorus-T and can possibly OHKO non-specially defensive Garchomp and Mega Salamence.

Set Details
========

Manectite allows Manectric to Mega Evolve into Mega Manectric, boosting its Speed and Special Attack along with granting it Intimidate, which lowers the foe's Attack. This is very useful when going against a physical attacker. Lightning Rod gives Manectric immunity to any Electric-type moves, allowing it to switch into a predicted Electric-type move and gain a boost in Special Attack. This allows Manectric to OHKO threats such as Mega Salamence and Garchomp after Mega Evolving. A Timid nature is used to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon before mega evolution, along with Talonflame and Greninja after mega evolution. It also lets Mega Manectric Speed tie with Mega Lopunny. A Modest nature can be used for more damage; it gives Mega Manectric a higher chance to OHKO uninvested Mega Salamence and Garchomp than a Timid nature does. Hidden Power Ice 2HKOes Hydregion with a Modest nature, while Timid loses the guaranteed 2HKO. As a cost of using Modest nature, Mega Manectric will lose out on its chance to outspeed Mega Gengar, Mega Salamence, Mega Blaziken, and Greninja, so Timid nature is often preferred. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Defense to prevent Porygon2 and Porygon-Z from getting an increase in Special Attack from their ability, Download.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Manectric is better off as a lead Pokemon because of its Speed and access to Volt Switch. This allows it to hit-and-run against powerful threats that can easily KO it. Also, it can assist with breaking any Focus Sash the foe might hold. It should be noted that Manectric should always Mega Evolve as soon as it is out on the field to take advantage of Mega Manectric's increased base stats. Do not switch Mega Manectric in continuously while entry hazards are out on the field because it lacks recovery and its bulk isn't very good. Do not keep Mega Manectric in on special walls because it's a wasted effort, as it can't KO Pokemon such as Chansey and Cresselia. Remember that when Manectric Mega Evolves into Mega Manectric, it doesn't get a huge boost in bulk; it is still frail, so it should avoid getting hit by any attack in general. Even though Mega Manectric can work great as a lead, it needs to watch out for common leads such as Garchomp; Garchomp's Earthquake can still OHKO Mega Manectric even after Intimidate, and although it has Hidden Power Ice to hit Garchomp for a lot of damage, the latter often carries a Focus Sash and will survive the attack anyway.

Team Options
========

Gyarados is a great partner because it can switch in from Mega Manectric and get an extra Intimidate off on physical attackers. Gyarados's Flying typing gives it immunity to Ground-type moves and provides resistance to Bug-, Fighting-, Fire-, and Water-type moves. Despite having a 4x weakness to Electric-type moves, Mega Manectric can switch in on a predicted Electric move and get a boost in Special Attack from Lightning Rod before Mega Evolving. Landorus-T is immune to any Ground-type move and can act as a double Intimidate user to soften attacks. It can also help form a VoltTurn core as well. Latios and Latias are both immune to Ground-type attacks because of Levitate. Latios can use a Choice Scarf to outspeed Choice Scarf Garchomp and OHKO it with its Dragon-type STAB moves. Talonflame can assist in getting rid of Fighting-types with its STAB Flying-type moves. It also has access to Will-O-Wisp for punishing physical attackers, which can be combined with Mega Manectric's Intimidate. Also, they both can form a VoltTurn core, just like with Landorus-T. Dragonite can be used to set up Dragon Dance on physical attackers after an Intimidate from Mega Manectric. Hydreigon is immune to Cresselia's Psychic attacks and resists Aegislash's Shadow Ball, and can hit both of these Pokemon hard with Dark Pulse.

Other Options
########

Protect allows Mega Manectric to scout the foe's move first and potentially cripple Choice Scarf users by locking them into a move, such as Garchomp using Earthquake. This gives Mega Manectric the time to switch out into a Pokemon that has a resistance to the attack. It is also useful in getting the Speed boost next turn after Mega Evolving. Unfortunately, it misses out on reliable coverage moves, and it could possibly cause the foe to set up on it. Magnet Rise allows Mega Manectric to avoid Ground-type attacks. Roar acts as a supportive move to Stealth Rock, getting passive damage off and messing up switch-ins. Substitute can be used on predicted switches and status moves. It also gives Mega Manectric a chance to beat Garchomp if it has Choice Scarf or Focus Sash. Toxic can act as a surprise status move to cripple special walls such as Cresselia.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ground-types**: Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mamoswine can OHKO Mega Manectric even at -1 Attack with an Earthquake, with the exception of Excadrill, which still has a high 75% chance to OHKO Mega Manectric with Earthquake. Mega Manectric can't really do anything to Mamoswine outside of Overheat, and even that doesn't OHKO it.

**Special Walls**: Special walls such as Cresselia and Chansey can take continuous hits from Mega Manectric. Cresselia can use Mega Manectric as a setup fodder, and Chansey can stall it out with Toxic.

**Mega Charizard X**: Mega Charizard X resists all of Mega Manectric's attacks aside from Hidden Power Ice, which it can take several hits from. It can easily set up on Mega Manectric and KO it with any of its STAB moves.

**Tyranitar**: Tyranitar walls Mega Manectric and can 2HKO it with Earthquake, but Mega Manectric can use Volt Switch to switch into a check or counter.

**Porygon2**: Porygon2 can act as a special wall and switch into Manectric before it Mega Evolves. This is because of its ability Trace, which will copy Manectric's Lightning Rod ability and give it immunity to its Electric-type moves and a boost in Special Attack if hit by one.
