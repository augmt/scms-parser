Overview
########
Carbink is faster and has greater overall bulk than most Stealth Rock users and lacks common 4x weaknesses, making it arguably the best Stealth Rock and sun setter in PU. Carbink's defensive typing means that it is a good check to Flareon and Stoutland, and its ability, Sturdy, lets it set up something even against foes that would OHKO it. It can also run a RestTalk set that enables it to last throughout the match and set up against the powerful foes that do not threaten it such as Flareon and Dodrio. However, its lacking movepool does it no favors, and its overall bulk is undermined by a poor HP stat. Additionally, its typing leaves it with no shortage of weaknesses to types such as Grass, Water, and Ground. Finally, poor offensive presence renders it setup fodder, and it has no reliable recovery, so it is forced to run the aforementioned RestTalk set if it wants any longevity.

ROCK WITH EYES
########
name: ROCK WITH EYES
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Moonblast
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
ability: Clear Body
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA
nature: Bold

Moves
========
Calm Mind compensates for Carbink's naturally lacking Special Attack and increases its special bulk. Moonblast is a STAB move with decent enough coverage that will do good damage after several uses of Calm Mind. Rest is Carbink's sole means of recovery and also removes status, while Sleep Talk allows Carbink to continue to boost its stats or attack while sleeping.

Set Details
========
HP and Defense are maximized to increase Carbink's physical bulk, as Calm Mind covers its Special Defense. Clear Body prevents Carbink's stats from being lowered, meaning that it won't be subject to the odd drop from a foe's attack or ability. Leftovers gives Carbink passive recovery, which increases its longevity.

Usage Tips
========
Send in Carbink against a Pokemon that doesn't threaten it such as Flareon or Dodrio so that it can set up. Due to its poor Speed, regardless of the boosts it might have accumulated, Carbink generally shouldn't stay in when faced with a foe with a type advantage such as Carracosta, Tangela, or Piloswine. When Carbink has been worn down sufficiently, use Rest to restore health and then use Sleep Talk over the course of the two following turns. It is safest for Carbink to attempt to set up once its checks and counters have been worn down or outright KOed by teammates.

Team Options
========
Teammates capable of dealing with Water-, Grass-, and Ground-types are ideal. For example, Tangela can dispatch most Water- and Ground-types, and Flareon can dispose of Grass-types. Toxic Spikes support from a Pokemon such as Roselia means that passive damage is inflicted on the opponent while Carbink sets up, and helps it beat other passive sweepers such as Vigoroth.

Sun Support
########
name: Sun Support
move 1: Sunny Day
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Explosion
move 4: Magic Coat
ability: Sturdy
item: Heat Rock
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
Sunny Day summons harsh sunlight, a boon for Fire-types and Chlorophyll Pokemon. Stealth Rock breaks Sturdy and Focus Sashes, and helps offensively inclined teammates net KOs with greater ease. Explosion allows Carbink to put a dent in something once it has set up both sun and Stealth Rock. Magic Coat lets Carbink bounce back status, entry hazards, and most notably, Taunt, which would otherwise render it a lot less useful.

Set Details
========
Maximum HP evens out Carbink's overall bulk, and maximum Speed lets it get up Stealth Rock and sun as fast as possible. Sturdy ensures that Carbink can summon weather or set up Stealth Rock even against opponents that would otherwise KO it, with the exception of Mold Breaker Pokemon. Heat Rock extends the duration of the sunlight to eight turns, allowing teammates to take advantage of it for as long as possible.

Usage Tips
========
Carbink functions well as a lead, though it can be brought in any time your team needs sun support. Carbink should always set up Stealth Rock first and explode after setting up both sunlight and Stealth Rock so as not to waste precious weather turns. If Carbink only has the opportunity to set up one thing before fainting, it should prioritize summoning the sun, unless teammates capable of taking advantage of it have fainted. If there is an important Pokemon such as Stoutland on the other team that Carbink checks, you should try to keep it alive for later on in the match. Magic Coat should be used if you predict that the foe will use Taunt or set up an entry hazard.

Team Options
========
This set should only be used on dedicated weather teams. Pokemon that can take advantage of sun with their abilities and/or moves such as Victreebel, Leafeon, Sawsbuck, Ninetales, and Flareon are good teammates, as they have the potential to sweep with sun support. Carbink wants to be backed by a teammate that can summon sunlight later on the match such as Volbeat; Volbeat in particular can also use Encore to deal with the setup sweepers that try to use Carbink as setup bait.

Other Options
########
Stone Edge 2HKOes Ninetales after Stealth Rock damage and breaks Haunter's Substitutes. Toxic puts a timer on Carbink's foes, though it generally just wastes sun turns if Carbink sticks around long enough to use it. Carbink can set up dual screens, but struggles to get both screens and Stealth Rock up, and is outclassed at doing so by Pokemon such as Meowstic-M and Solrock due to its poor Speed and nonexistent offensive presence. Carbink can set up Trick Room for its teammates and proceed to explode. Power Gem is an alternative to Moonblast that can be used should you be absolutely desperate for Carbink to have Rock-type coverage, though its lower power and inferior overall coverage means that you should definitely consider Moonblast before it. Carbink can try a defensive set that capitalizes on its ability to check some common threats, but it is still setup fodder.

Checks & Counters
########
**Taunt Users**: Pokemon such as Kricketune, Simisear, and Misdreavus can severely reduce Carbink's usefulness with Taunt, as it becomes unable to set up, recover, or support the team. However, they must be wary of using Taunt against sun support Carbink, as they risk having it bounced back with Magic Coat.

**Attackers with Super Effective STAB Moves**: Due to its low Speed stat and lack of investment, the mono-attacker set is forced out by plenty of common attackers such as Torterra, Carracosta, Piloswine, and Golem, irrespective of the boosts that it might have acquired.

**Setup Sweepers**: Setup sweepers such as Carracosta, Barbaracle, Klang, and Substitute + Swords Dance Bouffalant can easily set up on Carbink and prove troublesome for the rest of its team. The former three even pack a resistance to Explosion.

**Pokemon That Resist Moonblast**: Pokemon that resist Moonblast can come in on Carbink and proceed to trouble it. For example, Ninetales can set up with Nasty Plot and use Energy Ball, and Steel-types such as Klang and Metang can KO it with ease or use it as an opportunity to use Shift Gear or Stealth Rock, respectively.
