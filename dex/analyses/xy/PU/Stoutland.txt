Overview
########

When using sand in PU, having Stoutland is a must, as it is a great sweeper in the sand. Its ability Sand Rush, doubles its Speed while in the sand, allowing it to outpace the unboosted metagame. Stoutland has a variety of coverage moves which let it hit hard offensively, such as Crunch, Superpower, and Wild Charge. However, when sand is removed, it is outclassed by Tauros; as such, Stoutland is best used on sand teams.

Sand Sweeper
########
name: Sand Sweeper
move 1: Return
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Superpower
move 4: Wild Charge / Retaliate
ability: Sand Rush
item: Choice Band / Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Return is Stoutland's main STAB move and should be used against any Pokemon that does not resist it. Crunch is used to hit Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-S, super effectively. Superpower is used as coverage to hit Rock- and Steel-types such as Bastiodon, Aurorus, and Golem. Wild Charge can be used as coverage for Water- and Flying-types, specifically Pelipper. Retaliate can be used to revenge kill Pokemon after a teammate has been KOed, as it gets powered up to 140 Base Power and then goes back down to a decent 70 Base Power.

Set Details
========

The spread is a standard offensive one, with maximum Attack and Speed investment. Choice Band increases Stoutland's Attack and doesn't deal recoil damage, but locks it into one move. Life Orb is used to increase Stoutland's damage output at the cost of a little HP, while still letting it switch moves. An Adamant nature is used to increase Stoutland's Attack, as under sand Stoutland outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame and does not need the extra Speed from a Jolly nature.

Usage Tips
========

Sand should be set up before attempting to bring in or sweep with Stoutland. Stoutland should not be directly switched in, as it can result in Stoutland being inflicted with status or unwanted damage. Because of this, Stoutland should only be brought in after one of your Pokemon has fainted or on a double switch. Keep Hippopotas alive for as long as possible, as having sand up is a must for Stoutland so it can outspeed and KO opposing Pokemon. Predict switch-ins to walls and use the appropriate coverage move so as to not waste precious turns of sand. Opponents will try and stall out sand turns by switching into Pokemon that resist Stoutland's move. This can be avoided by getting Toxic Spikes and other entry hazards up as soon as possible. Hazards also help to wear down checks and counters to Stoutland, such as Rock- and Steel-types, before attempting to sweep. When hazards are up, double switching to threaten out opposing Pokemon is also a good way to quickly wear down checks and counters to Stoutland, because with the offensive pressure put on them they will be unable to heal off any damage from the sand and hazards. Hippopotas should only be sacrificed late-game to get sand up one last time before bringing in Stoutland to sweep, and this should only be done if you know Stoutland can KO all of the remaining Pokemon.

Team Options
========

Hippopotas is a required teammate for Stoutland, as it can set up both sand and Stealth Rock. Entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes can quickly wear down an opponent's team when coupled with sand, so Pokemon that can set Toxic Spikes such as Roselia make for good teammates. Serperior synergizes well with Stoutland, as it can check opposing Rock-type Pokemon. Rock-type Pokemon such as Carracosta or Golem can take advantage of sand's boost to their Special Defense. Pursuit trappers such as Sneasel can take out the opponent's Ghost-types so that Stoutland is free to spam its Normal-type attacks. Other powerful Normal-type Pokemon such as Tauros make for good partners, as they have similar checks which they can wear down and can open up a sweeping opportunity for one another.

Scrappy Wallbreaker
########
name: Scrappy Wallbreaker
move 1: Return
move 2: Superpower
move 3: Facade
move 4: Pursuit / Toxic / Play Rough
ability: Scrappy
item: Choice Band / Silk Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Return is Stoutland's main STAB move. Superpower gives Stoutland perfect neutral coverage in two moves, taking on Rock- and Steel-types, which resist Return. Facade allows Stoutland to absorb burns while still maintaining offensive presence. In the last slot, Pursuit can be used as a way to trap and remove Pokemon such as Misdreauvs, Toxic can cripple defensive switch-ins to Stoutland that can take two Returns, and Play Rough does more immediate damage to Poliwrath and Machoke.


Set Details
========

Attack and Speed are maximized for Stoutland to be as powerful as possible and outspeed everything up to Jolly Barbaracle. An Adamant nature and Choice Band further increase Stoutland's attacking power, allowing it to smash through most walls by strength alone, although Silk Scarf can be used to raise the power of Return and Facade while not locking Stoutland into a single move.

Usage Tips
========

Return is Stoutland's strongest attack and should be used every single turn unless specifically trying to hit a Pokemon with a different coverage move or if Stoutland has a status ailment. Return is enough to break down most walls without a resistance to it or incredible natural bulk and is easily spammable due to Scrappy. Stoutland should be brought in on a double switch or a slow Volt Switch, U-turn, or Baton Pass as often as possible to keep up offensive pressure and force switches, which can wear down opposing teams quite quickly and rack up entry hazard damage. However, switching Stoutland even into uninvested walls such as Pelipper can quickly wear it down in conjunction with entry hazards due to its only passable bulk and lack of resistances, so avoid switching it into strong moves. Even with Facade, don't aim to get Stoutland crippled with status unless it isn't needed for the late-game, as burn and poison wear it down quickly and paralysis makes it slow and easy to KO. However, Stoutland can still be used to absorb status on offensive teams. If running Pursuit, use it for team support rather than super effective coverage, as its power isn't close to Return's unless it's super effective and used on a switch. Be aware that being locked into Pursuit or Toxic can make Stoutland setup fodder, so use them carefully.

Team Options
========

Stealth Rock and Spikes are incredibly beneficial for Stoutland, as they can wear down the few things that can switch into Stoutland. Most notably, Stealth Rock guarantees the 2HKO on Avalugg and Pawniard with Return and boosts the odds of 2HKOing physically defensive Poliwrath to over 50%. Toxic Spikes is also useful for crippling defensive Pokemon forced to switch into Stoutland such as Carracosta or Gourgeist-XL. Slow pivots such as Volt Switch Probopass and Baton Pass Togetic can also give Stoutland more free switches for extra wallbreaking opportunities. Paralysis support from Pokemon such as Grumpig or Stunfisk or Sticky Web support from Leavanny can help patch up Stoutland's average Speed, allowing it to take out the Pokemon that would normally revenge kill it such as Simipour. Spinners appreciate the Pursuit support provided by Stoutland, as it allows them to freely spin without being blocked by Ghost-types such as Misdreavus. Most physical sweepers pair well with Stoutland due to its incredible wallbreaking capabilities. In particular, Rapidash appreciates Stoutland weakening defensive Carracosta and Poliwrath, and Shell Smash Carracosta enjoys the removal of Poliwrath and bulky Grass-types such as Gourgeist. Jumpluff can support Stoutland by taking on the Fighting- and Rock-types that give it trouble and also using U-turn to get Stoutland free switches, in addition to Swords Dance variants enjoying Stoutland's wallbreaking. Arbok can also help Stoutland take on Fighting-types while appreciating the removal of Piloswine and Torterra for Coil sweeps.

Other Options
########

Some other options include Fire Fang and Ice Fang, which are useful for getting coverage on Grass-types. Pursuit can be used to trap opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types, but that is best left to a teammate. Play Rough can be useful coverage to hit Fighting-types. Sleep Talk can be used if you need a Pokemon that can handle being asleep on your team. Substitute can be used to prevent status and ease prediction, but it tends to waste sand turns and is thus not recommended. Work Up can be used to boost Stoutland's Attack.

Checks & Counters
########

**Physical Walls**: Physical walls such as Avalugg and Gourgeist-S can take a hit from Stoutland and either recover off damage or burn Stoutland. Avalugg can't switch directly into a Choice Band Return with Toxic Spikes, Stealth Rock, and sand up as it can be 2HKOed, but it can switch in if entry hazards are not up or it has sacked a teammate. Once Avalugg is in, it can proceed to recover off any damage and stall out the sand. Gourgeist-S can predict a Return and switch in, but risks being 2HKOed by Crunch. Once in, it can burn Stoutland and recover health with Leech Seed. Gourgeist-S can also take advantage of Choice Band Stoutland locked into Return, Superpower, or Wild Charge, as it gets a free switch-in and can proceed to use its utility moves.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types such as Misdreavus, Drifblim, and Haunter can take advantage of Choice Band Stoutland locked into either Return or Superpower as it provides a free switch for them. Drifblim and Misdreavus can burn Stoutland with Will-O-Wisp, and Haunter can either set up a Substitute or damage whatever Stoutland switches out to. However, they have to be wary of Life Orb Stoutland, as it can OHKO them with Crunch.

**Rock-types**: Rock types such as Golem, Barbaracle, and Bastiodon can take advantage of Choice Band Stoutland locked into Return, as they take minimal damage from it. However, Life Orb Stoutland can just OHKO them with Superpower. Rock-types can get around this by baiting the Superpower and bringing in a Pokemon that resists it, as after the Attack drop Stoutland loses some of its power and is easily forced out.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Throh or Poliwrath can survive one hit from Stoutland and KO it with their STAB moves; however, they can not switch directly into Stoutland as they risk being 2HKOed. Throh and Poliwrath can come in on a double switch, a predicted Crunch, or after a teammate has been KOed.

**Other Weather**: Other weather, such as sun, rain, or hail, mitigates Stoutland's Speed boost. Weather teams are fairly obvious, as they carry weather setters such as Carbink, Meowstic, and Volbeat on sun teams and setters such as Murkrow, Meowstic, and Illumise on rain teams.

**Status**: Status such as Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, and Thunder Wave all cripple Stoutland. Burn halves Stoutland's attacking stat and Pokemon such as Gourgeist-S, Camerupt, and Drifblim all commonly carry Will-O-Wisp. Toxic quickly wears down Stoutland and limits the amount of time it can sweep, between Life Orb recoil and Toxic damage; Pokemon such as Avalugg and Bastiodon commonly carry it. Thunder Wave reduces Stoutland's Speed, which is one of the biggest things going for it, Pokemon such as Stunfisk and Grumpig commonly carry Thunder Wave.

**Lack of Sand**: When sand is not up, Stoutland can be easily revenge killed by faster threats, the best way to keep sand around is by keeping Hippopotas alive.
