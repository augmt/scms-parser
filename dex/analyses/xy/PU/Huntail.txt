Overview
########

Huntail has access to both Shell Smash and Baton Pass, giving it the fantastic niche of being able to pass +2 boosts to its teammates. However, it doesn't have too much going for it outside of Shell Smash and Baton Pass. It has a poor offensive movepool and cannot run both Sucker Punch and Shell Smash at the same time, as they are incompatible. Also, it is largely outclassed as an offensive Shell Smasher by Barbaracle and Carracosta. While Huntail doesn't get much outside of SmashPass, it has a good enough niche to deserve consideration on your team.

SmashPass
########
name: SmashPass
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Scald
move 4: Substitute
ability: Swift Swim
item: White Herb
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Shell Smash boosts Huntail's offensive stats by two stages while decreasing its defensive stats by one stage. Baton Pass allows Huntail to pass the boosts it has gained from Shell Smash to a teammate that can make better use of them. Scald is used in case Huntail has to attack the foe, such as if the foe is nearly KOed and Huntail can't safely Baton Pass out. Substitute is for avoiding status and easing Baton Passing, as it can allow a teammate to get in unscathed. Ice Beam can be used to 2HKO Grass-types such as Roselia and Serperior. Iron Defense is an option for boosting Huntail's Defense; however, it should only be used after Huntail has Shell Smashed, as the drops from Shell Smash will nullify the boosts from Iron Defense.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment in HP and Speed lets Huntail take as many hits as possible while being as fast as possible. A Timid nature is used to further increase Huntail's Speed, and White Herb is used to remove the defense drops Huntail gets after a Shell Smash. Swift Swim doubles Huntail's Speed while in rain.

Usage Tips
========

Huntail should be brought in mid- or late-game to try to pass its boosts to a teammate; it should wait until checks and counters to the intended recipient are weakened. Huntail should be brought in on offensively weak Pokemon or Pokemon using resisted moves, such as Glaceon, Lumineon, Pelipper, Basculin locked into Aqua Jet, and Rapidash locked into Flare Blitz; however, be wary of any coverage moves these Pokemon may carry, such as Wild Charge on Rapidash. After coming in, Shell Smash on the switch and then pass out into a teammate that either can take a hit from the current Pokemon or resists the opposing Pokemon's STAB move. Use Substitute if you predict a status move or if you know the foe cannot break Huntail's Substitute. If running Iron Defense, use it after Shell Smash so that the drops will not affect Huntail's boosts. Use Substitute or Baton Pass out on a predicted Sucker Punch, as Sucker Punch will not hit unless you attack the foe, giving you a free turn. If the opposing Pokemon is at low health and is threatening to your intended recipient, then it is better to KO it and Baton Pass next turn.

Team Options
========

Pokemon with Stored Power, such as Glaceon, make for good teammates, as Stored Power increases in power with each boost. Pokemon that can benefit from the stat boosts, such as Bouffalant, Rotom-F, Kingler, Marowak, Tauros, and Ursaring, are also good teammates. Most Pokemon can benefit from the stat boost; however, not all of them have the bulk to take a hit after Huntail passes them a boost. Substitute can help with this; some Pokemon that definitely cannot take a hit but appreciate the boosts include Raichu, Frogadier, Simisage, Simisear, and Simipour. Pokemon that can set up dual screens to help Huntail set up Shell Smash and pass it while taking minimal damage are good teammates; examples include Serperior and Meowstic.

Other Options
########

Unfortunately, Sucker Punch cannot be used in conjunction with Shell Smash, so while it might seem like a good option on Huntail, it is not advised. An offensive physical variant of Huntail with Shell Smash can be used, but its main niche is being able to pass its boosts to teammates. Super Fang can be used as an attacking option; being able to cripple walls can be nice.

Checks & Counters
########

**Phazing / Haze**: Pokemon such as Avalugg, Bastiodon, and Grumpig can phaze Huntail out with Roar or Whirlwind, while Poliwrath and Throh can phaze Huntail out with Circle Throw. Pokemon that have the move Haze, such as Altaria and Garbodor can stop Huntail from boosting and passing its boosts. They can switch directly into Huntail when it uses Shell Smash and then either take minimal damage from Huntail's Scald and then phaze, or use Haze on the Baton Pass and nullify the boosts. Poliwrath gets a special mention, as it is immune to Huntail's STAB move and can phaze Huntail out with Circle Throw.

**Taunt**: Pokemon such as Serperior, Misdreavus, and Vigoroth can Taunt Huntail and prevent it from setting up; however, they have to be in before Huntail boosts, as it can easily Baton Pass out to a sweeper for free if they try to Taunt it after it has boosted.

**Priority Encore**: With Prankster, Volbeat can switch directly into Huntail while it tries to boost, Encore Huntail into Shell Smash, and then U-turn out into something to take advantage of Encore-locked Huntail.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Serperior, Gogoat, and Torterra can all threaten Huntail with a super effective move; however, because Huntail can just Baton Pass out into an appropriate sweeper, the Grass-type has to be in before Huntail boosts for it to be an effective check.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Electrode and Raichu can OHKO Huntail with a super effective move; however, they must do so before Huntail boosts, or else it will just Baton Pass out into an appropriate sweeper.

**Strong Offensive Presence**: Strong offensive Pokemon such as Poliwrath, Tauros, and Choice Band Torterra can all either KO Huntail or seriously injure the incoming Baton Pass recipient, making it an easy revenge kill for any priority attack.
