Overview
########
Glalie fills a niche as an effective suicide entry hazard lead in PU thanks to its access to useful moves such as Spikes, which it can reliably set up, Taunt, and Explosion, in addition to its decent stats. However, Glalie doesn't have any niche outside of this and is hopelessly outclassed in any other role.

Suicide Lead
########
name: Suicide Lead
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Taunt
move 4: Explosion
ability: Inner Focus
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Hasty

Moves
========

Glalie can set Spikes up quite effectively thanks to its decent Speed stat. Focus Sash usually lets Glalie set up at least one layer of Spikes. Ice Beam is a reliable STAB move that has good coverage, prevents Glalie from being Taunt bait, and hits decently hard with maximum Special Attack investment, 2HKOing Golem leads. Taunt can stop Defoggers from removing entry hazards and is a must on this set. Taunt also reliably stops Kricketune from setting up Sticky Web, a great threat to offensive teams, and, with prediction, can also stop other entry hazard leads from getting up Stealth Rock. Explosion is used in the final moveslot because it is Glalie's best way of stopping Rapid Spin users; it can also grant a teammate a free switch in and does decent damage to most offensive Pokemon.

Set Details
========

Speed and Special Attack EVs are maximized to let Glalie outspeed most other leads, set up as many layers of Spikes as possible, and make Ice Beam hit fairly hard. A Hasty nature is used to give more power to Glalie's Explosion while letting it survive two Shadow Balls from Timid Misdreavus so that you can beat it with Ice Beam if it Taunts you. Focus Sash is the item of choice because it lets Glalie set up at least one layer of Spikes against offensive Pokemon and usually two against slower ones. Inner Focus stops Fake Out from flinching Glalie, which is very useful against Pokemon such as Purugly, guaranteeing that at least one layer of Spikes is set up.

Usage Tips
========

Glalie is very effective as a lead on offensive teams, as it can guarantee its Focus Sash remains intact and start setting up Spikes, which Glalie should try to set up as many of as possible. Glalie should only use Taunt if you are confident the foe will not attack. Kricketune is one of the only exceptions, as Glalie can safely Taunt it before it can use a Taunt of its own or set up Sticky Web. Glalie should also use Taunt against Defoggers to prevent them from removing entry hazards. Finally, Explosion should be used against Rapid Spin users or once Glalie has set up three layers of Spikes.

Team Options
========

Spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Haunter are a must when using Glalie; they fit well on offensive teams, and the former can use Taunt to stop Wartortle from using Foresight. Stealth Rock setters such as Rampardos and Golem also fit well on offensive teams and complement Glalie's Spikes. Offensive Pokemon such as Scyther and Raichu appreciate entry hazard support, as they force quite a lot of switches and residual damage can rack up very fast against their checks; Raichu also outspeeds and OHKOes most Defog users. Most of the checks to Normal-types such as Tauros, Purugly, and Dodrio are grounded and have no reliable recovery moves, so they are greatly weakened by Spikes; thus, Normal-types make for great partners. Glalie is also a nice Spikes setter on sand teams thanks to its ability to both keep Grass-types away with its Ice-type STAB moves and to lure and weaken Water-types with Explosion. Such teams also appreciate Spikes weakening Stoutland's checks and have a Stealth Rock setter, such as Hippopotas, to complement Spikes.

Other Options
########

Glalie should stick with the listed moveset, as it really doesn't have other viable options. Any offensive set is outclassed by more powerful and bulky Ice-types such as Rotom-F and Aurorus, and bulky sets are done better by Regice and Lapras. Ice Shard is one of the other moves Glalie can use on its suicide lead set, as it can be useful to pick off weakened faster Pokemon.

Checks & Counters
########

**Faster Taunt Users**: Speedy Taunt users such as Misdreavus and Haunter can shut Glalie down before it can set up Spikes. Electrode, Purugly, and Sneasel also sometimes carry Taunt and can stop Glalie in its tracks.

**Swanna and Lumineon**: While not directly threatening to Glalie, Swanna and Lumineon can outspeed it and use Defog before Glalie can use Taunt or Explosion, thus removing its entry hazards. However, they should be careful of Taunt or Explosion on the switch.
