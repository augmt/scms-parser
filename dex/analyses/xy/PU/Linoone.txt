Overview
########

Access to both Belly Drum and STAB Extreme Speed makes Linoone a terrifying late-game cleaner in the PU metagame. At +6 Attack it can sweep entire teams, and it possesses the coverage to defeat most Pokemon that it cannot hit neutrally with Extreme Speed. Moreover, Extreme Speed's +2 priority makes revenge killing Linoone a challenge. Linoone fits very well on hyper offense teams that struggle against defensive teams. However, getting Linoone in to set up is tricky because of its poor bulk. It also cannot hit Steel-types super effectively, and is easily walled by them as a result. Linoone is also a liability against offensive teams; hyper offense can prevent it from setting up a Belly Drum, and Linoone is, even at +6, walled by most bulky offense teams.

Belly Drum
########
name: Belly Drum
move 1: Belly Drum
move 2: Extreme Speed
move 3: Shadow Claw
move 4: Seed Bomb
ability: Pickup
item: Sitrus Berry
evs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Def / 40 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Belly Drum maximizes Linoone's Attack, raising it to a whopping 1048. Extreme Speed provides Linoone with reliable, STAB-boosted priority and makes Linoone very difficult to revenge kill. Shadow Claw hits Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus and Haunter, which are immune to Extreme Speed. Seed Bomb provides valuable Grass-type coverage against Rock-types such as Barbaracle, Carracosta, and Golem, which resist Extreme Speed.

Set Details
========

An Adamant nature and maximum investment in Attack are necessary in order to make Linoone hit as hard as possible. The given EVs for HP, Defense, and Special Defense maximize Linoone's bulk. Linoone doesn't need to invest in Speed because of Extreme Speed's +2 priority. A Sitrus Berry restores Linoone's HP after it uses Belly Drum, thus allowing it to stay alive for slightly longer and net a few more KOs in the process, and allows Linoone to set up Belly Drum more than once if it needs to. Pickup is the preferred ability, as Gluttony is all but useless without a pinch Berry and Quick Feet is illegal with Extreme Speed. Pickup has some limited use; once Linoone uses its Sitrus Berry, it might steal a foe's consumable item. If you want Linoone to outspeed Haunter, Drifblim, and Misdreavus, a Jolly nature and an EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe is required.

Usage Tips
========

For the most part, do not set up Linoone against offensive Pokemon, as they will often be able to quickly deal serious damage to it. However, Linoone can set up against a few foes such as Choice-locked Rotom and Mr. Mime as well as Raichu and Ninetales before a Nasty Plot boost. Otherwise, only set up on a weakened foe&mdash; possibly from a teammate's Memento&mdash; or if dual screens are on your side of the field. Be sure that whatever Linoone sets up on does not bring it below 25% of its HP, as it needs at least that much to activate Sitrus Berry and still be able to use Belly Drum. This set is used for late-game cleaning and can only be used once, so set up Linoone wisely. If you must use a coverage move, Linoone will often move last due to its uninvested Speed. Moveover, Linoone must be wary of defensive walls that can tank a hit at +6, as they can retaliate and often KO Linoone in the process; opposing physical walls should be weakened before Linoone attempts to set up.

Team Options
========

Linoone only fits on offensive teams that are built around it. Linoone appreciates entry hazard support to give it an easier time against physical walls. Marowak is a good choice for this role, as it does not share Linoone's Fighting-type weakness, unlike most Stealth Rock setters. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Armaldo and Pelipper is necessary to give Linoone enough HP to use Belly Drum. A naturally fast wallbreaker such as Simipour will not only beat other fast Pokemon that can KO Linoone at 75% health, such as Haunter, but will also wear down physically defensive Pokemon in order to aid Linoone's sweep. Linoone appreciates support from dual screens and Memento in order to have an easier time setting up. Carbink and Meowstic-M can provide dual screens; Misdreavus and Drifblim can use Memento. Dark-types such as Sneasel and Pawniard can beat the Ghost-types that give Linoone trouble, while a Fighting- or Fire-type such as Poliwrath or Ninetales, respectively, can beat Steel-types, which Linoone struggles against.

Other Options
########

Linoone can use Gunk Shot to OHKO Tangela and Quilladin after it sets up a Belly Drum. It has another coverage option in Play Rough, but most Pokemon that are hit by Play Rough for super effective damage, such as Poliwrath, already get hit hard with Extreme Speed. Play Rough's imperfect accuracy can cause problems as well. Double-Edge is a more powerful STAB attack that can OHKO Tangela, Torterra, and Piloswine without entry hazard support, but it wears down Linoone very quickly. A Choice Band can be used to make Linoone a decent revenge killer with Extreme Speed, but such a set lacks power, and a Rock- or Ghost-type can easily disrupt it. If using Choice Band, Linoone can use Switcheroo to lock foes into undesirable moves. It also cripples the Ghost-type special attackers Misdreavus and Haunter, both of which typically switch into Linoone. Salac Berry, Gluttony, and max Speed allow Linoone to outspeed Choice Scarf Haunter. Lum Berry allows Linoone to set up on defensive Pokemon that carry status-inducing moves. Rock Smash specifically hits Probopass, which otherwise walls Linoone completely. Lansat Berry with Gluttony can help bypass some of Linoone's checks on occasion, but such a strategy is unreliable.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fast Ghost-types**: Drifblim, Haunter, and Misdreavus are perhaps Linoone's biggest offensive checks in the tier. They are not only immune to Extreme Speed, but also outspeed Linoone and can OHKO it before it can use Shadow Claw.

**Steel-types**: Many Steel-types such as Probopass, Pawniard, and Klang can easily take a +6 Extreme Speed. In return, they can all wear down Linoone offensively.

**Status**: Linoone hates status of all kinds. Toxic drastically reduces the length of its sweep, paralysis might render it unable to move, and burn halves its damage output.

**Physical Walls**: Even at +6, Linoone fails to break most physical walls, such as Torterra, Quilladin, Tangela, and Avalugg. The first two aforementioned walls can Roar Linoone out of the battlefield as well.

**Offensive Pressure**: Most offensive teams can keep up the pressure and make it very difficult for Linoone to set up. Nearly all offensive Pokemon can bring Linoone to under 25% HP, preventing it from using Belly Drum.
