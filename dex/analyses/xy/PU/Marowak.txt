Overview
########

Marowak's niches over other Ground-types are Thick Club, which doubles its Attack, and Bonemerang, which is capable of breaking through Substitute and OHKOing Pokemon with Sturdy, such as Golem and Bastiodon, thanks to its multi-hit effect. Marowak has a good offensive movepool that lets it function well as a wallbreaker. It has access to Stealth Rock, which hurts opponents on the switch-in, especially those weak to Rock-type attacks. However, if Marowak loses its Thick Club, it loses most of its usefulness. Its decent physical bulk is let down by its poor special bulk and weaknesses to common Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks. Marowak also has a low Speed stat; however, its low Speed can be overcome by using Marowak alongside Sticky Web, paralysis, or Trick Room support.

move 1: Bonemerang
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Double-Edge / Stone Edge
move 4: Substitute / Stealth Rock
ability: Rock Head / Battle Armor
item: Thick Club
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Bonemerang breaks through Sturdy, Focus Sash, and Substitute, which is very useful. Knock Off hits bulky Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gourgeist harder, can cripple several Eviolite users, and is safe to use if you cannot predict what the opponent is about to do. Double-Edge is a good option, as it has a high Base Power and hits Pokemon that do not resist it extremely hard. Stone Edge should only be used over Double-Edge along with Stealth Rock, as without it, Marowak misses out on many important KOs with Stone Edge. Stealth Rock is a great entry hazard, and Marowak threatens several Defog users with Stone Edge or Double-Edge after Stealth Rock is set up. Substitute allows Marowak to take advantage of the switches it forces, and Substitute keeps it safe from faster Pokemon and gives it a buffer against moves such as Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp. Earthquake can be used for a more accurate Ground-type STAB move, but doesn't break through Substitutes or Sturdy.

Set Details
========

Rock Head is the best ability to use if Marowak is running Double-Edge, as it prevents recoil damage, but Battle Armor should be used if Stone Edge is run. Thick Club doubles Marowak's Attack. Max Attack EVs and an Adamant nature maximize Marowak's offensive power. 252 Speed EVs are invested to Speed tie max Speed Golem, and also allow Marowak to outspeed uninvested Pokemon that have base 65 to 70 Speed, such as Mantine, Roselia, and Pelipper. Marowak can also retain some bulk by running a spread of 104 HP / 252 Atk / 152 Spe to outspeed Adamant Carracosta, or a 212 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Spe spread to outspeed Lickilicky.

Usage Tips
========

This set is good to use in the lead position when predicting a Pokemon with Sturdy to come in, such as Golem or Gigalith, as Marowak can stop them from setting up Stealth Rock by threatening them with Bonemerang. Stealth Rock should be used when running Stone Edge, as it helps to achieve KOs on bulky Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Pelipper and Avalugg. However, Substitute is useful when predicting a switch, as it will allow Marowak to avoid burns and item removal. When you predict one of Marowak's checks or counters will come in, use Knock Off, which will cripple that Pokemon by removing its item, which will prove useful later in the game. Watch out when the foe has access to Trick, Switcheroo, or Knock Off, as removing Marowak's Thick Club really lowers its usefulness. Marowak can switch into Choice-locked Electric-types and prevent them from using Electric-type moves, most notably Volt Switch, giving Marowak a free turn as it forces the opponent to switch. Marowak should be wary of the coverage moves that Electric-types generally carry, however.

Team Options
========

Sticky Web support is quite useful, as it lowers the opponent's Speed, allowing Marowak to outspeed and put the hurt on a lot more Pokemon. Examples of Sticky Web users include Kricketune and Ariados. Thunder Wave support is also quite handy, as Marowak can outspeed any paralyzed Pokemon in the tier, despite its low Speed. Fire-types, which can absorb Will-O-Wisp, especially those with Flash Fire, such as Flareon or Heatmor, make for good partners, as Marowak is really hampered by it. Guts users such as Throh can also absorb burns well. Teammates that can get rid of Grass-types which threaten Marowak are really useful too, such as Sneasel. Pokemon that beat offensive Water- and Ice-types are good teammates, such as Rotom-F and offensive Tangela, as these threaten Marowak. Trick Room users, such as Carbink, allow Marowak to move first without having to risk an incoming burn from a faster Pokemon. If you're using a Trick Room team, Marowak is a great choice because of its low Speed stat, but make sure Marowak is Brave-natured with no Speed investment and 0 Speed IVs.


Other Options
########

Swords Dance is a possibility to boost Marowak's Attack even further, but it gives the opponent a free turn to hit Marowak for super effective damage or set up. Don't run any item other than Thick Club, as Marowak is outclassed by other Pokemon such as Golem when running another item. Fire Punch is another option for hitting Grass- and Ice-types more effectively, and most importantly 2HKOes Tangela. Counter can be used to hit physical threats after they attack you, as Marowak can take physical hits, but Counter isn't really good as it doesn't do anything to special attackers. Toxic cripples defensive Pokemon such as Tangela and the Gourgeist formes, but they are crippled by Knock Off already.


Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Grass-types**: Grass-types are really good checks to Marowak, as Marowak has a hard time standing up to them. Examples are Tangela, Torterra, and Gourgeist-XL, and though Knock Off is debilitating, they still wall Marowak and threaten it back effectively.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Poliwrath, Pelipper, and Mantine, can take a hit and burn Marowak with Scald, though the latter two have to be wary of Stone Edge, meaning they can't safely switch in.

**Specially offensive Pokemon**: Pokemon with good Special Attack can easily revenge kill Marowak, especially Pokemon with a typing advantage over Marowak, such as Swanna.

**Will-O-Wisp users**: Faster Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp can easily deal with Marowak, as they can burn it and stall it out or directly KO it, but they have to make sure Marowak does not have a Substitute up.

**Item Removal**: Item-removing attacks, such as Trick, Switcheroo, and Knock Off, remove Thick Club, making Marowak useless.

**Avalugg**: Avalugg has enough bulk to take a hit from Marowak and can KO it with Avalanche, though it cannot easily switch in safely as Stone Edge 2HKOes it.
