Overview
########

Ariados is a rather outclassed Pokemon in PU. While it does have a niche in having access to both Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes, there are better users of Sticky Web, mainly Kricketune and Leavanny, and Toxic Spikes aren't always worthwhile. While this entry hazard combination makes Ariados seem like an amazing lead for offensive teams, it has quite a few things holding it back. Firstly, Ariados is incredibly slow, especially for a lead, making it complete Taunt bait and easy to KO. Not only is Ariados incredibly prone to being Taunted, but it also can't do much damage at all to any Taunt users. Ariados's vulnerability to Taunt aside, it is still hard to set up both Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes against most teams. Finally, Ariados absolutely needs its Focus Sash to be effective, requiring team support to function effectively when not leading.

Lead
########
name: Lead
move 1: Sticky Web
move 2: Toxic Spikes
move 3: Megahorn
move 4: Sucker Punch / Poison Jab
ability: Insomnia
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

While Sticky Web is on the opponent's side of the field, the Speed of a foe switching in is lowered by one stage, allowing your powerful wallbreakers to become threatening sweepers. Toxic Spikes wears down foes very quickly, especially those on offensive teams holding a Life Orb, and cripples walls, making them easier to KO. Ariados's STAB Megahorn hits fairly hard, despite its mediocre base 90 Attack and keeps it from being complete Taunt bait for the likes of Misdreavus and Kricketune. Sucker Punch is recommended in the last moveslot due to its priority, but Poison Jab can be used to 2HKO Togetic, deterring it from using Defog against Ariados.

Set Details
========

Focus Sash is required on the set, as it allows Ariados to set up at least one layer of entry hazards if it isn't Taunted first. Maximum Speed and Attack investment allow Ariados to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, including Adamant Golem and Marowak, and deal as much damage to foes as possible. Insomnia is helpful to prevent Ariados from being put to sleep by the occasional Sleep Powder or Hypnosis. However, Swarm can be used because sleep-inducing moves are relatively uncommon in PU, and Megahorn hits rather hard when Ariados is brought down to its Focus Sash, as it is boosted by Swarm.

Usage Tips
========

Ariados should be used to set up Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes early-game and is best used as a suicide lead. Only if the opponent has an entry hazard remover or a Taunt-using lead such as Kricketune or Barbaracle should you not lead with Ariados. If your opponent has a more offensively inclined team, set up Sticky Web and at least one layer of Toxic Spikes if possible, but try to set up two layers of Toxic Spikes against more defensive and stall teams. Ariados should be attacking only if it is given a free turn or neither entry hazard helps your team much, so take advantage of Team Preview as much as possible. Also, be wary of opposing grounded Poison-types, as they can remove Toxic Spikes by switching in.

Team Options
========

Strong, slow wallbreakers such as Beheeyem, Bouffalant, Flareon, and Marowak make good partners for Ariados, as they appreciate Sticky Web. Pokemon that can pressure grounded Poison-types also make for good partners, as they can keep these Pokemon from switching in and instantly removing Toxic Spikes. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Haunter make for decent teammates for their ability to keep foes from using Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards. Purugly makes for a good partner thanks to its ability to deter opposing Defoggers through Defiant. Electric-types such as Raikou, Luxray, and Zebstrika pressure opposing Flying-types, which are immune to Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes and can carry Defog to remove entry hazards. Fast attackers such as Sneasel and Raichu are helpful in case Sticky Web is removed or not set up in the first place.

Other Options
########

Ariados doesn't really have many other viable options, especially because its only real niche is having access to both Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes; however, it has a few niche moves it can use. A weather support set with Sunny Day could be used, but it is very outclassed by other sun setters. Also, Night Shade can be used to deal decent damage to Steel- and Ghost-types.

Checks & Counters
########

**Entry Hazard Removers**: Rapid Spin users, such as Avalugg and Wartortle, can spin away Ariados's entry hazards with ease. Avalugg takes very little damage from Megahorn and can 2HKO Ariados with Avalanche or spin away entry hazards. Also, Defog users, such as Pelipper and Swanna, can clear away Ariados's entry hazards with ease.

**Rock-types**: Rock-types take almost no damage from Megahorn and can set up Stealth Rock and phaze Ariados out. Bastiodon has Magic Coat to bounce back Ariados's entry hazards. Golem takes very little damage from either of Ariados's attacks and can KO it with Rock Blast, especially in a lead matchup. Barbaracle can Taunt Ariados to prevent it from setting up entry hazards and set up its own Stealth Rock.

**Poison-types**: Poison-types resist Ariados's STAB moves and can basically do whatever they want. For example, Arbok can set up, and Haunter can Taunt Ariados or set up a Substitute, but it must be wary of Sucker Punch. Grounded Poison-types also absorb the Toxic Spikes that Ariados sets.

**Purugly**: Purugly has a decent chance to KO Ariados with Fake Out + Return if it is running a Silk Scarf, a guaranteed KO if it is running a Life Orb. Additionally, it can take advantage of the Speed drop from Sticky Web for a +2 Attack boost thanks to Defiant.

**Taunt**: Faster users of Taunt such as Kricketune and Misdreavus can stop Ariados in its tracks; the former two are also able to set up entry hazards of their own.

**Misdreavus**: Misdreavus has Taunt to stop Ariados from setting up entry hazards and takes very little from Ariados's STAB moves, allowing it to easily set up Nasty Plot.
