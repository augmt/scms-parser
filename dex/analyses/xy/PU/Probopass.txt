Overview
########

Probopass is one of the best pivots in PU thanks to its access to Volt Switch along with its high bulk and typing, as they allow it to check a variety of special threats; however, it loses to common Ground-types and coverage moves but still manages to take on physical attackers that don't have Ground-type coverage moves. Probopass works nicely both on offensive and defensive teams because it can run various sets thanks to access to both Sturdy and Magnet Pull, various utility moves, and decent coverage. Probopass's lack of firepower on defensive sets is compensated most of the time by the utility it provides, which mainly consists of crippling the enemy team with residual damage or slowing it down with Thunder Wave; however, Probopass still lacks any form of reliable recovery, so it shouldn't take unnecessary damage and get worn down.

Offensive Pivot
########
name: Offensive Pivot
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Flash Cannon
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Stealth Rock / Thunder Wave
ability: Magnet Pull
item: Leftovers / Air Balloon
evs: 172 HP / 252 SpA / 84 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Volt Switch is what makes Probopass act as a pivot, allowing it to gain free turns and bring teammates in safely. Flash Cannon is Probopass's main STAB move and is used to hit the majority of the tier really hard, especially Fairy- and Rock-types such as Mr. Mime, Togetic, Golem, and Armaldo, respectively. Earth Power is used mainly to KO Steel-types once Probopass has trapped them with Magnet Pull; it can also be used to damage Fire-types if Probopass isn't running Power Gem. Stealth Rock deals chip damage to the foes every time they switch in, and it works well with the momentum the team gains with Volt Switch. Thunder Wave cripples and limits the potential of fast enemy Pokemon such as Kadabra and Jumpluff, which tear offensive teams apart. Power Gem is Probopass's alternate STAB move, which hits Flying-types such as Jumpluff and Fire-types such as Ninetales and Heatmor harder than Earth Power. Toxic is an option to rack up residual damage against bulky Ground-type Pokemon such as Torterra and specially defensive walls in general, as Flash Cannon won't do that much to a lot of them.

Set Details
========

172 HP EVs make Probopass a bit bulkier so it can tank a few neutral hits while running an offensive set. Maximum Special Attack investment paired with a Modest nature gives Probopass as much firepower as possible and allow it to deal significant damage and open holes in the enemy team. 84 Speed EVs make Probopass outspeed common Stealth Rock leads and pivot out from common Pokemon with 50 or less base Speed, especially special walls such as Lickilicky. Magnet Pull is a game-changing ability, as it puts massive pressure on the Steel-type foes that can get trapped and KOed easily. Leftovers keeps Probopass healthy even as it takes Stealth Rock damage. Air Balloon is an option to have a temporary immunity to a Ground-type move, allowing Probopass to check a lot of Pokemon.

Usage Tips
========

This set should be used as a pivot because Probopass is one of the best pivots, checking special attackers such as Haunter, Ninetales, and Misdreavus while having the ability to Volt Switch out into a more favorable matchup. Probopass should Volt Switch most of the time to gain momentum for the team, especially after it switches in on Pokemon it walls, such as Zebstrika and Chatot, as they will probably switch out. Volt Switch should not be used when the opponent carries Pokemon immune to Electric-type moves, especially Ground-types such as Piloswine, Golem, and Torterra. Be careful when checking offensive Pokemon with this variant of Probopass, especially ones with good coverage, because its typing makes it really vulnerable to Ground- and Fighting-type coverage moves from Pokemon such as Raichu, Rapidash, and Stoutland. If the opponent has troublesome special attacking threats, such as Ninetales and Rotom-F, or Steel-type Pokemon, such as Pawniard and Klang, on their team, keep Probopass healthy to make sure it can trap them and win in 1v1 situations.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Steel-types, such as Togetic, Jumpluff, Leafeon, Tangela, and Gourgeist-XL, are good teammates for Probopass, as many can also easily check or stall out Water- and Ground-types that trouble Probopass, such as Simipour, Poliwrath, and Marowak. Spikes support is good when paired with Volt Switch pressure and the decent firepower of Probopass, causing foes to take high damage when they switch out and sometimes forcing them to stay in, giving Probopass a chance to cripple them with Thunder Wave. Offensive spinblockers, such as Misdreavus and Haunter, prevent entry hazards from being removed and also appreciate having Steel-types worn down, giving them the opportunity to run other coverage moves, as Hidden Power Fighting will be less needed. Chatot highly appreciates trapping of Steel-types, such as Probopass and Pawniard, as they can easily handle it. Slow Pokemon with an offensive presence that can make use of enemies slowed by Thunder Wave, such as Marowak, Poliwrath, and Pawniard, are also decent alongside Probopass.


Defensive Stealth Rock
########
name: Defensive Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Thunder Wave / Toxic
move 4: Power Gem / Flash Cannon
ability: Sturdy
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 168 SpD / 84 Spe
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Stealth Rock pressures the enemy team, as it deals damage to foes every time they switch in and breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy. Volt Switch makes Probopass an excellent pivot, letting it safely switch out and gain momentum and free turns for the team. Thunder Wave cripples opposing offensive Pokemon, slowing them and making them more easy to kill with a slow-paced team. Toxic puts a timer on opposing walls, forcing them to switch and take damage from Stealth Rock if they switch in again. Earth Power allows Probopass to hit Steel-type Pokemon really hard, especially other Probopass and Pawniard, but also makes Probopass setup fodder, as Earth Power is weaker than Probopass's main STAB moves. Power Gem is a STAB move that can be useful most of the time to hit Flying- and Fire-types. Flash Cannon is also a STAB move that is used to hit Fairy- and Ice-types, and it has a decent chance to lower a foe's Special Defense, usually causing them to switch out.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP investment and 168 Special Defense EVs allow Probopass to stay alive as long as possible, though it lacks any form of reliable recovery aside from Leftovers. The EVs also allow it to tank any hits from special attackers such as Ninetales with ease, checking and crippling them thanks to Thunder Wave or Toxic. 84 Speed EVs let Probopass outspeed slow uninvested Stealth Rock setters such as Golem and Armaldo. Sturdy lets Probopass set up Stealth Rock safely and tank at least one hit most of the time. Leftovers provides Probopass with passive recovery, which helps it to make up for residual damage and keep Sturdy intact.

Usage Tips
========

Probopass works best as a pivot, so try to use it to wall dangerous threats such as Zebstrika, Ninetales, and Chatot, and set up Stealth Rock or a status move to cripple the enemy team or just Volt Switch away immediately. Probopass's main priority when running a defensive set is to get Stealth Rock up as soon as possible to pressure foes, especially against Pokemon it walls, such as Ninetales and Rotom-F, and rack up more residual damage against the enemy team. Even though Probopass is known for being an excellent wall against special attackers, be wary about switching into Pokemon such as Kadabra, which might carry Hidden Power Fighting and other coverage against it. Because Probopass gives a lot of utility to a team, try to not lose it early in the battle, especially if it has to check a specific threat on the enemy team, such as Pawniard or Jumpluff, as it lacks recovery. Don't be overconfident with Sturdy if the foe can KO Probopass easily; it's nice to have guaranteed Stealth Rock or cripple a foe early, but Probopass will probably be needed throughout the game, with Sturdy also being important as a last-ditch play to cripple a setup sweeper such as Leafeon or Misdreavus.

Team Options
========

On hazard-stacking teams, Spikes setters such as Roselia and Whirlipede are good with Probopass to stack up residual damage along with spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Haunter, which keep entry hazards safe from Rapid Spin. Sweepers and cleaners that appreciate Stealth Rock and Toxic residual damage, foes crippled by Thunder Wave, and being brought into the field safely thanks to Volt Switch, such as Kadabra, Regice, and Ursaring, are good teammates. Defensive teams love the support given by defensive Probopass, as it gives them a bulky Stealth Rock setter and a Pokemon that can set momentum, work as a pivot thanks to Volt Switch, and has a possibility to cripple or wear down foes with Thunder Wave and Toxic. Slow teams benefit from Thunder Wave to revenge kill threats, and Toxic fits stalling strategies well. Bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangela and Torterra check Ground- and Water-types Pokemon for Probopass and also appreciate Volt Switch in addition to Thunder Wave and Toxic support.

Other Options
########

Taunt is an option to prevent utility Pokemon such as Grumpig from supporting their team force them to switch, or to stop slow entry hazard setters such as Golem, Quilladin, and Armaldo from setting up. Magic Coat is also viable to bounce back status moves, entry hazards, and moves such as Whirlwind or Roar. Pain Split or Chesto Berry and Rest could be used on a defensive set to give Probopass a form of recovery, though they are unreliable. Magnet Rise on an offensive set can give Probopass an immunity to Ground-type moves and allow it to check a lot of offensive threats in the tier such as Golem, Armaldo , and Marowak. Rock Polish makes Probopass an unexpected setup sweeper that can punish switches hard, finding a lot of ways to set up thanks to its high bulk and Sturdy.

Checks & Counters
########

**Water-types**: Water-type Pokemon such as Poliwrath, Simipour, and Carracosta can tank some hits and deal massive damage to Probopass with their Water-type STAB moves, so most of the time Probopass will be forced to switch out, though they don't appreciate taking a Thunder Wave or Toxic.

**Ground-types**: Ground-type Pokemon such as Marowak, Torterra, and Piloswine don't appreciate getting hit by STAB Flash Cannon or Toxic, but can check Probopass well by preventing it from using Volt Switch, therefore killing momentum and easily KO Probopass with their Ground-type STAB moves. Marowak is notable as it can OHKO Probopass despite Sturdy with Bonemerang.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-type Pokemon that have high bulk and decent damage output, such as Poliwrath, are optimal counters to Probopass, as they can tank a lot of hits and recover the damage with Rest or directly KO Probopass with their STAB moves.

**Super Effective Coverage**: Coverage moves such as Hidden Power Ground and Hidden Power Fighting are viable on specially offensive Pokemon that could struggle against Probopass, such as Misdreavus, Haunter, Grumpig, and Mr. Mime, but they still don't appreciate being hit by Flash Cannon most of the time. Other coverage moves such as Superpower on Stoutland threaten Probopass a lot, making Pokemon that Probopass should wall very threatening.

**Bulky Pokemon** : Bulky Pokemon, especially special walls such as Lickilicky and Roselia, don't care about any hit from Probopass, as most of them have reliable recovery. However, Volt Switch can catch them off guard, letting Probopass pivot out to a favorable matchup. They also dislike Thunder Wave and Toxic, which cripple them and cause them to waste a turn using Heal Bell.
