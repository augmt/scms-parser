Overview
########
Thanks to Simple, after a single use of Calm Mind, Swoobat's Special Attack reaches threatening levels. Also in Swoobat's favor is its access to Stored Power, a STAB attack that works well in conjunction with Calm Mind, becoming pretty powerful after just one use of the latter, and its Base Power can further increase should Swoobat acquire a boost from whichever Berry you choose to run. Even before a Salac Berry boost, Swoobat outspeeds the majority of the unboosted metagame. However, it needs a boost to inflict any significant damage, and Stored Power is pathetically weak off the bat. It also has limited setup opportunities because of its horrible bulk. Furthermore, it struggles against stall teams, as a mediocre Special Attack stat means that Swoobat requires multiple boosts to get past walls. Additionally, Swoobat is beaten by common threats such as Sneasel and weak to Stealth Rock. To top it all off, it is vulnerable to priority and prone to being revenge killed if it isn't behind a Substitute though a Kee Berry can somewhat mitigate this.

Moves
========
Courtesy of Simple, Calm Mind grants Swoobat great destructive potential and ups its STAB move to 100 Base Power. Stored Power is the aforementioned STAB option; it takes advantage of the boosts that Swoobat accumulates. Signal Beam hits opposing Psychic-types, Mightyena, and Sneasel for super effective damage. Substitute protects Swoobat from being revenge killed, and pushes its HP closer to Salac Berry range while offering Swoobat protection against status conditions. Roost is to be used in conjunction with a Kee Berry; a Defense boost enables Swoobat to actually take hits, so a recovery move is ideal for keeping Swoobat alive for as long as possible. Roost can prove particularly useful against Electric-types to remove Swoobat's weakness to their STAB moves. Heat Wave is an option for the third moveslot, as it has excellent neutral coverage with Stored Power; notably, it hits the Steel-types that resist Stored Power, such as Klang and Metang, and retains coverage on the ever-irksome Sneasel. Another option for the third moveslot is Air Slash, as it is a secondary STAB attack that has great neutral coverage with Stored Power, and its flinch chance can come in handy.

Set Details
========
The EV spread lets Swoobat do as much damage and outspeed as many foes as it can, while hitting an HP number that lets it get a Salac boost after three uses of Substitute. A Timid nature bolsters Swoobat's great Speed stat further. A Salac Berry provides a +2 boost to Swoobat when it hits 25% of its health or less , allowing it to outspeed the entirety of the unboosted metagame and upping Stored Power's Base Power to 140. Alternatively, a Kee Berry can be chosen instead, as at +2 Defense, Swoobat has an easier time setting up and takes the multitude of priority attacks in the tier better, notably taking less than 50% from Piloswine's Ice Shard. Simple doubles Swoobat's stat changes and is the reason to use Swoobat in the first place.

Usage Tips
========
Swoobat should aim to set up Calm Mind as soon as possible on a Pokemon that can't do much to it, such as Poliwrath (though the latter can phaze Swoobat out with Circle Throw if it isn't behind a Substitute). Use Substitute if you predict a status move such as Thunder Wave. If Swoobat is against a foe without a priority attack that it cannot KO, use Substitute until it gets to Salac Berry activation range to boost Stored Power to 140 Base Power. Swoobat shouldn't attempt to set up if the opponent has something capable of stopping it, as it can only really set up once throughout the battle. Swoobat should only attempt to activate its Salac Berry when it is going to need the Speed boost, as a lot of the time Swoobat would prefer to be at high health. Swoobat should never switch in on anything if it is holding a Salac Berry; instead, it should be sent out to revenge kill or force a foe out and set up. However, should you opt for Kee Berry, bringing Swoobat in on a weak or resisted physical attack can be a good method of reliably acquiring the boost. Bear in mind that even when Swoobat gains a boost to its Defense, it is still prone to being taken out by powerful physical attacks, so Swoobat should be careful when attempting to set up against a physical attacker. Roost should be used if Swoobat has been worn down and it finds an opportunity, such as when it forces a foe out and it has already netted a Calm Mind boost.

Team Options
========
For a frail setup sweeper like Swoobat, dual screens support from a teammate such as Meowstic-M or Solrock is ideal. Special wallbreakers such as Mega Camerupt and Aurorus can soften up special walls. Poliwrath makes for a good teammate, as it has decent synergy with Swoobat and beats Sneasel, Kecleon, Bastiodon, and Piloswine, which are all troublesome for Swoobat. Solrock can set up Stealth Rock in addition to the aforementioned dual screens. Priority attackers such as Sneasel and Carracosta can assist Swoobat by taking care of attackers that outspeed it, such as Choice Scarf Haunter. Swoobat dislikes taking Stealth Rock damage on the switch, so Defog support from a Pokemon such as Swanna isn't a bad idea, though not a necessity. Alternatively, you can try using a Taunt user such as Misdreavus, Taunt + Stealth Rock Barbaracle, or Taunt + Stealth Rock Monferno to stop Stealth Rock from being set up in the first place.

Other Options
########
Hidden Power Ground can be used to deal with Pokemon such as Bastiodon. A Life Orb set with Calm Mind and three attacks is an option should you desire some extra coverage. Giga Drain can be used for a guaranteed 2HKO on Piloswine when Swoobat is at +2 while restoring some HP. Shadow Ball hits Metang for super effective damage and hits foes such as Beheeyem marginally harder than Signal Beam, but Swoobat can't really afford to forgo any of the listed main options to accommodate alternative coverage choices. Swoobat has access to a myriad of support options including Taunt, Magic Coat, dual screens, Toxic, Thunder Wave, Knock Off, Tailwind, and U-turn, but in spite of its great Speed, it is outclassed at using them by Pokemon such as Meowstic-M because of its horrendous bulk. Swoobat can try Klutz in combination with Trick holding a detrimental item, but Swoobat's poor bulk makes it risky.

Checks and Counters
########
**Priority Users**: Swoobat's poor defenses and weaknesses to common priority moves such as Sucker Punch and Ice Shard mean that priority attackers such as Sneasel and Piloswine can easily revenge kill it if it isn't behind a Substitute. Piloswine can even take a hit from a boosted Swoobat, break its Substitute with Icicle Spear, and proceed to KO it with Ice Shard the next turn. Murkrow can stop Swoobat from setting up in the first place and has an immunity to its STAB move, while Volbeat can come in as Swoobat sets up, then proceed to outspeed thanks to Prankster and Encore Swoobat; meanwhile, all four of PU's Prankster users can Thunder Wave Swoobat to shut down its sweep if it isn't behind a Substitute.

**Faster Foes**: If Swoobat does not have a Substitute or a Salac Berry boost, it is prone to being revenge killed by faster foes, whether they are naturally faster, such as Zebstrika and Electrode, or attackers carrying a Choice Scarf such as Haunter and Rotom-F.

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Bastiodon resists Stored Power, can take a Heat Wave, and can phaze Swoobat out using Roar or set up Stealth Rock, though in a last Pokemon situation, it can beat Bastiodon because Bastiodon cannot really damage it. Other specially defensive Pokemon can prove problematic for Swoobat; for example, Grumpig and Regice can both easily tank a +2 Stored Power, with the former being able to phaze Swoobat out with Whirlwind and the latter being able to hit Swoobat for super effective damage with its STAB moves.
