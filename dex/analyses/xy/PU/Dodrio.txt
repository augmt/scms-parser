Overview
########

Dodrio's high Speed and Attack stats, along with high Base Power STAB moves, allow it to be an effective wallbreaker in the PU metagame. This is backed up by access to priority in Quick Attack and utility in Knock Off allowing Dodrio to cripple switch-ins. Despite this, Dodrio has major flaws. There are still many Pokemon in the PU metagame that can outspeed it, such as Raichu and Tauros, and revenge kill it due to its low bulk. Dodrio is also very prone to being worn down, as it has a weakness to Stealth Rock, and its strongest attack, Brave Bird, inflicts large amounts of recoil. Its coverage is also very limited, meaning it is walled by Rock- and Steel-types, which allows it to become setup fodder for common Pokemon like Carracosta and Barbaracle.

Wallbreaker
########
name: Wallbreaker
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Return
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Quick Attack
ability: Early Bird
item: Choice Band / Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
=======

Brave Bird is Dodrio's main STAB move, allowing it to break through opposing Pokemon. Return is Dodrio's secondary STAB move, hitting Electric-type Pokemon that resist Brave Bird without inflicting recoil. Knock Off allows Dodrio to cripple Pokemon that can switch into its STAB moves. This is important as both Rock- and Steel-types can otherwise easily switch into Dodrio. Quick Attack provides priority, allowing Dodrio to finish off weakened Pokemon. However, Quick Attack is weak and can be exploited. Roost or Taunt can be used in the final slot if Dodrio is holding a Life Orb. The former allows it to recover health, which is important as it is easily worn down, while the latter prevents entry hazards from Pokemon such as Kricketune as well as recovery or set up.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed and a Jolly nature allow Dodrio to outspeed Pokemon such as Haunter and Speed tie with others such as Ninetales. 252 Attack EVs provide maximum power, which is backed up by either Choice Band or Life Orb. The former allows it to hit harder but locks Dodrio into a move, whereas Life Orb is weaker and wears it down more but allows for freedom in move choice. Early Bird is the most reliable ability, allowing Dodrio to more easily check Grass-types such as Tangela.

Usage Tips
========

Due to its low bulk, Dodrio should not be switching into attacks. Instead, it should be switched in after a KO or from a Volt Switch or U-turn. When in, Dodrio should spam its STAB moves unless the opponent has a Pokemon that can take them, in which case Knock Off should be used to cripple the switch-in. Quick Attack can be used to revenge kill weakened opponents or to get get chip damage off on faster foes. Dodrio functions best as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker because of its high strength.

Team Options
========

Ground- and Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Poliwrath and Marowak, make good partners, because they can take out Steel- and Rock-types, which wall Dodrio. Ground-types also check Electric-types that give Dodrio problems. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Roselia and Golem weaken the enemy, allowing Dodrio to get KOs on Pokemon such as specially defensive Avalugg. Defog and Rapid Spin users, such as Prinplup and Avalugg, are important because otherwise Dodrio is quickly worn down by hazards. Setup sweepers, such as Carracosta and Gogoat, benefit from Dodrio's wallbreaking; the former particularly appreciates the removal of Grass-type Pokemon. Other Normal-type Pokemon, such as Ursaring and Tauros, create a Normal spam core; Dodrio can weaken Ghost-types like Gourgeist and Misdreavus, allowing its partner to sweep.

Other Options
########

A Choice Scarf set could be used to revenge kill Pokemon such as Raichu, but it receives stiff competition from the likes of Tauros and Scyther. Dodrio would like to use Baton Pass and Double-Edge; however, they are illegal with Brave Bird, so it would have to use Drill Peck, which is too weak. Thrash and Tangled Feet could be used, but Dodrio can still hit itself in confusion. Pursuit allows Dodrio to trap Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Gourgeist, and Endeavor allows Dodrio to weaken Pokemon after it has been worn down. The best way that Dodrio can beat its counters is either Toxic, which slowly wears them down, or Natural Gift with Salac or Apicot Berry, which hits Rock- and Steel-types super effectively.

Checks & Counters
########
**Rock-types**: Rock-type Pokemon, such as Golem, can take any move and use Dodrio as setup fodder or respond with their Rock-type STAB moves. However, without Leftovers recovery, many lose their ability to constantly switch in. Carracosta and Barbaracle can use Dodrio as set up fodder.

**Steel-types** Steel-types such as Bastiodon and Metang can easily survive a hit and use Dodrio to set up entry hazards, but the former cannot do much in response, while the latter has a weakness to Knock Off and dislikes losing its Eviolite. Klang can set up Shift Gears on Dodrio, but it hates having its Eviolite Knocked Off.

**Priority**: Dodrio's low bulk makes it easy to revenge kill with priority such as Mightyena's Sucker Punch and Basculin's Aqua Jet. Ice Shard, from Piloswine, deals super effective damage, and thus requires less prior damage to KO Dodrio.

**Faster Pokemon**: Raichu and Tauros can outspeed and KO non-Choice Scarf variants of Dodrio and can easily survive a Quick Attack. Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom-F and Haunter, can also revenge kill a weakened Dodrio.

**Status**: Paralysis, from Pokemon such as Meowstic and Togetic, makes Dodrio much easier to revenge kill and prevents it from switching in to revenge kill. Meowstic can move first due to Prankster, while Togetic can survive a hit. Will-O-Wisp users such as Rotom-F and Dusclops can take a hit from Dodrio; however, the latter heavily dislikes Knock Off. 

**Passive Damage**: Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Dodrio gets worn down a lot by constantly switching in, as it is easily forced out. Life Orb and Brave Bird recoil also wear Dodrio down a lot, and it doesn't have too many opportunities to Roost.
