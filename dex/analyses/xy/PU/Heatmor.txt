Overview
########

Heatmor's great attacking stats combined with an amazing movepool that includes Giga Drain, Knock Off, and Low Kick and is backed up by STAB Fire Blast, make it an effective wallbreaker in the PU metagame, as it has no safe switch-ins. It also has a useful ability, Flash Fire, allowing it to check other Fire-types, such as Flareon, and a form of priority in Sucker Punch. However, Sucker Punch does not make up for its poor Speed, so it is outsped by common Pokemon such as Tauros and Haunter, and its poor bulk and three weaknesses also mean it is easy to revenge kill, making it struggle to put in work against offensive teams. It also receives competition from other Fire-types, mainly Ninetales, for a teamslot, but unlike Ninetales, Heatmor has priority and and can get past special walls such as Lickilicky and Munchlax.

Moves
========

Fire Blast is Heatmor's most powerful STAB move, allowing Heatmor to break through or dent Pokemon that it hits neutrally. Giga Drain provides good coverage, hitting Rock- and Water-types such as Golem, Poliwrath, and Carracosta, while Low Kick 2HKOes Lickilicky after Stealth Rock and also hits Bastiodon and Munchlax hard. Sucker Punch can be used for priority, allowing Heatmor to revenge kill or weaken faster Pokemon, and although it hits off Heatmor's weaker Attack stat, it still has the power to 2HKO Pokemon such as Raichu. Knock Off hits Grumpig while removing Sliggoo's Eviolite and crippling any switch-in by removing its item.


Set Details
========

Max Special Attack investment boosts Heatmor's power, increasing its wallbreaking potential, which is boosted even more by Life Orb and a Rash nature. 200 Speed EVs allow Heatmor to outspeed neutral-natured Rampardos and Aurorus and OHKO them before they can OHKO it. The remaining EVs go in Attack, boosting the power of Heatmor's physical moves and notably giving Low Kick the power to 2HKO Lickilicky after Stealth Rock damage. Flash Fire lets Heatmor check other Fire-types and can boost the power of Heatmor's own Fire-type STAB move.

Usage Tips
========

Due to its low bulk, Heatmor dislikes switching into strong hits and thus prefers to be brought in after a KO or by a safe pivot. However, it can be brought in on Fire-types, such as Flareon, in order to get a Flash Fire boost. Heatmor should be used early- or mid-game to weaken walls, allowing its teammates to sweep. Due to its strength and coverage, predictions are not necessarily required but can allow Heatmor to 2HKO a switch-in or cripple one with Knock Off. Sucker Punch is not very reliable, so often it is better to use something else to revenge kill an opposing Pokemon, but it is helpful in allowing Heatmor to finish off a threat it has weakened.

Team Options
========

Stealth Rock and Spikes from Pokemon such as Golem and Roselia wear down the opposing team and allow Heatmor to score KOs on certain Pokemon; for example, Stealth Rock allows Heatmor to 2HKO Pelipper and OHKO Mr. Mime with Fire Blast. Rapid Spin and Defog from Pokemon such as Avalugg and Swanna are important as Heatmor is weak to Stealth Rock and will lose a quarter of its health upon switching in when the hazard is up. Water-types, such as Prinplup and Poliwrath, can switch into Water-type moves and threaten Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon, and in return, Heatmor beats Grass-type Pokemon; Prinplup can even Defog for Heatmor. Sticky Web partially makes up for Heatmor's poor Speed, but Heatmor needs to invest more into Speed to outspeed base 105 Speed Pokemon, and without a Speed-boosting nature it will always be outsped by Tauros and Sneasel. Tangela resists Water and Ground and has enough bulk to stomach most Rock-type attacks, while beating Aqua Jet users Carracosta and Basculin. Setup sweepers, such as Regice and Carracosta, appreciate Heatmor's ability to wear down walls, giving them an easier time sweeping.

Other Options
########

Heatmor already has good coverage in its moveset and thus doesn't require many other moves to help it. Focus Blast could be used over Low Kick to 2HKO Lickilicky without Stealth Rock support and to allow Heatmor to invest more into Speed, but it has shaky accuracy. Thunder Punch allows Heatmor to OHKO Pelipper, but it is already 2HKOed by Fire Blast after Stealth Rock. Expert Belt could be used as Heatmor gets easily worn down with Life Orb recoil and entry hazards, but the item doesn't always boost its moves. Substitute can be used to block status and stop Lickilicky lacking Body Slam, but it requires Leftovers, which limit its Heatmor's wallbreaking abilities. Substitute paired with Salac Berry can allow Heatmor to sweep late-game, but it still gets outsped by common Choice Scarf users.

Checks & Counters
########
**Faster Pokemon and Priority**: Heatmor's low Speed means it can be easily revenge killed by Pokemon such as Tauros and Simipour. Its low bulk means that Pokemon that hit it for neutral damage, such as Sawsbuck and Mr. Mime, can also KO it with little prior damage required. Carracosta can OHKO Heatmor after Stealth Rock damage or two turns of Life Orb recoil with priority Aqua Jet.

**Ninetales**: Ninetales is immune to Fire, resists Giga Drain, and takes little damage from Knock Off or Low Kick while setting up Nasty Plots on Heatmor and retaliating back with Psyshock.

**Passive Damage**: Heatmor is weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to Spikes, limiting the number of times it can switch in. Life Orb recoil also wears Heatmor down.
