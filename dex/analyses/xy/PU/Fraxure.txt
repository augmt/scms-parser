Overview
########

Fraxure boasts a massive Attack stat that allows it to act as a powerful wallbreaker, and as one of the few Dragon-types in the tier, it has a useful set of resistances to Fire-, Water-, Grass-, and Electric-type attacks, that is backed by decent defenses coupled with an Eviolite. Mold Breaker is a very useful ability for it that allows it to bypass opposing Pokemon's abilities, such as Sturdy or Solid Rock. Fraxure also has a diverse offensive movepool with helpful coverage moves such as Low Kick, Poison Jab, and Iron Tail. Fraxure is quite versatile in that it can act as a wallbreaker with a Choice Band or a late-game sweeper with Dragon Dance. However, it has a low and awkward Speed tier that leaves it outsped by many offensive Pokemon unboosted and common Choice Scarf users even after a boost. Unfortunately, it tends to rely on its Eviolite to set up, which is problematic due to the prevalence of Knock Off users.

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Low Kick
move 4: Iron Tail / Taunt
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Eviolite / Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Dragon Dance boosts Fraxure's Attack and Speed, making it a threat to both offensive and defensive teams. Outrage is Fraxure's strongest STAB move and hits extremely hard after a boost. Low Kick is important to hit Steel-types such as Bastiodon, as well as Avalugg and Piloswine. Iron Tail provides useful coverage against Fairy-types such as Mr. Mime and Carbink. Taunt prevents defensive Pokemon from setting up entry hazards or statusing Fraxure, giving it an easier time to set up.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread maximizes Fraxure's Attack and Speed, and a Jolly nature is important to be able to outspeed fast Pokemon such as Tauros and Zebstrika after a Dragon Dance. Eviolite gives Fraxure some useful bulk while setting up, but Life Orb provides a significant boost in power. An Adamant nature can be used for more power, but missing out on outspeeding certain threats, especially the previously mentioned Pokemon as well as Raichu and Sneasel, is not worth it.

Usage Tips
========

Fraxure should set up on weak defensive Pokemon, especially against resisted hits from Pokemon such as Roselia. However, Fraxure should be wary of a Sleep Powder from Roselia, which greatly cripples it. With Eviolite, Fraxure will be much bulkier than it seems in most situations, allowing it to take some powerful neutral attacks. Fraxure should set up mid- or late-game, particularly after its checks and counters have been weakened or removed.

Team Options
========

Wallbreakers such as Bouffalant and Tauros are great teammates to break down defensive Pokemon to help Fraxure sweep. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Golem and Marowak is helpful to wear down defensive Pokemon. Poison-types such as Haunter pressure Fairy-types, which is important if Fraxure lacks Iron Tail. Dual screens support from Meowstic-M gives Fraxure an easier time setting up and can alleviate the necessity of Eviolite, allowing for the use of Life Orb.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Low Kick
move 3: Iron Tail / Poison Jab
move 4: Dragon Claw / Dual Chop
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Outrage is Fraxure's strongest STAB move and destroys anything that does not resist it. Low Kick hits Ice- and Steel-types such as Avalugg, Piloswine, and Bastiodon. Iron Tail targets Fairy-types such as Carbink, Clefairy, and Togetic, as well as Piloswine. Poison Jab is a more accurate coverage move to hit Fairy-types with, but it loses out on hitting Carbink super effectively. Dragon Claw is a more reliable STAB move that doesn't lock Fraxure into an attack and is useful for late-game cleaning. Dual Chop breaks Focus Sash held by Pokemon such as Kricketune and Leavanny.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread maximizes Fraxure's offensive presence. An Adamant nature gives a significant boost in power, but a Jolly nature allows Fraxure to outspeed Kricketune and KO it with Dual Chop. Choice Band gives a massive boost to Fraxure's Attack.

Usage Tips
========

If the opponent does not have a Steel- or Fairy-type, Fraxure is free to spam Outrage or Dragon Claw and net a KO. Use Fraxure's coverage attacks on their targets on the switch, such as hitting Avalugg with Low Kick or Carbink with Iron Tail. Switch Fraxure in on weak resisted hits such as Giga Drain from Roselia or to revenge kill a foe, but it should be noted that without Eviolite, Fraxure cannot take attacks from offensive Pokemon. While its power is appealing, Outrage should be used sparingly, as being locked into the move is not ideal.

Team Options
========

Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Golem and Marowak is helpful to wear down Fraxure's switch-ins. Late-game sweepers such as Tauros are good teammates that appreciate Fraxure's wallbreaking ability. Sticky Web support from Leavanny or Kricketune is useful to slow down grounded opponents.

Other Options
########

Aqua Tail hits Golem for 4x super effective damage, but it has little use outside of that. Choice Scarf somewhat alleviates Fraxure's subpar Speed but renders Fraxure relatively weak, and even with it Fraxure is outsped by other common Choice Scarf users. Superpower is an alternative to Low Kick, but all of its targets are quite heavy and take more damage from Low Kick. Swords Dance pressures defensive teams more, but the Speed boost from Dragon Dance is much more useful.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ice-types**: Sneasel, Rotom-F, and Piloswine all threaten to deal massive damage to or OHKO Fraxure with their respective STAB moves, though most cannot switch in safely. However, faster ones, namely Sneasel and Rotom-F, are much more reliable checks while slower ones such as Aurorus, Regice, and Piloswine take a solid chunk of damage from Low Kick or Iron Tail.

**Fairy-types**: If Fraxure lacks Poison Jab and Iron Tail, Togetic and Mr. Mime are free switch-ins as they are immune to Fraxure's STAB moves. In addition, Choice Scarf Mr. Mime can revenge kill Fraxure even after a Dragon Dance.

**Status**: Burn from the likes of Poliwrath and Misdreavus, paralysis from the likes of Stunfisk, and poison from Toxic Spikes are all detrimental to Fraxure by hindering its Attack, Speed, and longevity respectively. Prankster Thunder Wave from the likes of Meowstic-M and Volbeat severely cripples Fraxure.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon such as Simipour, Haunter, and Tauros can deal heavy damage to Fraxure before it sets up or attacks, and even after a boost, Fraxure is outsped by common Choice Scarf users such as Mr. Mime and Rotom-F.
