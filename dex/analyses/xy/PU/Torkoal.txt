Overview
########
Torkoal's access to Shell Smash, which allows it to take out common spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Haunter, gives it a niche over other Rapid Spin users and Fire-types. Along with the already great utility move in Rapid Spin, Torkoal also has access to Stealth Rock, and its great Defense allows it to switch in on physical attackers such as Leafeon and Pawniard. Sadly, Torkoal is weak to Stealth Rock itself without having reliable recovery, and it is also extremely slow, meaning it loses to speedier offensive Pokemon. As an offensive Pokemon, it has limited coverage, making it very predictable.


Offensive Rapid Spin
########
name: Offensive Rapid Spin
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Rapid Spin
ability: Shell Armor
item: Life Orb / White Herb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

With a Shell Smash boost, Torkoal can beat common spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Haunter. Fire Blast is Torkoal's main STAB move, and is chosen for its sheer power. Earth Power allows Torkoal to break through Pokemon that switch into Fire Blast, such as Ninetales and Probopass. Once Torkoal lured in spinblockers and dealt enough damage to your opponent's team, it can Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards and keep other team members healthy. Hidden Power Electric can also be useful over Earth Power to damage bulky Water-types such as Poliwrath and Pelipper, even being able to OHKO the latter of the two.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature with max Speed is essential to allow Torkoal to outspeed spinblockers such as Misdreavus after a Shell Smash. Max Special Attack is used to help dish out as much damage as possible. A Life Orb lets Torkoal OHKO Misdreavus after Stealth Rock, but leaves Torkoal vulnerable to priority and faster Pokemon. Using a White Herb means Torkoal's defenses won't drop after the first Shell Smash, allowing Torkoal to survive priority moves such as Life Orb Carracosta's Aqua Jet.

Usage Tips
========

Torkoal should be brought in to remove entry hazards for other team members, especially against physical attackers such as Leafeon and Pawniard, as they do damage to it and it can Rapid Spin on them. Make sure to Rapid Spin before hazards can cripple Torkoal or its team too much, but wait until the opponent's hazard setters can't easily set them back up. Although Torkoal has the power after a Shell Smash to sweep, it should only Shell Smash when it needs to beat spinblockers. If facing a more frail spinblocker such as Haunter, use Fire Blast, but if there is a bulky spinblocker such as Misdreavus, set up a Shell Smash. Torkoal can also be helpful for punching holes in bulkier teams. Once you have taken out all of your opponent's Pokemon that are faster than Torkoal at +2, you can use Torkoal as a sweeper.


Team Options
========

Torkoal works well with Pokemon that don't appreciate entry hazards, such as Jumpluff and Dodrio, as Torkoal beats common spinblockers after a Shell Smash and removes hazards. Torkoal appreciates Grass- and Electric-types such as Jumpluff, Gourgeist, Raichu, and Rotom-F as partners to check Water-types. Torkoal appreciates bulky Water-types such as Poliwrath and Pelipper as teammates, because they can take on Water- and Ground-types that Torkoal can't take on as well. Torkoal appreciates a slow Volt Switch or U-turn to bring it in, as it doesn't appreciate taking any unnecessary damage. This set fits best on offensive teams, as it has great offensive presence along with the utility of Rapid Spin to help other offensive Pokemon such as Sturdy and Focus Sash users.


Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Lava Plume
move 3: Toxic / Earthquake
move 4: Rapid Spin
ability: Shell Armor
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 232 Def / 28 SpD
nature: Bold / Relaxed

Moves
========

Stealth Rock allows Torkoal to rack up damage on the opposing team's Pokemon every time they switch in. Lava Plume is a very spammable STAB move with a 30% chance to burn every time it's used, meaning physical attackers cannot safely set up on Torkoal. Toxic sets Pokemon on a timer and wears them down quickly, and Earthquake hits Pokemon such as Ninetales and Flareon, making Torkoal more of a threat to them. Run a Bold nature if you are using Toxic and a Relaxed nature if you are using Earthquake, so that Torkoal's Earthquake won't be weakened. Yawn is an alternate option over Toxic and Earthquake that forces switches, allowing Torkoal to rack up more Stealth Rock damage, and provides a turn to Rapid Spin as the foe switches. Rapid Spin lets Torkoal clear away entry hazards.

Set Details
========

With 248 HP EVs, Torkoal can switch into Stealth Rock four times, and with 28 SpD EVs it can take Ancient Power from offensive Tangela twice or Sludge Bomb twice from offensive Roselia. With 232 Defense EVs and a Bold nature, Torkoal can take plenty of physical hits. Leftovers are essential to allow Torkoal to gain small bits of recovery. A Relaxed nature should be used with Earthquake.

Usage Tips
========

Torkoal is able to switch into common physical setup sweepers such as Leafeon and Pawniard, and should mainly be used to set up Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin away entry hazards. Torkoal should stay in and Rapid Spin on Pokemon that it isn't threatened much by, such as passive walls or physical attackers. Torkoal is very physically bulky, but because it doesn't have access to reliable recovery, it isn't able to switch into too many hits. Be wary of Ghost-types, as they can block Rapid Spin and some of them, such as Misdreavus, can wear Torkoal down. Lava Plume and Toxic are very spammable moves that can easily cripple the foe. Make sure that Torkoal doesn't take too much residual damage from hazards or Toxic, as it is easily worn down.

Team Options
========

Defensive Torkoal works well with Wish and Heal Bell support provided by clerics such as Lickilicky, as it doesn't have reliable recovery and it is easily worn down by entry hazards and Toxic. Because Torkoal has weak Special Defense, it is important to have a Pokemon more suitable to switch into those kinds of attacks, such as Lickilicky. Grass-types such as Tangela and Gourgeist are great options to go along with Torkoal, as some of Torkoal's main weaknesses are covered by them and Torkoal covers most of their weaknesses in exchange. Defensive Torkoal fits with more defensive playstyles, such as stall or bulky offense. Certain hazard-weak Pokemon such as Rotom-F and Togetic pair well with Torkoal because it can Rapid Spin away hazards for them. Torkoal works well on teams that rely on keeping away entry hazards but can't afford to use Defog. Torkoal appreciates a slow Volt Switch or U-turn, allowing it to come in for free so that it doesn't have to take any extra damage. Lastly, Torkoal also appreciates a Pursuit trapper such as Pawniard, which can take out Ghost-types that try to prevent Torkoal from spinning.


Other Options
########

Torkoal can use Clear Smog to prevent opposing Pokemon from setting up on it, and Rock Slide or Stone Edge to hit Pokemon such as Swanna and Pelipper more effectively.

Checks & Counters
########

**Passive Damage**: Passive damage such as from entry hazards and Toxic easily wear Torkoal down because it doesn't have access to recovery.

**Special Attackers**: With Torkoal's weak Special Defense stat, it is unable to take most special attacks, such as Psychic from Beheeyem.

**Faster Attackers**: Torkoal is extremely slow, so even after a Shell Smash it is easily revenge killed by Pokemon such as Floatzel.

**Water-types**: Water-types such as Swanna, Pelipper, and Poliwrath can take any hit from Torkoal, even after a Shell Smash, and retaliate with super effective STAB attacks.

**Special Walls**: Special walls such as Zweilous can easily take Torkoal's Lava Plume, and with Torkoal's lack of recovery, it struggles to beat them while it's easily worn down.
