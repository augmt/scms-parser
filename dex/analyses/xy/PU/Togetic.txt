Overview
########

Togetic is a great pivot that works well on balanced and stall teams due to its access to Baton Pass, Defog, and Roost. Togetic's unique Fairy / Flying typing gives it some handy resistances, such as to Dark and Grass, as well as a 4x resistance to Fighting. Its good bulk combined with Eviolite allows Togetic to provide its team with invaluable support, sporting access to a variety of support moves and nifty coverage options; its access to Defog allows for easy entry hazard removal as well. However, Togetic possesses little offensive presence and is weak to Stealth Rock, and its Flying typing gives it weaknesses to Rock-, Electric-, and Ice-type attacks, hindering its ability to consistently switch in.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Defog
move 2: Dazzling Gleam / Seismic Toss
move 3: Roost
move 4: Heal Bell / Thunder Wave / Baton Pass
ability: Serene Grace
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Defog allows Togetic to support its team with entry hazard removal, opening up space for sweepers that are weak to Stealth Rock, such as Scyther and Sneasel. Dazzling Gleam is Togetic's most reliable STAB option, hitting most Pokemon for decent damage. Seismic Toss is a more consistent source of damage, preventing Pokemon such as Substitute + Calm Mind Serperior from setting up against Togetic. Roost is a reliable means of recovery. Heal Bell allows Togetic to act as a cleric, ridding its teammates of status afflictions. Thunder Wave is a great support option, crippling opposing offensive Pokemon and allowing Togetic's teammates to outspeed said Pokemon. Baton Pass lets Togetic switch out slowly, allowing you to scout what the opponent might have switched in and choose your own Pokemon accordingly; it also allows an ally to switch in unscathed and pivot on opposing switch-ins to gain momentum. Flamethrower is a solid secondary coverage move, allowing Togetic to wear down Steel- and Grass / Poison-types that resist Dazzling Gleam, such as Klang and Roselia, preventing them from staying in too long.

Set Details
========

The EVs accentuate Togetic's impressive bulk, maximizing its durability, longevity, and supporting capabilities. A Bold nature increases Togetic's Defense stat. Eviolite is the premier item for a defensive NFE Pokemon such as Togetic, boosting its defensive stats by 1.5x. Serene Grace is the chosen ability, as it doesn't conflict with the usage of Defog. A specially defensive spread of 248 / 252 SpD / 8 Def with a Calm nature can be used if you want Togetic to take special attacks better.

Usage Tips
========

Togetic can switch into a variety of moves from Pokemon such as Heatmor, Kadabra, and Swanna, so bring it in on one of the aforementioned Pokemon and support Togetic's teammates with Defog or Heal Bell. Roost should be used frequently, as Togetic will be taking hits and it lacks Leftovers; however, Togetic shouldn't overstay its welcome on the battlefield due to its poor offensive presence, which makes it easy setup bait. Baton Pass should be used when you anticipate a switch or want to bring a teammate in safely, while Thunder Wave should be used against fast switch-ins such as Tauros and Dodrio; however, Togetic must be wary of Raichu and Zebstrika due to Lightning Rod.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that complement Togetic nicely are those that resist its weaknesses or are comfortable taking strong attacks and benefit from having Heal Bell support, such as Camerupt and Piloswine. Lickilicky is a great partner, as not only does it pair nicely with Togetic in terms of typing, but the standard Lickilicky set runs Heal Bell, freeing up a moveslot for Togetic. Klang is also a nice option, as it resists Togetic's weaknesses and can provide your team with a solid win condition. Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards such as Ninetales, Scyther, and Rotom-F appreciate Togetic as a partner due to its ability to clear the field of entry hazards with Defog. Throh resists Steel- and Rock-type attacks, can take a Knock Off, and checks common Trick users such as Rotom-F, making it a great teammate.

NastyPass
########
name: NastyPass
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Roost
move 4: Dazzling Gleam
ability: Serene Grace
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Nasty Plot boosts Togetic's Special Attack, which can be transferred to an ally, allowing said ally to effectively sweep the opposing team. Baton Pass is essential and allows Togetic to transfer the boosts or gain momentum. Roost is a reliable recovery option, and its secondary effect of neutralizing Togetic's Flying-type can be handy for dodging incoming super effective hits while also allowing Togetic to pass Nasty Plot boosts multiple times in a battle. Dazzling Gleam is the STAB move of choice and provides Togetic with a reliable means of damaging a foe, along with preventing Togetic from being entirely susceptible to Taunt; it can also become an extremely potent move after one or two Nasty Plots, should Togetic decide to stay in. Fire Blast can be used to deal neutral damage to Gabordor or hurt Steel-types such as Klang and Metang.

Set Details
========

The EVs are focused solely on bulk to maximize Togetic's durability, as Togetic's duty as a Baton Passer doesn't require a large offensive presence. A Bold nature increases Togetic's Defense stat while decreasing its Attack stat, which Togetic makes no use of. Eviolite is a fantastic item, multiplying both of Togetic's defensive stats by 1.5x and boosting its bulk to incredibly respectable levels. A specially defensive spread of 248 / 252 SpD / 8 Def with a Calm nature can be used if you want Togetic to take special attacks better.

Usage Tips
========

Togetic's Baton Passing potential is utilized to the fullest when it is brought in on a Pokemon that really can't touch it, such as Tangela, Swanna, or Avalugg, so that it can proceed to boost and pass the boosted stats; Baton Pass can also be used to gain momentum early on in the game. Togetic has very solid bulk, allowing it to survive most super effective hits and be used more than once in a game. Togetic is quite slow as well, which is handy for getting off a slow Baton Pass and bringing in a sweeper unscathed.

Team Options
========

Baton Pass Pokemon need capable receivers in order to function effectively and Togetic is no different. Raichu, Haunter, Kadabra, Serperior, and Frogadier are all prime examples of Pokemon that are good receivers of Nasty Plot due to their already good Special Attack stats and workable Speed stats. Togetic won't always be in the premier position to use Nasty Plot and Baton Pass, so it will most likely switch in more than once; therefore, Pokemon that can remove entry hazards, such as Avalugg, are much appreciated. Pokemon that resist Togetic's weaknesses, the most prevalent of which are Electric and Ice, are great partners as well; prime examples are Steel-type Pokemon, as Togetic resists Fighting-type attacks, pairing nicely with Steel-types. Fire-types such as Ninetales, Flareon, and Heatmor resist Dazzling Gleam and Fire Blast, so Pokemon such as specially defensive Lickilicky are appreciated.

Other Options
########

Togetic can run a different Nasty Plot set, and instead of Baton Passing to an ally, make use of it for itself, with a solid special movepool consisting of options such as Psychic for hitting Garbodor, Grass Knot, Shadow Ball, and Ancient Power. However, not much is needed for such a set since Fire / Fairy coverage hits most types at least neutrally. Yawn is a unique option, forcing opposing Pokemon to switch or fall asleep, essentially opening up a free turn for Togetic.  Magic Coat is a neat way to shield Togetic from status, cripple the foe, or bounce back entry hazards. Wish can be used for Togetic and its teammates to gain back HP, as Wish and slow Baton Pass is a good combination, allowing weakened Pokemon to avoid taking damage; however, Wish should be avoided due to Togetic's low HP stat. Substitute and Baton Pass can provide a safe switch-in for teammates and sometimes prevent the Substitute from breaking because Togetic will be taking a hit before using Substitute most of the time.

Checks & Counters
########

**Poison-types**: Togetic cannot touch Poison-types with Dazzling Gleam, and if they aren't Grass-type as well, Fire-type moves don't do significant damage. Garbodor and Arbok in particular can become issues, as they can use Togetic as setup fodder. 

**Taunt**: Taunt users such as Vigoroth, Haunter, and Misdreavus prevent Togetic from using support moves. Togetic relies on its support capabilities to function effectively, so having that aspect neutralized severely hampers what Togetic can do.

**Steel-types**: If Togetic lacks a Fire-type move, Steel-types can be quite problematic. Pokemon such as Metang and Bastiodon take little to nothing from Dazzling Gleam and can set up Stealth Rock when Togetic switches out.

**Knock Off**: Although Togetic resists Knock Off, the move gets rid of Togetic's Eviolite, severely dampening its ability to take a hit, so Togetic must be wary of Knock Off users such as Kecleon, Marowak, and Leafeon.

**Bulky Setup Sweepers**: Pokemon such as Carracosta and Bouffalant can set up on Togetic with relative ease and subsequently hit it with boosted STAB attacks.

**Ice-types**: Ice-type Pokemon such as Sneasel and Rotom-F can threaten Togetic with their super effective STAB attacks. Piloswine is a prime example, as not only can it 2HKO Togetic with its STAB moves, but it can also set up Stealth Rock, forcing Togetic to choose between entry hazard removal and HP preservation.

**Rock-types**: Rock-types such as Golem, Carracosta, and Barbaracle threaten Togetic with their STAB moves. Most Rock-types can also set up Stealth Rock, once again forcing Togetic to choose between entry hazard removal and HP conservation.

**Electric-types**: Most fast, powerful Electric-type Pokemon, such as Raichu and Zebstrika, enjoy switching into Thunder Wave due to the Lightning Rod boost they receive and can also fire off powerful Thunderbolts, which Togetic doesn't want to take. Volt Switch can prove even more of an issue, as the opponent instantly gains momentum if Togetic switches out.
