Overview
########

Ursaring is one of the premier wallbreakers in PU. Its base 130 Attack allows it to deal out heavy damage to any foe in its path. Ursaring also has access to two great abilities in Guts and Quick Feet, both of which allow it to function even better as a physical attacker. However, in order for Ursaring to activate its ability, it must be either burned or poisoned, which will cut into its longevity. In addition, even with Quick Feet, it is still slow and requires either Sticky Web or paralysis support to outspeed faster Pokemon such as Raichu and Sneasel. Nonetheless, Ursaring has an advantage over other Normal-types such as Tauros and Stoutland, as it doesn't mind being crippled with status and can take advantage of it as well.

Quick Feet
########
name: Quick Feet
move 1: Facade
move 2: Close Combat
move 3: Crunch
move 4: Swords Dance / Protect
ability: Quick Feet
item: Toxic Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Facade does a lot of damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Close Combat hits Rock- and Steel-types that resist Facade, such as Golem and Bastiodon. Crunch hits Ghost-types such as Haunter, Gourgeist, and Misdreavus, which are immune to Facade and Close Combat. Swords Dance boosts Ursaring's Attack to enormous levels, allowing it to sweep more efficiently after it's been poisoned. Protect can be used over Swords Dance to guarantee Ursaring gets poisoned at the expense of the possibly giving the foe a free turn to set up.

Set Details
========​

Maximum Attack and Speed EVs and a Jolly Nature allow Ursaring to hit as fast and hard as possible. With a Jolly nature, Ursaring will be able to outspeed positive-natured base 105 Speed Pokemon such as Rapidash and Kadabra after Toxic Orb activates. An Adamant nature can be used but the extra Speed to go after faster threats outweighs the extra power an Adamant nature would provide.

Usage Tips
========​

You don't want Ursaring to switch into any attack because of the nature of its moveset and its poor defensive typing, so it's best to switch Ursaring in when another teammate has fainted or on an obvious status move. Quick Feet Ursaring is better suited for a late-game cleaner role. Use Swords Dance when the foe doesn't threaten Ursaring or if you predict the foe to switch. Be cautious when facing Ghost-type Pokemon, as they can switch into Facade and cost Ursaring valuable time. The same can be said about using not very effective moves as well.

Team Options
========

Ursaring appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Carracosta and Golem in order to net crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs. For example, after a Swords Dance and after Stealth Rock damage, Ursaring OHKOes Avalugg and physically defensive Gourgeist with Close Combat and Crunch, respectively. Pokemon that appreciate Ursaring's wallbreaking capabilities, such as Shell Smash Barbaracle and Calm Mind Swoobat, make for great teammates. Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Kadabra, Mr. Mime, and Haunter are solid teammates for Ursaring, as they either resist or are immune to Ursaring's Fighting weakness while Ursaring covers their Ghost weakness and threatens Ghost-types with Crunch. Kadabra and Mr. Mime can use Encore on foes using setup moves and allow Ursaring to switch in and not take any damage. Other Normal-types such as Tauros and Purugly also make for good partners, as they can wear down one another's checks and counters. Pokemon that can use Volt Switch, U-turn, or Baton Pass are great teammates for Ursaring because they can allow Ursaring to switch in without taking damage and freely activate its Toxic Orb. Examples include Rotom-F, Raichu, Probopass, Zebstrika, and Togetic. Rapid Spin or Defog support from Pokemon such as Avalugg and Pelipper helps Ursaring, as it is susceptible to all entry hazards.

Guts
########
name: Guts
move 1: Facade
move 2: Close Combat
move 3: Crunch
move 4: Protect / Swords Dance
ability: Guts
item: Toxic Orb / Flame Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========​

Facade rips through all Pokemon that don't resist it and is Ursaring's go-to move. Close Combat smashes Rock- and Steel-types that resist Facade, such as Golem and Bastiodon. Crunch hits Ghost-types such as Haunter, Misdreavus, and Gourgeist, which are immune to Facade and Close Combat. Protect gives Ursaring a free turn to activate its status Orb while also allowing it to scout and dodge Fake Out. Swords Dance could be used over Protect, but it leaves Ursaring susceptible to attacks and gives the foe a free turn to set up.

Set Details
========
​
Maximum Attack and Speed EVs and a Adamant Nature allow Ursaring to hit as fast and hard as possible. A Jolly nature allows Ursaring to outspeed Aurorus and Rampardos and Speed tie with neutral-natured maximum Speed base 65 Pokemon such as Flareon and Heatmor. Toxic Orb is slashed over Flame Orb because three turns of residual poison damage is less than three turns of burn damage; however, if Toxic Orb is used, it's best not to keep Ursaring in longer than three turns if you plan to send it in later. Ursaring doesn't have to stay on the field if it is low on health, as it can still hit opposing Pokemon hard even in a weakened state, so feel free to switch it out.

Usage Tips
========​

You don't want Ursaring to switch into any attack because of the nature of its moveset and its poor defensive typing; it's best to switch Ursaring in when another teammate has fainted or on an obvious status move. Swords Dance should be used if the foe can't do much to Ursaring or if it switches out. As this set forgoes the added Speed from Quick Feet for more power, it's best to use Ursaring for early- or mid-game situations to deal heavy damage to the opponent's team.

Team Options
========
​
Ursaring appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Golem and Barbaracle, as it helps turn 2HKOes into OHKOs and possible 3HKOs into 2HKOs. Stealth Rock guarantees that Ursaring can OHKO Pelipper with Facade and 2HKO physically defensive Gourgeist with Crunch. Revenge killers such as Haunter and Kadabra enjoy Ursaring's wallbreaking capabilities to weaken opposing Pokemon so they can clean up afterwards. Setup sweepers like Carracosta and Ninetales also appreciate Ursaring's wallbreaking ability. Other Normal-types such as Tauros and Purugly also make for good partners, as they can wear down one another's checks and counters. Ursaring would also thrive with Trick Room support from Pokemon such as Beheeyem or Duosion because of its slow Speed. Ursaring also covers their Ghost weakness, while Beheeyem and Duosion cover Ursaring's Fighting weakness. An EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD with a Brave nature would be more effective under Trick Room conditions. Ursaring also greatly appreciates Sticky Web support from Pokemon such as Kricketune and Leavanny because Sticky Web allows Ursaring to outspeed and beat faster grounded threats. In this case, a Jolly nature is preferred, as it allows Ursaring to outspeed everything up to maximum Speed positive-natured base 105 pokemon such as Kadabra. Pokemon with access to Volt Switch, U-turn, or Baton Pass are solid partners for Ursaring for their ability to bring it in after picking off a weakened foe or grab momentum for Ursaring to active its status Orb. Examples of these Pokemon include Raichu, Togetic, and Rotom-F. As Ursaring is worn down by all forms of entry hazards, Rapid Spin or Defog support from Pokemon such as Avalugg, Swanna, and Pelipper is greatly appreciated.

Other Options​
########

Earthquake is an option over Close Combat to hit Rock-, Steel-, and Fire-types without the defense drops. Power-Up Punch can be used over Swords Dance to damage the foe and get an Attack boost in the process. However, despite Ursaring's wide physical movepool to take advantage of, its Normal + Fighting + Dark coverage handles most Pokemon in the tier.

Checks & Counters
########

**Physically Defensive Pokemon**: Avalugg can take an unboosted Close Combat and KO Ursaring with Avalanche. Tangela can tank an unboosted Facade and proceed to OHKO Ursaring with Leaf Storm after Stealth Rock and Toxic damage. Bulky Ghost-types such as Gourgeist, Eviolite Dusclops, and defensive Misdreavus can survive a Crunch and proceed to stall Ursaring out.

**Revenge Killers**: Ursaring is slow without Quick Feet, so it's easily KOed by any Pokemon that's faster than it such as Sneasel, Raichu, and Choice Scarf Pokemon in particular, such as Rotom-F and Haunter. Quick Feet Ursaring is threatened by everything above base 105 Speed.

**Priority Attacks**: Ursaring is susceptible to being revenge killed by Golem and Mightyena's Sucker Punch, Basculin's Aqua Jet, and Kecleon's Fake Out. Even if these attacks don't KO Ursaring they will certainly cut into its longevity.

**Passive Damage**: Ursaring is easily worn down because it's always poisoned or burned. Entry hazards cut into its longevity by adding damage every time Ursaring switches in. Foes can also try to stall out Ursaring with Protect or Substitute to the point where Ursaring is in range to be KOed.​
