Overview
########

Dusknoir carves out a niche for itself in PU as a bulky, offensive spinblocker, with its Ghost typing giving it an immunity to Normal- and Fighting-type attacks. However, Dusknoir faces competition from other Ghost-types such as Misdreavus, Haunter, and Gourgeist. Dusknoir also lacks a strong, reliable, physical Ghost-type STAB attack despite having a wide range of coverage moves. It does set itself apart from other Ghost-types in the tier with a priority move in Shadow Sneak and Trick to cripple opposing foes. Unfortunately, a lack of reliable recovery outside of Rest hinders Dusknoir's ability to reliably spinblock over the course of a match.

move 1: Shadow Sneak
move 2: Earthquake

move 4: Trick / Pursuit
ability: Frisk
item: Choice Band
evs: 212 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Shadow Sneak is Dusknoir's Ghost-type STAB move and serves as a means to bypass Dusknoir's poor Speed. Earthquake provides great neutral coverage alongside Shadow Sneak, hitting Steel-types such as Pawniard and Probopass as well as Fire-types such as Ninetales and Rapidash super effectively. Ice Punch hits Grass-types such as Roselia and Jumpluff and Ground-types such as Marowak and Torterra super effectively. Alternatively, Thunder Punch can be used to hit Pelipper, Simipour, and Poliwrath harder while still hitting Flying-types such as Dodrio, Togetic, and Ninjask. Trick can cripple an opposing wall by locking it into a single move with Choice Band. Pursuit is an option over Trick, as it allows Dusknoir to take advantage of switches forced against frail Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Haunter and Kadabra.

Set Details
========

212 HP EVs and maximum Attack EVs boost Dusknoir's overall bulk and offensive presence. Running 44 EVs in Speed allows Dusknoir to outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Piloswine and possibly cripple them with Trick. An Adamant nature gives an additional boost to Dusknoir's Attack stat. Choice Band is the preferred item, as it provides Dusknoir with a means to hit as hard as possible. Frisk is the preferred ability to scout a foe's item, as it helps against foes bluffing being Choice-locked as well as helping you pick the best time to use Trick.

Usage Tips
========

Switch Dusknoir in on a predicted Rapid Spin to keep entry hazards from being removed. Use Trick to cripple Pokemon Dusknoir has trouble with such as Avalugg and Tangela, as they can shrug off any of its attacks with ease, but keep in mind that Dusknoir's attacking power will be limited without Choice Band. If Pursuit is run in the last moveslot, use it as a means to get the edge against frail Pokemon such as Kadabra and Haunter, as both fear Shadow Sneak. Be mindful of what move Dusknoir locks itself into. Normal- and Dark-types such as Stoutland and Pawniard can take advantage of Dusknoir locked into Shadow Sneak, while Flying-types such as Dodrio and Jumpluff get a free turn on Dusknoir locked into Earthquake.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard setters such as Whirlipede, Dwebble, Roselia, Probopass, and Barbaracle benefit from Dusknoir's ability to keep entry hazards up. Defiant users such as Pawniard and Purugly are solid partners for Dusknoir, as they stop foes from removing entry hazards with Defog. Dark- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mightyena and Poliwrath can cover Dusknoir's Dark- and Ghost-type weaknesses, making them good partners. Pokemon that appreciate Dusknoir's ability to Pursuit trap Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Sand Rush Stoutland, Poliwrath, and Arbok, make for good partners. Pokemon that appreciate physical walls crippled by Trick, such as Tangela, make for good partners as well; examples include Barbaracle, Carracosta, Ursaring, and Jumpluff.

Other Options
########

Dusknoir has several other coverage moves, such as Fire Punch and Rock Slide, though Dusknoir would rather not give up any of the listed options. Shadow Punch is more powerful than Shadow Sneak, though the move lacks priority and is still weak even with a Choice Band. Dusknoir can run Substitute alongside Focus Punch, though it is better off being used as an offensive spinblocker, as Pokemon such as Poliwrath can run a SubPunch set better. Toxic can be used to wear down walls that Dusknoir has trouble getting past, such as Avalugg, while Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical attackers such as Pawniard. Dusknoir can run a defensive set with an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD and an Impish nature with Will-O-Wisp / Pain Split / Foul Play / Shadow Sneak, but such a set is generally outclassed by Gourgeist-XL, which has access to reliable recovery in Synthesis. Spell Tag is an option to boost Dusknoir's Ghost-type STAB move while bluffing being Choice-locked.

Checks and Counters
########

**Dark-types**: Dark-type Pokemon such as Pawniard and Mightyena threaten Dusknoir with their STAB attacks, but they must beware of switching in on an attack they don't resist. If Pawniard is running Pursuit, it can hit Dusknoir locked into Shadow Sneak or Pursuit on the switch for a great amount of damage or set up Swords Dance as Dusknoir switches out. Knock Off users in general cripple Dusknoir by removing its Choice Band; without its Choice Band, Dusknoir lacks offensive presence.

**Physically Defensive Pokemon**: Pokemon with good physical bulk, such as Poliwrath, Avalugg, Carracosta, Pelipper, and Tangela, can take at least two hits from Dusknoir. Poliwrath and Pelipper can cripple Dusknoir with status by means of Scald, Avalugg can heal off damage taken from Dusknoir's attacks with Recover or retaliate with Avalanche, Carracosta can use Knock Off to remove Dusknoir's Choice Band, and Tangela can simply attack Dusknoir with Giga Drain or Leaf Storm. However, most need to be wary of Trick. Many physically bulky Pokemon can take on Dusknoir depending on the move it is locked into.

**Status**: Will-O-Wisp cripples Dusknoir for the rest of the match by lowering its Attack, while Toxic puts Dusknoir on a timer by whittling away at its health each turn.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types such as Haunter and Misdreavus can outspeed Dusknoir and hit it hard with their super effective STAB moves, assuming that Dusknoir is not locked into Shadow Sneak. Gourgeist can survive a Shadow Sneak or Ice Punch and proceed to burn Dusknoir with Will-O-Wisp, heal off any damage taken with Synthesis, or 2HKO Dusknoir with Foul Play.
