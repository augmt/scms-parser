Overview
########

Klang is one of the few viable Steel-types in the tier with its role being a late-game RestTalk Shift Gear sweeper. Its Steel typing is a defensive boon, letting it resist common threats such as Tangela and Roselia. Klang is one of the few physical sweepers that beats Avalugg due to its Steel resisting Avalanche and Gear Grind being able to break Sturdy. Unfortunately, Klang has a really poor movepool, so it's walled easily by bulky opponents such as Pelipper, Poliwrath, and Stunfisk. Klang relies on a lot of support from teammates and is weak before using Shift Gear. 

RestTalk
########
name: RestTalk
move 1: Shift Gear
move 2: Gear Grind
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
ability: Clear Body
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 156 Def / 24 SpD / 76 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Shift Gear boosts Klang's Attack and Speed, potentially letting it sweep or clean up late-game. Gear Grind is a STAB move that hits twice, and while this is helpful against Substitute, Focus Sash and Sturdy users, it only has 85% accuracy. Rest replenishes HP and heals Klang of status, which helps Klang while setting up Shift Gear, and Sleep Talk lets Klang hit opposing Pokemon or further set up while asleep.

Set Details
========

The given Defense EVs and an Impish nature allow Klang to avoid getting 2HKOed by Life Orb Tauros's Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage. The EVs invested in Special Defense let Klang dodge the 2HKO from Choice Specs Raichu's Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock damage. Finally, 76 Speed EVs allow Klang to outspeed Chatot after one Shift Gear. Clear Body is Klang's only viable ability, as Minus and Plus are both useless in singles, and it stops Klang's stats being lowered. Eviolite increases Klang's bulk, so Eviolite Klang can take more hits while setting up with Shift Gear.

Usage Tips
========

Klang should be brought in against foes that can't touch it, such as Roselia, Tangela, and Gourgeist. It is essential that Pokemon that don't mind taking a Gear Grind, such as Pelipper and Poliwrath, are removed before Klang starts setting up. Klang should start using Rest and Sleep Talk once it's low on health or has been inflicted with status; it shouldn't be spamming Gear Grind if it's burned. Klang should get at least one Shift Gear boost before having to use Rest so it outspeeds most Pokemon when using Sleep Talk the next turn.

Team Options
========

Klang appreciates bulky Fairy-types and Water / Flying types, such as Togetic and Pelipper, as they resist Fighting. Grass-types such as Roselia can help take down bulky Water-types that resist Klang's Gear Grind, such as Poliwrath. Toxic Spikes can wear down foes' HP when they stay in to the point when Klang can clean up, so a Pokemon such as Roselia is a much appreciated teammate. Ground-types such as Golem and Piloswine can deal with Electric-types such as Raichu and Zebstrika. Klang appreciates Misdreavus and Haunter because of their immunity to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, two of Klang's three weaknesses. Pokemon that can take Fire-type attacks, such as Carracosta, Ninetales, and Barbaracle, are helpful for covering Klang's last weakness.

Other Options
########

Thunder Wave can be used to cripple offensive Pokemon that aren't expecting it. Volt Switch hits Pelipper hard and confers offensive momentum. Return provides neutral coverage when used with Gear Grind. Wild Charge hits bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Poliwrath, Pelipper, and Swanna super effectively; however, it has recoil damage. Substitute can prevent Klang from getting afflicted by status or revenge killed.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Poliwrath and Throh can take hits from Gear Grind and force Klang out with Circle Throw, rendering its boosts useless. Throh's Storm Throw does a ton of damage, as it always lands a critical hit. Poliwrath can withstand Gear Grind due to its natural bulk and resistance to Steel; it can then set up a Substitute and use Focus Punch, dealing heavy damage to Klang.

**Ground-types**: Ground-type Pokemon such as Camerupt and Stunfisk check Klang; they can survive a Gear Grind and retaliate with Earthquake and Earth Power. They can also set up Stealth Rock while Klang is forced out.

**Fast Taunt users**: Electrode, for example, can cripple Klang with Taunt, which stops Klang from setting up Shift Gear, using Rest to regain health or remove status, and using Sleep Talk if Klang is already asleep. This forces Klang to switch or spam a weak unboosted Gear Grind.

**Fire-types**: Fire-type Pokemon such Ninetales and Flareon can check Klang, threatening Klang and forcing it out with their super effective STAB attacks before it gets the chance to set up. Ninetales can come in as Klang tries to set up Shift Gear and either force Klang to switch out or 2HKO it with a sun-boosted Life Orb Flamethrower.

**Knock Off**: Knock Off users, such as Marowak and Sneasel, can remove Klang's Eviolite, reducing its bulk; this makes Klang unable to take as many hits while setting up with Shift Gear.

**Trick**: Trick users such as Rotom-F can cripple Klang by giving it a Choice item. Not only will Klang be locked into one move, buts its Eviolite will be removed as well, making it frailer and easier to take down. Rotom-F in particular can check Klang, as an unboosted Gear Grind is only a 3HKO, giving Rotom-F plenty of time to Trick a Choice Scarf onto Klang.

**Offensive Pressure**: Pokemon such as Ninetales and Ursaring can pressure Klang, meaning it won't survive long enough to set up Shift Gear and use Rest to heal back the damage. Ninetales and Ursaring can also set up Nasty Plot and Swords Dance as Klang switches out.
