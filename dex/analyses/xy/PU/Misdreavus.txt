Overview
########

Misdreavus's good bulk and defensive typing make it one of the best Normal-type checks in the tier, as well as a good check to common threats such as Golem and Poliwrath. This is helped by a great support movepool, including moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Taunt. Its great defensive typing allows it to switch into physical attackers with ease and spinblock. However, Misdreavus relies on Eviolite for its bulk, and it has limited walling capabilities due to its lack of reliable recovery. Misdreavus can also set up with Nasty Plot, but it needs multiple boosts to break through most special walls.

Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Dazzling Gleam / Thunderbolt
move 4: Taunt / Will-O-Wisp
item: Eviolite
evs: 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Nasty Plot boosts Misdreavus's Special Attack, allowing it to sweep. Shadow Ball is Misdreavus's strongest STAB move and has a good offensive type. Dazzling Gleam hits Dark-type Pokemon, such as Sneasel and Mightyena, while also having perfect neutral coverage alongside Shadow Ball. Thunderbolt also has good neutral coverage and hits Flying- and Water-type Pokemon such as Pelipper and Poliwrath harder. Taunt prevents status and phazing, allowing Misdreavus to set up on walls more easily, while Will-O-Wisp can be used to allow Misdreavus to set up on physical attackers and whittle the foe down. Both Taunt and Will-O-Wisp provide team support, allowing Misdreavus to function outside of sweeping. Substitute can be used to block status and allows Misdreavus to set up on weaker hits; however, it wears Misdreavus down and it can be phazed out anyways.

Set Details
========

136 Speed EVs allow Misdreavus outspeed neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Poliwrath and Mightyena, crippling them with a burn. 252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature boost Misdreavus's power as much as possible. The remaining EVs go in HP to boost its mixed bulk.


Usage Tips
========

Thanks to its good typing, Misdreavus can set up on a lot of Pokemon, such as Poliwrath and Golem. Misdreavus's good natural bulk and typing allow it to take multiple hits, but it gets worn down quickly due to its lack of recovery. Misdreavus can also function as a Spinblocker, so it should be switched in on a predicted Rapid Spin. It is better used as a mid-game wallbreaker, as it lacks the speed and strength to sweep by itself. Taunt should be used when Misdreavus is predicting the opponent to use a status or phazing move.

Team Options
========

Fighting-type Pokemon such as Throh and Poliwrath make for good partners, as they can sponge a Knock Off and beat Dark-types such as Sneasel and Mightyena. Misdreavus also appreciates entry hazard support, particularly from setter Pokemon such as Golem and Glalie, to help gradually weaken the opponent's team and allow it to OHKO Grumpig and Tauros after some boosts. Dark-type Pokemon, such as Sneasel and Mightyena, can beat faster Ghost-types such as Haunter. Wallbreakers, such as Marowak and Heatmor, are also appreciated, as they wear down the opponent's bulky Pokemon that Misdreavus cannot break.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Foul Play / Shadow Ball
move 2: Will-O-Wisp
move 3: Pain Split
move 4: Taunt / Perish Song
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Foul Play helps check physical attackers, as it allows Misdreavus to beat Ursaring and Tauros. Shadow Ball is an equally good option, as it does more damage to specially based Pokemon and some other walls; and unlike Foul Play, can break Poliwrath's Substitutes. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and gradually wears Pokemon down. Pain Split allows Misdreavus to recover health when low, but it is somewhat unreliable, as it relies on the foe being at high amounts of health. Taunt prevents Pokemon from trying to boost or set up entry hazards on Misdreavus and prevents opposing walls from recovering. Perish Song acts as a win condition, as it beats setup sweepers and opposing walls; it is more important on stall teams, against bulky setup sweepers that cannot be phazed. Heal Bell can be used to clear the team's status ailments; however, it forces Misdreavus to give up on a way to beat setup sweepers and walls.

Set Details
========

252 HP and Defense EVs boost Misdreavus's physical defense as much as possible, helping it wall physical attackers. 16 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow it to outspeed neutral-natured base 65 Speed Pokemon, such as Flareon and Heatmor, while also allowing it to Taunt Huntail before it boosts. 52 Speed EVs could be utilized instead to allow Misdreavus to outspeed and burn Mightyena.

Usage Tips
========

Due to its bulk and typing, Misdreavus can switch into plenty of physical attackers, such as Poliwrath and Piloswine, but it should not switch in too often, as it lacks reliable recovery. It also functions as a Spinblocker, so it should switch in on a predicted Rapid Spin. Spreading burns is Misdreavus's main objective. Taunt should be used to prevent Pokemon from setting up, inflicting status, or recovering health, while Shadow Ball can finish off weakened Pokemon and break Substitutes. Use Pain Split when Misdreavus is at low health. Avoiding Knock Off is crucial, as not only will it do a lot of damage, but it prevents Misdreavus from walling as effectively.

Team Options
========

As it can block Rapid Spin, Misdreavus pairs well with Stealth Rock setters, such as Torterra and Piloswine, as well as Spikes and Toxic Spikes setters, such as Roselia. Heal Bell users prevent Misdreavus from getting worn down too quickly by status. Normal-type Pokemon, such as Lickilicky, can beat Ghost-types such as Haunter and opposing Misdreavus, while Misdreavus can switch into Fighting-type moves for them. Fighting-types, such as Throh and Poliwrath, can switch into Knock Off and beat Dark-types. Misdreavus works well on stall-based teams, as it checks common stallbreakers such as Tauros, but it can also work effectively in offense as a glue Pokemon.

Other Options
########

A Calm Mind set could be used to allow Misdreavus to set up on specially attacking Pokemon, while a specially defensive spread could be used to wall them. Magic Coat could be used to bounce back entry hazards. Memento provides support for a teammate to set up, and Destiny Bond punishes the opponent for KOing Misdreavus, though it has limited usage due to Misdreavus's middling Speed. Thunder Wave could be utilized to cripple offensive Pokemon, and Toxic wears walls down quicker, but Will-O-Wisp has overall better utility.

Checks & Counters
########
**Knock Off**: Knock Off hits Misdreavus super effectively and removes its Eviolite, significantly decreasing its bulk. Common users such as Sneasel can outspeed and deal heavy damage with its high Attack stat while Throh can survive a hit and get a Guts boost if burnt.

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Specially bulky Pokemon, such as Bastiodon and Togetic, can easily survive a boosted hit and retaliate with a status or phazing move. However, they both have to watch out for Taunt, although Bastiodon can bounce it back with Magic Coat.

**Offensive Type Advantage**: Dark-types such as Sneasel and Mightyena can outspeed Misdreavus, depending on the set, and deal heavy damage with their STAB moves, and Mightyena gets an Attack boost if it KOs Misdreavus. They do, however, have to be wary of Will-O-Wisp. Ghost-types such as Haunter can outspeed and deal heavy damage; however, they need chip damage to KO and Misdreavus can OHKO with Shadow Ball.

**Normal-types**: Lickilicky is immune to Misdreavus's STAB moves, takes little damage from its coverage moves, can deal heavy damage with Knock Off or phaze it out with Dragon Tail, and can clear its status with Heal Bell. Ursaring gets an Attack boost from Will-O-Wisp, can take a Dazzling Gleam, and can retaliate with Crunch.

**Fire-types**: Bulky Fire-types such as Camerupt and Heatmor can switch into a Will-O-Wisp and then set up entry hazards or deal heavy damage to Misdreavus with their Fire-type STAB moves, but they dislike taking boosted hits. Like Heatmor, Ninetales gets a Flash Fire boost when switching into Will-O-Wisp, and it can then set up Nasty Plots. Specially defensive Flareon can take a boosted hit, while Choice Band sets can deal heavy damage with Flare Blitz.

**Offensive Pressure**: Because Pain Split is situational, Misdreavus finds it hard to stay at high amounts of health in order to switch into offensive Pokemon. Offensive pressure also makes it hard for Misdreavus to set up Nasty Plots, threatening to 2HKO it or wearing it down to the point where it is easily revenge killed.
