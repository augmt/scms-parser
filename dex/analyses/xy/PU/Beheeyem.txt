Overview
########
Due to Beheeyem's base 125 Special Attack and Analytic, often coupled with a Choice Specs, it hits extremely hard. Decent bulk makes it able to survive a hit and fire off strong Psychic-type attacks more than once per game, and it has a pretty good movepool with a lot of coverage options. However, Beheeyem has a bad typing with a nasty weakness to Knock Off, and its low Speed makes it easy for the plethora of faster Pokemon in the tier to revenge kill it if not inside Trick Room.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Psychic / Psyshock
move 2: Signal Beam
move 3: Hidden Power Ground
move 4: Trick / Psyshock
ability: Analytic
item: Choice Specs
evs: 212 HP / 252 SpA / 44 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========
Psychic is Beheeyem's strongest STAB move and hits incredibly hard coming off a base 125 Special Attack stat boosted by a Choice Specs and Analytic. Psyshock is an alternative STAB move that hits special walls such as Lickilicky and Munchlax harder, but it is weaker against other targets due to its lower Base Power. Signal Beam hits opposing Psychic- and Dark-types such as Duosion and Sneasel, which resist or are immune to Beheeyem's STAB move. Hidden Power Ground hits Steel-types such as Metang and Bastiodon, which could otherwise freely switch into Beheeyem. Trick allows Beheeyem to cripple the opponent's special walls by locking them into a move.

Set Details
========
44 Speed EVs allow Beheeyem to outspeed an uninvested Throh so Beheeyem can hit it with a Psychic or Psyshock before Throh can use Knock Off. It is advised to use a little more Speed, however, as Throh often runs a little bit of Speed. 252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximize Beheeyem's damage output. The leftover EVs go into HP to make Beheeyem more capable of taking hits. Analytic boosts Beheeyem's damage even more and almost always activates because Beheeyem is very slow. Choice Specs makes Beheeyem incredibly powerful.

Usage Tips
========
Because Beheeyem is Choice-locked, this set requires a lot of prediction to work; if you predict wrong Beheeyem will be forced to switch out and take entry hazard damage each time it comes in again. This set works best early-game to break through special walls such as Lickilicky and Grumpig or to weaken them for another teammate to break through later in the game. Tricking Beheeyem's Choice Specs onto special walls cripples them enormously, as it forces them to use only one move. Because Beheeyem is almost always going to move last, it does not like taking unnecessary damage by switching into attacks. Thus, you ideally send out Beheeyem after one of your Pokemon has fainted, by giving it free switches with U-turn or Volt Switch, or with double switches.

Team Options
========
Like all Pokemon, Beheeyem appreciates Stealth Rock to increase the chance of KOing Pokemon such as Aurorus and Bouffalant. Special sweepers such as Simipour, Ninetales, and Raichu appreciate Beheeyem weakening special walls so they can break through them late-game. Fighting-types such as Throh and Poliwrath can take care of the Dark-type Pokemon that threaten Beheeyem, although they have to watch out for Mightyena's Play Rough. Poliwrath can also take advantage of Sneasel to set up a Substitute or use Rain Dance. Dark-types such as Sneasel and Mightyena can take out the Ghost-types that hit Beheeyem super effectively, most notably Misdreavus and Haunter. However, both have to watch out for Misdreavus's Will-O-Wisp. Sticky Web support from Kricketune or Leavanny is useful to make Beheeyem capable of outspeeding some Pokemon, but even with Sticky Web, Beheeyem is not that fast.

Trick Room
########
name: Trick Room
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Signal Beam
move 4: Shadow Ball / Hidden Power Ground
ability: Analytic
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD
nature: Quiet
ivs: 30 SpA / 30 SpD / 1 Spe

Moves
========
Trick Room uses Beheeyem's crippling Speed to its advantage to make it faster than nearly every Pokemon under Trick Room. Psychic is Beheeyem's strongest and preferred STAB move. Signal Beam gives Beheeyem more coverage against Dark- and Psychic-types such as Mightyena and opposing Beheeyem, which resist Beheeyem's STAB move. Shadow Ball OHKOes most Misdreavus variants after Stealth Rock damage and hits Metang hard. Hidden Power Ground hits Steel-types such as Bastiodon and Klang, which would otherwise be able to freely switch into Beheeyem, super effectively. However, it hits Metang for less damage than Shadow Ball does.

Set Details
========
252 HP EVs maximize Beheeyem's bulk, and 252 Special Attack EVs maximize the damage Beheeyem can dish out. A Quiet nature is used over a Modest one to be even faster in Trick Room. Analytic is the preferred ability because although Beheeyem usually won't be outsped in Trick Room, it can still boost Beheeyem's damage output if Trick Room is not up yet. A Life Orb is the item of choice, as it allows Beheeyem to hit very hard while still being able to switch moves. Speed IVs are minimized to make Beheeyem even faster in Trick Room.

Usage Tips
========
This set is meant to be a late-game sweeper that cleans up after the opponent's team has been weakened enough for Beheeyem to KO everything. Beheeyem should set up Trick Room against weaker Pokemon such as Swanna or Pokemon that cannot deal that much damage to it, such as Poliwrath. It can also set up Trick Room against defensive Pokemon such as Avalugg and Solrock. Beheeyem should not switch into attacks, because if it does there is a good chance that it will not have enough health left to set up Trick Room. Even if it does, Beheeyem might not be able to sweep due to Life Orb recoil making it faint. If using this set on a dedicated Trick Room team, do not be afraid to sacrifice Beheeyem. Trick Room teams cannot afford to waste too many precious turns by switching, nor do they like losing momentum if the opponent predicts a switch.

Team Options
========
Other slow but strong Pokemon, such as Bouffalant, Marowak, and Rampardos, greatly appreciate Trick Room making them capable of outspeeding more Pokemon. Like it is for all Pokemon, Stealth Rock support is useful to grab some extra KOs against Pokemon such as Flareon, Ninetales, and Stoutland. Good Stealth Rock users would be Carbink, Marowak, and Rampardos. Wallbreakers such as Aurorus, Nasty Plot Raichu, and mixed Heatmor can weaken special walls for Beheeyem. Fighting-types can defeat the Dark-types that threaten Beheeyem. Throh would be the best choice, as it's quite slow and can thus take advantage of the Trick Room Beheeyem sets up. Dark-types can defeat the Ghost-types that give Beheeyem trouble. Zweilous is a good choice on dedicated Trick Room teams because it is slow and very strong. When using this set as a stand-alone sweeper, however, Sneasel and Mightyena are far better choices, as Zweilous is generally a mediocre Pokemon.

Other Options
########
Nasty Plot boosts Beheeyem's Special Attack to insanely high levels, but Beheeyem is too slow to make good use of Nasty Plot and will often get KOed before it can do much damage to the foe. A bulky set with Calm Mind, Recover, Psyshock, and Signal Beam could be used but is outclassed by Duosion, because Duosion has Magic Guard to protect it from status. Thunderbolt provides extra coverage against bulky Water-types such as Wartortle and Prinplup and hits Flying-types such as Togetic and Vullaby as well.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dark-types**: Dark-types such as Sneasel and Mightyena are immune to Psychic and can force Beheeyem out with the threat of Knock Off or Crunch. Sneasel can also set up a Swords Dance as Beheeyem switches out or Pursuit trap it. In Trick Room, however, Beheeyem can easily defeat Sneasel with a Life Orb-boosted Signal Beam.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-type Pokemon such as Misdreavus, Haunter, and Dusknoir can threaten Beheeyem with their super effective STAB moves. Misdreavus can set up a Nasty Plot as Beheeyem switches out for fear of a Shadow Ball.

**Faster Pokemon**: Although Beheeyem has enough bulk to survive most neutral hits from full health, fast and strong Pokemon such as Tauros, Sneasel, and Leafeon can KO it with little to no prior damage needed.
