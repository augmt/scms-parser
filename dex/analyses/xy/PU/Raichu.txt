Overview
########

Raichu's high Speed lets it outspeed the majority of the metagame, allowing it to become a successful revenge killer. This, along with its high Special Attack, means that Raichu forces a lot of switches, and it can capitalize on that with Volt Switch, as Ground-type Pokemon are deterred from switching in due to Raichu's coverage, including moves such as Focus Blast and Grass Knot. Nasty Plot helps Raichu wallbreak and allows it to sweep, but Raichu is easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users and priority. It receives competition from other Electric-types; however, it has niches over them such as its superior strength and coverage over Zebstrika and its higher Speed over Electabuzz. Unfortunately, Raichu is not strong enough to break through walls without a boosting item and team support, its low bulk means that it is easy to revenge kill, as it is OHKOed by moves such as Mightyena's Sucker Punch, and it is easily worn down by entry hazards and Life Orb recoil.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Encore
ability: Lightningrod
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Volt Switch is Raichu's most spammable STAB move, as it provides momentum on switches Raichu forces. Thunderbolt is a stronger STAB move that does not force Raichu to switch out. Focus Blast hits Pokemon that are immune to Electric, such as Golem and Piloswine, as well as Lickilicky and Regice, but it has low accuracy. It can also hit Ground-types hard if Raichu is not running Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Ice hits other Ground-types as well as Grass-types such as Torterra, Jumpluff, and Roselia. Encore can be used to force foes out, allowing Raichu to gain momentum with Volt Switch.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed and a Timid nature allow Raichu to Speed tie with Jumpluff and outspeed everything slower, and 252 Special Attack EVs increase Raichu's power. Life Orb is the preferred item, which further increases Raichu's damage output. Expert Belt can be used to bluff a Choice item and avoid recoil, but running it will result in a noticeable decrease in power. Lightningrod allows Raichu to switch into Electric-type attacks and prevent the use of them in general.

Usage Tips
========

Due to its high Speed, Raichu can be used as a revenge killer, or it can be used to wear down the opposing team with its strong attacks. This means Raichu can be played throughout the battle, as it can perform multiple roles. Raichu should rarely be switched in, as it has low bulk, and instead should come in from Volt Switch or U-turn from teammates or after a KO. It should be careful if switching in on an expected Electric-type attack, as this is easy to predict, and Raichu deters the use of Electric-type attacks with Lightningrod anyway. Volt Switch is its safest move to go for, unless the foe opponent has an Electric immunity, as it allows Raichu to safely switch out and wear down the opposing team while gaining momentum.

Team Options
========

Raichu can create VoltTurn cores with Pokemon such as Ninjask and Flareon, creating momentum by constantly forcing the foe out. Both Pokemon also check Grass-types, and the latter appreciates the removal of Water-types. Entry hazard setters, such as Whirlipede and Golem, wear the opponent's team down further, as VoltTurn cores continuously force the foe out. Ice-types such as Regice and Aurorus are greatly appreciated, as they can take out Ground- and Grass-type Pokemon, and in return, Raichu beats Water-types. Grass-type Pokemon, such as Roselia and Torterra, can check Ground-types, can set up entry hazards, and enjoy the removal of Flying-types, and Fire-type Pokemon such as Ninetales and Rapidash can beat Grass-types and appreciate the removal of Water-types. Fighting-types such as Poliwrath and Machoke can beat Lickilicky and Regice, while Raichu can get past Flying-types. Entry hazard-removing Pokemon, such as Swanna and Torkoal, are appreciated, as Raichu gets worn down from consistently switching out. Due to its offensive presence and low bulk, Raichu fits best on offensive teams.

Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Focus Blast / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Substitute / Encore / Hidden Power Ice
ability: Lightningrod
item: Life Orb / Focus Sash / Leftovers
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Nastly Plot boosts Raichu's Special Attack by two stages, providing it with enough power to break through most walls. Thunderbolt is its strongest STAB move, and Focus Blast provides good neutral coverage and is a strong secondary attack, but it has a shaky accuracy. Hidden Power Ice hits Ground- and Grass-type Pokemon super effectively but has low Base Power. Substitute blocks status and protects Raichu from priority or faster Pokemon. Encore helps Raichu force the foe out, allowing it to more easily boost with Nasty Plot.

Set Details
========

252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are required to outspeed Pokemon such as Ursaring and Rapidash, and maximum Special Attack investment increases Raichu's wallbreaking potential. Life Orb can be used to further increase Raichu's Special Attack but wears it down. Focus Sash allows Raichu to survive a hit, but it is easily broken. Leftovers provides Raichu with passive recovery, but Raichu doesn't really have the bulk to take full advantage of it. Lightningrod allows Raichu to set up on opposing Electric-types and get a power boost from taking Electric-type moves.

Usage Tips
========

Raichu should be used late-game as a sweeper, after the opposing team is worn down and faster Pokemon are removed, or as a mid-game wallbreaker. It should aim to set up on Pokemon that it forces out, such as Pelipper and Togetic, or on Pokemon that it has Encored into non-attacking moves. If set up, Raichu can still be switched out against a revenge killer, as it can find multiple setup opportunities throughout the game. It can also be used throughout the game as a revenge killer.

Team Options
========

The choice of Raichu's teammates often depends on its coverage move. For example, if it lacks Focus Blast, Pokemon such as Poliwrath and Machoke should be used in order to take care of Piloswine and Lickilicky, and if lacking Hidden Power Ice, Raichu appreciates Ice-types, such as Regice and Aurorus, to take care of Ground- and Grass-types. Raichu should be used on offensive teams which carry wallbreakers, such as Heatmor and Stoutland, in order to weaken the opposing walls, and entry hazard users, such as Piloswine and Dwebble, to wear the opposing team down. Fire- and Flying-types such as Rapidash and Dodrio beat Grass-types, which Raichu has problems getting past, and Water- and Grass-types such as Simipour and Victreebel can remove Ground-types, which Raichu hates. Choice Scarf Mr. Mime can provide Healing Wish support to Raichu if Raichu is worn down from wallbreaking, allowing Raichu to sweep, and can revenge kill faster Pokemon. Sticky Web support from Pokemon such as Leavanny and Kricketune slows down faster Pokemon, but Choice Scarf Rotom-F and Dodrio are unaffected and will still outspeed Raichu.

Other Options
########

Raichu has a decent Attack stat and a wide range of physical moves, such as Volt Tackle, Iron Tail, Knock Off, and Extreme Speed, but running Extreme Speed results in move illegalities. Knock Off can be used on a specially based set to cripple switch-ins, particularly Roselia. Raichu also has a decent special movepool including moves such as Grass Knot, which hits Pokemon such as Piloswine and Golem super effectively and has perfect accuracy, so Raichu doesn't have to rely on the inaccurate Focus Blast. Surf hits Ground- and Rock-types super effectively but is illegal with Lightningrod. Due to Raichu's high Speed, a Choice Scarf set could be used to let Raichu function as a revenge killer, outspeeding every other Choice Scarf user and boosted Pokemon such as Shell Smash Barbaracle, but such a set is weak. Choice Specs can be used over Life Orb for more power, but Raichu needs the ability to change moves. Raichu can be used on a rain team with Thunder for increased damage output. Salac Berry combined with Substitute on the Nasty Plot set prevents Raichu from being revenge killed by faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ground-types**: Ground-type Pokemon such as Piloswine and Golem are immune to Raichu's Electric-type STAB move and can retaliate back with their Ground-type STAB move or set up entry hazards, but they have to watch out for super effective coverage moves. Stunfisk is a particularly good switch-in, as it can easily take super effective Hidden Power Ices.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Torterra and Quilladin resist Electric and can deal heavy damage to Raichu with their STAB moves and set up entry hazards, but they have to be careful around Hidden Power Ice. Roselia has enough Special Defense and recovery to easily take any move from Raichu and can put it to sleep or use it as entry hazard fodder, and Gogoat can set up with Substitute or Bulk Up.

**Faster Pokemon**: Although Raichu has a high base Speed, Pokemon such as Zebstrika and Floatzel can outspeed and revenge kill a weakened Raichu, but they dislike switching in. Choice Scarf users such as Mr. Mime, Rotom-F, and Sawsbuck can also outspeed and KO Raichu.

**Priority**: Due to Raichu's low bulk, common priority moves such as Dusknoir's Shadow Sneak and Carracosta's Aqua Jet can KO a weakened Raichu. Mightyena can OHKO Raichu after Stealth Rock damage with Sucker Punch, but it has to be careful of Substitute.

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Bulky Pokemon such as Hypno and Grumpig can take any hit from Raichu then retaliate back with their attacks or phaze it. Other specially defensive Pokemon such as Lickilicky can take an unboosted hit, but they will get KOed by boosted attacks or coverage moves.

**Passive Damage**: Raichu is greatly worn down by Life Orb recoil and entry hazards and can easily be revenge killed.
