Overview
########

Tangela is an amazing Pokemon in the PU metagame due to its amazing physical bulk with an Eviolite and good defensive typing that allows it to check top-tier threats such as Poliwrath, Carracosta, and Barbaracle. With one of the best defensive abilities in the game, Regenerator, Tangela can be an amazing pivot that heals itself each time it switches out. In addition to its modest Special Attack, it has a decent movepool that includes Sleep Powder, Leech Seed, and Synthesis. However, Tangela somewhat relies on its Eviolite, and losing it can be detrimental. Its weakness to common types in PU such as Fire, Ice, and Flying hinders its usefulness a bit. Overall, as either an offensively based tank or a defensively based supporter, Tangela's ability to fit into any playstyle allows it to be a great asset to any team.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Leaf Storm
move 2: Sleep Powder
move 3: Giga Drain
move 4: Hidden Power Ice
ability: Regenerator
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Leaf Storm is an incredibly powerful STAB move that hits Ground-, Water-, and Rock-types very hard at the cost of halving Tangela's Special Attack with each use. Sleep Powder is used to put foes to sleep, crippling them and conferring momentum. Giga Drain is Tangela's more reliable STAB attack, providing coverage against Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types, as well as being a reliable source of recovery. Lastly, Hidden Power Ice allows Tangela to hit threats such as Torterra. Ancient Power can be used instead to hit Bug- and Fire-types more effectively on the switch while still hitting Flying-types, namely Articuno, but Hidden Power Ice's coverage is superior.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread increases Tangela's bulk and attacking power, the latter further supplemented by a Modest nature. Eviolite is Tangela's item of choice, as it drastically increases its defenses. Lastly, Regenerator allows Tangela multiple switch-in opportunities to act as a bulky pivot.

Usage Tips
========

Tangela's primary function is to act as a very bulky special attacker, taking on most Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokemon with ease. Tangela works well on offensive teams thanks to its great raw physical bulk and Regenerator that allow it to act as a bulky pivot. Avoid special attacks if possible, as even though it is bulky, Tangela's Special Defense is far lower than its Defense. Tangela can come in on most physical attackers and wear them down with Leaf Storm or Giga Drain. Sleep Powder should be used to cripple one of Tangela's checks or counters on the switch-in, though this requires a bit of prediction.

Team Options
========

Fire-types such as Flareon and Ninetales make for excellent teammates, as they beat Bug- and Ice-types, while Tangela beats Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types for them in return. Ground-types such as Camerupt and Stunfisk make for good teammates, as they can beat Poison- and Fire-types for Tangela, while Tangela beats Water-types in return. Rock-types such as Barbaracle and Carracosta make for good teammates, as they can beat the Fire-, Bug-, Flying-, and Ice-type Pokemon that give Tangela trouble. In return, Tangela can effectively wall most Grass-, Ground-, and Electric-type Pokemon that could give them trouble.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Giga Drain
move 2: Sleep Powder / Toxic
move 3: Synthesis / Leech Seed
move 4: Hidden Power Ice
ability: Regenerator
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Giga Drain is a reliable STAB attack and source of recovery that provides coverage against Rock-, Water-, and Ground-types, such as Barbaracle, Carracosta, Poliwrath, Piloswine, Marowak, and Golem. Sleep Powder cripples foes by putting them to sleep, ensuring a gain in momentum. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to better wear down and stall out switch-ins such as Bouffalant, Heatmor, Ninetales, and Camerupt. Synthesis can be used as a reliable source of instant recovery, while Leech Seed can provide steady recovery each turn while simultaneously sapping the opposing Pokemon's health. Finally, Hidden Power Ice allows Tangela to hit threats such as Torterra. Stun Spore can be used for its ability to cripple foes for the whole match, but Tangela struggles to find the room to run it.

Set Details
========

The EV spread, along with a Bold nature, maximizes Tangela's physical bulk. Eviolite further bolsters both of Tangela's defenses. Regenerator allows Tangela to regain HP every time it switches out, making it very hard to wear down.

Usage Tips
========

Tangela's primary function is to act as a physical wall, as it can take on most Water-, Rock-, and. Ground-type Pokemon with ease. It works best on stall teams thanks to its great bulk, array of support moves, and ability to switch in and out thanks to Regenerator. Avoid taking hits from special attacks if possible, as Tangela's Special Defense is far lower than its Defense, even when holding Eviolite. Tangela can come in on most physical attackers and wear them down with Leech Seed and Giga Drain. With a bit of prediction, Sleep Powder can be used to cripple one of Tangela's checks or counters on the switch-in.

Team Options
========

Special walls such as Lickilicky make for the best teammates, as they form great defensive cores with Tangela. Ground-types such as Piloswine and Stunfisk make for good teammates, as they can beat Poison- and Fire-types for Tangela, while Tangela beats Water-types in return. Rock-types such as Carracosta are good partners, as they can beat the Fire-, Bug-, Flying-, and Ice-type Pokemon that give Tangela trouble. In return, Tangela can effectively wall most Grass-, Ground-, and Electric-type Pokemon that could give them trouble. Entry hazard setters such as Garbodor can absorb Toxic Spikes for Tangela, as well as lay down their own, helping Tangela stall out its foes. Lastly, Fire-types such as Camerupt and Flareon are excellent teammates, as they beat the Bug- and Ice-types that trouble Tangela, while Tangela beats Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types for them in return.

Other Options
########

Although Tangela is a great Pokemon in the PU metagame, it has very few other options to utilize. Sludge Bomb can be used for coverage against Grass- and Fairy-types, but primarily for its 30% chance to poison and cripple walls. Knock Off can be used to remove items from foes, crippling them, but Tangela struggles to find a spot for it. A specially defensive spread can be used to better wall Water-types, but Tangela works best as a physical wall. Lastly, Choice Specs can be used in conjunction with Leaf Storm to catch opponents off guard.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Heatmor, Ninetales, Flareon, and Camerupt can all take out Tangela with their super effective Fire-type STAB moves. They must be wary of Sleep Powder, however.

**Pokemon with Sap Sipper**: Pokemon with Sap Sipper such as Bouffalant, Gogoat, and Zebstrika do not take any damage from Tangela's Grass-type moves and gain an Attack boost if struck by one. Zebstrika can OHKO Tangela with Overheat, while Bouffalant and Gogoat can set up on it and proceed to sweep.

**Ice-types**: Specially-based Ice-types such as Rotom-F, Regice, Articuno, and Glaceon can all OHKO Tangela with their super effective STAB attacks, and also take relatively little damage from Tangela's attacks.

**Poison-types**: Poison-types such as Garbodor, Roselia, Haunter, and Arbok all have a relatively easy time beating Tangela, as they take little damage from Tangela's attacks and can threaten it with their super effective STAB attacks. Roselia is an exceptionally good counter, as it is immune to both Leech Seed and Sleep Powder.
