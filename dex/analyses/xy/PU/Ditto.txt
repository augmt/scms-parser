Overview
########
Ditto is one of the best revenge killers in the tier due to its ability, Imposter, which allows it to switch in and copy the foe's stats, moveset, and boosts. Ditto discourages foes from setting up stat boosts, as it can copy them; however, it struggles against Bulk Up and Calm Mind users such as Poliwrath and Carbink, respectively. Ditto also struggles against stall, as it is usually locked into one move, disabling it from healing, not to mention its terrible HP stat and the fact that after transforming, each of its moves has only 5 PP. Ditto has a hard time against opposing Choice Scarf users due to them outspeeding it and Ditto being easy to play around, because although you know the foe's set, the opponent also knows your transformed Ditto's set; therefore, the opponent can predict the incoming attack.

Revenge Killer
########
name: Revenge Killer
move 1: Transform
ability: Imposter
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
ivs: 30 HP / 30 SpA / 1 Spe
nature: Relaxed

Moves
========
Transform is the only move Ditto learns, but it shouldn't ever need to be used, as Imposter transforms Ditto into the foe upon switching in. After transforming into a foe, each of Ditto's moves only has 5 PP. With the a Choice Scarf, Ditto usually moves even faster than the foe it transforms into.

Set Details
========
The IVs allow Ditto to get Hidden Power Grass against Huntail and Carracosta, if they are running it, to hit them hard. The Choice Scarf is mandatory; if Ditto isn't using it, it has to rely on winning Speed ties to move before the foes it has transformed into, which is based on luck. Imposter is also mandatory so Ditto transforms into the foe upon switching in rather than wasting a turn using Transform. Hidden Power Fire IVs (30 Atk / 30 SpA / 0 Spe) can be used to hit Grass- and Ice-types, such as Tangela, while Hidden Power Electric IVs (30 SpA / 1 Spe) can be used instead to hit Water- and Flying-type Pokemon, such as Huntail and Mantine. The minimum Speed and maximum Defense investment is to help Ditto against opposing Ditto in Struggle wars.

Usage Tips
========
Ditto should only be used as a revenge killer, as it can pick off weakened Pokemon well. It's a good idea to send in Ditto after losing a Pokemon if the foe has accumulated stat boosts, as Ditto has a chance of sweeping. Another way to bring Ditto in safely would be by using a slow Volt Switch, U-turn, or Baton Pass. When bringing in Ditto, you should choose wisely what attack it should be Choice-locked into, considering each of its moves only has 5 PP after it transforms. Ditto shouldn't switch into anything, as the foe could use that turn to set up or OHKO Ditto by attacking. Toxic Spikes can wear Ditto down; even if Ditto comes in on a Poison- or Steel-type, Ditto gets poisoned before it transforms into the opposing Pokemon. Sticky Web isn't a problem for Ditto, as it copies the foe's stat boosts and drops exactly. Ditto can take advantage of useful abilities when transforming such as Poliwrath's Water Absorb to give it an immunity. All of these abilities allow Ditto to switch in with less risk.

Ditto should be preserved for late-game if there is a setup sweeper, such as Shell Smash Carracosta and Shell Smash Barbaracle, on the opponent's team that threatens yours. This is so Ditto can come in after one of your Pokemon have fainted and get the opposing setup sweeper's stat boosts. Ditto should be used to transform into Pokemon that threaten the opponent's team late-game, so Ditto has a chance of cleaning up by finishing off weakened Pokemon or performing a sweep.

Team Options
========
Ditto appreciates teammates that can take on opposing setup sweepers such as Mantine and Pelipper, as they can take on Bulk Up users such as Poliwrath and Gogoat. Roselia and Flareon can take care of Calm Mind users such as Clefairy and Carbink. Grounded Poison-types, such as Roselia and Arbok, rid your side of the field from Toxic Spikes, preventing Ditto getting poisoned upon switching in and worn down as a result. Offensive teams generally work better with Ditto, as they can prevent foes from setting up a Substitute on Pokemon such as Poliwrath and Leafeon. A slow U-turn, Volt Switch, or Baton Pass user such as Togetic can be beneficial to Ditto, as it allows Ditto to switch in without taking damage. Offensive Pokemon such as Golem can help Ditto take care of Unburden Drifblim by OHKOing it with Stone Edge or, if it is already weakened, Sucker Punch.

Other Options
########
Ditto should only be using a Choice Scarf set, as otherwise it has to rely on winning Speed ties to move first. This strategy relies too much on luck and could cost you the match if things don't go your way.

Checks & Counters
########
**Substitute**: Substitute users such as Poliwrath are a pain for Ditto, as it cannot transform into them as long as they are behind a Substitute. If Poliwrath is behind a Substitute and forces Ditto to switch in with Circle Throw, Ditto is forced to either get OHKOed or switch out.

**Ditto**: Ditto can't transform into another Ditto. If the opponent has a Ditto that has already transformed, has stat boosts, and is ready to sweep your team, your Ditto can't switch in and transform into it. Therefore, the opposing Ditto has a chance to sweep if no Pokemon on your team can either outspeed or take a hit it.

**Bulky Pokemon**: Calm Mind and Bulk Up users, such as Duosion and Gogoat, get bulkier as they set up. After transforming, each of Ditto's attacks has a limited amount of PP, so Duosion and Gogoat can take hits and continue boosting up, not to mention Duosion usually has Recover and Gogoat has Milk Drink. Pokemon with access to recovery moves, such as Lickilicky, Artcuno, and Avalugg, can wear Ditto down and use Wish, Roost, and Recover, respectively, to stall it out.

**Unburden**: Pokemon with Unburden, such as Drifblim, have their Speed doubled after their held item is lost. However, Ditto will not get the Unburden boost if it is still holding a Choice Scarf, which boosts its Speed only 1.5x, so opposing Unburden users will be able to outspeed Ditto after their Speed boost.

**Playing Around the Set**: The opponent knows exactly what moves Ditto has, so it's easy to play around it. For example, if Ditto transforms into Rotom-F and the opponent knows that Ditto is most likely going for Volt Switch to gain momentum, they will likely bring in a Ground-type, such as Piloswine, forcing Ditto to switch out and give the foe a free turn to attack, lay down entry hazards, or set up stat boosts.

**Paralysis**: Ditto doesn't like getting paralyzed, as its role as a revenge killer will be rendered virtually worthless. If Ditto switches in on a Thunder Wave user such as Regice and gets paralyzed, its Speed is halved and revenge killing capabilities are all but gone, as it will be slower than foes it transforms into.
