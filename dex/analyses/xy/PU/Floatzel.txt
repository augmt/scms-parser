Overview
########

Floatzel has a very impressive Speed, and its decent Attack allows it to be a good revenge killer; however, it lacks enough strength to break through physical walls such as Tangela and Poliwrath, and offensive sets face competition from Pokemon such as Basculin. Floatzel's niche lies in Baton Passing Bulk Up boosts, as its high Speed and access to Taunt give it an edge over Huntail. Floatzel also has a wide support movepool, including moves such as Switcheroo, and an excellent ability in Water Veil that allows it to set up on Pokemon such as Pelipper with ease. Unfortunately, Floatzel has poor bulk and find it difficult to set up against offensive teams and can be easily worn down when setting up.

Baton Pass
########
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Taunt / Substitute
move 4: Waterfall
ability: Water Veil
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Bulk Up boosts Floatzel's Attack and Defense, allowing it to set up on physically offensive Pokemon. Baton Pass passes the boosts to Floatzel's teammates. Taunt prevents status and phazing, letting Baton Pass recipients come in safely. Substitute helps Baton Pass recipients take a hit or avoid phazing from Poliwrath, but they can be phazed by other means, and Floatzel has poor bulk, meaning its Substitute is easy to break. Waterfall gives Floatzel some offensive presence, allowing it to become be a revenge killer due to its high Speed.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature are required to outspeed Pokemon such as Jumpluff and Swoobat. Maximum HP investment increases Floatzel's mixed bulk, allowing it to set up more easily. Leftovers provides some recovery, which Floatzel otherwise lacks, and Water Veil prevents Pokemon such as Misdreavus from burning Floatzel and allows Floatzel to more comfortably take Scalds.

Usage Tips
========

Floatzel has poor bulk and thus should not be switched in to take a hit; it prefers to come in after a KO against something it beats. Floatzel should take advantage of passive Pokemon, such as Togetic, Pelipper, and Misdreavus, to set up Bulk Ups, and Bulk Up's Defense boosts allow Floatzel to set up on physical attackers such as Flareon, Piloswine, and Pawniard. Its Water typing forces out Pokemon such as Ninetales, Armaldo, and Marowak, providing free turns to set up. With Substitute, Floatzel can set up on Pokemon such as defensive Poliwrath, while Taunt should be used to prevent opposing Pokemon from using Taunt, inflicting status, and setting up. Floatzel can be used more than once in a game, so do not worry about setting up too early. Its high Speed also allows it to revenge kill weakened threats such as Ninetales.

Team Options
========

Floatzel appreciates multiple Baton Pass recipients so that it can pass to an appropriate Pokemon depending on what the opponent has out. Recipients such as Dodrio, Leafeon, and Flareon can take advantage of Grass-types that switch into Floatzel. Other good recipients include those with good Attack and decent Speed or priority so they can sweep, and ones that don't have the bulk or ability to set up by themselves. These include Dodrio, Rapidash, and Basculin. Slower, bulky Pokemon such as Poliwrath, Carracosta, Piloswine, Torterra, and Marowak also appreciate the boosts.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Hidden Power Electric
move 4: Baton Pass / Surf
ability: Water Veil
item: Choice Specs
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Hydro Pump is Floatzel's strongest STAB move, dealing heavy damage to any foe that does not resist it. Ice Beam hits Grass-types that resist such as Roselia, super effectively, and provides good neutral coverage. Hidden Power Electric hits Water-types, specifically Pelipper, granting perfect neutral coverage. Baton Pass provides momentum on predicted switches and allows teammates to deal with specific threats. Surf is a more reliable STAB move due to its better accuracy. Switcheroo can be used to cripple Lickilicky while stopping bulky sweepers such as Clefairy, and Focus Blast 2HKOes Lickilicky and Regice while hitting other Normal- and Steel-types hard, but it has shaky accuracy.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allow Floatzel to Speed tie with Sneasel, and 252 Special Attack EVs let Floatzel hit as hard as possible. Choice Specs boosts Floatzel's power even more, making it difficult to switch into. Water Veil allows Floatzel to take Scalds and not get worn down by possible burns, but Swift Swim can be used on a rain team or to check opposing Rain Dance Poliwrath.

Usage Tips
========

Floatzel should be used as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker, but it can sweep late-game when Choice Scarf users are removed and foes are weakened, and Floatzel can be used as a revenge killer due to its high Speed. Try not to reveal Floatzel's item too early, as it can successfully bait Pokemon such as Tangela and Pelipper in if the opponent does not know Floatzel is a special attacker. Be careful when locking Floatzel into Hidden Power Electric, as it is weak and easy to take advantage of. Baton Pass should be used on predicted switches into counters, such as Lickilicky, to gain momentum.

Team Options
========

Floatzel works best on offensively based teams, as it can weaken checks and counters of other offensive Pokemon. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Golem and Whirlipede weaken foes, and Stealth Rock allows Floatzel to OHKO Raichu. Physical attackers, such as Carracosta, Torterra, and Leafeon, enjoy the baiting of Tangela and other physical walls and can set up on Lickilicky, which Floatzel lures in and can use Baton Pass against. Alternatively, special attackers, such as Mr. Mime and Simipour, appreciate the crippling of Lickilicky and weakening of other special walls. On rain teams, Swift Swim Floatzel enjoys multiple rain-setting teammates, including Volbeat and Electrode, as well as teammates that can use the rain, such as Armaldo, Golduck, and Raichu.

Other Options
########

Floatzel's decent Attack stat, wide movepool that includes Ice Punch, Low Kick, and Crunch, and access to Switcheroo allow it to successfully utilize Choice Band. A physically based Life Orb set, with Ice Beam for Tangela coverage, prevents Floatzel from being locked into a move. Floatzel's high Speed allows it to perform these roles more successfully than Pokemon such as Simipour and Basculin. Agility is a possibility instead of Bulk Up, but Bulk Up's boosts are generally more useful for recipients. A specially defensive spread gives Floatzel nice mixed bulk after using Bulk Up, but Floatzel's biggest niche is its Speed. Floatzel could be used on a rain team, as it has access to Swift Swim and Rain Dance, but it is already fast enough. A Flame Orb set with Switcheroo can be used to cripple switch-ins such as Poliwrath. Maranga Berry allows Floatzel to more comfortably set up on special attackers and allows its Baton Pass recipient to safely switch in, while Salac Berry allows slower teammates to sweep or faster ones to outspeed Choice Scarf users.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangela and Simisage can switch in, take a hit, and retaliate with their Grass-type STAB moves. Both Torterra and Quilladin can use Roar to phaze Floatzel's teammate if Floatzel Baton Passes out. Floatzel will refrain from Taunting Leech Seed or status, which can cripple switch-ins, in fear of Grass-type attacks.

**Offensive Pressure**: Strong offensive Pokemon such as Dodrio and Beheeyem deal enough damage to Floatzel to prevent it from setting up in fear of being KOed, and any Baton Pass recipient will be crippled by a strong hit.

**Electric-types**: Electric-type Pokemon such as Raichu and Luxray can take a hit and deal heavy damage to Floatzel with their Electric-type STAB moves. Zebstrika and Choice Scarf Rotom-F can OHKO Floatzel before it can Baton Pass its boosts.

**Special Attackers**: Strong special attackers, such as Regice and Swanna, cripple Floatzel with their STAB or coverage moves. Choice Scarf users such as Haunter and Mr. Mime can outspeed and finish off a weakened Floatzel.

**Phazing**: Both Poliwrath and Lickilicky can survive a boosted hit and phaze Taunt variants of Floatzel with Circle Throw and Dragon Tail, respectively, while Substitute variants can be phazed by Roar and Whirlwind users such as Quilladin and Grumpig.
