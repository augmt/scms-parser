Overview
########

Kricketune is the best Sticky Web setter in PU, allowing it to support its slow but powerful teammates by slowing down the opposing Pokemon. Unlike other Sticky Web users such as Leavanny and Ariados, Kricketune has a lot of utility outside of setting up Sticky Web. It can prevent slower Defog users from removing its entry hazard by using Taunt as well as continue to annoy foes with Knock Off and Endeavor. Unfortunately, entry hazard removal is common in PU, and as a suicide Sticky Web setter, Kricketune requires a lot of team support to keep Sticky Web up. Kricketune is also rather slow and not very threatening; thus, taking care of common Sticky Web partners is often enough to prevent Kricketune from bugging a team too much.

Moves
========

Sticky Web allows Kricketune to slow down the opponent's team and support its slow teammates. Taunt is a great move that allows Kricketune to outspeed and prevent Defog users from removing Sticky Web. In addition, it prevents slower foes from stacking Spikes or setting up against it. Endeavor allows Kricketune to bring foes down to 1 HP after it activates its Focus Sash, letting a teammate finish them off. Knock Off removes items and is useful to weaken NFE Pokemon such as Misdreavus, Piloswine, and Tangela, annoy stall teams by removing Leftovers, and discourage Ghost-types from switching in on Endeavor. Bug Bite is an option over Knock Off that gets boosted by Technician and allows Kricketune to OHKO Life Orb Sneasel and 2HKO Leafeon.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed investment allows Kricketune to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible, letting it Taunt bulky Defog users before they remove Sticky Web, as well as set up Sticky Web and use Endeavor on as many foes as possible. Focus Sash almost guarantees that Kricketune will be able to set up Sticky Web and enables it to use Endeavor effectively. Kricketune should not invest in bulk because the set is designed as a suicide lead, and having less bulk enables it to utilize a more powerful Endeavor.

Usage Tips
========

Kricketune should usually be used as a lead to maximize the effect of its Focus Sash and let it set up Sticky Web as soon as possible, unless it is obvious that the opponent will lead with a Pokemon that beats Kricketune, such as a faster Taunt user. If any Pokemon that has Defog comes in on Kricketune, use Taunt to prevent Sticky Web from being removed. Set up Sticky Web as soon as possible, and if it is certain that Sticky Web will remain on the field for the rest of the game, sacrifice Kricketune to give one of its teammates a free switch-in. After setting up Sticky Web, Kricketune should stay in and spam Knock Off to annoy the opponent until it gets brought down to its Focus Sash. After this, use Endeavor as much as possible to soften up foes. If Kricketune is up against a Toxic Spikes user, it is advisable to use Taunt first, then set up Sticky Web, because the residual damage from Toxic Spikes will limit its teammates' longevity. Against stall teams, it is advisable to simply use a combination of Taunt and Knock Off to wear down foes because Sticky Web rarely comes in handy against these teams. If a Pokemon that threatens to sweep your team comes in on Kricketune with an intact Focus Sash, Kricketune can use Endeavor and bring the foe down to 1 HP on the same turn it gets attacked and brought down to the Focus Sash, neutering a threat. If the opposing team has a Rapid Spin or Defog user, it isn't a bad idea to set up Sticky Web and switch out to preserve Kricketune in case the entry hazard needs to be set up again.

Team Options
========

Kricketune should only be used on offensive teams because they can deal with the early loss of a teammate much better than defensive teams can. Offensive teams can also pressure Defog and Rapid Spin users more easily and usually have a way to beat stall teams that do not mind Sticky Web. Slow but powerful teammates can outspeed more Pokemon with Sticky Web up, as well as cripple Defog users. Examples include Heatmor, Marowak, and Beheeyem. Sticky Web teams also appreciate fast Pokemon, such as Ninetales, Tauros, and Choice Scarf Rotom-F; these Pokemon not only outspeed virtually the entire tier, including revenge killers, but provide insurance against Flying-types, Pokemon with Levitate, and opposing Sticky Web teams. Spinblockers such as Misdreavus and Haunter can foil attempts to spin away Sticky Web, and they even have access to Taunt and Thunderbolt to stop common Defog users. Purugly can also discourage the use of Defog with its ability Defiant, giving it a +2 Attack boost when it switches into Defog. An offensive Stealth Rock user, such as Marowak, Rampardos, or Golem, can provide Stealth Rock support, which is useful to wear down foes for the team while threatening them offensively.

Other Options
########

Kricketune does not have many other options; a non-Sticky Web set is either bad or outclassed by another Pokemon.Toxic can be used to cripple bulky foes, but Kricketune does not have a spare moveslot for it. Sing can be used to neuter a threat, but its accuracy is terrible.

Checks & Counters
########

**Entry Hazard Removal**: Entry hazard removal is common in PU and will leave Kricketune's slower teammates more vulnerable to attacks. Rapid Spin users include Avalugg and Wartortle; the latter can even use Rapid Spin on Ghost-types thanks to nForesight. Swanna is faster than Kricketune and thus avoids Taunt; it can then Defog away the Sticky Web and defeat Kricketune. Bulky Defog users, such as Pelipper, Vullaby, and Togetic, are susceptible to Kricketune's Taunt, but are able to use Defog against Kricketune's teammates; however, constant offensive pressure could easily cripple them.

**Faster Taunt Users**: Faster Taunt users are able to avoid Kricketune's Taunt and can Taunt it to prevent it from setting up Sticky Web. Misdreavus and Haunter both have access to Taunt and are immune to Endeavor; they dislike Knock Off, though. Serperior, and Sneasel are also faster albeit less common users of Taunt, although they get hit hard by the uncommon Bug Bite.

**Purugly**: Purugly is faster and has access to Fake Out, meaning that Kricketune will be KOed without even having the chance to set up Sticky Web thanks to Fake Out's guaranteed flinch.

**Immunity to Sticky Web**: Flying-types and Levitate users are completely immune to the effects of Sticky Web. For example, Swanna, Dodrio, and Haunter can come in on a slower Pokemon and hit something hard. This could be problematic if the Sticky Web team lacks faster Pokemon that can deal with them.

**Ditto**: Ditto cannot switch into a Taunt and dislikes Knock Off; however, if it switches in safely, it gets to copy Kricketune and set up Sticky Web. This means that the Sticky Web team is also slowed down, and the opposing team will likely be faster due to the presence of Sticky Web on both sides. Furthermore, Ditto is usually only seen on offensive teams, which can easily take advantage of the slow nature of Sticky Web teams.
