Overview
########

Pelipper is a great Defogger thanks to its defensive typing, which allows it to wall threats such as Poliwrath, in addition to its decent defensive stats. Furthermore, it boasts a reliable recovery option in Roost. However, Pelipper suffers from a 4x weakness to Electric-type attacks and a low Speed stat, which means that common attackers such as Rotom-F and Raichu force it out. It is also weak to Stealth Rock, which means that it loses a chunk of its HP when coming in to remove said entry hazard. Finally, its lacking offensive presence means that it can be used as setup fodder, though its access to U-turn partially mitigates this.

Defensive Defog
########
Name: Defensive Defog
move 1: Defog
move 2: Scald
move 3: Roost
move 4: U-turn / Toxic / Air Slash
ability: Keen Eye
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpA
Nature: Bold

Moves
========

Defog is essential on Pelipper given that it is a very good asset to any team, especially those with several Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock. Roost allows Pelipper to reliably recover health. Scald is a STAB move with a high burn chance that can come in handy against attackers and walls alike. U-turn allows Pelipper to gain momentum and switch out of strong attackers wanting to take advantage of it. Toxic gradually wears down walls and attackers. Alternatively, Air Slash hits Throh and Poliwrath and breaks the latter's Substitutes, though it won't be doing a lot of damage coming off Pelipper's uninvested base 85 Special Attack.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs lessen the damage that Pelipper takes from Stealth Rock and 252 Defense EVs give Pelipper the best possible chance of being able to withstand physical hits. Keen Eye is chosen due to the fact that it is compatible with Defog, unlike Rain Dish. Leftovers grants Pelipper passive recovery. 96 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed neutral-natured base 45s such as Marowak and Golem, though running these Speed EVs detracts from Pelipper's bulk.

Usage Tips
========

As Pelipper is a vital Pokemon to keep alive in order to remove entry hazards with Defog or poison a foe with Toxic, Roost should be used often to keep Pelipper above 50-60% of its HP. Switch Pelipper into Pokemon that it can check or counter, such as Poliwrath and Throh. It should then proceed to use Defog to remove entry hazards or dish out a Scald or Toxic. U-turn on a predicted switch to gain momentum for the team. U-turn also makes Pelipper less of a momentum drain for balanced teams, as Pelipper is so slow that it will often take a hit and then bring in a teammate safely. Pelipper should not switch in on a special attack unless it resists it and is at high health. You should try switching Pelipper in on something that it will be able to pull off a Roost or a Defog against. Pelipper shouldn't directly switch in on most Stealth Rock setters, as many of them carry Rock-type moves that threaten it. For example, after Stealth Rock damage, Marowak can 2HKO Pelipper with Double-Edge or OHKO it with Stone Edge, and Stunfisk can use its 4x effective STAB Discharge.

Team Options
========

Specially defensive Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Bastiodon make good teammates, as they can take special attacks that Pelipper can't. Ground-type Pokemon that can take Rock- and Electric-type attacks, such as Piloswine, Golem, and Stunfisk, are good partners, and Pelipper can take physical Water-type attacks that threaten them in return. Fighting-types such as Poliwrath and Throh can take the Rock-type attacks that Pelipper dislikes. Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock such as Rotom-F, Ninetales, and Sneasel appreciate the Defog support that Pelipper can provide. Pelipper fits into stall and balanced teams due to its bulk and Defog support, as well as its access to Toxic and Roost for wearing down foes while keeping its HP up.

Other Options
########

Hurricane is a powerful STAB attack, though its accuracy is unreliable and Pelipper generally would rather have an option with more utility in its fourth moveslot. Knock Off deprives the foe of its held item. Pelipper can provide weather support for the team with Rain Dance and then pivot out with U-turn, though Volbeat is generally a better choice for this role thanks to Prankster and Encore. Tailwind helps Pelipper and its teammates get the jump on foes that they could not normally outspeed, but Pelipper would rather not forgo the moveslot and the move's duration is disappointingly short.

Checks & Counters
########

**Electric-types**: Electric-type Pokemon such as Rotom-F, Raichu, and Zebstrika don't appreciate a Toxic or a burn from Scald, but they can come in on Defog and OHKO Pelipper with their Electric-type moves.

**Fast Special Attackers**: Fast special attackers such as Chatot and Haunter can OHKO Pelipper once it has been damaged by Stealth Rock. Timid Life Orb Haunter can come in on Defog and scare Pelipper out with the prospect of a Sludge Wave, which OHKOes Pelipper after Stealth Rock damage.

**Taunt Users**: Taunt users such as Misdreavus can force Pelipper to spam Scald, as it won't be able to use Defog, Roost, or Toxic.

**Water-types**: Water-types such as Poliwrath, Swanna, and Freeze-Dry Lapras check Pelipper. Although Poliwrath can't hurt Pelipper directly with Scald, Circle Throw, or Focus Punch, it walls Pelipper and can use Toxic to force Pelipper to either switch out or get worn down to the point of fainting.

**Status**: Status such as poison and burn can wear down Pelipper, putting it in 2HKO range for Pokemon that it would normally wall. Burn or poison, in addition to Stealth Rock damage, can wear Pelipper down and force it to use Roost more often.

**Substitute Users**: Pokemon such as Fraxure and Gogoat are bulky enough to prevent Scald from breaking their Substitutes and can use Pelipper as setup fodder if it decides to stay in.
