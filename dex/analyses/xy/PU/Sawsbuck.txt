Overview
########

Sawsbuck is a decent sweeper due to its two great abilities: Sap Sipper, which gives it an immunity to Grass-type attacks and boosts its Attack by one stage when it is hit by one, and Chlorophyll, which doubles Sawsbuck's Speed in the sun. Sawsbuck receives competition from Grass-types such as Leafeon; however, it has a niche in its Normal typing, which grants it the ability to hit opposing Grass-types such as Roselia hard with its STAB Normal-type move of choice. Sawsbuck has good offensive type coverage and it is quite difficult to wall after a Swords Dance. Unfortunately, Sawsbuck isn't too fast for a sweeper when out of the sun, its typing gives it 6 weaknesses to very common attacking types, and its poor defenses mean it's relatively easy to revenge kill.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Horn Leech
move 3: Double-Edge / Return
move 4: Baton Pass / Substitute
ability: Sap Sipper
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance boosts Sawsbuck's Attack by two stages. Horn Leech is a strong STAB move that recovers 50% of the damage dealt. Double-Edge is a hard hitting Normal-type STAB move; Horn Leech's recovery makes up for its recoil. Return is an option if Sawsbuck needs a strong Normal-type STAB move without recoil damage and still hits hard. Baton Pass allows Sawsbuck to gain momentum against walls such as Tangela and pass Swords Dance boosts. Alternatively, Substitute protects Sawsbuck from getting afflicted by status, allows it to scout foes' moves, and keeps it from getting revenge killed.

Set Details
========

A standard offensive EV spread is used on Sawsbuck to ensure it can outspeed as many Pokemon as possible and Speed tie with Haunter. Life Orb is used for more power. Sap Sipper allows Sawsbuck to get an Attack boost of one stage when hit by a Grass-type move. Chlorophyll can be used with sun support to get the Speed boost. When using Chlorophyll, an EV spread of 108 HP / 252 Atk / 148 Spe is preferred, as it lets Sawsbuck outspeed Choice Scarf Tauros and gives it more bulk, letting it take hits such as Sneasel's Ice Shard better.

Usage Tips
========

Sawsbuck is best used as a mid- or late-game sweeper. Sawsbuck shouldn't be setting up to sweep until its checks and counters are weakened to the point where it can 2HKO or OHKO them. When switching into Grass-type attacks, be cautious, as it's predictable and can result in Sawsbuck fainting, such as if an opposing Roselia goes for Sludge Bomb rather than Giga Drain when you switch Sawsbuck in. Make sure to bring Sawsbuck in on Pokemon it can set up on, such as Carracosta, Serperior, Relicanth, Golem, and Stunfisk, although the latter has the chance of paralyzing Sawsbuck, crippling its sweeping abilities.

Baton Pass can be used immediately after bringing in Sawsbuck to gain momentum against walls such as Avalugg and Gourgeist, or Baton Pass can be used later to pass a Swords Dance boost to a teammate. Substitute prevents Pokemon such as Misdreavus, Vullaby and Pelipper from inflicting status, allows Sawsbuck to scout incoming attacks, and prevents revenge killers from dealing damage the first turn they come in. When using sun, it's crucial to bring in Sawsbuck right after setting it up, as it needs to take advantage of sun's few turns and set up a Swords Dance if needed.

Team Options
========

Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Roselia are appreciated, as they weaken Pokemon throughout the battle so that Sawsbuck can OHKO or 2HKO them. Wallbreakers such as Tauros can weaken walls to the point of getting OHKOed by Sawsbuck's attacks. Sawsbuck provides a switch-in to Grass- and Electric-types, which threaten Poliwrath. In return, Poliwrath helps beat Ice- and Fire-types that threaten Sawsbuck, especially Avalugg due to its physical bulk. A Fire / Water / Grass core including Sawsbuck has great synergy, as the members resist each other's weaknesses; Pelipper, Sawsbuck and Ninetales work especially well as partners in this case. If using Chlorophyll, teammates such as Carbink, Golem, and Volbeat are appreciated because they can use Sunny Day. Volbeat deserves a special mention, as it has a slow U-turn that can give Sawsbuck a free switch in. Pokemon that benefit from sun, such as Ninetales, Flareon, and Victreebel, make good teammates, as they are similar to Chlorophyll Sawsbuck. Sneasel checks Ghost-types that don't mind taking Sawsbuck's attacks, such as Haunter and Gourgeist.

Other Options
########

Wild Charge allows Sawsbuck to hit Water / Flying types such as Mantine, Pelipper, and Swanna harder than Horn Leech. Jump Kick can be used for hitting Steel-types such as Bastiodon and Klang. Megahorn can hit Tangela and Gourgeist hard. Substitute + Salac Berry can be used; Sawsbuck should spam Substitute until the foe switches out or it gets the Speed boost. Aromatherapy can be used to keep Sawsbuck's team free of status, while Synthesis recovers HP and even more so in sun. Agility boosts Speed to ensure Sawsbuck isn't revenge killed by faster Pokemon when not in sun. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple Pokemon before fainting.

Checks & Counters
########

**Gourgeist**: All variants of Gourgeist resist or are immune to Sawsbuck's STAB moves, so it can come in and threaten to burn Sawsbuck with Will-O-Wisp. If Sawsbuck uses the turn Gourgeist switches in to set up a Swords Dance, it can Baton Pass out; however, the incoming Pokemon is at risk of getting burned as well. Also, Gourgeist can't touch Sawsbuck if it is behind a Substitute.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon, such as Ninetales, Choice Scarf Rotom-F, Dodrio, Scyther, Sneasel, and Tauros, can come in after a teammate faints, outspeed Sawsbuck outside of sun, and OHKO Sawsbuck due to its poor defenses.

**Priority**: Priority moves such as Sneasel's Ice Shard and Mightyena's Sucker Punch can hit Sawsbuck hard before it gets a chance to attack. Pokemon such as Illumise and Meowstic can also cripple Sawsbuck with Prankster Thunder Wave, lowering its Speed.

**Haunter**: Haunter is immune to Normal-type attacks and resists Horn Leech. It can check Sawsbuck with Sludge Wave or by switching in when you use Swords Dance. This means that Sawsbuck will be forced to switch out, wasting a turn and allowing Haunter to set up a Substitute or hit the incoming Pokemon. 

**Physical Walls**: Physical walls such as Avalugg, Garbodor, and Pelipper can switch into Swords Dance, survive a hit, and retaliate with their STAB Avalanche, Gunk Shot, and Hurricane, respectively. Sawsbuck is either going to be OHKOed or be forced to switch and have wasted a turn setting up; the opposing wall can use this chance to inflict status or score a hard hit on the incoming Pokemon.
