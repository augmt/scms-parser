Overview
########

Grumpig acts as a utility and support Pokemon and is mainly used on defensive and bulky offensive teams to counter Ninetales, Regice, and Aurorus thanks to Thick Fat, a great ability that lets it tank Fire- and Ice-types moves even better. Grumpig is pretty fast for a defensively oriented Pokemon and can perform the roles of both phazer and cleric in one moveset thanks to its access to Whirlwind and Heal Bell, making it versatile and useful in every stage of the match while being more effective than Hypno. Grumpig can also make use of status moves such as Thunder Wave and Toxic to slow down and wear down the enemy team, especially with entry hazard support and Whirlwind. However, its limited coverage due to its moveset being utility-focused and its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers keep it from being an excellent Pokemon.

Moves
========

Psychic is Grumpig's main STAB move, and paired with Grumpig's decent Special Attack it manages to hit Fighting- and Poison-types hard even without significant investment. Whirlwind makes Grumpig a decent phazer and allows it to force setup sweepers, especially ones that rely on their Special Attack, to switch. Heal Bell is useful to heal Grumpig's team from statuses, making it a decent cleric. Grumpig's decent base Speed, which allows it to outspeed common walls such as Lickilicky, entry hazard setters, and some setup sweepers, makes it a viable user of Taunt to inhibit their potential; Grumpig's Taunt also works well in tandem with Toxic. Thunder Wave slows down the enemy team and makes the job easier for your own setup sweepers and cleaners; it is preferred over Toxic if you have a slow-paced team. Toxic cripples enemy walls and sweepers, forcing switches; you should run it over Thunder Wave if your team struggles against offensive Pokemon and walls. Seismic Toss and Focus Blast are valid options over Psychic to damage Psychic-, Steel-, and Dark-types. Mono-Psychic coverage is underwhelming most of the time.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP and Special Defense with a Calm nature allow Grumpig tank special attacks with ease and help it stay alive as long as possible to provide utility to the team. Thick Fat is a great ability because it makes Grumpig take less damage from Fire and Ice moves, letting Grumpig counter Ninetales, Regice, and Aurorus, all of which give a lot of problems to stall and defensive teams. Leftovers provides Grumpig a little recovery, as it has none without it.

Usage Tips
========

Grumpig can be used as a utility and support Pokemon because it has access to good phazing and cleric moves such as Whirlwind and Heal Bell. When using Grumpig, it's better to use Toxic and Thunder Wave early-game cripple foes from the start, opening spaces for your cleaners and sweepers in the late-game. Try to switch in on Pokemon that Grumpig can check, especially specially offensive Pokemon, and use Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Heal Bell to spread status and remove statuses from your own team. Grumpig is particularly useful on teams that have a weakness to Fire- and Ice-types such as Ninetales, Regice, and Aurorus because it can check them thanks to Thick Fat. Whirlwind should be used when entry hazards are on the opponent's side of the field to get residual damage on foes and to phaze out enemy setup sweepers, especially specially based ones, or when predicting a switch to wear the opponent's team down even more with entry hazards.

Team Options
========

Grumpig's ability to perform different roles and access to great support and status moves such as Whirlwind and Heal Bell massively help defensive strategies, especially stall, which struggles with setup sweepers and strong special attackers. Entry hazard stacking is synergizes well with Grumpig's phazing and status spreading. Pokemon that can take on physical attackers, such as Carracosta and Avalugg, are good partners for Grumpig to make up for its bad Defense. Grass-types such as Tangela, Gourgeist-XL, and Leafeon, which fear special Fire- and Ice-type attacks, especially from Ninetales, Regice, and Aurorus, appreciate Grumpig's Thick Fat and high Special Defense. Wish users increase Grumpig's longevity. Entry hazard control is really appreciated to prevent Grumpig from taking residual damage, which is good because Grumpig doesn't have a reliable source of recovery and it also helps with Wish passing. Pawniard and Sneasel can Pursuit trap Ghost-types and appreciate Grumpig's utility moves; Pawniard can also pressure the enemy Defog user. Fighting-types such as Throh and Poliwrath have good synergy with Grumpig, as they can both phaze the enemy team with Circle Throw to rack up entry hazard damage; They also counter popular Steel-types and Pursuit trappers such as Pawniard and Sneasel, which give Grumpig a lot of problems.

Other Options
########

Grumpig can run an offensive set thanks to its decent coverage and good Speed and Special Attack, and its high Special Defense and Thick Fat give it opportunities to set up Calm Mind. Grumpig has access to moves such as Signal Beam to take on Psychic-types such as Kadabra, Energy Ball for Pokemon such as Barbaracle and Golem, and Shadow Ball to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types, so consider running one of these three over Psychic. Psyshock could be used if Grumpig needs to deal with specially defensive targets. Magic Coat could be useful against entry hazards setters and Taunt users to erase their potential and force them to switch.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Probopass, Metang, and Klang are immune to Toxic and take minimal damage from Psychic and Psyshock. They can stall Grumpig out with Toxic, force a switch, set up on it, or even KO it; however, they still don't appreciate being paralyzed because it makes them more prone to being revenge killed; this is a problem for Klang in particular, as it relies on its Speed boost from Shift Gear to sweep.

**Dark-types**: Dark-types such as Pawniard, Mightyena, and Sneasel are immune to Psychic-type moves and can easily KO Grumpig with their Dark-type STAB moves, and even if Grumpig switches they will deal a lot of damage to the switch-in. Sneasel and Pawniard, the latter of which is also immune to Toxic, can Pursuit trap Grumpig, KOing it most of the time if it switches out.

**Strong Physical Attackers**: Strong physical attackers such as Marowak, Torterra, and Ursaring don't like to switch into Grumpig's STAB moves but can answer back, KOing it thanks to Grumpig's low base Defense. Additionally, Marowak and Torterra are not affected by Thunder Wave, and Ursaring makes use of both Toxic and Thunder Wave, as Quick Feet ignores the Speed drop from Thunder Wave.

**Fast Taunt Users**: Fast Taunt users such as Simipour, Dodrio, and Misdreavus can take away all of Grumpig's utility by blocking its main moves and forcing it to switch; however, they don't enjoy being hit by Thunder Wave on the switch or getting hit by a STAB Psychic or Psyshock, as most of them don't really have great bulk.

**Residual Damage**: Residual damage such as entry hazard damage can heavily cripple Grumpig because it lacks reliable recovery and has to switch in frequently to check or counter foes. Status conditions such as burn and poison also wear down Grumpig and make it waste a turn using Heal Bell.
