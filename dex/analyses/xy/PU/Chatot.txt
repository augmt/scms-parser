Overview
########

Chatot has access to STAB Boomburst and Chatter; the latter gives it a 100% chance to confuse the target, which is a niche. It has a nice Special Attack stat and ordinary base Speed for the metagame. Against slower teams it could be threatening, such as stall teams without Bastiodon. Unfortunately, Chatot is a very frail attacker due to its low defensive stats coupled with its weakness to Stealth Rock, and it is outsped by common Pokemon such as Swanna, Simipour, and Frogadier.

Moves
========

Boomburst is a very strong STAB move that allows Chatot to muscle through any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Chatter is a great STAB move for Chatot thanks to its 100% confusion chance, and though it is not a very powerful move, confusion gives Chatot a chance to use Substitute. Nasty Plot gives extra power to Chatot's moves, instantly doubling its Special Attack. Other options can be used over it, depending on the team, such as Encore, Substitute, and Hidden Power Ground. Encore is a nice support move; Chatot can use it against setup sweepers and hazard setters. Substitute is nice to set up and spam Boomburst or Chatter, giving Chatot a buffer to take hits and an immunity to status, which make it pretty annoying versus stall teams. Hidden Power Ground can be used to weaken Chatot's counters, such as Bastiodon and Electrode, but using it forces Chatot to forgo the utility of Encore or Substitute.


Set Details
========

The EV spread with a Timid nature is used to maximize Chatot's power and Speed. Life Orb makes Chatot a fearsome special sweeper, while Leftovers's passive recovery gives Chatot more opportunities to set up a Substitutes and lets it recover HP while behind that Substitute. The last 4 EVs are put into Defense and not into HP to reduce damage taken from Stealth Rock.


Usage Tips
========

Behind a Substitute, Chatot can more easily deal heavy damage with Boomburst, a powerful STAB move. As Chatter confuses foes and Encore can grant Chatot free turns, Chatot has more opportunities to use Substitute. Use Chatter and Substitute to deal chip damage to the target and spam Boomburst when Pokemon that resist Normal are gone. Nasty Plot should be used only on predicted switches. Chatot can be switched in after a KO to revenge kill the foe or pivoted in via a slow Volt Switch or U-turn user; this is to give it a safe switch in without taking damage.


Team Options
========

Chatot appreciates Sticky Web to outspeed faster Pokemon. Late-game cleaners, such as Raichu, can sweep once the opposing team has been weakened. Spikes / Toxic Spikes from Pokemon such as Whirlipede and Roselia deals extra damage to enemies, supporting Chatot. Bouffalant and Tauros can be used for a "Normal spam" core, weakening Chatot's counters. Golem and Piloswine have nice synergy with Chatot because they hit Electrode and Bastiodon, Chatot's most common counters.


Other Options
########

There aren't a lot of other options for Chatot; the only one is a set with either Choice Specs or Choice Scarf. Choice Specs Chatot has almost no switch-ins and deals huge damage with Boomburst, and Choice Scarf Chatot is a nice revenge killer that can outspeed big threats. U-turn can be a nice option on these Choice sets to gain offensive momentum instead of hard switching.

Checks & Counters
########

**Soundproof**: Pokemon with the ability Soundproof, such as Mr. Mime, Bouffalant, Bastiodon, and Electrode, can switch into any of Chatot's sound-based moves, as they are immune to them. Electrode has to be wary of switching in on Hidden Power Ground from Chatot, which can 2HKO it. Mr. Mime and Bouffalant take little to no damage from Chatot's Heat Wave and Hidden Power Ground and can potentially set up on Chatot.

**Steel-types**: Steel types such as Metang, Klang, and Bastiodon can take Chatot's STAB moves thanks to their resistances to them. Bastiodon is immune to Chatot's sound-based moves, takes minimal damage from Heat Wave, and can KO Chatot with Rock Blast, but it has to be wary of switching into Hidden Power Ground; Chatot's +2 Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Ground has a chance to OHKO Bastiodon. Metang takes minimal damage from Chatot's STAB moves and can 2HKO Chatot with Meteor Mash and set Stealth Rock, but it has to be wary of Heat Wave and Hidden Power Ground, which can 2HKO it after a boost. Klang takes minimal damage from Chatot's STAB moves but has to be wary of Heat Wave, which can OHKO it after a boost. However, Klang can set up a Shift Gear and potentially OHKO Chatot after Stealth Rock damage.

**Special Bulk**: Special walls such as Lickilicky and Regice can switch into Chatot's moves thanks to their great bulk. Lickilicky can threaten Chatot with Body Slam or Knock Off, while Regice can KO it with Ice Beam.

**Rock-types**: Rock-types, such as Carracosta and Golem, safely switch into Chatot's STAB moves and threaten Chatot out with their Rock-type STAB moves. However, they have to be wary of confusion from Chatter, as well as taking big damage from Hidden Power Ground.

**Priority**: Priority users such as Carracosta and Piloswine can threaten to revenge kill Chatot with Aqua Jet and Ice Shard, respectively. However, Carracosta does not appreciate Hidden Power Ground, and Piloswine does not like taking a Boomburst.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Raichu, Electrode and Choice Scarf Rotom-F can outspeed Chatot and threaten it with their STAB moves. Rotom-F and Raichu do not appreciate taking a strong move from Chatot due to their frailty, while Electrode is immune to Chatot's main moves thanks to Soundproof.

**Revenge Killers**: Faster revenge killers, such as Tauros, Kadabra, Dodrio, Ninetales, and Choice Scarf Rotom-F, can threaten to revenge kill Chatot; however, they don't appreciate switching into Chatot's STAB moves.
