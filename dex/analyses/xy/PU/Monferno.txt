Overview
########

Despite not being a common Pokemon, access to Taunt and Stealth Rock makes Monferno a good suicide lead that outspeeds all other Stealth Rock leads and can thus prevent them from getting Stealth Rock up on your side of the field. Its great movepool allows Monferno to be a somewhat diverse and unpredictable Pokemon that can take the foe by surprise. Unfortunately, Monferno has generally mediocre stats. It also faces competition as a suicide lead from Barbaracle and Golem, which are more useful outside of setting up Stealth Rock. However, Monferno has higher Speed and Endeavor as advantages over them.

Suicide Lead
########
name: Suicide Lead
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Overheat
move 4: Endeavor
ability: Blaze
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is arguably the best entry hazard and makes the foe take damage every time they switch in. Taunt stops other leads such as Barbaracle, Aurorus, and Kricketune from getting up their own entry hazards, stops Defog from slower Pokemon, and prevents Monferno from becoming setup fodder after the Special Attack drop from Overheat. Overheat is a strong STAB move that gets a boost from Blaze if Monferno has been brought down to its Focus Sash. It also deals with Avalugg, which would otherwise be able to freely use Rapid Spin against Monferno. Endeavor makes good use of the Focus Sash to bring the foe down to 1 HP as well.

Set Details
========

The EV spread and Timid nature let Monferno outspeed all other suicide leads, such as Barbaracle, Kricketune, and Rampardos, while packing a good punch with Overheat. Focus Sash helps Monferno set up Stealth Rock more reliably and also makes Monferno capable of utilizing Endeavor and taking advantage of Blaze.

Usage Tips
========

Monferno should be sent out as soon as possible to set up Stealth Rock and maximize the chip damage it will do. If facing a Marowak, just go for Stealth Rock instead of Taunt; otherwise, if Marowak goes for Bonemerang, you won't have Stealth Rock up for the whole match and will practically start five versus six for nothing. Similarly, it's safer to go for Stealth Rock instead of Taunt against lead Carracosta and Piloswine, because Carracosta often carries Aqua Jet, which 2HKOes Monferno, while Piloswine can use Earthquake followed by Ice Shard to prevent Monferno from getting up Stealth Rock if you mispredict. If the opponent leads with a Pokemon that is very threatening to your team, it is worth it to use a slow Endeavor over Stealth Rock and cripple the foe so that it cannot be as dangerous to your team later on. Although this set is a suicide lead, it can be worth it to keep Monferno alive if battling a stall team because Endeavor puts a lot of pressure on the opponent if Monferno has been brought down to low health. It can also set up Stealth Rock again if the opponent removes it with Rapid Spin or Defog.

Team Options
========

Ghost-types such as Misdreavus, Haunter, and Dusknoir can block Rapid Spin from Avalugg, Torkoal, and Armaldo, though they do not like taking a Knock Off from Armaldo. Purugly and Pawniard are good teammates because they have Defiant to discourage Defog. This set is supposed to be a lead for hyper offensive teams, so strong offensive Pokemon such as Sneasel, Carracosta, and Dodrio are great teammates that appreciate Monferno's support and can also apply offensive pressure to the opponent so that they cannot find safe opportunities to use Rapid Spin or Defog.

Other Options
########

A defensive stallbreaker set with the moves Close Combat, Slack Off, Will-O-Wisp, and either Taunt or Stealth Rock can be used, as Monferno is the only counter to Sneasel with reliable recovery. It also takes on Leafeon and Pawniard lacking Psycho Cut. A set with the moves Fake Out, Stealth Rock, Overheat, and Grass Knot counterleads Golem and can deal with Poliwrath, Carracosta, and Barbaracle to an extent, but it is less consistent at keeping Stealth Rock away from your side of the field. Monferno can make use of Vacuum Wave to finish the foe off after an Endeavor but lacks the room for it. Thunder Punch makes quick work of Pelipper and Swanna and hits other Water-types such as Poliwrath hard. A Nasty Plot set consisting of Nasty Plot, Fire Blast, Vacuum Wave, and either Hidden Power Electric or Focus Blast can be used, but Monferno lacks the power and Speed to be an effective Nasty Plot sweeper and is generally outdone by Ninetales. It does have a superior typing and priority over Ninetales, though. Similarly, a Swords Dance set of Swords Dance, Close Combat, Fire Punch, and either Mach Punch or Thunder Punch with the ability Iron Fist can be used, but it has the same problems as the Nasty Plot set. Encore can lock opposing leads into Stealth Rock or another move, making it easier for teammates to set up.

Checks & Counters
########

**Entry Hazard Removers**: Entry hazard removers such as Pelipper, Swanna, Togetic, Armaldo, and Torkoal can remove Stealth Rock. If Monferno is faster, it can stop Defog with Taunt, but they can remove Stealth Rock later in the game as well.

**Faster Taunt**: Pokemon that have a faster Taunt than Monferno, such as Simipour and Dodrio, can stop it from setting up Stealth Rock, thus preventing Monferno from doing its job.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon such as Kadabra, Dodrio, Raichu, and Zebstrika can KO Monferno before it can use Endeavor after it has set up Stealth Rock.

**Purugly**: Purugly deserves a special mention because with the combination of Fake Out + Return it can stop Monferno from doing anything at all.

**Water-types**: Water-types such as Poliwrath, Pelipper, and Swanna fear little from Monferno and can take it out with their STAB moves. Pelipper and Swanna can also use Defog to clear Monferno's Stealth Rock away. They have to watch out for Endeavor, though, especially the slower ones.

**Ground-types**: Ground-types can check Monferno with their super effective STAB moves. In particular, Piloswine can KO it with a combination of Earthquake and Ice Shard, while Marowak can do the same with Bonemerang. Golem is also an annoyance with Earthquake followed by Sucker Punch being hard to play around for Monferno.
