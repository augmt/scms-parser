Overview
########

Simipour's good offensive stats and movepool make it a decent sweeper in the PU metagame. Despite this, it faces tough competition from other offensive Water-types, such as Swanna and Frogadier, which are stronger and provide more support. However, Simipour does have a niche over them, as it learns Nasty Plot, which allows it to become an effective sweeper. Even so, though it is fast, it is outsped by common threats such as Sneasel and Tauros. It also has to boost multiple times in order to break through common special walls such as Lickilicky and Roselia.

Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Nasty Plot
move 3: Hydro Pump
move 4: Ice Beam
ability: Torrent
item: Salac Berry
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Substitute allows Simipour to dodge status while making it easier to get into Salac Berry and Torrent range. Nasty Plot raises its Special Attack and lets it sweep. Hydro Pump is Simipour's main STAB attack. It is boosted by Torrent and has the power to break through Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks, such as Frogadier. Ice Beam is a reliable coverage move that lets Simipour hit Pokemon which resist its STAB move, such as Tangela and Sawsbuck, for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is required in order to outspeed as much as possible. This is helped by Salac Berry, which allows Simipour to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after the boost. Maximum Special Attack EVs are used to give it as much power as possible in order to break through walls, and Torrent increases the power of Hydro Pump even more. 4 HP EVs put Simipour into Salac Berry and Torrent range after three Substitutes, allowing it to survive weaker or resisted priority moves, such as Sneasel's Ice Shard, if its third Substitute breaks.

Usage Tips
========

Try to get Simipour in safely, either after a KO, with help from a slow pivot, or by switching into something it forces out, such as Flareon or Heatmor. This allows it to take as little damage as possible and force a switch to get a free Substitute if Simipour needs a Speed boost, or a free Nasty Plot if it can sweep straight away. Once it has boosted, if the opponent has Pokemon that can outspeed Simipour or survive a hit, keep using Substitute until Simipour gets to Salac Berry and Torrent range. Salac Berry only works once, meaning Simipour only has one chance to sweep. As such, before you set up, make sure you have gotten rid of priority users and faster Pokemon and weakened the opponent's team to the point where Simipour can sweep.

Team Options
========

Simipour greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Golem and Roselia, as they turn 2HKOs into OHKOs on Pokemon such as Togetic and Pelipper. Simipour's coverage is resisted by Water-types, so Grass- and Electric-types, such as Raichu and Leafeon, are helpful in order to beat them. Strong wallbreakers, such as Ursaring and Heatmor, can wear down the opposing team, allowing Simipour to sweep. Of these, Tauros is particularly effective, as it can bait and KO Poliwrath. Simipour also works well with Bug-types, such as Ninjask and Leavanny, which enjoys the removal of Rock- and Fire-types.


Other Options
########

Surf can be used instead of Hydro Pump, but Simipour then loses the ability to OHKO certain Pokemon, such as Frogadier. Grass Knot hits Water-types, such as Politoed and Lapras, which otherwise wall Simipour, and can be used instead of Substitute on a Nasty Plot set; however, that prevents it from reliably utilizing Salac Berry. Simipour also has a good physical movepool that it can use in order to bait its usual checks; Low Kick 2HKOes Lickilicky and Knock Off removes Roselia's Eviolite. Due to its high Speed, Simipour can use Taunt to function as an anti-lead while preventing foes from using status and recovery moves. Substitute + Endeavor can be used to wear down common checks to Simipour such as Mantine and Poliwrath.

Checks & Counters
########
**Bulky Water-types**: Pokemon such as Lapras and Poliwrath can easily survive a hit even after boosts and KO back. Both of these Pokemon, along with Mantine and Politoed, are healed if hit by a Water-type move. These Pokemon cannot do too much back with their Water-type STAB moves, but they can finish off a weakened Simipour with their coverage moves.

**Bulky Pokemon**: Pokemon with high Special Defense, such as Roselia and Lickilicky, can survive a hit and retaliate. However, these Pokemon will be KOed if Simipour gets a second Nasty Plot boost. If Simipour is behind a Substitute, Pokemon such as Articuno can phaze it out with Roar.

**Priority**: Simipour usually has low health after setting up, so priority such as Mightyena's Sucker Punch and Purugly's Fake Out can revenge kill it if Simipour is not behind a Substitute. However, Simipour can survive weaker, resisted priority attacks such as Sneasel's Ice Shard. Priority Thunder Wave from Volbeat will prevent Simipour from sweeping, making it easy to revenge kill.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Fast Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Raichu, can outspeed Simipour even after a Salac Berry boost and finish it off. Other Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-F and Haunter can outspeed it before it gets the Salac Berry boost. However, they fail to revenge kill Simipour if it has a Substitute up.
