Overview
########

Poliwrath's amazing typing and good physical bulk make it one of the best defensive walls in the tier, allowing it to check Pokemon such as Carracosta, Barbaracle, and Pawniard. It is a staple on stall teams, but its good offensive presence allows it to fit onto every playstyle. Its typing also allows it to be a Knock Off sponge, as it is the best check to Knock Off's main user and one of the best Pokemon in the tier, Sneasel. Its high Attack stat and good offensive typing allow it to become an effective attacker; however, it is limited by low Base Power moves and the lack of a reliable Fighting-type STAB move, meaning it is walled by Pokemon such as Tangela and Misdreavus and is entry hazard fodder for Roselia. However, Poliwrath has a decent support movepool that includes Scald and Circle Throw, allowing it to check bulky sweepers such as Klang and Vigoroth, which are big threats to stall. Poliwrath also boasts a high Special Defense, but it fails to check many special attackers, as most have a type advantage against it. Its ability Water Absorb allows it to check Water-types such as Simipour, providing it with more switch-in opportunities. However, its walling capabilities are limited by its lack of reliable recovery, meaning it gets worn down very easily from constant switches.

SubPunch
########
name: SubPunch
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Focus Punch
move 3: Waterfall
move 4: Toxic
ability: Water Absorb
item: Leftovers
evs: 200 HP / 252 Atk / 56 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Substitute allows Poliwrath to block status and weaker moves and have a free turn to use Focus Punch, which is Poliwrath's strongest move, hitting even Pokemon that resist Fighting for good damage. Waterfall is Poliwrath's more reliable STAB move, hitting most Ghost-, Psychic-, and Flying-types for neutral damage. Toxic cripples primary switch-ins to Poliwrath, such as Tangela and Misdreavus. Instead of Toxic, Encore could be used to force switches and get free Substitutes, while Ice Punch can be used to hit Grass- and Flying-types, such as Gourgeist and Togetic respectively, although they can easily take it.

Set Details
========

The Speed EVs allow Poliwrath to outspeed Adamant Golem and Marowak; however, 124 Speed EVs could be used to outspeed minimum Speed Misdreavus, but this would greatly reduce Poliwrath's bulk. 252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature are used to make Poliwrath's Attack as high as possible, increasing its damage output. The remaining EVs are placed into HP to increase Poliwrath's mixed bulk. Leftovers is used for small amounts of recovery, which Poliwrath otherwise lacks, and prevents it from getting too worn down by Substitute. Water Absorb helps Poliwrath check Water-types much more easily and allows it to completely shut down Pelipper.

Usage Tips
========

Switch Poliwrath into a Pokemon it walls and forces out, such as Sneasel, and then set up a Substitute. Substitute can also be used on predicted status moves or on weaker hits. If the opponent has a Pokemon that walls Poliwrath, such as Tangela, use Toxic on a predicted switch instead of spamming Focus Punch to save health. Focus Punch can be used without setting up a Substitute first, but only if the foe will switch out or not use an attacking move. Poliwrath should be careful of Chatot, as sound-based moves will go through Substitute, so switching out should be its primary response. It also has to be wary of Torterra's Bullet Seed, as it will break the Substitute and then deal damage to Poliwrath. Switching out is fine if Poliwrath has a Substitute up and is in a bad situation.

Team Options
========

Dark-type Pokemon, such as Sneasel and Mightyena, make for good partners, as they can beat Ghost- and Psychic-types that threaten Poliwrath. Poliwrath also pairs well with Fire-types such as Flareon and Ninetales, as it appreciates the removal of Grass-types, and in return, Poliwrath beats Ground- and Rock-types. Psychic-types such as Kadabra and Beheeyem beat Poison-types, and Poliwrath resists Bug and Dark. Electric-types such as Raichu and Zebstrika can check Flying-type Pokemon. Electrode makes for a particularly good partner, as it walls Chatot. Entry hazard setters such as Quilladin and Golem are appreciated, as Poliwrath forces a lot of switches due to its decent bulk and good typing. Roselia works well with Poliwrath, as it resists Fairy, Grass, and Electric and can set up entry hazards, while in return Poliwrath can beat Fire- and Ice-types. Steel-types, such as Klang and Metang, have great synergy with Poliwrath, as they resist four of Poliwrath's weaknesses, and Poliwrath in return checks Fire-types. Poliwrath fits better on offensively based teams, as it checks Pokemon such as Carracosta and Sneasel, and it appreciates the control of momentum and teammates to provide offensive pressure.

RestTalk
########
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Scald
move 4: Circle Throw
ability: Water Absorb
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def
nature: Relaxed

Moves
========

Rest and Sleep Talk provide Poliwrath with some recovery, as it otherwise gets worn down quickly from constantly switching in, and they also remove status inflictions, which it would otherwise be vulnerable to. Scald is a spammable STAB move due to its good chance to burn, helping Poliwrath check physical attackers. Circle Throw allows Poliwrath to phaze out Pokemon trying to set up on it and shuffle the opponent's team to get more entry hazard damage and mess with switch-ins.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP and Defense EVs and a Relaxed nature are used to increase Poliwrath's physical defense as much as possible, giving it an easier time checking physical attackers. Relaxed is chosen to lower neither Scald nor Circle Throw's damage output. Water Absorb allows Poliwrath to switch into Water-types more easily and discourage Water-type moves as a whole. Leftovers provide passive recovery, putting less pressure on Poliwrath to Rest. 56 Speed EVs could be used for Poliwrath to outspeed Adamant Marowak, but that would require Poliwrath to have a Bold nature, decreasing Circle Throw's damage output.

Usage Tips
========

Poliwrath should be switched in on physically offensive Pokemon such as Sneasel, Carracosta, and Piloswine. Poliwrath should be careful when switching into stronger physical attackers, such as Marowak, or ones with access to super effective coverage moves, such as Tauros. Once Poliwrath is in, it should start spamming Scald to fish for a burn. Circle Throw is helpful for shuffling foes around, collecting entry hazard damage, preventing predicted switches to counters or walls, and phazing Pokemon trying to set up. Rest allows Poliwrath to become a status absorber, so it shouldn't worry about switching into status moves. Poliwrath's typing grants it a resistance to Dark, so it is a reliable switch-in to Knock Off users. Rest should only be used when Poliwrath is at low health to allow it to constantly switch in and check opposing Pokemon.

Team Options
========

Poliwrath's passive nature makes it function better on defensively based teams, but it still works on offensive teams, as it can check many dangerous Pokemon. Although not necessary, Heal Bell users such as Leafeon are helpful to wake Poliwrath up so it can instantly attack and not have to rely on Sleep Talk. Entry hazards set up by Pokemon such as Roselia and Piloswine are important to rack up damage; they also work well with Poliwrath's phazing with Circle Throw. Special walls, such as Togetic, pair well with physically defensive Poliwrath. Fire-types, such as Flareon, make for good partners, as they check Grass-type Pokemon, while in return Poliwrath beats Rock- and Ground-types. Lickilicky is an effective partner, as it checks Misdreavus, which can otherwise switch in and set up Nasty Plot on Poliwrath. Lickilicky can also check most special attackers that threaten Poliwrath, such as Swanna and Kadabra. Steel-types such as Bastiodon and Metang resist Psychic- and Flying-type attacks and can set up entry hazards, and Poliwrath beats Fire- and Ground-types for them.

Special Tank
########
name: Special Tank
move 1: Focus Blast
move 2: Scald / Hydro Pump
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Vacuum Wave
ability: Water Absorb
item: Leftovers
evs: 200 HP / 252 SpA / 56 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Focus Blast is Poliwrath's strongest STAB move, but it is hard to spam due to its low accuracy. Scald is Poliwrath's most accurate and reliable STAB move, which has a chance to cripple opposing Pokemon with a burn. Hydro Pump can be used for more power, but it has a lower accuracy and cannot burn, and Poliwrath already has a strong STAB move in Focus Blast. Ice Beam hits Grass- and Flying-types such as Tangela and Togetic respectively, which resist Poliwrath's STAB moves. Vacuum Wave is a priority move that makes up for Poliwrath's poor Speed and allows it to revenge kill weakened Pokemon such as Rotom-F and Tauros.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack investment and a Modest nature are used to increase Poliwrath's power as much as possible, making up for its naturally poor Special Attack stat. 56 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed neutral-natured base 45 Speed Pokemon such as Golem and Marowak. The remaining EVs go into HP to increase its overall bulk. Leftovers provide some passive recovery, allowing Poliwrath to check Pokemon more easily; however, it still gets worn down after repeated hits.

Usage Tips
========

Due to its typing and natural bulk, Poliwrath is a good switch-in to attackers such as Sneasel and Armaldo; however, it dislikes taking repeated attacks because it has no reliable recovery. This set allows Poliwrath to bait in its usual checks and counters; for example, Ice Beam can 2HKO Tangela and Gourgeist on the switch. Scald and Hydro Pump are its most spammable moves, as the former can inflict burn and the latter is strong and has a better accuracy. Vacuum Wave lets Poliwrath revenge kill weakened threats, dealing heavy damage to fast Pokemon such as Sneasel and Sand Rush Stoutland.

Team Options
========

Electric-types such as Raichu and Rotom-F beat Water-types, this set's best switch-ins, while Poliwrath in return beats the Ground-types that threaten them. Fire- and Flying-types such as Flareon and Dodrio beat Grass-types, which resist Poliwrath's Water-type STAB move, while Poliwrath can check Rock-types. Dark-types such as Sneasel and Mightyena can take out Psychic-types; the former is especially effective, as it can Pursuit trap them. Ground-types such as Stunfisk and Marowak can set up entry hazards and check Electric-types. Steel- and Poison-types such as Klang and Arbok beat the Fairy-types that can set up on Poliwrath. Entry hazards set up by Pokemon such as Golem and Roselia help Poliwrath weaken the opponent's team and provide KOs on Pokemon; for example, Stealth Rock guarantees a 2HKO on Gourgeist-S. Many physical attackers, such as Golem and Carracosta, appreciate Poliwrath's ability to bait and KO Tangela and Gourgeist.

KELDEO ON STEROIDS
########
name: KELDEO ON STEROIDS
move 1: Rain Dance
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Ice Beam
ability: Swift Swim
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Rain Dance doubles Poliwrath's Speed and increases the power of its Water-type STAB move, allowing it to sweep. Hydro Pump is its strongest and most spammable STAB move, as its power is boosted by the rain. Focus Blast is Poliwrath's secondary STAB move, which provides good neutral coverage, but it has poor accuracy. Ice Beam provides perfect relevant neutral coverage and hits Grass- and Flying-types, such as Gourgeist and Togetic, respectively.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack EVs, Life Orb, and a Modest nature give Poliwrath as much power as possible, allowing it to sweep weakened teams. Maximum Speed investment is required to Speed tie with Adamant Choice Scarf Tauros under rain, as well as other base 70 Speed Pokemon, such as Mightyena, out of rain.

Usage Tips
========

Poliwrath should be used as a late-game sweeper after the opposing team has been weakened; however, it can be used beforehand to check dangerous Pokemon such as Sneasel. Although Poliwrath has the bulk and resistances to switch in, it dislikes doing so, as it gets worn down by Life Orb recoil and lacks recovery. Rain Dance should be used first, as it allows Poliwrath to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame. Be careful of Choice Scarf Raichu and Tauros, as if they have a positive Speed nature, they will outspeed Poliwrath in the rain. Don't be afraid to switch Poliwrath out if rain has been set up and it is in a bad situation and can sweep later.

Team Options
========

Wallbreakers such as Heatmor and Marowak can soften up the opposing team to allow Poliwrath to sweep. Poliwrath can be used on a rain team with other Swift Swim sweepers, such as Beartic, and other Rain Dance users, such as Volbeat and Electrode, though it is still effective outside of rain teams. Electric-types such as Raichu and Zebstrika can beat Water-types. Fire- and Flying-types such as Ninetales and Jumpluff respectively can wear down Grass-types. Swanna also works particularly well, as it can also check Grass-types while the rain activates Hydration and causes Hurricane to always hit. Entry hazards weaken the opponent's team and allow Poliwrath to get more KOs; for example, Stealth Rock allows it to always OHKO Drifblim, and Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes allow it to always OHKO Beheeyem. Piloswine and Roselia are two examples of entry hazard setters that work well.

Other Options
########

Choice Specs could be used instead of Leftovers to massively increase Poliwrath's power, but Poliwrath is easy to play around once it is locked into a move. Hidden Power Electric could be used with Choice Specs to hit Pelipper, which otherwise walls it. Substitute and Bulk Up allow Poliwrath to use Pokemon such as Gourgeist and Dusknoir as setup fodder, but this set is easily revenge killed by many special attackers. Poliwrath has a usable physical moveset containing Poison Jab to hit Fairy- and Grass-types, Earthquake to hit Electric-types, and Brick Break, its most reliable physical Fighting-type STAB move. These could be options on a Choice Band set, but its moves are very weak, so it struggles to get past physical walls. Counter is an option to punish strong physical attackers, but Poliwrath lacks a moveslot to use it. Belly Drum with Salac Berry could set Poliwrath up for a sweep, but Poliwrath is still slow even after a Speed boost.

Checks & Counters
########
**Grass-types**: Bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Roselia and Torterra can easily stomach a hit and then either retaliate with their Grass-type STAB move, inflict status, or set up entry hazards, but the latter has to be wary of Ice Beam. Tangela is particularly good at walling Poliwrath, as it can recover health with Regenerator by switching in and out, but it has to be careful of Toxic and is 2HKOed by Ice Beam.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-type Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Dusknoir can easily take any hit from Poliwrath, but they have to be wary of Toxic and Scald burns. Misdreavus can use Taunt or Will-O-Wisp and then set up Nasty Plot. Gourgeist resists or is immune to Poliwrath's STAB moves and can retaliate with a burn, recover health with Leech Seed, or hit Poliwrath hard with a Grass-type STAB move; however, it dislikes taking Toxic and Ice Beam.

**Offensive Type Advantage**: Flying-type Pokemon such as Dodrio and Swanna can OHKO Poliwrath with their respective Flying-type STAB moves. The latter resists Poliwrath's STAB moves and can recover lost health with Roost. Psychic-types such as Swoobat and Beheeyem can deal heavy damage with their Psychic-type STAB moves or set up with Calm Mind and Nasty Plot, respectively. Electric-types such as Raichu and Rotom-F can deal heavy damage with their STAB moves, although they dislike switching in to take a hit.

**Strong Attackers**: Strong special attackers such as Haunter and Frogadier can hit Poliwrath on its weaker defensive stat, while Marowak and Tauros have enough power to break through physically defensive Poliwrath.

**Fairy-Types**: Bulky Fairy-types such as Togetic and Clefairy resist Poliwrath's Fighting-type STAB moves, take little damage from any other attack, can recover lost HP, and can set up Nasty Plot and Calm Mind, respectively. However, they have to be wary of getting phazed by Circle Throw. Mr. Mime can survive a hit and either threaten to KO with a STAB move or set up Nasty Plot.
