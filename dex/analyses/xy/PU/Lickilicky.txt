Overview
########

Lickilicky is one of the premier walls in PU due to its high Special Defense and HP stats and decent defensive typing. Lickilicky sports great overall bulk and a fantastic support movepool that includes Wish and Heal Bell to support its team. Oblivious is a good ability that prevents Lickilicky from being Taunted or locked into a move with Encore, while Own Tempo blocks confusion from Chatot's Chatter. Due to its Normal typing, Lickilicky can handle many common special attackers, such as Articuno, Electrode, Ninetales, and Rotom-F, as it is not hit for super effective damage by any of their STAB moves. Lickilicky also has respectable offensive stats that prevent it from being setup bait, as it can break Substitutes with Body Slam and phaze out foes with Dragon Tail. Unfortunately, Lickilicky often relies on its own Wishes for longevity, especially with the heavy amounts of offensive pressure it encounters.

Moves
========

Wish is a reliable form of recovery that can heal Lickilicky or its teammates. Protect lets Lickilicky receive its Wishes without taking damage and scout against Choice-locked foes such as Rotom-F and Haunter. Body Slam is a decently powerful STAB move that prevents Lickilicky from being setup fodder and has a helpful 30% chance to paralyze the foe. Alternately, Knock Off provides good utility in removing foes' items and, more importantly, smacking Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Haunter. Return is a slightly stronger STAB move that works better on teams that prefer to spread poison and not paralysis. Heal Bell is a great support move that heals off status conditions from Lickilicky and its teammates, while Dragon Tail phazes out setup sweepers.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP investment capitalizes on Lickilicky's high HP stat. Maximum Special Defense investment and a Careful nature allow Lickilicky to handle most special attackers. Leftovers is important to provide passive recovery throughout the battle. Oblivious is preferred to prevent the effects of Taunt so that Lickilicky can act as a cleric more effectively, while Own Tempo lets Lickilicky avoid confusion from Chatot's Chatter.

Usage Tips
========

Lickilicky is generally a safe switch-in to most special attackers, including Articuno, Camerupt, Electrode, Ninetales, Rotom-F, Serperior, and Kadabra. However, it is important to watch out for Trick from Rotom-F and Encore from Kadabra, which cripple Lickilicky by locking it into an unfavorable move. Protect should be used to scout the moves of potential Choice-locked attackers and Trick users. Lickilicky can pass its Wishes to its teammates, but be careful when passing, as Lickilicky likes to stay above 70% HP so it can switch back in later in the match. Be wary of Roar and Whirlwind users, as they can phaze Lickilicky out when it is trying to Protect to receive its Wish, leaving Lickilicky with little health. Also be wary of Wish passing around Roar and Whirlwind users, as they can phaze out the intended recipient. If you predict the foe is going to start setting up on Lickilicky, use Dragon Tail to phaze them out. Protect should be used when Lickilicky is below 40% health or when the next attack might KO Lickilicky.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that resist Fighting are great teammates for Lickilicky; Gourgeist and Misdreavus both fit this role. Entry hazard setters, such as Roselia, are helpful if Lickilicky is using Dragon Tail to rack up damage on the opponent's team. If Lickilicky is not carrying Heal Bell, clerics such as Grumpig are greatly appreciated to remove status ailments, which cripple Lickilicky. As Lickilicky is best used on stall and balance teams, partners such as Poliwrath, Avalugg, and Pelipper are helpful to take on physical attackers.

Other Options
########

Toxic cripples setup sweepers and other bulky Pokemon, but Lickilicky has trouble fitting it onto its moveset. A more offensive set can be used, as Lickilicky has access to boosting moves in Swords Dance and Belly Drum to increase its already high Attack stat. Lickilicky can also use a Choice Band set thanks to the variety of coverage moves it has access to, including Power Whip, Knock Off, Earthquake, Zen Headbutt, the elemental punches, and STAB Explosion to nuke a foe. However, Tauros and Stoutland generally outclass Lickilicky in the role of an offensive Normal-type.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Throh and Poliwrath can come in on any of Lickilicky's attacks, taking little damage, and then either set up on Lickilicky or threaten it out with a STAB move. However, Lickilicky can predict Fighting-type switch-ins and use Dragon Tail in combination with entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field to lower their health and eventually check them.

**Status**: Status effects such as burn and toxic can seriously compromise Lickilicky's ability to switch into hits; the residual damage can mean the difference between a foe getting a 3HKO and a 2HKO on Lickilicky. Toxic Spikes users, such as Roselia, Toxic users, such as Articuno, Bastiodon, and Avalugg, which Lickilicky likes to switch into, and Will-O-Wisp users, such as Camerupt and Ninetales, are all Pokemon to watch out for, as they can status Lickilicky.

**Strong Attackers**: Strong attackers such as Choice Specs Aurorus, Beheeyem, and Focus Blast Simisear can overwhelm Lickilicky if it tries to switch into them to take their attacks, especially with hazards on your side of the field.

**Trick**: Trick users that Lickilicky likes to switch into, such as Rotom-F and Mr. Mime, can predict the switch and use Trick, which can seriously hinder Lickilicky's ability to support its team by limiting it to only one move.

**Entry Hazards**: Entry hazards bar Sticky Web all quickly lower Lickilicky's longevity. Spikes users such as Roselia put hefty amounts of pressure on Lickilicky, as multiple layers of Spikes force it to use Wish more often to heal itself rather than its teammates.
