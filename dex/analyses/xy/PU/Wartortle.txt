Overview
########
Wartortle is the only viable Pokemon that can utilize Rapid Spin + Foresight successfully in the tier, allowing it to Rapid Spin against Ghost-types; this is Wartortle's niche over Avalugg. Wartortle still faces heavy competition from Avalugg, however, due to Avalugg's access to Roar and better offensive presence. Wartortle has good bulk due to its base 80 Defense and Special Defense stats, which is boosted further by Eviolite, not to mention Water is a decent defensive typing. Unfortunately, Wartortle's low offensive stats can render it setup bait and cause momentum loss against offensive teams. Wartortle has no access to reliable recovery moves, unlike Avalugg, which gets Recover, meaning that Wartortle is worse at consistently spinning throughout a game, and it is also less bulky and relies on its item for its bulk to be retained.

Rapid Spin
########
name: Rapid Spin
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Scald
move 3: Foresight
move 4: Toxic
ability: Torrent
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========
Rapid Spin is mandatory and the reason to use Wartortle, as unlike Defog, it removes entry hazards from your side of the field only. Scald is useful, as it has a 30% chance to burn and cripple physical attackers. Foresight ensures Wartortle is able to pull off a Rapid Spin against Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus and Haunter. Toxic limits the foe's longevity by inflicting increasing damage every turn it stays in. Seismic Toss provides the same amount of damage every time it is used and pairs well with Foresight to hit Ghost-types; it can also break most Substitutes, but Scald is better in most situations for its chance to burn.

Set Details
========
Torrent is the standard option, as Rain Dish is even more useless. Eviolite increases Wartortle's defensive stats. The given EVs and a Bold nature maximize Wartortle's physical bulk, which is the better option, as Water-types are generally better suited for taking on physical attackers. A specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD can be used instead in order to tank special hits better.

Usage Tips
========
The first thing to do when sending in Wartortle is to use Rapid Spin if there are entry hazards on your side of the field, unless the opponent has a Ghost-type. If the opponent has a Ghost-type, use Foresight on the turn it comes in and immediately Rapid Spin the entry hazards away the next turn. To accommodate for Rapid Spin's momentum loss, double switches, U-turn users, and slow Baton Pass users are appreciated. Use Scald on a predicted switch-in to finish off a foe quickly when it is at low HP. Toxic should be used against Pokemon without cleric support, walls, and Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks. Wartortle shouldn't stay in too long unless it can beat the foe, as otherwise, it will lose momentum due to its passivity. 

Team Options
========
Wartortle fits well on balanced and stall teams due to its access to Rapid Spin and its reasonable defenses; it should absolutely not be used on offensive teams. Wartortle needs partners that can help make up for the momentum loss it causes such as Ninjask, Rotom-F, and Togetic, which can gain momentum from U-turn, Volt Switch, and slow Baton Pass, respectively; they all resist Grass, and Rotom-F resists Electric-type attacks too. Walls such as Roselia and Gourgeist-XL can make up momentum by taking hits and double switching; Roselia deserves a special mention, as it has good synergy with Wartortle due to resisting both Wartortle's weaknesses and absorbing status for Wartortle due to Natural Cure. Pokemon such as Dodrio, Flareon, and Rotom-F appreciate the removal of entry hazards, thereby making Wartortle a good partner. Pokemon that can threaten Electric-types, such as Marowak, Piloswine, and Torterra, or Grass-types, such as Ninetales and Rotom-F, are appreciated, as Wartortle is weak to their STAB attacks. Cleric support is useful too and can be provided by Pokemon such as Lickilicky, which can also provide Wish support, which Wartortle finds particularly useful, as it can't recover its health on its own.

Other Options
########
Yawn forces switches and prevents foes from setting up. Haze removes the boosts of setup sweepers, such as Carracosta, even if they are behind Substitute. Rest is the only form of recovery Wartortle has access to and can be used in conjunction with cleric support. A Counter + Mirror Coat set can be used, but it is a gimmick, requires Wartortle to take heavy damage, and doesn't aid it in using Rapid Spin.

Checks & Counters
########
**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Tangela, Roselia, and Gourgeist can either put Wartortle to sleep and prevent it from using Rapid Spin, use Leech Seed on it, or directly KO it with one of their super effective STAB moves.

**Electric-types*: Electric-types, such as Raichu and Rotom-F, can beat Wartortle quite easily with one of their STAB moves. They can switch in on the turn Wartortle goes for Rapid Spin or Scald and either force it out or OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Rotom-F can use Wartortle to gain momentum with Volt Switch if you have no Pokemon immune to Electric.

**Setup Sweepers**: Pokemon that can set up, especially those behind a Substitute, such as Leafeon and Klang can easily use Wartortle as setup bait and defeat it because of its little offensive presence.

**Knock Off**: Wartortle is very Eviolite-reliant, and Knock Off can remove its Eviolite and allow other Pokemon to beat up Wartortle pretty quickly. If Wartortle uses Rapid Spin as a Knock Off user, such as Sneasel, switches in, Sneasel it is either going to Knock Off Wartortle's Eviolite or, if Wartortle switches out, the incoming Pokemon's item.

**Status**: As Wartortle lacks reliable recovery or cleric moves, status, especially poison from Toxic or Toxic Spikes users, such as Poliwrath, Pelipper, and Whirlipede, can bring it down to low health pretty quickly. 

**Haunter and Misdreavus**: Wartortle has access to Foresight for using Rapid Spin against Ghost-types; however, Misdreavus and Haunter both have access to Taunt and can easily predict the incoming Foresight. This stops Wartortle from using Rapid Spin against them and forces it to either switch out or take powerful hits.
