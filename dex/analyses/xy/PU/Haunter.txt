Overview
########
Despite its NFE status, Haunter sits in a good Speed tier, outspeeding common threats such as Chatot and Mr. Mime, and its base 115 Special Attack is one of the highest in PU. Its typing is good offensively and allows it to spinblock to a certain degree, and when combined with Levitate, it is one of the best defensive typings in the game. However, Haunter's terrible defenses undermine its great defensive typing and force Haunter to rely on its immunities. It also lacks boosting moves and has a hard time beating certain special walls such as Lickilicky. Haunter has to play mind games with Sucker Punch users such as Mightyena which can OHKO Haunter with a successful hit.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Sludge Bomb / Sludge Wave
move 3: Taunt / Destiny Bond
move 4: Hidden Power Fighting / Destiny Bond
ability: Levitate
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Shadow Ball is Haunter's most reliable Ghost-type STAB move and allows Haunter to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Misdreavus, Mr. Mime, and Kadabra, super effectively. Sludge Bomb is a Poison-type STAB move that hits Dark- and Normal-types, such as Sneasel, and Tauros which either resist or are immune to Shadow Ball, neutrally; this gives Haunter perfect relevant and neutral coverage with Shadow Ball. Alternatively, Sludge Wave can be used to hit Quilladin and for more power, notably guaranteeing the OHKO on Pelipper after Stealth Rock. Taunt is to avoid status inflictions and prevent Pokemon such as Roselia from setting up entry hazards. Hidden Power Fighting hits Probopass and Pawniard, preventing the latter from setting up a Swords Dance. Destiny Bond combined with Haunter's Speed stat allows Haunter to make foes faint the same turn Haunter does.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack EVs and a Life Orb increase Haunter's damage output, helping it to KO foes so that it doesn't have to take a hit with its frail defenses. 252 EVs and a Timid nature allow Haunter to outspeed most Pokemon in the tier, such as Mr. Mime, Chatot, and Misdreavus.

Usage Tips
========

Haunter needs to get a free switch, as it shouldn't be switching in on attacks due to its frail defenses unless the foe is using a Ground- or Normal-type attack. Haunter's Ghost typing enables it to spinblock against Avalugg, and even if Avalanche KOes Haunter, the entry hazards are still there and a teammate gets a free switch to pressure Avalugg. Haunter should avoid using Destiny Bond too early to try to surprise opponents and bring down their Pokemon with Haunter. Taunt can be used against Pokemon trying to inflict status, set up entry hazards, or use Substitute against Haunter before it has to switch and must be used wisely.

Team Options
========

Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Piloswine is appreciated, as it allows Haunter to OHKO Sneasel and has a chance to OHKO Ninetales after Stealth Rock damage with Sludge Bomb. Setup sweepers such as Carracosta and Barbaracle appreciate Taunt to block status and phazing moves. Pokemon that pressure Avalugg with their strong special attacks, such as Ninetales and Rotom-F, make for good teammates in case Haunter is taken down while trying to spinblock. SubPunch Poliwrath and Throh help deal with specially defensive Pokemon, such as Bastiodon and Lickilicky, which can come in and cause problems especially if Haunter isn't running Taunt; they also pressure Avalugg to a degree, and Poliwrath helps with Sneasel. However, Lickilicky is immune to Taunt and can eventually stall Haunter out of HP with Life Orb recoil with Wish and Protect.

Substitute
########
name: Substitute
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Sludge Bomb
move 4: Disable / Hidden Power Fighting / Will-O-Wisp
ability: Levitate
item: Black Sludge
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Substitute protects Haunter from revenge killing, status afflictions, and priority attacks such as Sucker Punch; it can be set up frequently, as Haunter forces a lot of switches. Shadow Ball is reliable Ghost-type STAB move which hits Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively. Sludge Bomb is a Poison-type STAB move that hits Dark- and Normal-type Pokemon, which resist or are immune to Shadow Ball, neutrally. Disable works well with Substitute because of Haunter's good defensive typing and Speed, allowing it to wall foes that only have one move to hit Haunter with. Hidden Power Fighting hits Probopass and Pawniard, preventing the latter from setting up a Swords Dance. Will-O-Wisp can catch physical attackers trying to check Haunter, such as Piloswine, Mightyena, and Kecleon.

Set Details
========

Black Sludge allows Haunter to gain back some HP at the end of each turn, making up for HP lost from using Substitute. Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature allows Haunter to outspeed most Pokemon in the tier, such as Arbok, Chatot, and Babaracle. Maximum Special Attack investment is used to allow Haunter to hit hard.

Usage Tips
========

Haunter should set up Substitute when it switches in on a Pokemon it forces out such as Sawsbuck, Mr. Mime, and Misdreavus. Haunter's Ghost typing gives it spinblocking capabilities against Avalugg, and Disable can prevent Avalugg from using Avalanche if timed correctly. Will-O-Wisp can cripple Avalugg, lowering its physical attack and whittling its health down, forcing it to keep using Recover. Disable can force Pokemon such as Tauros and Throh to switch out because only one of their moves hits Haunter, allowing Haunter to set up another Substitute. Disable also stops dangerous attacks for the main supporter or attacker of the team, giving them a chance to support the team or set up. Pain Split should be used when Haunter is low on health, as it allows Haunter to restore some HP and works well with Substitute to weaken bulkier foes for Haunter or its teammates to beat. Will-O-Wisp should be used to let Haunter cripple physical attackers such as Sneasel and Pawniard, which would normally threaten Haunter.

Team Options
========

Toxic Spikes users such as Roselia can set up the entry hazard so that Haunter does not have to rely on Sludge Bomb to poison foes. Depending on which utility move you run, Haunter can help to create setup opportunities for powerful sweepers such as Carracosta, Ninetales, and Pawniard by burning or wearing down physical attackers and bulky walls. Disable helps to block coverage attacks such as Knock Off and Stone Edge and can give sweepers a free turn to set up when used against Choice-locked foes.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Sludge Bomb / Sludge Wave
move 3: Destiny Bond
move 4: Trick
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Shadow Ball is a reliable STAB move, dealing super effective damage to other Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus and Drifblim, and Psychic-types such as Mr. Mime and Kadabra, while hitting most other types neutrally. Sludge Bomb is a Poison-type STAB move which hits Dark- and Normal-types, which resist or are immune to Shadow Ball, neutrally. However, Sludge Wave has the merit of being able to hit Quilladin and OHKO Jumpluff. Destiny Bond is used to bring a foe down with Haunter, such as Pawniard when it is close to fainting and goes well with Haunter's high Speed. Trick cripples walls such as Lickilicky and Bastiodon by giving them a Choice Scarf, which locks them into one move.

Set Details
========

The Speed EVs allow Haunter to revenge kill with ease. 252 Special Attack EVs allow Haunter to deal as much damage as possible. A Choice Scarf makes Haunter even faster, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon that have set up already, such as Barbaracle.

Usage Tips
========

Don't directly switch in Haunter in against Pokemon; you want to let it get a free switch in due to its poor defenses. Haunter's set is a hit-and-run one; when a teammate faints, bring Haunter in as a quick but strong revenge killer and then switch it out to be used later on in the battle. Make sure not to reveal Destiny Bond until Haunter is sure to faint; otherwise, the opponent will see it coming and most likely try to play around it. Haunter should use Trick against walls such as Lickilicky to lock them into one move; avoid using it against Pokemon that won't mind the Choice Scarf too much, as well as if Haunter needs the extra Speed from the Choice Scarf.

Team Options
========

Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Piloswine and Golem is helpful to wear down foes so Haunter can finish them off; the two can take special hits aimed at Haunter well. Physical wallbreakers such as Ursaring and Tauros can take out specially defensive Pokemon such as Bastiodon and Lickilicky, allowing Haunter to fire off its special attacks with ease. Slow Baton Pass users such as Togetic can give Haunter a free switch in; Togetic can also give it Special Attack boosts with Nasty Plot thanks to to its incredible bulk and access to reliable recovery. Offensive teammates such as Sneasel, Carracosta, Barbaracle, and Dodrio appreciate Haunter wearing down Pokemon and crippling walls with Choice Scarf, giving them a chance to clean up.

Other Options
########

A Focus Sash lets Haunter act as a solid revenge killer for threats such as Pawniard, especially with Hidden Power Fighting. Haunter can utilize other options, such as Dazzling Gleam, Thunderbolt, Energy Ball, and Psychic, but they provide no useful coverage for Haunter. Eviolite can work well with Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Pain Split for extra bulk to stall foes out.

Checks & Counters
########

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Probopass, and Bastiodon can take hits from Haunter and fire back with their own or cripple Haunter with a status condition; Lickilicky also has access to Heal Bell to cure itself of from Sludge Bomb. There is the risk of Haunter using Trick or Disable, however.

**Knock Off Users**: Pokemon such as Sneasel, Pawniard, and Kricketune can cripple or OHKO Haunter with Knock Off by removing its item, though they risk taking a Will-O-Wisp and being crippled themselves. They also have a chance of losing to Disable.

**Priority**: Haunter is frail, so priority attacks such as Carracosta's Aqua Jet or Golem's Sucker Punch can heavily damage Haunter if played correctly. Kecleon's Shadow Sneak can't be played around and will OHKO Haunter.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon such as Tauros, Simipour, and Purugly can easily revenge kill Haunter due to its frail defenses. However, they are all outsped and hit fairly hard by Choice Scarf Haunter.
