Overview
########

Barbaracle's high Attack stat backed up by Tough Claws makes it a big threat in the PU metagame. It can successfully utilize a lead set due to its decent Speed, which lets it outspeed Kricketune, and its access to Stealth Rock and Taunt. Barbaracle's good offensive movepool, which includes moves such as Shell Smash, Stone Edge, and Razor Shell, allows it to become a threatening sweeper. Although it receives competition from Carracosta and Huntail as a Shell Smash sweeper, its high Speed means it does not have to rely on weak or unreliable priority attacks. Barbaracle has decent setup opportunities because of its decent bulk and several important resistances, including a resistance to Fire. Unfortunately, its typing also makes it weak to four types, and Barbaracle does not have enough power to break through bulky Pokemon such as Tangela and Quilladin.

Lead
########
name: Lead
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Razor Shell / Endeavor
ability: Tough Claws
item: Focus Sash
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Stealth Rock allows Barbaracle to be used as a suicide lead for offensively based teams. Taunt prevents foes from setting up entry hazards, which is very helpful, because Barbaracle outspeeds most other leads, such as Golem and Kricketune. Stone Edge is Barbaracle's best STAB move, as it threatens to 2HKO every Defog and Rapid Spin user apart from Prinplup. Razor Shell provides a secondary STAB move, offering good neutral coverage with Stone Edge. Endeavor can be used to weaken bulky Pokemon that Barbaracle cannot normally touch, such as Poliwrath and Tangela, if it is has been brought down to its Focus Sash.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature let Barbaracle outspeed and Taunt Kricketune, a common lead. Maximum Attack EVs allow Barbaracle to hit hard and keep up offensive pressure against Defog, Rapid Spin, and Taunt users. Investing in bulk is pointless for suicide leads and counterproductive when using Endeavor. Focus Sash ensures that Barbaracle will survive a hit in order to get Stealth Rock up.

Usage Tips
========

Barbaracle should be used as a lead, as Stealth Rock is better used early-game for offensive pressure and momentum. Setting Stealth Rock is its main objective, but Taunt should be used against slower entry hazard setters such as Kricketune and Golem. Barbaracle should be careful around Piloswine and Leavanny, as the former can KO Barbaracle with Earthquake and Ice Shard, meaning Barbaracle cannot set up Stealth Rock if it Taunts Piloswine, and the latter can use Magic Coat to bounce back Barbaracle's Stealth Rock or outspeed and 2HKO it and proceed to get up Sticky Web. Misdreavus and Monferno may also be problematic, as both can outspeed and Taunt Barbaracle before it gets Stealth Rock up. When against Golem, Stone Edge should be used before Razor Shell to break Sturdy and avoid activating Golem's Weakness Policy. Barbaracle can be saved for a bit later if the opponent has a Defog user or a Pokemon that can outspeed and Taunt it; however, Stealth Rock is most effective when used as early as possible.

Team Options
========

Lead Barbaracle's only merit is on offensive teams to provide offensive pressure. Spinblockers such as Haunter and Misdreavus should be used to prevent Avalugg from Rapid Spinning, which would otherwise make Barbaracle worthless. Defiant Purugly also helps keep Stealth Rock on the field by deterring the use of Defog. Wallbreakers such as Heatmor and Bouffalant fit onto offensively based teams and force a lot of switches, piling up Stealth Rock damage. Setup sweepers such as Regice and Simipour appreciate Stealth Rock support, as it weakens the opponent's Pokemon and allows Barbaracle's teammates to score KOs with greater ease.

Shell Smash
########
name: Shell Smash
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Razor Shell
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Aerial Ace
ability: Tough Claws
item: Lum Berry / White Herb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Shell Smash lets Barbaracle outspeed the entire unboosted tier as well as some Choice Scarf users and boosts Barbaracle's Attack to the point where it can sweep. Razor Shell is Barbaracle's primary STAB move and is boosted by Tough Claws. Stone Edge provides nearly perfect neutral coverage and is as strong as Razor Shell, but it has poor accuracy. Aerial Ace can OHKO Poliwrath at +2 while hitting bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangela and Torterra hard. X-Scissor can be used to hit Grass-types harder, OHKOing Torterra at +2 and doing far more damage to Tangela, but running X-Scissor means Barbaracle gets walled by Poliwrath and Gourgeist-XL.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature let Barbaracle hit as hard as possible, allowing it to sweep more easily. 252 Speed EVs allow Barbaracle to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, as well as Choice Scarf Mr. Mime and Rotom-F, when boosted. A Jolly nature can be used to beat Choice Scarf Scyther, Choice Scarf Haunter, and Adamant Choice Scarf Tauros, but Barbaracle loses a notable amount of power. Lum Berry lets Barbaracle take a status move and have an easier time setting up on walls, while White Herb makes Barbaracle harder to revenge kill and lets it set up on slower Pokemon more easily.

Usage Tips
========

Barbaracle should be used late-game once the opposing team is weakened and its counters are gone, as it can realistically only set up once. Barbaracle should set up on Pokemon that it forces out, such as Heatmor and Dodrio, or walls that cannot touch it, such as Lickilicky. Be careful around Choice Scarf Haunter, Choice Scarf Scyther, and Choice Scarf Tauros, as they can outspeed Barbaracle even after a boost.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard setters such as Golem and Roselia are good teammates, as their entry hazards weaken the opposing team and allow Barbaracle to score specific KOs after a boost; for example, a layer of Spikes allows it to always get the OHKO on offensive Poliwrath, and Stealth Rock allows it to OHKO Bouffalant. Fire-types such as Ninetales and Heatmor can beat Grass-type Pokemon, and in return Barbaracle checks Rock- and Ground-types. Other teammates that can lure in and KO physically defensive Grass-types, such as Ice Beam variants of Poliwrath and Basculin, are also appreciated. Wallbreakers such as Marowak and Tauros weaken the opposing team to allow Barbaracle to sweep.

Other Options
########

A Choice Scarf set could be used to let Barbaracle outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and revenge kill threats such as Jumpluff and Raichu, while a Choice Band could be used to provide huge immediate power, but both items lock Barbaracle into a move. Switcheroo works well with these two items to lure in and cripple Barbaracle's usual counters, such as Tangela and Quilladin. Cross Chop can be used to hit Carracosta and Relicanth harder, while Earthquake achieves similar coverage and has better accuracy but is weaker. Lastly, Rock Slide is more accurate than Stone Edge but is noticeably weaker.

Checks & Counters
########
**Grass-types**: Defensive Grass-type Pokemon such as Torterra and Gourgeist can switch in, survive any hit, and retaliate back with their Grass-type STAB moves, but they dislike taking a boosted Aerial Ace. Tangela and Quilladin have enough bulk to survive a +4 Aerial Ace, and the former can recover health as it OHKOes Barbaracle with Giga Drain. Leavanny checks the lead set well, as it can outspeed Barbaracle, use Magic Coat to bounce back Barbaracle's Stealth Rock, set up Sticky Web, and bring it down to its Focus Sash with Leaf Storm.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Choice Scarf Rotom-F can outspeed Barbaracle before a boost and threaten to KO the lead set or knock it down to its Focus Sash with its Electric-type STAB moves. Choice Scarf variants of Scyther, Haunter, and Tauros can all outspeed a boosted Barbaracle and revenge kill it if it is weakened.

**Poliwrath**: Poliwrath resists Barbaracle's STAB moves; defensive sets can take a +2 Aerial Ace and phaze Barbaracle out with Circle Throw, and specially offensive sets can finish off a weakened Barbaracle with Vacuum Wave.

**Entry Hazard Removal**: Defog and Rapid Spin from Pokemon such as Prinplup and Avalugg will defeat the purpose of having a suicide lead. However, Barbaracle threatens Avalugg and every Defog user besides Prinplup with its Rock-type STAB move, and it will often have teammates to block Rapid Spin and deter Defog.
