Overview
########

Mega Gardevoir is a force to be reckoned with in the OU metagame thanks to a number of qualities. For starters, it has an excellent base 165 Special Attack, and when this is paired with an expansive offensive movepool, including Pixilate Hyper Voice, Mega Gardevoir can do a lot of damage to opposing teams. Its Psychic / Fairy typing is pretty useful defensively, giving it many important resistances and immunities, especially to Fighting and Dragon. Its relatively good base 100 Speed is also a plus, allowing Mega Gardevoir to outspeed a decent portion of the metagame. Hyper Voice's ability to bypass Substitute is also very useful, allowing Gardevoir to better handle Pokemon such as Substitute Kyurem-B. Unfortunately, its lack of physical bulk leaves it vulnerable to many common physical attackers, such as Talonflame. While Mega Gardevoir's Speed is certainly not bad, it is still outsped by a good number of Pokemon including Garchomp and Greninja. Lastly, a mere base 80 Speed prior to Mega Evolving further limits Gardevoir's usefulness in battle.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Hyper Voice
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Substitute / Taunt
ability: Trace
item: Gardevoirite
evs: 24 Def / 232 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Hyper Voice is a strong and reliable Fairy-type STAB move thanks to Pixilate and its ability to bypass Substitutes. Psyshock is a secondary STAB move that hits Chansey, Venusaur, and Scolipede for high damage. Focus Blast hits Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn that might try to come in on Gardevoir. Hidden Power Ground is a more accurate alternative that hits Heatran and Jirachi for as much damage as Focus Blast. Will-O-Wisp is generally preferred in the last slot to cripple Mega Gardevoir answers such as Jirachi, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Doublade. Substitute allows Gardevoir to take advantage of forced switches and provides a buffer against status and revenge killers; it also eases prediction heavily. Taunt is a very useful utility move that allows Gardevoir to go toe-to-toe with walls such as Chansey and Heatran.

Set Details
========

Trace is Gardevoir's most useful ability prior to Mega Evolution because it allows Gardevoir to utilize useful opposing abilities such as Dragonite's Multiscale, Heatran's Flash Fire, Kabutops's Swift Swim, and Scolipede's Speed Boost. A Timid nature is preferred to revenge kill Swift Swim sweepers and Sand Rush Excadrill with Trace as well as at least tie with opposing base 100s. However, a Modest nature is also an option to maximize power and OHKO opponents such as Landorus. The given EV spread allows Gardevoir to survive two Psyshocks from Latios while achieving good Speed and power.

Usage Tips
========

This particular set does very well against offensive teams, using its high power and good Speed to make quick work of opposing Pokemon. Gardevoir also excels against stall teams, as its high damage output in conjunction with either Taunt or Will-O-Wisp allow it to pester most defensive Pokemon. Prior to Mega Evolving, Trace can be used to provide switch-in opportunities and grab useful abilities such as Flash Fire, Poison Heal, Natural Cure, and Multiscale, as well as enable Gardevoir to revenge kill Excadrill and Kabutops in sand and rain, respectively. As Gardevoir has poor physical bulk, trying to come in on physical attackers such as Talonflame is not advised. However, it can switch into threats whose moves it resists such as Latias, Latios, and Mandibuzz, so it is advisable to take advantage of such opportunities.

Team Options
========

Bisharp and Mandibuzz are both viable teammates due to their type synergy with Gardevoir. The former also appreciates the removal of Fighting-types that often trouble it, and it can Pursuit trap Chansey. Heatran and Tyranitar are both useful to defeat Talonflame, while also setting up Stealth Rock. Heatran also handles Mega Scizor effectively. Magnezone makes an excellent teammate for Mega Gardevoir, especially for Hidden Power Ground variants, since Magnezone can trap and remove Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Since Gardevoir is a little slow, a Sticky Web user such as Shuckle can be useful to aid Gardevoir in handling faster Pokemon. Thundurus, with its access to Prankster Thunder Wave, can also be a useful teammate for the same reason.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Hyper Voice
move 3: Psyshock
move 4: Focus Blast
ability: Trace
item: Gardevoirite
evs: 24 Def / 232 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Calm Mind boosts Mega Gardevoir's high Special Attack and Special Defense to formidable levels. Hyper Voice provides a strong and reliable Fairy STAB move and the ability to defeat Substitute users, notably Kyurem-B. Psyshock is a good secondary STAB move that breaks through Venusaur, Scolipede, and Chansey quite well. Focus Blast is a great coverage move to hit Heatran and Ferrothorn, which both otherwise wall Gardevoir. Taunt prevents opposing defensive Pokemon, such as Chansey, from pulling off status moves. Substitute is an alternative over Taunt to avoid status while allowing Gardevoir to attain more opportunities to set up Calm Mind, but Taunt is usually a more viable alternative.

Set Details
========

The EV spread allows Gardevoir to survive at least two Psyshocks from Latios in order to check it more easily. Trace is the chosen ability in order to allow Gardevoir to obtain some useful abilities prior to Mega Evolution, such as Multiscale and Speed Boost, as well as some potential switch-in opportunities, such as against Heatran.

Usage Tips
========

This Gardevoir set is an excellent stallbreaker, being able to use common stall threats, such as Chansey, as setup fodder while using its great power to overwhelm teams. Its immediate power also gives it an edge against offense, as this team archetype has very few Pokemon that are capable of safely switching in. Gardevoir should use Calm Mind against weaker opponents that cannot outright break it, such as Chansey. Gardevoir should avoid switching into physical attackers such as Talonflame due to its poor physical bulk. However, it can use its typing to effectively switch into common threats such as Latias, Keldeo, Mandibuzz, and Kyurem-B.

Team Options
========

Bisharp and Tyranitar can keep Gengar and Doublade at bay, and trap them with Pursuit. A Pokemon to handle Mega Scizor, such as Talonflame, is also useful. Terrakion, Keldeo, and Conkeldurr can also dismantle Ferrothorn and Heatran, while Heatran itself can also counter Talonflame and Mega Scizor. Landorus-T is also useful to take on Excadrill and Mega Scizor, provide crucial Stealth Rock support, and get Gardevoir in safely with U-turn.

Other Options
########

Gardevoir has an expansive movepool, so there are quite a few more moves available for use. Hypnosis could be used if you want to use Gardevoir as a sleep inducer, but its poor accuracy makes it a shaky option. Gardevoir can also support its team with Sunny Day or Rain Dance, but there are more reliable options for such roles, and sun is a mediocre playstyle to begin with. Gardevoir could run a defensive set with Will-O-Wisp, Heal Bell, and Wish, but such a set is outclassed by Clefable, Sylveon, and Togekiss. A Choice Scarf set could be workable, as Gardevoir is the fastest Fairy-type in OU and has a wide offensive movepool and Healing Wish. However, this set is relatively easy to deal with and outclassed by Latias at using Healing Wish. Thunderbolt is an option if hitting Talonflame and Mega Pinsir is important, but it does not provide anything useful beyond that. Lastly, Memento is a viable option to allow a teammate a free setup opportunity; however, Gardevoir will rarely have the time for this, and Healing Wish often has greater utility.

Checks and Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Scizor, Heatran, and Ferrothorn can take hits from Mega Gardevoir relatively well and hit it hard with their moves. Scizor also has priority in Bullet Punch, allowing it to weaken Mega Gardevoir before it retaliates. However, only Mega Scizor can avoid getting 2HKOed by Focus Blast, and even then it can be crippled by Will-O-Wisp. Jirachi, Klefki, Bronzong, and Doublade all fall into a similar boat, as they are able to counter Gardevoir but are also crippled by Will-O-Wisp. Choice Scarf Heatran and Sand Rush Excadrill can both revenge kill Mega Gardevoir.

**Fire-types**: Fire-type Pokemon are capable of enduring Hyper Voice from Mega Gardevoir, and they are able to overwhelm it as well. Victini takes many of Gardevoir's moves bar Shadow Ball well and can OHKO it with V-create. Entei is in a similar boat, being able to OHKO Gardevoir with Sacred Fire or revenge kill it with Extreme Speed. Talonflame can overwhelm Mega Gardevoir, while its Bulk Up set takes Hyper Voice and Psyshock relatively well. Physically defensive Mega Charizard Y can also wall Mega Gardevoir.

**Chansey**: Thanks to its astronomical special bulk, Chansey can take anything Mega Gardevoir can muster and stall it out with recovery, Toxic, and Seismic Toss. However, it loses to Taunt and Calm Mind variants.
