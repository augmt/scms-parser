Overview
########

Gastrodon has a high HP stat and a great defensive typing that leaves it weak to only Grass-type moves. It has reliable recovery in Recover. Its base 92 Special Attack stat is decent for a wall, allowing it to deter opposing Pokemon that try to set up. Its great ability in Storm Drain gives an immunity to Water-type attacks. However, Gastrodon's defenses are only passable. Gastrodon also faces competition from Quagsire, which has Unaware, making it a lot harder for setup sweepers to set up. Gastrodon is also very slow, so it is outsped by most of the tier.

move 2: Earth Power / Ice Beam / Earthquake
move 3: Toxic

evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold / Relaxed

Moves
========

Scald is a Water-type STAB move that has a high chance to burn, which is good for crippling physical threats. Earth Power is a special Ground-type STAB move that hits Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Keldeo for good damage. Ice Beam hits Landorus, Dragonite, and Garchomp decently hard. Earthquake serves the same purpose as Earth Power and also derails Calm Mind users. Toxic is ideal for a wall like Gastrodon, as it slowly wears at the opponent's Pokemon. Recover is reliable recovery, and it helps rack up Toxic damage. Counter is an option as Gastrodon takes most physical hits very well, so Counter can nab some surprising KOs.

Set Details
========

252 HP EVs max out Gastrodon's HP, adding to its bulk, while 252 Defense EVs with a Bold nature max out its Defense to handle threats such as Keldeo. Storm Drain gives an immunity to Water-type attacks, with a situational boost to Special Attack. Leftovers provides passive recovery. A Relaxed nature should be used if Earthquake is being used.

Usage Tips
========

Gastrodon best functions as a physical wall that stays in to burn physical attackers or stall with Toxic to cripple opponents. Recover is best used to rack up Toxic damage on the opposing Pokemon. Gastrodon can switch into a predicted Water-type attack and get a free Special Attack boost, which guarantees Ice Beam OHKOes Garchomp and Landorus. Gastrodon can also take hits from most physical attackers, so stay in on a physical attack and either attempt to burn the physical attacker with Scald or cripple it with Toxic.

Team Options
========

With Sludge Bomb, Mega Venusaur can counter opposing Grass-types, such as Breloom, which threaten Gastrodon. Ferrothorn can also perform this role, and makes up for not being able to counter Breloom with being able to set up entry hazards. Heatran counters most special attackers that can break through Gastrodon, and Gastrodon can take any Water-type move directed at Heatran. Chansey works well with Gastrodon, as it takes special hits with ease. Skarmory has good defensive synergy with Gastrodon, as Gastrodon takes both Electric- and Fire-type attacks for Skarmory, while Skarmory takes Grass-type attacks directed at Gastrodon, as well as being able to set up hazards.

Other Options
########

Clear Smog can remove stat boosts from sweepers, but it is rather weak and has no purpose other than this. Offensive Life Orb or Choice Specs sets are options as Gastrodon has a usable Special Attack stat, but they are mostly outclassed by wall Gastrodon. Yawn can force switches or induce sleep. Stockpile skyrockets Gastrodon's defenses, but it fails to find a space on Gastrodon's moveset.

Checks and Counters
########

**Grass-types**: With a quadruple weakness to Grass-type moves and low Speed, it's no question why Grass-types are a good answer to Gastrodon. Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn take almost no damage from Gastrodon's attacks and OHKO it with their STAB moves, while Pokemon such as Celebi and Breloom simply outspeed and OHKO Gastrodon.

**Special Walls**: Special walls such as Chansey take pitiful amounts of damage from Gastrodon's attacks. Also, Toxic doesn't cripple Chansey due to Natural Cure.

**Special Attackers**: Special attackers such as Latios can break through Gastrodon. Thundurus and Mega Charizard Y can hit Gastrodon hard with Grass Knot and Solar Beam, respectively.

**Choice Band Users**: Choice Band users such as Azumarill and Dragonite easily 2HKO Gastrodon.
