Overview
########

Scizor's small but diverse movepool allows it to pull off a number of roles effectively in one sitting. In a nutshell, it can check and revenge kill numerous foes with its fearsome Technician-boosted Bullet Punch, scout foes effectively with its powerful U-turn, provide tons of utility with its fantastic defensive typing as well as Knock Off, sweep opposing teams with Swords Dance, and even recover its health with Roost. All of this is supported by Scizor's great offensive and decent defensive stats, which can be amplified even further with its Mega Evolution. With all these positive perks, Scizor is a catch-all check or counter against a plethora of OU threats, including Bisharp, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Altaria, Latios, Latias, Excadrill, and Mega Diancie.

Scizor's strong and influential presence backfires on it, however, as many teams either use Fire-type Pokemon or odd Fire-type attacks, such as Fire Blast or Hidden Power Fire, solely to keep Scizor in check. Strong special attackers give it pain as well, as they can prey off of its weaker and often uninvested Special Defense. Scizor's low Speed is somewhat mitigated by Bullet Punch, but common faster Pokemon that resist it, such as Keldeo, Talonflame, and Rotom-W, generally limit its usage. Nonetheless, Scizor continues to maintain a dominant position with a literal iron fist, being a very practical choice for nearly any team and having virtually zero competition in what it does.

Bulky Swords Dance
########
name: Bulky Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Roost
move 3: Bullet Punch
move 4: Knock Off / U-turn / Superpower
ability: Light Metal
item: Scizorite
evs: 248 HP / 44 Atk / 16 Def / 200 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

The combination of Swords Dance and Roost allows Scizor to boost its Attack and sweep safely while constantly maintaining its health. After enough Attack boosts, Bullet Punch becomes a potent attack, with priority as well as decent power and coverage backing it up against faster attackers.

Because Scizor is strapped for moveslots, the chosen move in the last slot is important. Knock Off provides a good mix of utility and coverage, allowing Scizor to achieve overall good coverage as well as the ability to remove items from switch-ins such as Skarmory and Heatran. U-turn turns Scizor into an effective pivot, allowing it to gain offensive momentum early-game and scout for checks and counters that may stop it from successfully sweeping. Superpower hits opposing Steel-types, especially Ferrothorn and Bisharp, harder but must be used on the switch against Heatran and Magnezone, as most variants of both can outrun this set and OHKO with a Fire-type attack. Bug Bite is another option to consider, operating as a strong and reliable attack with no drawbacks except for average coverage.

Set Details
========

With just 248 HP and 16 Def EVs with an Impish nature, Mega Scizor avoids the 2HKO from maximum Attack Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake, so it can afford to focus on investing in other stats instead of Defense. In particular, 200 Special Defense EVs ensure that Mega Scizor is never OHKOed by Clefable's Fire Blast and Timid Mega Diancie's Hidden Power Fire and never 2HKOed by Mega Gardevoir's Focus Blast and Life Orb Latios's Draco Meteor followed by -2 Hidden Power Fire, making Mega Scizor an effective check to some special attackers as well. The rest is invested into Attack, as this set is generally starved for power. If you wish to avoid the 2HKO from Jolly Lopunny's High Jump Kick, you may invest 44 EVs into Defense. Scizorite is a required item because it significantly increases Scizor's defenses; the EV spread is also based on Mega Scizor's stat distribution. However, if you prefer using another Mega Evolution, using Leftovers along with a specially defensive spread and Technician is a feasible alternative.

Investing fully into physical bulk is also an option to soak up physical hits even better and transform some physical attackers into setup bait. To put this into perspective, a build of 248 HP / 252+ Def avoids being 2HKOed by some insanely powerful attacks in the tier, such as Choice Band Azumarill's Waterfall, +0 Life Orb Excadrill's Earthquake, Adamant Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick, and Mega Gallade's Close Combat.

Usage Tips
========

Because this Scizor has limited coverage and significantly lower offense than usual, it should not attempt to sweep early- or mid-game when its checks and counters are healthy. During this time, however, it can act as an effective defensive pivot and bulky check to many physical threats, capable of healing itself instantly with Roost while providing stellar utility with Knock Off or U-turn. If using U-turn or Superpower, Scizor can afford to use Swords Dance early in order to pressure opponents, as well as lure in its checks and counters and put a decent dent in them. It should switch out immediately, however, in the face of dangerous or crippling attacks such as Fire-type attacks, Will-O-Wisp, and Keldeo's Choice Specs-boosted Scald or Hydro Pump. Due to this set's insane bulk, Scizor is able to set up on relatively powerful attackers such as opposing Scizor, Mega Gallade, Mega Beedrill, Breloom, Excadrill, Celebi, Latios, Mega Diancie, Tyranitar, and Garchomp (provided the latter five don't carry Hidden Power Fire or Fire Blast). In the face of these threats, Scizor can often easily nab two, or even three, Swords Dance boosts.

Team Options
========

This Scizor finds itself at home on balanced teams due to its great bulk, pivoting capabilities, and sweeping potential. It should mainly be paired with Pokemon that can beat Scizor's checks and counters over time, as well as cover its weakness to Fire-type coverage moves and other extremely powerful special attacks. Meanwhile, Scizor can confidently switch into Fairy-, Ice-, Steel-, Bug-, and Grass-type attacks aimed at these partners. For instance, Slowbro is a great choice that handles a majority of Fire-types as well as Keldeo, and it can also utilize Scald and Thunder Wave to slow down or pressure some of Scizor's other counters. Heatran absorbs Fire-type attacks aimed at Scizor with Flash Fire and can provide coverage against or cripple Steel- and Fire-types that wall Scizor. If Scizor uses U-turn, Landorus-T and Rotom-W can complete a VoltTurn core alongside it while countering Talonflame and other counters with relative ease. Kyurem-B is also notable, as it can absolutely maul (and set up Substitute on) most of Scizor's defensive counters, including Slowbro, Mandibuzz, Rotom-W, Heatran, and Skarmory. Finally, Latias is a particularly fantastic partner, as it can check counters such as Keldeo, Thundurus, Mega Manectric, Charizard, and Slowbro, on top of providing Defog and Healing Wish support to ease pressure off of Scizor.


Offensive Swords Dance
########
name: Offensive Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Bullet Punch
move 3: Superpower
move 4: Bug Bite
ability: Technician
item: Scizorite / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

After a Swords Dance boost, Scizor transforms into an awesome offensive threat, capable of leveling teams with just Bullet Punch and Superpower. The former is both a good sweeping and revenge killing tool thanks to priority and boosts from Technician and STAB. Superpower vastly improves Scizor's coverage and firepower against Steel-types, hitting (and likely OHKOing) most for super effective damage, as well as punching huge dents in neutral targets such as Skarmory, opposing Scizor, Keldeo, and Camerupt. Bug Bite further improves Scizor's coverage, hitting relevant threats such as Rotom-W, Celebi, Mega Slowbro, Jirachi, and Mega Venusaur harder so that Scizor does not have to rely on a weaker Bullet Punch or Superpower, which drops stats after use. Knock Off can also be used for good Dark-type coverage and general utility, which helps in dealing with some threats such as Jirachi, Celebi, and Doublade while removing useful items from foes.

Set Details
========

A simple spread of maximum Attack and Speed, along with an Adamant nature, allows Scizor to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Jolly nature can be used if you prefer outspeeding and outprioritizing opposing threats, such as maximum Speed Jolly Bisharp and Diggersby as well as Heatran variants with some Speed investment. Additionally, transferring some EVs from Speed to HP is optional for increasing overall bulk, although without Roost, the HP investment is usually not worth the trouble.

The item of choice is Scizorite, which generally improves all of Scizor's relevant stats and makes it less vulnerable to Knock Off. Life Orb is a viable alternative, as using it means Scizor doesn't have to occupy the team's Mega slot; furthermore, Life Orb Scizor's increased damage output is actually significant in comparison to Mega Scizor's. For example, a +2 Life Orb-boosted Bug Bite has a chance to OHKO even the most physically defensive Mega Venusaur and Mega Sableye, while Mega Scizor stands no chance of doing so. In this case, using either a Jolly or Adamant nature is viable because both variants of Life Orb Scizor will outdamage Adamant Mega Scizor regardless.

Usage Tips
========

It is generally important to preserve Scizor's health to safely set up and be harder to revenge kill. Unless there's a dangerous threat that needs to be checked by Scizor, avoid switching it into entry hazards and attacks frequently. Scizor should usually set up Swords Dance after its checks and counters have been eliminated or weakened into KO range; however, it may be useful in some situations to use Swords Dance early-game to apply pressure to the opponent or weaken foes for another sweeper. Additionally, due to Scizor's great power, coverage, and Speed, this set is able to lure in and deal heavy damage to—if not outright KO—quite a few slower checks, such as Magnezone, Rotom-W, Heatran, and Skarmory.

In terms of setup opportunities, Scizor can easily set up on predicted switches, as well as on some weak physical attackers and defensive Pokemon; however, try to scout for Fire-type attacks or Will-O-Wisp before doing so.

Team Options
========

This Scizor greatly enjoys entry hazard support to achieve some KOs, such as a chance to OHKO defensive Rotom-W and Jirachi with a boosted Bug Bite after Stealth Rock. Garchomp, Skarmory, Heatran, Landorus-T, and other hazard setters can easily achieve this while providing some defensive synergy and unique benefits of their own (U-turn pivoting from Landorus-T, Fire-type protection and coverage from Heatran, etc). Although dual screens support is not too necessary (and only used certain offensive builds), it compensates for Scizor's lack of Roost and bulk investment while also allowing it to endure some otherwise fatal attacks, such as uninvested Heatran's Lava Plume and Keldeo's Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump. Such support is especially useful if Scizor uses Life Orb, as it tends to suffer from recoil and even lower bulk.

This set also appreciates defensive synergy despite its offensive leanings. Latias and Latios boast exceptionally good offensive and defensive synergy with Scizor; both can switch into powerful Fire-, Water-, and Electric-type attacks aimed at Scizor, while Scizor itself can switch into Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type attacks. Latias can provide Healing Wish support to give Scizor another chance to sweep should Scizor sustain too much damage or status. Rotom-W also fares well against Fire-type Pokemon and attacks while being capable of maintaining momentum with Volt Switch and crippling faster checks and counters with Thunder Wave. Slowbro can also provide similar functions, except it trades Volt Switch for Regenerator and the handy ability to counter Keldeo.


Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Bullet Punch
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Superpower
move 4: Pursuit / Knock Off
ability: Technician
item: Choice Band
evs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Bullet Punch is a powerful priority attack that threatens to kill weakened or frail foes. This goes very well in hand with U-turn, which scouts for possible switch-ins to said attack and maintains momentum, all while being fairly powerful. Superpower provides vital coverage against Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn; it can also be used to hit neutral targets hard. The chosen Dark-type attack depends on personal preference. Pursuit provides great utility against frail Psychic- and Ghost-types as well as weakened Pokemon that usually attempt to switch out of it, such as Mega Gardevoir, Latios, and Celebi. Knock Off is an option that threatens to remove items, which is a useful function when facing item-reliant foes such as Shed Shell Skarmory and Eviolite Chansey.

Set Details
========

This Scizor enjoys as much power and bulk as possible to maximize its pivoting capabilities, necessitating heavy investment in Attack and HP as well as an Adamant nature. Investing in Speed to outrun defensive foes such as Rotom-W, Heatran, and Mega Venusaur is also worth consideration, although doing so without moderation greatly reduces Scizor's bulk or offense.

Usage Tips
========

Prediction is key when using Choice Band Scizor. U-turn is generally the safest move to use early-game, as it is powerful, eases prediction, and gains momentum on Scizor's many predicted switch-ins. Despite Bullet Punch's great power for a priority attack, it should be used with caution, as Choice Band locks Scizor into it, which is unfavorable considering the many common threats that resist it. When the opportunity presents itself, however, it is an easy revenge killing tool against weakened or frail threats such as Terrakion, Latios, Mega Gallade, and Mega Gardevoir. A well-planned double switch can also be crucial to gain momentum with a strong U-turn or Pursuit trap an opposing Pokemon. If Steel-types and other Bullet Punch-resistant Pokemon are present, use Superpower to hit them on the switch.

Pursuit is used to trap Gengar, Latios, Mega Gardevoir, and other weakened Pokemon that might attempt to switch out of Bullet Punch. However, before using Pursuit, it is necessary to scout for coverage moves such as Hidden Power Fire or Will-O-Wisp from the aforementioned Pokemon. Additionally, some opponents may predict the Pursuit and let their Pokemon stay in for a last-resort attack, so it may be wiser to use Bullet Punch in some situations. It is also not advised to lock Scizor into Pursuit when the opponent has a Pokemon that can set up on it, such as Belly Drum Azumarill, Mega Gyarados, or Mega Gallade.

Team Options
========

Scizor will be using U-turn most of the time, making Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Rotom-W and Landorus-T perfect for forming a VoltTurn core. The aforementioned Pokemon can also provide support with Will-O-Wisp or Stealth Rock while providing defensive synergy. When used on VoltTurn teams, Scizor should also be partnered with sweepers, cleaners, or wallbreakers that appreciate the opposing team being slowly weakened. Such teammates include Keldeo, Mega Altaria, Mega Gallade, Talonflame, Landorus-T, and Serperior. Regardless of which type of team Scizor is placed in, its slow U-turn is always useful to safely switch teammates, especially frail attackers, into the field.

Stealth Rock support is helpful, as many of Scizor's checks and counters, such as Talonflame, Gyarados, and Charizard will not enjoy taking both Stealth Rock and U-turn damage. Garchomp and Heatran are notable providers, as they can take care of Skarmory with Fire Blast and keep other Steel-types in check. At the same time, keeping entry hazards off Scizor's side of the field is also recommended, as it will be switching in and out frequently. Rapid Spin is preferred over Defog for keeping your team's Stealth Rock; viable users include Excadrill, Starmie, and Tentacruel, the latter two of which are notable for absorbing Fire-type attacks aimed at Scizor. If you feel that removing your own entry hazards is not too significant, however, feel free to use Latios and Latias, which also sponge up Fire-type attacks while providing great coverage and offense.


Defog
########
name: Defog
move 1: Defog
move 2: Roost
move 3: Bullet Punch
move 4: U-turn / Superpower
ability: Light Metal
item: Scizorite
evs: 248 HP / 60 Def / 200 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Defog clears all entry hazards from the field, and Scizor gets many opportunities to use it thanks to its fantastic bulk, defensive typing, reliable recovery in Roost, and the well-known threat of Bullet Punch. Roost and Bullet Punch also allow Scizor to tank physical attacks and check foes when needed. In the last slot, U-turn is preferred, as it tops off Scizor's pivoting capabilities, giving it the ability to ease prediction, maintain momentum, and switch teammates in safely against faster foes. On the other hand, Superpower is useful for covering Steel-types, making Scizor a near-perfect counter to Bisharp and Excadrill, as well as giving it an option to pick off weakened Ferrothorn. Knock Off is another utility option worth considering, as it can greatly cripple Scizor's common matchups, including Excadrill, Rotom-W, Heatran, and Landorus-T.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP, along with an Impish nature, optimizes Scizor's physical defense, enabling it better opportunities to use Defog and Roost as well as handle hard-hitting physical attacks multiple times. Significant investment in Special Defense is used to better check some special threats in a pinch, such as Mega Gardevoir, Gengar, and Latios lacking Hidden Power Fire. Investing in Attack is also optional if you prefer a little more firepower behind Bullet Punch, U-turn, and Superpower. Scizorite is preferred to give Scizor significantly more bulk upon Mega Evolving. If you dislike the inability to use other Mega Evolutions, you can replace Scizorite with Leftovers, which frees up teambuilding considerably.

Usage Tips
========

This Scizor should be sent out against physical or weak special attackers, as it can usually sponge the hit and proceed to recover the damage with Roost, pivot with U-turn, or use Defog. Bluffing an offensive set by switching Scizor into Pokemon it easily checks or counters, such as Chansey and Latias, generally gives it a free turn to use Defog. While using Defog is the main role of this set, Scizor can still act as a check or counter to attackers lacking a Fire-type move, as it is capable of avoiding 2HKOs from the likes of Excadrill, Tyranitar, Bisharp, Mega Diancie, Landorus-T, and Mega Gallade while retaliating with its chosen attacks.

Notably, without Attack investment and multiple coverage moves, Scizor will lack the power to be a decent offensive threat, making it easy setup bait for sweepers such as Gyarados, Raikou, Excadrill, and Talonflame. Therefore, it is advised to switch out of them and into a revenge killer or counter as soon as possible. It is also important to note that Scizor loses to most common Stealth Rock users, such as Fire Blast Garchomp and Heatran, so stay clear of them.

Team Options
========

When using this set, it is important to keep in mind the opportunity costs, as this Scizor takes up the team's Mega slot and gives up utility and coverage in exchange for using Defog. If your team doesn't require other Mega Pokemon, Scizor is a fine choice on some balanced teams that find other available Defog users unsuitable; for example, while Latias and Latios are generally good choices, they are vulnerable to Bisharp and other Pursuit users, while Skarmory and Mandibuzz's multiple weaknesses and passivity might be undesirable for several teams. It is recommended to place it in more defensively designed teams, with a few revenge killers and sweepers to make up for Scizor's tendency to become setup bait, as well as its general lack of offense and coverage.

As this set's main purpose is eliminating entry hazards, it pairs well with hazard-weak Pokemon such as Talonflame, Dragonite, Gyarados, and Thundurus. Additionally, Scizor can utilize its slow U-turn to bring these Pokemon out safely, giving them better chances to set up and sweep. Defensively speaking, Rotom-W is a great teammate, as it can utilize Volt Switch to complete a VoltTurn core and also covers Scizor's massive weakness to Fire-type attacks. Slowbro is also a good teammate because it can counter Keldeo (one of Scizor's best switch-ins), provide great defensive synergy and utility, and abuse Regenerator to its full potential thanks to the elimination of entry hazards. Celebi also performs similar functions, with the added ability to lure in Heatran and other troublesome Pokemon and remove them with Earth Power and other coverage moves. It also appreciates Scizor's ability to counter Bisharp with Superpower, should said Pokemon pose a particularly significant problem.


Other Options
########

If you prefer playing with other Mega Evolutions but still want to take advantage of Scizor's typing and other assets, using regular Scizor is a perfectly acceptable option on sets running Scizorite. While Mega Scizor is an amazing Pokemon, regular Scizor is still pretty good itself, only really missing out on its Mega counterpart's skyrocketed defenses. Items such as Life Orb, Iron Plate, Leftovers, and Lum Berry can compensate on sets utilizing Roost or Swords Dance, providing some great benefits of their own. Regular Scizor should also use Technician over Light Metal for obvious reasons.

Choice Scarf Scizor can forego Bullet Punch for a stronger Iron Head and can outspeed most unboosted attackers while trapping threats with Pursuit somewhat effectively. However, Scizor loses a considerable amount of power doing this and does not fare well for a Pokemon that frequently relies on odd coverage moves to hit specific targets. Likewise, Assault Vest complements Scizor's typing and makes it an even better check against many special attackers, but it also compromises power and the ability to use Roost.

For moves, Aerial Ace can be used to hit Keldeo, which resists most of Scizor's most commonly used moves except for Superpower, as well as KO Celebi, Chesnaught, and Mega Venusaur. However, it provides redundant coverage outside of those targets, and the mentioned Grass-types are covered with Bug Bite anyways. Likewise, Quick Attack is another physical priority move that is boosted by Technician, but it is overall inferior to other attacks due to its terrible coverage and power. Tailwind provides decent team support, and while defensive Scizor is a reliable user of the move with a slow U-turn to get nearly any attacker in safely, Tailwind's short duration makes it rather hard to use effectively. Substitute goes well with Scizor's ability to force many switches on paper, although it generally compromises moveslots, as it must be used with Roost to recover lost health. Finally, Toxic cripples many of Scizor's non-Steel-type counters, which prevents it from being a liability against the likes of Mega Slowbro, Talonflame, and other checks and counters.


Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-type Pokemon and Coverage Moves**: Fire-types are Scizor's worst enemy, as many of them resist its STAB type combination and can simply roast its exoskeleton off with their respective Fire-type attacks. Mega Charizard X and Y are the biggest offenders, taking drastically reduced damage from Knock Off as well as Scizor's other commonly used attacks. Talonflame is crippled somewhat by Knock Off but is otherwise a fine counter, as it can either cripple or revenge kill it with Will-O-Wisp or Flare Blitz and Brave Bird, respectively. Most variants of Heatran can typically outspeed and OHKO Scizor, caring only about a well-predicted Superpower. Additionally, many non-Fire-type attackers such as Latios, Serperior, Clefable, Mega Altaria, (Mega) Garchomp, and (Mega) Slowbro carry Fire-type coverage specifically to keep Scizor and other similar Steel-types in check.

**Electric-type Pokemon**: Electric-types generally make great switch-ins into Bullet Punch and sport unique and reliable ways to check Scizor. Zapdos is a near-perfect counter, as it absolutely doesn't mind any attack aimed at it (except for Knock Off) and can do heavy damage with either Heat Wave or Thunderbolt while using Roost to recover lost health. Likewise, Rotom-W is typically bulky enough to withstand multiple attacks and can cripple Scizor with Will-O-Wisp, caring only about boosted neutral attacks such as Superpower, U-turn, and Bug Bite. Mega Manectric can utilize Intimidate to lower Scizor's offense and OHKOes with Flamethrower or Overheat. Lastly, Magnezone can switch into both of Scizor's STAB attacks and utilize its ability Magnet Pull to trap and KO it with Hidden Power Fire or Thunderbolt. However, Scizor can use either U-turn to escape or Superpower or Knock Off to inflict some collateral damage.

**Physically Defensive Tanks and Walls**: Scizor is a physical attacker that sometimes falls short in terms of coverage and sheer power, making it quite easy to wall outside of Fire-types. For instance, Skarmory is a solid counter that can tank multiple boosted Superpowers while recovering the damage instantly with Roost. It can also retaliate by either phazing it with Whirlwind or dealing good damage with Brave Bird or Counter. Mandibuzz can punish Scizor's high Attack stat and Swords Dance boosts with Foul Play while tanking attacks with its high Defense stat and Roost. While Hippowdon takes decent damage from boosted hits, it can easily heal off the damage with Slack Off while phazing Scizor with Whirlwind. However, it loses terribly against Swords Dance + Roost variants in last Pokemon scenarios. (Mega) Sableye can burn with Will-O-Wisp while easily taking boosted attacks. Quagsire counters Swords Dance Scizor well with Unaware and threatens to burn it with Scald but takes quite a large amount of chip damage from U-turn and Superpower. Likewise, Alomomola can switch in and fish for Scald burns without too much trouble thanks to Regenerator, access to recovery via Wish, and its huge physical bulk, but it is affected by boosted Knock Offs and Bug Bites if the burn doesn't kick in soon enough.

**Offensive Pressure**: Scizor falls easily to repeated attacks and is heavily reliant on Bullet Punch to make up for its low Speed. Therefore, hard-hitting Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch and other attacks are great checks. Keldeo, Excadrill, and Thundurus are prime examples, all of them resisting both Bullet Punch and Scizor's Bug-type attacks while threatening Scizor with their own powerful STAB moves. Gyarados and Volcarona can neuter Scizor's offense with Intimidate and Flame Body, respectively, making it easy setup bait for both. Likewise, Suicune and Manaphy are both bulky enough to take other attacks besides Bullet Punch while being able to set up Calm Mind or, in Manaphy's case, Tail Glow boosts.

**Burn**: Scizor is crippled by burn, which halves its Attack and quickly whittles down its health. This limits its functionality against Pokemon with Scald or Will-O-Wisp, moves that counters such as Keldeo and Rotom-W happen to pack all the time.​
