Overview
########

Scizor's versatility and resilience give it a huge presence on any team, and its extremely flexible Mega Evolution has the power, bulk, and utility to back it up. Offensively, Swords Dance allows Scizor to rip through opposing teams with boosted attacks, most notably STAB Technician Bullet Punch, one of the strongest priority attacks the tier has to offer. With great coverage in Knock Off, Bug Bite, and Superpower, Scizor has no trouble powering through opponents of any kind. By adding Pursuit, U-turn, and a Choice Band, Scizor can turn its sweeping capabilities into that of a revenge killer, pivot, and Pursuit trapper. All of this comes off of a staggering base 130 Attack, boosted to 150 through Mega Evolution. Defensively, Mega Scizor turns out to be one of the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier, with an amazing base 140 Defense and 100 Special Defense, backed up by a solid HP stat that can be easily invested in even on offensive sets, thanks to Bullet Punch covering Speed issues. Its typing gives it only one weakness, as compared to its eight resistances and one immunity. Roost gives it the reliable recovery it needs to outlast its opponents, as well as the ability to boost without the fear of being worn down. However, having bulk greater than that of Skarmory is put to great use on support sets utilizing Defog or Baton Pass. No matter what the role, Scizor can usually pull it off.

However, like any other Pokemon, Scizor still has its fair share of checks and balances. Its nasty double weakness to Fire-type attacks can prevent it from doing its job, and Scizor requires team support to take care of this Achilles heel. Having lost two of its resistances, Scizor can no longer switch into Ghost- and Dark-type attacks with impunity like it used to be able to, and once its set is revealed, it is often forced to play rather predictably. As an offensive Pokemon, Scizor is mostly held back by its low Speed, even though Bullet Punch can somewhat rectify this weakness. Lastly, Scizor can easily be walled by the likes of Skarmory and Mandibuzz, and its attempts to boost will simply be nullified by Whirlwind and Foul Play, respectively. However, despite these setbacks, Scizor remains a major force in the OU metagame and will easily carry its weight on a team.

Baton Pass
########
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Roost
move 4: Bullet Punch
ability: Light Metal
item: Scizorite
evs: 248 HP / 236 Def / 24 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Swords Dance, Roost, and Bullet Punch are all fairly standard. The first boosts Scizor's Attack to higher levels, the second restores half of Scizor's health instantly and complements its supreme bulk, and the third is a potent priority move that works extremely well with the Attack boosts Scizor acquires. The real magic of this set lies in Baton Pass, which, when combined with Swords Dance, can turn faster and more powerful physically threatening teammates into killing machines in a matter of a couple of turns. Baton Pass can also be used as a pseudo U-turn to scout and escape from predicted switch-ins and otherwise dangerous threats.

Set Details
========

A slow, defensive spread is recommended in order to obtain more setup opportunities so Scizor can pull off a slow Baton Pass, preventing the recipient from taking damage. With the given HP and Defense EVs along with an Impish nature, many fierce physical OU threats, such as Azumarill, Bisharp, Conkeldurr, Dragonite, Excadrill, Garchomp, Kyurem-B, Landorus-T, and Terrakion, fail to 2HKO Mega Scizor even after Stealth Rock damage, effectively rendering them as non-threats and setup bait. A specially defensive spread is worth consideration in order to take weaker Hidden Power Fires and other odd special attacks, such as Latios's Thunderbolt and Surf, better. However, Scizor is simply more adept at tanking physical hits overall. 24 Speed EVs are used to outrun Heatran lacking Speed investment so that Mega Scizor can use Baton Pass before being hit by Lava Plume.

Scizorite is the item of choice, as it improves all of Scizor's relevant stats, especially its defenses. If you plan on using another Mega Evolution and don't Scizor having a slight drop in defense, then Leftovers and Occa Berry are also viable options. Non-Mega Scizor should use Technician over Light Metal.

Usage Tips
========

Setting up Swords Dance and passing it to a teammate is incredibly easy thanks to Scizor's great bulk and access to reliable recovery. Foes with Fire-type attacks limit Scizor's ability to do this, as they can KO Scizor before it can pull off a pass. Before attempting to perform this set's strategy, ensure Scizor is protected against such attacks; this can be done with field support such as Light Screen and rain, or by simply knocking out Scizor's main counters, such as both Mega Charizard formes, Heatran, and Mega Manectric, beforehand. Getting rid of these counters also makes it very possible for Scizor to set up and sweep by itself with just Bullet Punch, as it has very few other notable weaknesses aside from a vulnerability to being burned.

The element of surprise is somewhat&mdash;but not fully&mdash;instrumental to this set's success. Opponents usually don't expect Baton Pass Scizor very often, granting Scizor many opportunities to set up and pass to other a teammate. Notably, this set doesn't mind burn and other status as much as other Swords Dance sets, as it can simply pass its Attack boosts to something else. Therefore, it can set up in front of status-reliant foes such as Rotom-W and Ferrothorn. Keep in mind, however, that Scizor itself also benefits from Attack boosts and can sweep on its own if given the chance, so be careful when deciding if it should absorb a burn or not. Additionally, while Baton Pass can be used to scout out switch-ins, it might be a dead giveaway to this set's purpose, so be wary of revealing Baton Pass too early if the set's surprise factor is particularly important to you.

Team Options
========

As the Pokemon this set is supposed to provide support for, fast and powerful physical attackers are required teammates. Ideally, Scizor should be paired with Pokemon that can act independently from it, as it is not guaranteed to successfully or properly pull off a Baton Pass in every match. Several great examples include Focus Sash Terrakion, Scolipede, Aqua Jet Sharpedo, which requires the priority move to outprioritize foes and outspeed Talonflame after a Speed boost, and Life Orb Entei. Kyurem-B is an exceptional possibility, as it has dangerously high Attack and defenses, and its ability, Mold Breaker, enables it to punch past stall-based Pokemon that are reliant on their abilities to wall physical attackers, especially Sturdy Skarmory, Unaware Clefable, and Unaware Quagsire. Basically, as long as your team covers its weaknesses, isn't weak to priority, and isn't too reliant on Scizor, anything goes!

Scizor itself doesn't require too much support aside from Pokemon that can protect it from Fire-type attacks. Mainly, Scizor will want to watch out for both Mega Evolutions of Charizard, Heatran, and Talonflame amongst other Fire-type foes, as well as other attackers that carry Fire-type coverage attacks. An effective way to lure and defeat Heatran and Talonflame is by using a Natural Gift Talonflame of your own; specifically, its Natural Gift set is designed to outrun other Talonflame and defeat Heatran with a boosted Fighting- or Ground-type attack. Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Landorus-T are also worth consideration, as they can lure in and revenge kill common Fire-types, amongst other targets, and punch massive holes with fast and monstrous boosted STAB attacks after Baton Pass. Defensive protection from Fire-type attacks can be achieved by setting up dual screens or Drizzle support, both of which enable Scizor to take at least one Fire-type attack with ease. To this extent, Kabutops is also a valuable teammate, as it can use Swift Swim to sweep and revenge kill in the rain, benefits from Attack boosts, and can tank Talonflame's main attacks.

Bulky Swords Dance
########
name: Bulky Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Roost
move 3: Bullet Punch
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Light Metal
item: Scizorite
nature: Impish
evs: 248 HP / 84 Atk / 176 SpD

Moves
========

Swords Dance allows Scizor to easily sweep teams, and thanks to this set's focus on bulk, it will have ample opportunities to set up. Roost allows Scizor to set up on anything that cannot 2HKO it, such as Garchomp without Fire Blast and Excadrill, and prevents Scizor from being worn down before it can sweep. Bullet Punch is Scizor's main attacking move, packing an effective 60 Base Power thanks to Technician and making up for Scizor's uninvested Speed. Knock Off allows Scizor to get a solid hit on many Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch, such as Rotom-W, and can also be of use to cripple common switch-ins such as Heatran. In the last slot, another coverage move such as Superpower or Bug Bite may be used. However, Superpower's defense drops can severely hinder Scizor's sweep, and Bug Bite, while immensely powerful, gets very poor coverage along with Bullet Punch.

Set Details
========

The EVs might seem complicated, but their purpose is to allow Scizor to set up on specific threats. 248 HP EV investment makes Scizor as bulky as possible and reduces Stealth Rock damage. 176 Special Defense EVs avoid the 2HKO from max Special Attack Modest Mega Gardevoir's Focus Blast, which is important as Mega Scizor is supposed to serve as a good answer to it. An Impish nature and 0 Defense EVs are sufficient to avoid the 2HKO from max Attack Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake and anything weaker. A fully physically defensive set is also an option to take advantage of Mega Scizor's enormous Defense stat. As an example, it avoids the 2HKO from Life Orb Terrakion, one of the strongest physical attackers in the OU tier, and eats up hits from the likes of such powerhouses as Life Orb Excadrill and Choice Band Azumarill. Scizorite is the main item, as Mega Scizor's bulk and extra power are too good to pass up, even for Leftovers recovery. Leftovers can be run if Scizor's traits and running another Mega are desired for a team, or even a Lum Berry to circumvent burn and bluff a Mega variant. Finally, Light Metal is the ability of choice because Scizor will be Mega Evolving immediately, taking advantage of Technician only after Mega Evolution. Prior to that, however, Light Metal allows Scizor to take slightly less damage when switching in to Grass Knot and Low Kick. Albeit situational, it is the only ability with tangible benefit to Scizor before it Mega Evolves. Technician should naturally be used if any item other than Scizorite is run, and can even be utilized in combination with another potential Mega to hold off on Mega Evolving and bluff a normal Scizor.

Usage Tips
========

Although Scizor can certainly come out early- to mid-game against easy targets like Assault Vest Azumarill, Ferrothorn, and Mega Gardevoir, Scizor should not be attempting a boost until all of its various counters are either removed or weakened enough for it to KO at +2 with Bullet Punch or Knock Off. This holds true for defensive counters, such as Skarmory, as well, and in many cases, going straight for an unboosted Knock Off will be far more beneficial, as it makes these counters much easier to wear down. Due to the bulky EV investment, Scizor can set up against many prominent threats on both the physical and special side, including foes such as Garchomp, Mega Tyranitar, and Conkeldurr, often attaining two or sometimes even three boosts before sweeping.

Team Options
========

Teammates that can easily wear down or take out foes such as Heatran, Rotom-W, Zapdos, Skarmory, and Mandibuzz are highly appreciated, as all of these Pokemon can prevent Scizor from sweeping. Kyurem-B stands out in particular, as it shares a decent degree of defensive synergy with Scizor and can easily take out every one of the aforementioned Pokemon. Heatran with Earth Power is also a nice partner, sponging any Fire-type attacks aimed in Scizor's direction, taking out opposing Heatran, and wearing Zapdos and Rotom-W down with Toxic. Excadrill also has a decent matchup against the aforementioned Pokemon, although it cannot switch in on any of them. A Stealth Rock and possibly Spikes user is also great, wearing down opponents and making it much easier for Scizor to sweep with Bullet Punch.


Offensive Swords Dance
########
name: Offensive Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Bullet Punch
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Superpower / U-turn
ability: Light Metal
item: Scizorite
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

Moves
========

Swords Dance allows Scizor to easily boost itself into a fearsome attacker, doubling its Attack stat in a single turn. Bullet Punch returns as Scizor's Steel-type STAB move of choice, easily dismantling the faster Pokemon that might attempt to check it. U-turn may seem like an odd choice on a boosting set, but thanks to Scizor's full investment in Speed and Attack, it allows Scizor to boost up even if some of its slower checks (such as Rotom-W) are still alive, hitting them with a boosted U-turn. On the other hand, Bug Bite is a stronger, more consistent attack that won't force Scizor to switch out, but its coverage isn't superb. Notably, however, Bug Bite can OHKO Rotom-W after Stealth Rock. Knock Off is Scizor's best coverage move, hitting many Pokemon for neutral or super effective damage alongside Bullet Punch, but Superpower can be used as it easily takes out Heatran and is Scizor's strongest attack against Skarmory, doing about 60% to it on average.

Set Details
========

Full investment in Attack and Speed allows Scizor to outspeed many threats, including defensive variants of Heatran, Rotom-W, and Mega Venusaur, along with Jolly Mega Tyranitar, and hit them with powerful attacks to bring them down. An Adamant nature is chosen to give Scizor more power, as Bullet Punch is generally strong enough to take out the faster, frailer threats in the OU tier after they have been worn down. Scizorite is the item of choice, as the extra power, bulk, and Speed help Scizor in both sweeping and setting up. However, if a Mega Evolution slot is already used up, a Life Orb (with Technician) can be used instead, although the benefits of Scizorite will be missed. It should be noted that Life Orb Scizor (both Jolly and Adamant) has more damage output than Mega Scizor at the cost of bulk. Light Metal allows Scizor to take slightly less damage from Grass Knot and Low Kick before it Mega Evolves.


Usage Tips
========

Because Roost is not on this set, it's important to preserve Scizor's health, particularly if Life Orb is being used. For that reason, it should be sent out mid- to late-game and kept for sweeping purposes, although it can come out earlier to gain momentum with U-turn or threaten a switch-in with Knock Off if it will take little damage in the process. Once a sweeping opportunity presents itself, Scizor should be sent out to start boosting. Ideally, Scizor should be setting up against Pokemon that cannot do much to it, such as Mega Venusaur or Sylveon. It's important that Scizor's counters, namely Pokemon such as Skarmory, are removed or weakened before it attempts a sweep. Without bulk investment or Roost, it's harder for Scizor to come back in later in the match and sweep again.


Team Options
========

Terrakion is a good teammate for Scizor as they can break down one another's counters to start a sweep. Keldeo is a great partner, easily weakening Heatran, Skarmory, and Landorus-T, whereas Keldeo's common switch-ins such as Mega Venusaur and Sylveon tend to be complete setup bait for Scizor. Stealth Rock and Spikes support from the likes of Ferrothorn can be invaluable to getting a sweep going, easily wearing down the opponent's team. Rotom-W is a great partner due to its access to Volt Switch, easily forming a VoltTurn core with Scizor. In addition, a burnt enemy from Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp is very easy for Scizor to set up on. Finally, because this Scizor has no way of recovering health and less bulk than other variants, a Defog or Rapid Spin partner such as Latias (which shares decent defensive synergy with Scizor) can aid greatly in setting up. Although less reliable, Wish and Healing Wish support from Pokemon like Sylveon and Latias, respectively, can be used to give Scizor a second chance at sweeping.

Roost + 3 Attacks
########
name: Roost + 3 Attacks
move 1: Roost
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Bullet Punch
move 4: Knock Off / Pursuit / Superpower
ability: Light Metal
item: Scizorite
evs: 248 HP / 96 Atk / 164 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Roost gives Scizor a way to repeatedly check prominent threats such as Bisharp, Latias, Latios, most Fairy-types, and some Dragon-types that offensive sets cannot deal with. U-turn is a good STAB move that Scizor can use to switch into a more favorable match-up, especially against Skarmory; it also provides the team with offensive momentum. Bullet Punch gives Scizor a solid STAB move which is necessary to hit Fairy-and Dragon-types such as Clefable and Kyurem-B. Bullet Punch is also a priority attack that is boosted by Technician, which mitigates Scizor's horrible Speed. Knock Off is a great move to round off Scizor's coverage, neutering walls such as Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Heatran on the switch while also hitting Pokemon such as Skarmory. Other options on this set include using Pursuit instead of Knock Off to trap Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, and Mega Gardevoir, which can assist Pokemon such as Keldeo in sweeping. It also puts Kyurem-B into the KO range of Bullet Punch. Adding to Scizor's coverage, Superpower hits common switch-ins to Scizor such as Heatran while being able to do a good amount of damage to Skarmory, forcing it to Roost. Superpower is also the only move in Scizor's arsenal that is guaranteed to OHKO Bisharp.


Set Details
========

Scizor's EV spread focuses on HP, Special Defense, and Attack. 248 HP EVs make Scizor as bulky as possible and reduce Stealth Rock damage. 164 Special Defense EVs are used to help Scizor sponge up attacks from the likes of Latios and Latias, while 96 Attack EVs give Scizor additional damage output. Light Metal is the ability of choice as it reduces the damage of Low Kick and Grass Knot, and Mega Scizor gains Technician upon Mega Evolving anyway.

Usage Tips
========

This Scizor set is a medium between the other sets, being more offensively-oriented than the Defog set but more defensively-oriented than the Swords Dance set. Mega Scizor can act as a lure to Pokemon that counter it such as Heatran and Skarmory, then use U-turn to escape the unfavorable match-up. U-turn should also be used to build or keep offensive momentum for the team. Scizor makes for a good switch-in to Fairy-type Pokemon, as it resists their STAB moves and can retaliate with a super effective Bullet Punch. However, watch out for Clefable as it sometimes carries a Fire-type move which often OHKOes Scizor. Another Pokemon to watch out for is Mega Gardevoir, as it occasionally carries Hidden Power Fire or Will-O-Wisp, which are moves that Scizor dislikes.

Team Options
========

Notable teammates of Mega Scizor should be able to counter Keldeo, Thundurus, and Fire- types such as Heatran. Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Rotom-W, Keldeo, Terrakion, and Heatran all make for great partners, as they can beat the Fire-types that Mega Scizor hates. Pokemon that counter or check Thundurus such as Terrakion, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon also make for great teammates as they either wall it or threaten it out. Mega Scizor has no way to really damage Keldeo, and a Hydro Pump from it could be deadly, so teammates that can check Keldeo such as Latias and Latios make good teammates. As Mega Scizor is a counter to Fairy-types, Pokemon that are weak or are countered by Fairy-types are good teammates to Mega Scizor as well.

Defog
########
name: Defog
move 1: Defog
move 2: Roost
move 3: Bullet Punch
move 4: U-turn / Superpower / Knock Off
ability: Light Metal
item: Scizorite
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def

Moves
========

Defog is the focal point of this set, as Scizor is an extremely bulky and reliable Defog user. Roost is mandatory, keeping Scizor healthy throughout the duration of the match, thus allowing it to Defog more than once. The third slot is dedicated to whichever move fits the team better: Bullet Punch allows Scizor to revenge kill weakened opponents and threaten Fairy-types, while Knock Off provides all-around utility and a deterrent to Pokemon that are dependent on their items, such as Heatran. Finally, U-turn allows Scizor to pivot out once it has used Defog, and this can be useful for grabbing momentum when Defog is not necessary. As this set does not invest in Speed, its great bulk and slow U-turn allow many frail Pokemon a free switch-in.

Set Details
========

By maxing out its HP and Defense, Scizor becomes bulkier than even Skarmory, easily taking hits from ferocious physical attackers such as Excadrill and Bisharp, with the remaining 4 EVs invested in Attack for a slight boost to its attacking moves. An Impish nature is chosen as it raises Scizor's Defense through the roof without lowering the power of its attacks. Scizorite is the primary item, as Scizor becomes significantly bulkier after Mega Evolving. However, should another Mega Evolution already be on the team, Leftovers can be used, although the loss in bulk is usually not worth it.

Usage Tips
========

Scizor can be sent out against almost all physical attackers that lack a Fire-type move and gain a free turn to use Defog. Because this is set is not as commonly seen as the other ones listed above, bluffing an offensive set will also often gain it free turns, and switching into Pokemon like Sylveon and Chansey can also work. Although this set's primary role is to use Defog, its sheer defensive prowess allows it to work as a physical wall as well, acting as a full stop to several powerful physical attackers including non-Swords Dance Garchomp and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Beware, however, that without super effective coverage, Scizor may not be able to rack up enough damage on some physical attackers to prevent them from boosting in front of Scizor, particularly Swords Dance Excadrill and Bulk Up Thundurus. Make sure your team has a way of handling these boosting threats other than Scizor, either through revenge killers or walls with phazing capabilities.

Team Options
========

Although one usually thinks of Choice Band Scizor when considering members of a VoltTurn team, this Scizor set is actually also a great choice as it provides the Defog support that VoltTurn teams require. Note, however, that VoltTurn teams like to have their own entry hazards up as well, so Scizor should always be paired with a teammate, such as Landorus-T, that can be a reliable setter of Stealth Rock. Frailer attackers such as Gengar appreciate Scizor's slow U-turn to enter the battle safely; many of them, such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, immensely appreciate the Defog support as well. As always, Heatran is a perfect teammate as it not only sponges up Fire-type attacks, but also has great stat synergy with defensive Scizor, as Heatran commonly runs a specially defensive set and will complement Scizor's great physical bulk.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: U-turn
move 2: Bullet Punch
move 3: Knock Off / Pursuit
move 4: Superpower
ability: Technician
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD

Moves
========

Choice Band Scizor carries the strongest unboosted U-turn in the tier, allowing it to dish out massive damage while also providing momentum for its team. Similarly, with a Choice Band, Scizor's Bullet Punch becomes one of the strongest priority attacks available and makes it a great revenge killer capable of stopping the likes of Gengar and Belly Drum Azumarill. Knock Off provides a strong coverage move that can cripple many switch-ins, particularly Skarmory and Heatran, and easily put the opponent in a no-win situation. Pursuit, on the other hand, allows Scizor to trap Latias, Latios, and Gengar, putting a definite end to their use. Finally, Superpower allows Scizor to OHKO any incoming Heatran, as well as do massive damage to the likes of Conkeldurr and Rotom-W.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment in HP and Attack ensures that Scizor is bulky enough to be used several times in a match while letting it hit as hard as possible. Specifically, 248 HP EVs are used to lessen damage from Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are thrown into Special Defense, the lower of Scizor's two defensive stats. An Adamant nature ensures that Scizor hits as hard as possible. Choice Band is the only item considered, as it gives Scizor the highest power boost possible, and Scizor usually doesn't need to change moves.

Usage Tips
========

Scizor finds many opportunities to enter the battle with its respectable mixed bulk and threatening attacks. Whenever one of its attacks is needed, Scizor can be send out to perform the appropriate duty, and its bulk often permits it to switch into attacks. A well-planned dual switch is often extremely rewarding, as few Pokemon outside of select group of defensive walls will want to switch into Scizor's U-turn or Knock Off. Although this set can be played fairly liberally, make sure to conserve Scizor's HP if necessary, as it has no means of recovery and can be worn down by entry hazards.

Team Options
========

Users of Volt Switch and U-turn, such as Rotom-W and Landorus-T, can be used to form a highly effective VoltTurn core with Scizor. Rapid Spin or Defog support is highly recommended, as Scizor will be doing a lot of switching. A wallbreaker such as Kyurem-B can be helpful in breaking down the few Pokemon that can switch into Scizor safely, namely Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Mandibuzz. As always, Heatran is a great partner due to its easy absorption of Fire-type attacks, which Scizor will encounter frequently. If used as part of a VoltTurn core, a late-game cleaner such as Choice Band Talonflame or Mega Pinsir is often effective as a way to sweep the remnants of the opponent's team, as VoltTurn strategies often tend to spread damage very evenly throughout a team. Finally, entry hazards are a vital part of Choice Band Scizor's gameplay, as many of Scizor's checks, such as Charizard and Talonflame, are severely weakened by them, and this works well with Scizor's tendency to force switches.


Other Options
########

Acrobatics is a strong Flying-type move that can hit Keldeo, which resists all of Scizor's other attacks except for the occasionally seen Superpower. However, it prevents Scizor from holding an item and it doesn't work with Scizor's Mega Evolution. Aerial Ace can be used instead, but its low Base Power and relatively redundant coverage prevent it from being of much use over Scizor's other moves. Tailwind can be used to support Scizor's team, and while defensive Scizor is a reliable user of the move, with a slow U-turn to get nearly any attacker in safely, Tailwind's short duration makes it rather hard to take advantage of, especially in a relatively bulky metagame. Finally, Choice Scarf Scizor can afford to forego Bullet Punch for a stronger Iron Head and can outspeed most unboosted attackers. However, Scizor loses a considerable amount of power, and this does not fare well for a Pokemon that frequently relies on its non-STAB coverage moves to hit certain targets.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types** Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X and Heatran can hit Scizor for 4x super effective damage with their STAB moves, easily taking out even the bulkiest of Scizor variants. Attackers with Fire-type coverage moves are also extremely dangerous, particularly Pokemon such as Tyranitar or Garchomp that can attempt to lure Scizor in.

**Steel-types** Steel-types resist both of Scizor's STABs, although they may need to watch out for Scizor's coverage moves. In particular, a healthy Skarmory does not mind taking Superpower or Knock Off under most circumstances.

**Bulky Ground-types** Hippowdon usually does not mind Scizor, phazing it out and recovering the damage with Slack Off, although it does not enjoy taking a boosted Knock Off or Bug Bite. Landorus-T and Gliscor, while able to wall Choice Band and defensive variants, can be brought down by the stronger and more threatening Swords Dance variants.

**Bulky Water-types** Defensive Rotom-W can survive most of Scizor's attacks other than a +2 Bug Bite after Stealth Rock and proceed to cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Suicune can take any of Scizor's unboosted attacks and set up with Calm Mind, but variants without Roar may be overpowered by Swords Dance sets if they fail to get a Scald Burn.

**Physical Walls** Physical walls can easily handle Scizor, though some, such as Hippowdon without Whirlwind and Gliscor, will lose to Swords Dance variants. However, physical walls with phazing moves and/or Foul Play, in addition to Unaware Quagsire, will have no trouble with Scizor provided that they are healthy and that they confront it before it boosts too far.
