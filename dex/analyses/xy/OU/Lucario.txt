Overview
########

Lucario's exceptional Attack stat allows it to successfully function as a wallbreaker and a late-game cleaner. Lucario has a wide movepool and has the capability to utilize many different movesets. It has access to both of the most powerful physical Fighting-type attacks, Close Combat and High Jump Kick. It also has access to the coveted +2 priority attack Extreme Speed. Lucario isn't hurt much by entry hazards because it's immune to Toxic Spikes and is 4x resistant to Stealth Rock. It does suffer from four moveslot syndrome despite having access to a variety of moves, and fails to cover most relevant threats as a result. Lucario is also very frail and has mediocre Speed for an OU Pokemon. Although it has an incredible ability in Justified, Lucario can be hard-pressed to take advantage of Justified's Attack boost because of its poor defenses. Lucario is also susceptible to common priority moves such as Mach Punch, Aqua Jet, and Brave Bird. Despite its flaws, Lucario can still rip through opposing teams.

Moves
========

Close Combat is Lucario's main STAB move that's capable of ripping holes in opposing teams. Swords Dance raises Lucario's Attack to incredible levels in preparation for a late-game sweep or for breaking down defensive threats. Extreme Speed is an exceptional +2 priority move that allows Lucario to beat weakened foes, faster threats, and priority abusers such as Talonflame, Thundurus, Azumarill, and Mega Pinsir. Iron Tail is Lucario's other STAB move that allows it to beat potential checks and counters to it such as Clefable, Azumarill, Sylveon, Mega Heracross, Mew, and Mega Venusaur. Lucario can use Crunch to break through bulky Psychic-type Pokemon such as Slowbro and Mew. Ice Punch is a crucial coverage move that enables Lucario to hit Ground- and Flying-type Pokemon super effectively, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Garchomp.

Set Details
========

Lucario's EV spread is common for physical sweepers, having maximum Attack and Speed in order to function as an effective wallbreaker or late-game cleaner. There's no point in ever using Jolly nature because Lucario fails to outspeed anything relevant with it. Using Jolly nature over an Adamant nature would only make it harder for Lucario to perform its role as a late-game cleaner, having a noticeable decrease in power. The last moveslot depends on what the team has trouble dealing with, so if Lucario doesn't have problems with Fairy-types but has trouble dealing with bulky Ground-types, use Ice Punch. If it has trouble with Psychic-types and can handle Fairy-, Ground-, and Flying-type Pokemon, use Crunch.

Usage Tips
========

Lucario should be used as a late-game cleaner or as a wallbreaker that can punch holes in the opposing team, subsequently opening up an opportunity for a teammate to clean up. Lucario's checks and counters should be KOed or weakened before attempting to sweep with Lucario. The same applies before attempting to boost Lucario's Attack; this way, it doesn't waste turns or boosts.

Team Options
========

Lucario can function as an effective Fairy-type lure. It can open up opportunities for teammates to eliminate Clefable or Azumarill. Pokemon such as Bisharp, Mega Scizor, Choice Scarf Heatran, and Life Orb Excadrill benefit from Lucario's ability to lure Fairy-types. Pokemon that can provide entry hazard support make it easier for Lucario to secure OHKOs and 2HKOs. Entry hazards also make it easier for Lucario to function as a late-game cleaner. Mega Charizard Y and Kyurem-B can pave the way for a late-game sweep by getting rid of checks to Lucario such as Mega Venusaur, Hippowdon, Skarmory, Gyarados, and Mew. Latios is also another great partner that can provide Lucario an opportunity to set up through the use of Memento.

Other Options
########

Lucario has access to Stone Edge and can use it to OHKO unsuspecting Flying-types such as Talonflame, Gyarados, and Mega Pinsir. High Jump Kick can be used over Close Combat to avoid Close Combat's stat drops. However, High Jump Kick's imperfect accuracy can be an issue. Lucario is capable of running a special moveset thanks to its excellent base 115 Special Attack, a vast special movepool, and access to Nasty Plot.

Checks & Counters
########

**Mega Venusaur**: Lucario is unable to OHKO or 2HKO Mega Venusaur with its dual STAB moves, Close Combat and Iron Tail, and it is 2HKOed by Hidden Power Fire or Earthquake from Mega Venusaur.

**Bulky Ground-types**: If Lucario lacks Ice Punch, Landorus-T becomes a huge headache because of its bulk and ability, Intimidate. Gliscor can also be a problem because of its great Defense and excellent recovery through Poison Heal. Gliscor can seem to be an insurmountable wall to Lucario if it doesn't carry Ice Punch. Physically defensive Hippowdon can take any attack from Lucario and KO it with Earthquake.

**Bulky Fairy-types**: Bulky Fairy-types such as Clefable and Azumarill are able to absorb both neutral and resisted attacks from Lucario.

**Bulky Psychic-types**: Without Crunch, Lucario is unable to take on defensive Mew without being crippled by Will-O-Wisp. Lucario doesn't have the power to break through Slowbro without Crunch.

**Skarmory**: Without a boost, Lucario fails to 2HKO Skarmory with Close Combat and is KOed by Brave Bird or Counter from Skarmory.

**Mega Heracross**: Mega Heracross is bulky enough to absorb neutral and resisted hits from Lucario and then OHKO Lucario with Close Combat.

**Gyarados**: Gyarados resists both of Lucario's STAB moves and cuts Lucario's Attack with Intimidate.
