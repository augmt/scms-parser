Overview
########

Victini is, simply put, a powerhouse. While base 100 Attack might not seem all that impressive, access to a 180 Base Power STAB move in V-create makes Victini insanely difficult to stop; this is backed by an excellent movepool with many coverage and utility options. On top of this, Victini's unique defensive typing lets it serve as a check to many of the tier's top threats, including Mega Gardevoir, Mega Medicham, and Clefable, and access to Taunt and Will-O-Wisp lets it cripple some of its few answers, such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon. Choice Band Victini outright OHKOes or, at the least, 2HKOes almost every Pokemon in the tier; as such, it is ridiculously threatening to defensive teams. Victini does have a few problems, though. Its Psychic typing makes it Pursuit bait, and V-create's stat drops don't help with this. Victini is weak to Stealth Rock and can be checked by various common Water-type Pokemon in the OU tier. In general, Victini has difficulty finding switch-in opportunities due to its many common weaknesses.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: V-create
move 2: Bolt Strike
move 3: Zen Headbutt / Brick Break
move 4: U-turn
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

V-create is the main selling point of using Victini; it is the literal definition of a nuke, blasting through all but the bulkiest of Pokemon that resist it. For example, it has a 50% chance to OHKO Latios after Stealth Rock damage. Bolt Strike complements V-create well by annihilating Water-types, even 2HKOing Slowbro; it also hits Heatran rather hard. Zen Headbutt is generally preferred in the third moveslot to 2HKO Mega Charizard X, which otherwise counters Victini. However, Brick Break is also an option to OHKO Tyranitar and deal more damage to Heatran. U-turn is preferred in the last moveslot to reduce the need for prediction and pivot out of potentially unfavorable scenarios while also dealing heavy damage to Tyranitar on the switch.

Set Details
========

Max Attack and Speed investment maximize Victini's offensive capabilities. For the same reason, Choice Band is the primary item on the set. Life Orb can be used to switch moves, but with V-create's drops, Victini won't typically have the chance to switch moves anyway. There is also a significant drop in power when using Life Orb over Choice Band that makes Victini much easier to play around. A Jolly nature can be used instead of Adamant to ensure a Speed tie at the least with other base 100s, but the decrease in power generally isn't worth it.

Usage Tips
========

The name of the game with this set is spam V-create and watch something crumble. More prediction comes into play when involving Heatran, Tyranitar, and bulky Water-types, such as Slowbro and Alomomola. These Pokemon can seriously threaten Victini and limit its ability to spam V-create because it runs the risk of losing some serious momentum. In many situations, it can be a good idea to use Bolt Strike on switch-ins of these Pokemon and then double switch out as the opponent goes out to a Pokemon that can tank it. In the presence of Tyranitar, Brick Break can also be a solid option if Victini has it. U-turn is a very safe option in general and can even be preferred to killing something with V-create if keeping up offensive momentum is more important.

Team Options
========

Victini will often be forced out by foes such as Latios, Latias, Terrakion, Landorus-T, Gliscor, Azumarill, Keldeo, Excadrill, and Greninja. It is important to carry Pokemon such as Chesnaught, Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T that can come into these when they try to revenge kill. Spikes support from Chesnaught and Ferrothorn also aids Victini in wearing down opposing defensive Pokemon, which, when combined with Victini's U-turn and VoltTurn partners, such as Landorus-T and Mega Manectric, can wear down opposing teams very quickly. Defog or Rapid Spin support is important to get rid of Stealth Rock, which is a massive detriment to Victini's switch-in opportunities. Latias and Reflect Type Starmie are the best choices for this role. Finally, Pokemon to handle setup sweepers such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Mega Charizard X that can take advantage of a Choice-locked Victini are vital partners; some options include Hippowdon, Azumarill, and Ferrothorn.

Substitute
########
name: Substitute
move 1: Substitute
move 2: V-create
move 3: Bolt Strike
move 4: Power-Up Punch
item: Leftovers
evs: 96 HP / 252 Atk / 160 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Substitute is an excellent move on Victini to avoid status such as Toxic and, moreover, punish switch-ins, heavily reducing the prediction needed in using it. V-create is used as an obscenely powerful STAB move even without a boosting item, while Bolt Strike complements it nicely by hitting Water-types and Heatran. The odd move out on this set is Power-Up Punch, which is mediocre at best on almost every single other Pokemon in the game; however, when combined with Substitute, it works perfectly for Victini, allowing it to avoid statuses from foes such as Slowbro, Alomomola, Tyranitar, and Heatran and hit them with boosted Bolt Strikes. It also lets Victini bypass Hippowdon, Gliscor, and physically defensive Rotom-W, three very annoying checks to it otherwise. Zen Headbutt can be run over Substitute desired to hit Mega Charizard X. Will-O-Wisp is an option over Power-Up Punch to cripple many of the same foes, but though they are crippled by a burn, many of them still wall Victini. Brick Break allows Victini to bypass Tyranitar with much greater ease.

Set Details
========

The EV spread gives Victini maximum power while outspeeding Adamant Excadrill and Jolly Mega Heracross. The remaining EVs are placed into HP for a bit of extra bulk. A spread with maximum Speed can be run to tie with opposing base 100s at worst, but in order to take best advantage of this, a Jolly nature is required, which comes at a severe cost to Victini's power.

Usage Tips
========

As with your typical Victini, spamming V-create and smacking Water-types with Bolt Strike are typically its best options. Substitute is used to take advantage of sacrifices and then gain another kill, as well as prevent status from threatening defensive Pokemon. Power-Up Punch is for when Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Hippowdon, Gliscor, Slowbro, and Alomomola are around to ruin Victini's day otherwise.

Team Options
========

Hazard removal is vital to allow Victini easier and more frequent switch-in opportunities. Latias and Reflect Type Starmie are the best Pokemon for this role. Again, the likes of Chesnaught, Clefable, Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon make for good partners to come in on the various Water-, Ground-, Rock-, and Dragon-type foes that often come in to force Victini out, along with setup sweepers that wish to take advantage of it, though with Substitute as a buffer, these can be less of an issue for Victini itself. What's more important are Pokemon to come into Landorus-T as Victini chips away at it with V-creates, such as Rotom-W and Gliscor. Spikes support can also be very useful in wearing Slowbro down into a more manageable range of HP.

Stallbreaker
########
name: Stallbreaker
move 1: Taunt
move 2: V-create
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Bolt Strike
ability: Victory Star
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 32 Atk / 68 Def / 160 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Taunt allows Victini to debilitate setup sweepers, hazard setters, and walls such as Calm Mind Clefable, Heatran, and Chansey, respectively. Will-O-Wisp is key to this set, as it is used to wear down the opposition and cripple physical attackers while providing a decent way of dealing with opposing Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Bisharp. V-create is a staggeringly powerful STAB move that threatens all kinds of Pokemon, although it must be used carefully, as Victini becomes vulnerable to Pursuit trappers after V-create's Defense drop.

Bolt Strike provides great coverage and is highly effective against threats such as non-Earth Power Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, Rotom-W, and Substitute + 3 attacks Mega Medicham courtesy of its high Base Power. Using Bolt Strike means that Victini is left vulnerable to Gliscor and Landorus-T; however, the latter can be burned on the switch, possibly crippling it indefinitely.

Blue Flare with full Special Attack investment and a Modest nature is a viable alternative to V-create, as it leaves Victini less vulnerable to Pursuit, but the difference in power is noticeable. It's worth noting that using Bolt Strike with Blue Flare is undesirable because this would force Victini to use a nature that reduces its bulk, Speed, or power. Glaciate can be used instead of Taunt to surprise and take care of common switch-ins such as Latias, Latios, Landorus-T, Gliscor, Greninja, and Garchomp thanks to its incredibly useful Speed drop effect and super effective coverage. Thunder is a decent alternative to Bolt Strike if you wish to use Blue Flare, as Victory Star compensates for its poor accuracy. Grass Knot can also be used instead of Bolt Strike, but it's mostly inferior because it leaves Victini vulnerable to Heatran and really doesn't do much else besides nail Slowbro, Quagsire, and Hippowdon. Focus Blast can also be used to hit Heatran and Tyranitar hard.

Set Details
========

The EV spread allows Victini to outpace Adamant Excadrill and Jolly Mega Heracross while optimizing its bulk to take on dangerous threats and avoiding the 2HKO from Adamant Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick. Victory Star is a useful ability that makes Victini's moves more accurate; for example, Bolt Strike and Will-O-Wisp become 93% accurate. If you intend to run Blue Flare, use a Modest nature; never use Blue Flare with Bolt Strike, as it forces Victini to forgo much-needed Speed or bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T are some of Victini's most common switch-ins. As such, Will-O-Wisp is particularly deadly, especially against Gliscor before its Toxic Orb activates. This set effectively checks Mega Heracross, Clefable, Mega Medicham, and Mega Gardevoir, provided that these threats don't have the appropriate coverage moves to defeat it. Victini gets worn down easily, so try to keep it healthy so it can optimally check threats, as it lacks reliable recovery. This set excels on stall and balanced teams due to its ability to check extremely dangerous threats in one teamslot and break through most stall teams.

Team Options
========

Clerics such as Chansey and Clefable are great partners, as Victini is vulnerable to status effects such as Toxic. Additionally, both Clefable and Chansey are able to provide much-needed Wish support. Alomomola, in particular, is a great Wish passer, as it is able to help combat threats such as Mega Medicham and can switch into Landorus-T. Defog users such as Skarmory and Mandibuzz are good teammates, as Victini detests taking Stealth Rock damage. Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Bisharp are also useful, as Latios and Latias commonly switch into Victini.

Special Lure
########
name: Special Lure
move 1: Blue Flare / V-create
move 2: Thunder
move 3: Glaciate
move 4: Focus Blast
item: Expert Belt / Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Naughty

Moves
========

Victini is one of two Pokemon with access to Blue Flare, which is complemented by Victory Star's boost in accuracy from an unreliable 85% to a much more consistent 93%. With Fire Blast being nerfed to 110 Base Power, Blue Flare now has a significant power difference over it. This set is all about surprise factor and luring typical Victini answers, so hitting foes with special attacks can come as a huge surprise. V-create is also an option to maintain a powerful physical nuke and is still pretty powerful with a Naughty nature taken into account, even without investment. It is crucial to eliminate Clefable. Slowbro, Alomomola, Azumarill, Keldeo, and other Water-types are swiftly eliminated by Thunder, which has 77% accuracy thanks to Victory Star. Focus Blast also has 77% accuracy, and allows it to devastate Tyranitar and Heatran that think a V-create is coming. Glaciate nails Dragon-types on the switch and can cripple switch-ins with a -1 Speed drop. It also serves as a solid lure to hit Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon. Grass Knot can be used to hit Quagsire and Hippowdon for heavier damage. Psychic is another option to nail specially defensive Mega Charizard X.

Set Details
========

This Victini is an offensive variant with EVs optimizing its power and Speed. 4 EVs are placed into Defense instead of HP to give Victini an extra switch into Stealth Rock. Victini wants a Modest nature to maximize its damage output. A Naughty nature should be used to enhance V-create's power if Victini chooses to run it. A Naive nature can be run to outspeed or at worst tie with opposing base 100s. Expert Belt increases longevity and lets Victini bluff a Choice item in addition to allowing for some surprise KOs on Pokemon such as Tyranitar switching into Blue Flare. It also boosts power significantly against Pokemon like Heatran and Slowbro. Life Orb gives a consistent increase in power, and helps deal much more damage to Pokemon like Rotom-W that are neutral at worst to Victini's entire set.

Usage Tips
========

It's important to understand that a person's first thought when they see Victini is usually V-create, so be aware that they will most likely switch assuming that a V-create or U-turn is incoming. Therefore, the first prediction is huge. For example, a well-placed Focus Blast can devastate that Tyranitar looking to tank a V-create. Know that your opponent will respond much differently once they realize that it's a special attacking set and change your predictions accordingly. Despite being the weakest move by far on the set, Glaciate can be one of the most useful, slowing and damaging checks just enough for Victini to finish them off with Blue Flare. It also can take massive chunks of HP from Dragonite and Garchomp, two solid counters to the physical set.

Team Options
========

Strong physical sweepers to take advantage of weakened physical walls make for good teammates, such as Mega Charizard X, Excadrill, and Choice Scarf Garchomp. Pokemon with strong priority attacks, such as Choice Band Azumarill and Dragonite, can pick off foes that Victini has weakened. Skarmory can tank almost any physical attack aimed at Victini, while setting hazards to help wear down Victini's counters or Defogging away the hazards that it hates. Most Pokemon that can remove hazards from Victini's side of the field are good teammates; Starmie, Excadrill, and Latias are other good examples.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: V-create
move 2: Bolt Strike
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Final Gambit / Zen Headbutt
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

V-create still hits like a truck even without a boosting item, and a Choice Scarf allows Victini to attack faster threats, such as Keldeo and Greninja. Choice Scarf negates the Speed drop, allowing it to 2HKO slower Pokemon such as Gliscor and in general hit slower Pokemon attempting to revenge kill it that it couldn't otherwise. Bolt Strike synergizes very well with V-create by hitting Water-types, allowing it to revenge kill slightly weakened Mega Gyarados especially. U-turn allows Victini to scout for switches, and is useful because Choice Scarf Victini hates being stuck locked into anything in many scenarios. Final Gambit is the best option in the last slot, ruining defensive Pokemon with a massive 341 HP being taken off their health, paving the way for Pokemon such as Excadrill to clean. It also cleanly KOes most Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Charizard X, allowing it to revenge kill them rather effectively. Zen Headbutt is Victini's best option against Mega Charizard X, which otherwise completely walls this set, and allows it to hit faster Fighting-types like Terrakion and Keldeo hard; however, both of these Pokemon commonly use a Choice Scarf themselves, making Victini a shaky check.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed investment maximize Victini's ability to outspeed and successfully revenge kill foes with a Choice Scarf. An Adamant nature is preferred over a Jolly one for more power, as it doesn't really let Victini outspeed much that is notable besides Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T, which it cannot OHKO. Choice Scarf is what makes the set work, transforming Victini into a capable revenge killer.

Usage Tips
========

This set is generally used to serve as a fast, powerful nuke instead of necessarily revenge killing foes, though there are a few Pokemon that it can deal with, especially thanks to Final Gambit. Without the real firepower to break down some physical walls and pivots, spamming U-turn is often the best option, though without these walls around, spamming V-create is still a solid strategy. Final Gambit must be used strategically, as it causes Victini to faint. Be sure that the opponent will switch what you want to cripple with Final Gambit into Victini so you don't waste it and fail to weaken the opponent's wall.

Team Options
========

Choice-locked Victini can be massive setup bait for Pokemon that resist Fire type moves, such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Calm Mind Suicune. For this reason, Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn that can handle these well make for good partners. Because of the mechanics of Final Gambit, anti-hazard support is almost compulsory, Latias and Starmie being the best choices to fill this role. Strong priority users, such as Diggersby and Azumarill, can take advantage of weakened faster Pokemon.

Other Options
########

A Trick Room set can be used to take advantage of the Speed drops from V-create, allowing Victini to devastate faster Pokemon. However, this set is rather gimmicky and only viable on specific teams, making it an inferior option overall. A more specially defensive set to handle Mega Gardevoir reliably, perhaps even with Protect to amplify its recovery, is viable, as is a more physically defensive set to handle Mega Medicham. Special versions of the Will-O-Wisp set with Blue Flare and Thunder can be run for more reliability and to lure some more of Victini's common answers, though there is a noticeable drop in power with the lack of V-create.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Dragon-types**: Bulky Dragon-types are Victini's main counters for any set, as they can tank the powerful Fire- and Electric-type moves that Victini throws around. Mega Charizard X is probably the best overall counter, as it has a 4x resistance to Fire and Choice Band-boosted Bolt Strike can't even 3HKO it while it can threaten Victini with Earthquake or the potential to use it as setup fodder. If Mega Charizard X is weakened, then Substitute + Power-Up Punch can be problematic and Life Orb Psychic will 2HKO either way, but it is still the most solid answer out there. Other bulky Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Multiscale Dragonite handle Victini nicely as well, especially Roost Dragonite with HP investment. They can be hit hard with a Glaciate from special or mixed Victini, though.

**Fast Revenge Killers**: Victini is not very fast and has its Speed dropped even further by its best move, making it especially prone to revenge killing. Terrakion, Keldeo, Greninja, Landorus, Latios, Latias, Excadrill, and Tyranitar are some examples of Pokemon that can revenge kill it.

**Pursuit Users**: Because of V-create's nasty side effects, Victini is one of the most Pursuit-prone Pokemon in the game. Tyranitar has the added bonus of resisting V-create and easily OHKOes Victini that try to switch out with Pursuit. Bisharp can play Sucker Punch and Pursuit mindgames, though Substitute variants of Victini can be problematic to it.

**Special Walls**: Bulky special walls hard wall Victini's special set. Chansey, Blissey, and Goodra get special mentions for being nearly untouchable and being able to spread status or retaliate back in Goodra's case. They do have to watch out for mixed variants with V-create, however, and are mediocre initial switch-ins to Victini.

**Hazards**: Victini switches in and out a lot, so setting up Stealth Rock early-game and keeping it up can be crucial in wearing it down. Stealth Rock also greatly deters Victini from using U-turn for free momentum, as U-turn's relatively low power along with the cost to get Victini in while Stealth Rock is up means that the Victini user will be more inclined to capitalize on the opportunity to fire off an attack. Heatran can check Victini, especially if it carries Earth Power, and lay down the Stealth Rock it hates.
