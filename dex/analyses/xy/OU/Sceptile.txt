Overview
########

At first glance, Mega Sceptile may not seem very impressive. For starters, it has bad bulk and a typing that leaves it vulnerable to various priority users including Talonflame, Mamoswine, Weavile, Bisharp, and Mega Scizor. Furthermore, its base 145 Special Attack is relatively average considering Mega Sceptile has to go without a boosting item. Combine this with its lack of a powerful and reliable STAB move, and it's easy to see how most defensive teams don't struggle to handle it. However, Mega Sceptile's niche in OU comes from its ability to handle offensive teams. Its base 145 Speed makes it the fastest Dragon-type available, which is immensely useful in a tier with numerous threatening Dragon-types such as Latios, Latias, Garchomp, and Mega Charizard X, as Mega Sceptile is able to revenge kill all of them, barring Mega Altaria. Additionally, despite Mega Sceptile's relatively average Special Attack, it has access to Leaf Storm, which, thanks to its high Base Power, allows Mega Sceptile to revenge kill frailer threats such as Mega Lopunny. Its Grass STAB move of choice, along with its four times resistance to Water, allows Mega Sceptile to check all of the various bulky Water-type Pokemon in OU, including Slowbro, Manaphy, and Rotom-W. Finally, thanks to its access to Lightning Rod, Mega Sceptile is able to check most of the various Electric-types in OU, including Rotom-W, Mega Manectric, and Thundurus, the latter of which cannot even paralyze Mega Sceptile.

Moves
========

Leaf Storm is a very powerful STAB move that lets Mega Sceptile OHKO and 2HKO many Pokemon that its other Grass-type moves cannot. For example, Leaf Storm has a decent chance to 2HKO physically defensive Magic Guard Clefable and OHKO Landorus, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mega Manectric, and Assault Vest Azumarill after Stealth Rock. However, because Leaf Storm tends to force out Mega Sceptile after use because of the Special Attack drop it induces, Energy Ball can be used instead if you want a more consistent STAB move. In addition, Energy Ball does not allow for Pokemon that would otherwise be OHKOed by Leaf Storm, such as Mega Slowbro, to switch in on a Mega Sceptile at -2 Special Attack and abuse the situation. Both moves allow Mega Sceptile to check the bulky Water-types that it's supposed to, such as Rotom-W and Keldeo. Dragon Pulse is a great secondary STAB move that only Fairies are immune to and only Steel-types resist. Additionally, it hits Dragon-type Pokemon super effectively, which allows Mega Sceptile to effectively revenge kill Dragon-types such as Latias and Garchomp. Earthquake can be used to effectively handle Heatran, Klefki, Jirachi, Magnezone, and Tentacruel, and Hidden Power Fire can be used to cover Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. One small problem with Hidden Power Fire is that it forces Mega Sceptile to use a Speed IV of 30, which prevents it from Speed tying with Mega Beedrill. If this troubles you, or if you find it too hard to safely Mega Evolve Sceptile, you can try another route with its last two moves. Protect allows Sceptile to safely Mega Evolve, thus gaining a better Speed tier so that it can revenge kill Mega Manectric and Lopunny without having to deal with having only base 120 Speed for one turn. Additionally, it lets Mega Sceptile avoid Mega Lopunny's Fake Out. If you are running Protect, you should use Focus Blast in the last slot, as it hits all Steel-types except for Doublade neutrally.

Set Details
========

Mega Sceptile's base 145 Speed, Lightning Rod ability, and Dragon typing are all integral to its success in OU, so Sceptile needs to be used with Sceptilite. Maximum Speed EVs with a Speed-boosting nature are used in order to get the most of Mega Sceptile's revenge killing ability; if Mega Sceptile is using a Special Attack-boosting nature it loses out on being able to revenge kill Mega Lopunny and Mega Manectric. Even though Hidden Power Fire drops Mega Sceptile's Speed IV to 30, maximum Speed investment should still be used so that you can at least Speed tie other Mega Sceptile with Hidden Power Fire. A Naive nature is chosen on sets with Earthquake so that you don't drop either of Mega Sceptile's offensive stats. If you're using only Focus Blast for coverage against Steel-types, a Timid nature should be used to prevent any unnecessary hindrance to Mega Sceptile's Special Defense. Maximum Special Attack investment is used to ensure it hits as hard as possible.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Sceptile's base 120 Speed before Mega Evolving is great, but it is not always enough, as it doesn't allow Mega Sceptile to revenge kill Mega Lopunny or Mega Manectric. Thus, it's very important for Mega Sceptile to Mega Evolve early on when playing against offensive teams. One method by which you could bring in Mega Sceptile is with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn; this ensures Mega Sceptile gets in unscathed. Less support is needed if Mega Sceptile carries Protect, as it will never have to deal with its base 120 Speed, and it therefore can Mega Evolve after the opponent's Lopunny or Manectric without an issue. After Sceptile Mega Evolves and acquires Lightning Rod, you can have it pivot in on Electric-type attacks from the likes of Thundurus, Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Rotom-W, receive a Special Attack boost, and subsequently begin to use extremely powerful attacks. Do beware that some of these Electric-types may carry Hidden Power Ice, or in Thundurus's case, Hidden Power Flying, which does severe damage to Mega Sceptile. Thanks to its 4x Water resistance, Mega Sceptile can also pivot in on various Water-types, such as Slowbro, Quagsire, Keldeo, and Alomomola, and annihilate them with a STAB Leaf Storm. Again, be aware that some of these Pokemon may carry Ice Beam or Icy Wind, both of which demolish Mega Sceptile. One perk of Mega Sceptile is that, unlike with other fast attackers, you don't have to be cautious when playing against a team with Thundurus, because Mega Sceptile cannot be stopped by Prankster Thunder Wave.

Team Options
========

Defensively, Steel-types such as Klefki, Bronzong, and Jirachi as well as Poison-types such as Amoonguss, Dragalge, and Gengar can handle the Fairy-types that Mega Sceptile has trouble with, such as Clefable, Mega Altaria, Togekiss, and Sylveon. Togekiss especially gives Mega Sceptile a hard time, so checks to it, such as Rotom-W and Thundurus, make for good teammates. Mega Sceptile hates Talonflame's priority Brave Bird, so Talonflame switch-ins such as Heatran, Rhyperior, and Rotom-W are helpful. Heatran deserves a special mention for also being able to beat the bulky Grass-types, such as Amoonguss, that Mega Sceptile hates.

Offensively, Mega Sceptile makes a good partner for Talonflame as well, as Mega Sceptile beats Rotom-W, Rhyperior, Tyranitar, and Heatran, all Pokemon that counter Talonflame. Gyarados hates Rotom-W for its ability to wall and OHKO it with Volt Switch. Mega Sceptile can OHKO Rotom-W for Gyarados, and if it switches in on a Volt Switch, it will get a Special Attack boost. In return, Gyarados with Bounce beats the bulky Grass-types that Mega Sceptile cannot, such as Amoonguss. As Mega Sceptile struggles greatly against stall, it appreciates powerful wallbreakers to break the walls that it cannot. Choice Specs Sylveon, Choice Specs Dragalge, Swords Dance Diggersby, and Swords Dance Crawdaunt can all help break defensive teams for Mega Sceptile.

Substitute
########
name: Substitute
move 1: Dragon Pulse
move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Substitute
ability: Overgrow
item: Sceptilite
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Substitute is a great move for using on a predicted switch to a potential check; it greatly eases prediction throughout the match. Substitute also allows Mega Sceptile to evade Bisharp and Mega Absol's Sucker Punch. Giga Drain works extremely well alongside Substitute, as it recovers Mega Sceptile's health and therefore allows it to make more Substitutes. It also hits Water-type Pokemon super effectively, which allows Mega Sceptile to check various Water-types such as Rotom-W. However, it is relatively weak against neutral targets. Dragon Pulse is a great secondary STAB move that hits most targets neutrally while also hitting Dragon-types super effectively, which allows Mega Sceptile to revenge all Dragon-types without a Speed boost bar Mega Altaria, such as Latios and Choice Band Dragonite. On the fourth and final slot you should use Focus Blast, as it hits all Steel-types at except for Doublade at least neutrally, unlike Earthquake, to which Skarmory is immune, and Hidden Power Fire, to which Heatran is immune. However, if you're willing to give up hitting Heatran and OHKOing Bisharp, Hidden Power Fire is viable because it is more accurate than Focus Blast and hits Scizor super effectively.

Set Details
========

Sceptile needs base 145 Speed, Lightning Rod, and its Dragon typing in order to be viable in OU, so it should be used with Sceptilite. Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment with a Timid nature should be used to hit as hard as possible without sacrificing any Speed. If Mega Sceptile were to use a Modest nature, for example, it wouldn't be able to revenge kill Mega Lopunny or Mega Manectric.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Sceptile is a fast Pokemon; even without having already gained the Speed boost that comes from Mega Evolving, it can revenge kill many Pokemon such as Keldeo, Terrakion, and Latios. However, this Speed is not always sufficient, as it doesn't allow Mega Sceptile to outspeed Mega Lopunny or Mega Manectric on the turn it Mega Evolves. Against teams with these Pokemon, or any Pokemon with a base Speed of 120 or higher, it is very important to Mega Evolve quickly, as not prioritizing Mega Evolving Sceptile could lead to, for example, Mega Lopunny demolishing your team. One method you can use to bring Sceptile in early and safely is a slow Volt Switch or U-turn. After Mega Evolving and acquiring Lightning Rod, Mega Sceptile can switch in on Electric-type attacks from the various Electric-type Pokemon in OU, including Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Rotom-W, get a Special Attack boost, and subsequently either attack with a very powerful move or set up a Substitute. You should use Substitute whenever the situation calls for it; instead of having to predict whether or not the opponent will switch his or her Pokemon out, and thus possibly costing a game, just use Substitute. The worst that could happen is that Mega Sceptile wastes 25% of its HP; the potential benefit of being protected by a Substitute against a Pokemon that Mega Sceptile can 2HKO far outweighs this risk. When behind a Substitute, Mega Sceptile becomes very hard to deal with for offensive teams, as few Pokemon used on offensive teams can outspeed and/or avoid the 2HKO from Mega Sceptile. Emergency checks to Mega Sceptile, such as Weavile, do not work when Mega Sceptile is behind a Substitute, as Weavile's Ice Shard simply breaks the Substitute and Mega Sceptile can OHKO Weavile with Focus Blast.

Team Options
========

Fairies such as Clefable, Mega Altaria, Togekiss, and Sylveon all give Mega Sceptile trouble. As a result, it appreciates teammates that make quick work of Fairies, namely Steel-types such as Klefki, Bronzong, and Jirachi and Poison-types such as Amoonguss, Dragalge, and Gengar. Togekiss is especially notable as a nuisance for Sceptile, as it takes pitiful damage from all of Sceptile's moves. Rotom-W and Thundurus both check Togekiss, so they can make for good teammates for Mega Sceptile. Talonflame's priority Brave Bird can stop any Mega Sceptile not behind a Substitute, so Mega Sceptile appreciates the support of Talonflame switch-ins, such as Heatran, Rhyperior, and Rotom-W. Heatran is especially notable because it can beat the bulky Grass-types, such as Amoonguss, that give Mega Sceptile headaches.

Talonflame is a great teammate for Mega Sceptile as well. It is stopped cold by various Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Rhyperior, Tyranitar, and Heatran, all four of which Mega Sceptile beats for Talonflame, while in return, Talonflame can break down the bulky Grass-types, such as Mega Venusaur, that Mega Sceptile hates dealing with. Gyarados also hates Rotom-W for its ability to wall and OHKO it with Volt Switch. Mega Sceptile OHKOes Rotom-W for Gyarados, and if Mega Sceptile switches in on a Volt Switch, it gets a Special Attack boost. In return, Gyarados beats the bulky Grass-types, such as Celebi, that Mega Sceptile cannot by using Bounce. As Mega Sceptile struggles greatly against stall, it enjoys having powerful wallbreakers as teammates to break the walls that it cannot. Choice Specs Sylveon, Choice Specs Dragalge, Swords Dance Diggersby, and Swords Dance Crawdaunt can all help break defensive teams for Mega Sceptile.

Other Options
########

Mega Sceptile boasts a Thunder Wave immunity, an impeccable base 145 Speed, a usable 110 base Attack, and a solid physical movepool. A Swords Dance set set with Leaf Blade, Low Kick / Earthquake, and Outrage / Dragon Claw is therefore plausible. However, it is much less effective than other Dragon-type sweepers, such as Mega Altaria, Mega Charizard X, and Haxorus, and should only be used for its surprise value. Any standard set Mega Sceptile can run leaves it walled by Fairies; Iron Tail can be a good solution. Likewise, almost all bulky Flying-types wall Mega Sceptile; Rock Slide can be used to remedy this problem. On the All-Out Attacker set, Mega Sceptile could use both Leaf Storm and Giga Drain. Leaf Storm is used in scenarios when the power is needed, and Giga Drain is used whenever a consistent STAB move is needed. Going this route forgoes having exceptional coverage against Steel-types and the utility provided by Protect, so it's only recommended if team support renders those unnecessary. If you desire a stronger Grass-type STAB move on the Substitute set, you can use Leaf Storm. It gains many OHKOs and 2HKOs that Giga Drain cannot achieve, such as on Landorus, Azumarill, and Mega Manectric. However, it is counterproductive alongside Substitute, as it can't recover HP and forces Mega Sceptile out after use.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairies**: Mega Altaria is one of the best counters to Mega Sceptile, as it resists its Grass STAB moves, Focus Blast, and Hidden Power Fire; is is also immune to Dragon Pulse and takes very little damage from Earthquake. It can use Mega Sceptile as setup bait or just go for the OHKO with Return or Hyper Voice. Sylveon can tank a hit and subsequently OHKO with Hyper Voice, potentially through Mega Sceptile's Substitute. Mega Gardevoir can switch into any move bar Leaf Storm and OHKO with Hyper Voice even through a Substitute. Clefable with mixed bulk and a Calm nature avoids the 2HKO from all moves, can use Mega Sceptile as Stealth Rock fodder, and can recover constantly with Wish.

**Flying-types**: Mandibuzz avoids the 2HKO from Dragon Pulse, can Roost off any damage taken, and can threaten Mega Sceptile with Foul Play and use it as Defog fodder. Specially defensive Talonflame avoids the 2HKO from Dragon Pulse and can OHKO with Brave Bird. Assault Vest Tornadus-T easily avoids the 2HKO from Dragon Pulse and can OHKO with Hurricane. All Togekiss sets counter Mega Sceptile, but offensive sets are especially good for being able to use Mega Sceptile as Nasty Plot setup bait.

**Select Bulky Steel Types**: Klefki can easily switch in on Grass- and Dragon-type moves, take a Hidden Power Fire well, use Mega Sceptile as Spikes fodder, and 2HKO Mega Sceptile with Play Rough. It must, however, be wary of Earthquake. Bronzong takes very little from all of Mega Sceptile's attacks and can do decent damage with Gyro Ball. Specially defensive Jirachi walls Mega Sceptile that lack Earthquake, and Mega Scizor beats all sets lacking Hidden Power Fire. Specially defensive Doublade avoids the 2HKO from all of Mega Sceptile's moves. Mega Metagross can switch in on either of Mega Sceptile's STAB moves and KO in return with Meteor Mash.

**Bulky Grass-types**: Bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Celebi can all switch on any move Mega Sceptile has repeatedly throughout a match and force it out.

**Chansey and Blissey**: Chansey and Blissey easily switch in on any move Mega Sceptile may possess.

**Revenge Killers**: Mega Sceptile's typing and bad bulk leave it vulnerable to priority. Talonflame can revenge kill with Brave Bird while Mamoswine and Weavile can both revenge kill it with Ice Shard. Choice Band Scizor can revenge kill it with Bullet Punch easily, and it can even check Mega Sceptile that lack Hidden Power Fire, as it resists Dragon and Grass. Mega Aerodactyl doesn't have priority, but it outspeeds Mega Sceptile and can revenge kill it with Aerial Ace, Ice Fang, or Stone Edge.
