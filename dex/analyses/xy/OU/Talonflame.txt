Overview
########

With access to Gale Wings and STAB Brave Bird, Talonflame is unarguably the best revenge killer in OU. It can also be a great cleaner and sweeper, with Swords Dance, Bulk Up, or a Choice Band. Furthermore, Talonflame has priority Roost and a good typing that gives it plenty of opportunities to use it, allowing it to stick around throughout the match and check some common threats, such as Landorus and Mega Venusaur. However, Talonflame's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prevents it from switching in and out as much as it would want, hampering its effectiveness and making Defog or Rapid Spin support a necessity. Talonflame's weakness to Stealth Rock is amplified by the fact that both its STABs make it suffer recoil, further decreasing its longevity. Also, Talonflame's unimpressive base 81 Attack and lack of coverage means that it's easy to stop with physically bulky Pokemon or Pokemon that resist its STABs, such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon. Finally, Talonflame has weaknesses to the common Water-, Electric-, and Rock-type attacks, so taking it out is not hard at all.

Revenge Killer
########
name: Revenge Killer
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Flare Blitz
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Tailwind / Sleep Talk / Roost
ability: Gale Wings
item: Choice Band / Sharp Beak
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

Moves
========

Brave Bird gets priority and is Talonflame's most useful asset, OHKOing many offensive Pokemon and also allowing Talonflame to clean up weakened teams. Flare Blitz takes care of the Steel-types that resist Brave Bird, as well as some Electric-types, such as Thundurus and Zapdos. U-turn does respectable damage to some of Talonflame's best switch-ins, such as Tyranitar and Rotom-W, and gives switch initiative. Tailwind is a nice option for the last slot with Choice Band, as it gets priority and can let teams revenge kill Pokemon that Brave Bird alone can not, such as Mega Tyranitar, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Manectric. Sleep Talk is useful to absorb sleep from the likes of Breloom and Amoonguss. The best part about this is that, unlike other Pokemon that might carry Sleep Talk, no move Talonflame picks with it will cause it to fare poorly against these Pokemon. If Sharp Beak is the item of choice, then Roost is a superior option, as it allows Talonflame to take advantage of its typing to find more switch-in opportunities and stick around for longer by healing damage taken from resisted attacks, such as Scizor's U-turn or Clefable's Moonblast.

There are some other situational moves that can be used on the last slot. Will-O-Wisp provides permanent chip damage to Talonflame's switch-ins and neuters its physically based checks, such as Tyranitar and Landorus-T, making them easier to wear down, but being locked into a status move has severe drawbacks, and the best choice against a predicted check is often just to use U-turn as it comes in. Lastly, Me First allows Talonflame to OHKO Garchomp and Kyurem-B that have just KOed something with a Dragon-type attack.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed is used to Speed tie opposing Talonflame and OHKO Mega Pinsir before it manages to hit Talonflame with +2 Quick Attack, and also lets Talonflame outspeed positive-natured base 110s, such as Latios and Latias, so that you can safely hit them with U-turn. Choice Band is the superior item choice as Talonflame will mostly be using either Brave Bird or U-turn, but Sharp Beak gives more flexibility and allows Talonflame to use Roost. A Jolly nature with an EV spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe can be used, enabling Talonflame to outspeed and OHKO Thundurus with Flare Blitz and giving it a bit more bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Talonflame is first and foremost a revenge killer and should be played as such. The moment the battle starts, you should identify which Pokemon Talonflame can revenge kill; if those Pokemon are not too threatening to your team, Talonflame can be played more recklessly. Otherwise, it should be kept safe at all costs, unless its use is absolutely necessary. In some situations, Talonflame can also end games with Brave Bird, so if one sees a team that can be swept by Talonflame with minimal preparations, it is wise to keep Talonflame healthy until those preparations have been made. Also, U-turn is the best move to spam early-game, as most of Talonflame's checks and counters can get worn down pretty easily by U-turn and Stealth Rock.

Team Options
========

A way to deal with Stealth Rock is the number one concern when using Talonflame. Excadrill, Latios, and Latias are the best Pokemon at this job, as all have decent synergy with Talonflame, resisting one or more of its weaknesses and beating some of its checks and counters (Mold Breaker Excadrill beats Rotom-W, Heatran, and Tyranitar; Latios and Latias beat Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Thundurus), so they are some of the best teammates to have. Next, a good check to Rotom-W and physical walls / pivots in general is needed, as those are the most common answers to Talonflame. Mega Venusaur and Kyurem-B can handle all of those, so they are both great partners. Rotom-W and Scizor have great synergy with Talonflame and can form a VoltTurn core that facilitates getting Talonflame into battle for free. Stealth Rock support is nice to have, as it enables Talonflame to OHKO certain targets. For example, with Choice Band and Stealth Rock up, Brave Bird can OHKO Latias and Landorus, and 2HKO Mandibuzz and max HP Zapdos. Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Terrakion are all great partners and some of the best offensive Stealth Rock setters. Finally, Choice Band Staraptor and Mega Pinsir work great alongside Talonflame, as they all have similar checks and counters, hopefully allowing them to overwhelm their checks and sweep.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Brave Bird
move 3: Flare Blitz
move 4: Roost
ability: Gale Wings
item: Sharp Beak
nature: Jolly
evs: 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe

Moves
========

With Swords Dance and priority Brave Bird, Talonflame can take the role of a sweeper. Brave Bird is fairly powerful after a boost and OHKOes most offensive Pokemon. Flare Blitz takes care of Steel-types, while Roost gives some use to Talonflame in the early and mid-game, as it can throw a couple of attacks, recover off the passive damage and recoil, and set up later to attempt a sweep. Roost also allows Talonflame to deal with the Pokemon it checks, such as Scizor, Clefable, Mega Venusaur, and Volcarona, for an extended period of time.

U-turn can be used on the last slot, as Talonflame fits nicely onto VoltTurn chains, and U-turn wears down certain checks and counters, such as Rotom-W and Tyranitar. Taunt is another option, as it shuts down Hippowdon and defensive Heatran, allowing Talonflame to boost enough to get past them and sweep.

Set Details
========

136 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature are crucial for Talonflame to outrun Thundurus, which can otherwise easily prevent a sweep. The remaining EVs are distributed to optomize Talonflame's attacking capabilities and give it a bit of bulk to help set up. Sharp Beak is the best item option to power up Brave Bird, as after a boost, Flare Blitz has enough power to KO its targets, and with Life Orb Talonflame will get KOed by recoil really fast. However, a Life Orb gives Talonflame a chance to achieve some crucial OHKOes with Brave Bird, including a 43.8% chance to OHKO Thundurus, a 25% chance to OHKO Choice Scarf Excadrill or Sand Rush Excadrill in sand after Stealth Rock, a 50% chance to OHKO Choice Scarf Rotom-W after Stealth Rock, and a 75% chance to OHKO specially defensive Hippowdon after one layer of Spikes. Life Orb also gives Talonflame more immediate power, which is useful for revenge killing purposes. However, move recoil plus Life Orb weakens Talonflame extremely quickly, so it's generally not recommended. If Raikou proves particularly problematic, an EV spread of 88 HP / 252 Atk / 168 Spe with a Jolly nature can be run to outspeed it. If greater revenge killing ability is preferred over the ability to outspeed Thundurus, then an Adamant nature with EVs of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe can be run in order to tie with other Talonflame and outspeed Mega Pinsir and hit it with Brave Bird before it uses Quick Attack.

Usage Tips
========

This set can be very flexible in terms of playstyle. It can take the role of an all-out attacker, revenge killer, pivot, hole puncher, or late-game cleaner; choose what it is most appropriate for after seeing your opponent's team. As long as there are hard counters to Talonflame, it's better to double switch out or heal with Roost. Also, if you want to clean up with Talonflame, make sure you have enough health to do so, as many teams rely on recoil damage to check Talonflame if their checks and counters are weakened.

Team Options
========

As usual, Excadrill, Latios, and Latias are the best partners to Talonflame, as they are effective at getting rid of Stealth Rock, have good offensive presence, and cover Talonflame's weaknesses. Strong physical wallbreakers that weaken the physically bulky Pokemon that Talonflame can't OHKO, such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T, work well with Talonflame. Such Pokemon include Swords Dance Garchomp, Choice Band Terrakion, and Mega Heracross, with Garchomp also being able to set up Stealth Rock, further assisting Talonflame. Rotom-W can deal with most physical walls and tanks that check Talonflame, in addition to bringing Talonflame in unharmed with Volt Switch, making for a very effective teammate. Staraptor forms a very effective offensive core with Talonflame, as both Pokemon have similar checks and counters, so either of them can weaken the opposing team's checks so that the other one can clean up later. If Staraptor holds Choice Band, Staraptor is usually the one who weakens the opposing team and Talonflame the one who sweeps, while if Staraptor holds Choice Scarf the opposite happens. Mega Pinsir wears down Talonflame's checks and counters in a similar fashion, so it's another good teammate.

Stallbreaker
########
name: Stallbreaker
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Roost
move 4: Will-O-Wisp
ability: Gale Wings
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 252 SpD / 8 Spe
nature: Careful

Moves
=====

Brave Bird is one of Talonflame's most powerful attacking moves and it even has priority. Taunt prevents the use of healing, status, boosting, and phazing moves as well as the use of entry hazards. It also allows Talonflame to beat Heatran that lack a Rock-type move. Roost helps Talonflame stay healthy and outlast dangerous Pokemon that lack a coverage move for it such as Mega Charizard Y. Roost's priority usually enables Talonflame to heal before being attacked, allowing Talonflame to get in a Will-O-Wisp or Taunt before it needs to start healing. Having access to reliable recovery is one of Talonflame's advantages over stallbreaker Victini and Chandelure. Will-O-Wisp pressures many of Talonflame's checks and counters by slowly wearing them down and by restricting their offensive capabilities. The combination of Will-O-Wisp and Taunt gives Talonflame more versatility than running Bulk Up with either Taunt or Will-O-Wisp. Taunt gives it the ability to stallbreak similarly to the Bulk Up + Taunt set while still having the ability lure and cripple like the Bulk Up + Will-O-Wisp set.

Set Details
========

248 HP and 252 Special Defense EVs bolster Talonflame's special bulk and enable it to switch into Stealth Rock three times from full health. The 8 Speed EVs allow Talonflame to outspeed max Speed neutral-natured Kyurem-B so Talonflame can check it with Will-O-Wisp. A spread of 104 HP / 180 Atk / 16 Def / 208 Spe with an Impish nature and a Sharp Beak guarantees the OHKO on Mega Medicham and lets Talonflame check +2 Mega Pinsir.

Usage Tips
========

This Talonflame set excels at dismantling stall teams lacking Mega Charizard X and Suicune. Talonflame can freely switch in on passive Pokemon such as Magic Guard Calm Mind Clefable, Amoonguss after a Pokemon has been put to sleep, Chansey lacking a status move, and Skarmory. Do not let Talonflame get inflicted by a status, as it makes stallbreaking far more difficult. Be careful with Roost as its priority can make Talonflame vulnerable to Ground-type moves when used. It can also be used advantageously by removing Talonflame's Electric-type weakness for a turn. In addition, make sure to conserve PP against stall teams by using Taunt only when needed, while against more offensive teams, bluffing only either Will-O-Wisp or Taunt can assist in luring in Talonflame's checks. Talonflame can check many Pokemon that are powerful against balanced and stall teams such as Mega Heracross and Mega Medicham.

Team Options
=========

Entry hazard removal from Excadrill, Latias, and Latios is greatly appreciated as they can check various threats for Talonflame and have good defensive synergy. Latias's Healing Wish also can give Talonflame a second chance at stallbreaking if a stray Toxic hits it. Keep in mind when teambuilding that if you pick Latias or Latios as your Defogger, like Talonflame either one is easily checked by Tyranitar. Pokemon that resist Electric- and Water-type attacks such as Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Raikou are good teammates. Even though Talonflame can stall out some of Heatran's specially defensive sets, it is highly recommended that you run a Heatran check such as Keldeo, Terrakion, or Garchomp alongside it. Stealth Rock support is extremely helpful due to the amount of switches Talonflame forces, so Pokemon such as Hippowdon make good teammates.

Bulk Up
########
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Brave Bird
move 3: Roost
move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Taunt
ability: Gale Wings
item: Leftovers
nature: Careful
evs: 248 HP / 252 SpD / 8 Spe

Moves
========

Bulk Up makes Talonflame really difficult to take down and gives it the power to sweep through teams. Brave Bird gets priority and hits hard after a few boosts, enabling Talonflame to bypass faster threats. Roost allows Talonflame to accumulate multiple boosts in front of Pokemon that can't significantly hurt it and also gets priority, allowing Talonflame to soften the blow from faster Pokemon that use Rock- or Electric-type moves if the need arises. Will-O-Wisp pressures Talonflame's checks and counters by slowly wearing them down, while also limiting the offensive presence of some of those Pokemon, such as Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Landorus-T. Taunt prevents the use of phazing moves, entry hazards, and status, granting Talonflame the ability to beat some of its most common checks, namely Hippowdon, Heatran, and Alomomola. This makes Talonflame a decent stallbreaker.

Substitute helps Talonflame stall out the PP of Stone Edge users, such as Tyranitar and Landorus-T, and Rotom-W's Hydro Pump, allowing Talonflame to use them as setup bait, sometimes. Flare Blitz can be used for the last slot for a way to deal immediately with threatening Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Bisharp, Excadrill, and Thundurus, but leaves Talonflame very prone to its usual checks and counters, unlike the other options on the last slot.

Set Details
========

Special bulk is maximized to help Talonflame take hits on its weaker side, as Bulk Up patches up its physical side. 8 Speed EVs allow Talonflame to outrun Kyurem-B and hit it with Will-O-Wisp before it can destroy Talonflame with Fusion Bolt.

Usage Tips
========

If the opponent lacks Fire-types, send Talonflame in as early as possible to cripple its checks with Will-O-Wisp, making them easier to wear down throughout the course of the game. With Taunt, this set stops many of the universal Talonflame checks, such as Whirlwind Hippowdon and specially defensive Heatran, so use this to your advantage; send out Talonflame when it can threaten everything on the opposing team other than said checks, and as they come in, either grab a second Bulk Up boost as they realize their mistake and switch out, or Taunt them and then grab a second Bulk Up boost. Also, take advantage of Talonflame's fast Taunt to handicap Pokemon that rely a lot on non-attacking moves, such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Hippowdon. Be aware of what attacks Talonflame can and can't survive, so you can decide whether you should stay in and boost more or switch out.

Team Options
========

Anti-Stealth Rock support is a must, even more so than on other sets, as Bulk Up Talonflame likes to switch in and out a lot. Talonflame switches frequently in part because of its ability to check multiple Pokemon and cripple some of its own checks with Will-O-Wisp, but also because its lack of immediate power makes it very wallable. Defog Mega Scizor and Skarmory are the most sturdy Pokemon for this job, though more offensive choices such as Latios, Latias, and Excadrill can work depending on the team. All of those Pokemon have at least decent defensive synergy with Talonflame, being able to check or wall some of the Pokemon that Talonflame struggles against, such as Rotom-W, Heatran, Tyranitar, Thundurus, and Landorus-T. Mega Venusaur can check most Water- and Electric-types that threaten Talonflame, in addition to handling certain physically defensive Pokemon that wall Talonflame, such as Hippowdon and Tyranitar. Choice Band Staraptor can wear down Talonflame's checks and counters so that it has an easier time sweeping late-game, making for a great partner; the same goes for Mega Pinsir.

Swords Dance + Natural Gift
########
name: Swords Dance + Natural Gift
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Natural Gift
move 3: Brave Bird
move 4: Flare Blitz
ability: Gale Wings
item: Liechi Berry / Salac Berry
evs: 88 HP / 252 Atk / 168 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Natural Gift allows Talonflame to beat its usual counters with the appropriate Berry, which can open up the way for a sweep. Swords Dance is used to bolster the power of Talonflame's attacks, allowing it to OHKO Tyranitar and Quagsire with Natural Gift and to bring Heatran and Rotom-W into the KO range of Brave Bird. Brave Bird provides a powerful STAB priority weapon.

Set Details
========

A Jolly nature with the given EV spread is used to outspeed Timid Thundurus and KO it with Flare Blitz if it switches into a Brave Bird, taking advantage of the fact that this particular Talonflame set is not Choice-locked. The EV spread also enables Talonflame to outpace Choice Scarf Tyranitar and maximum Speed Raikou, preventing them from revenge killing. Depending on which Berry is used, Talonflame can beat a few of its checks with Natural Gift; Liechi Berry hits Rotom-W, Tyranitar, and Quagsire with a 100 Base Power Grass-type move, while Salac Berry hits Tyranitar (harder) and Heatran with a 100 Base Power Fighting-type move.

Usage Tips
========

Talonflame won't be as strong as its standard Choice Band set; this set is more to lure in and remove or weaken Talonflame's standard checks and sweep once they are removed. The surprise factor of this set allows it to bluff the standard Choice Band or Swords Dance set if played well. Set up Swords Dance on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Scizor that Talonflame can force out. Entry hazards should be removed to bring Talonflame in unscathed since it might be forced to consume the Berry if it reaches low HP; this is something to watch out for if using Brave Bird before Natural Gift has been used. Be sure that Rotom-W is weakened to around 75% before you use Natural Gift, as otherwise it can survive even a +2 hit and KO back. Try to avoid Knock Off, because removing Talonflame's Berry effectively wastes a moveslot and an item, not to mention that this Talonflame doesn't have any form of recovery to heal off the damage. Finally, be cautious of spamming Brave Bird before Talonflame is ready to sweep, as the opponent might notice a difference in damage between this and Sharp Beak or Choice Band Talonflame, and then expect the lure.

Team Options
========

Slow U-turn and Volt Switch users are good teammates, as they allow Talonflame to come in without taking prior damage; examples of those include Mega Scizor, Gliscor, Raikou, and Rotom-W. Defoggers and spinners such as Mandibuzz, Excadrill, and Latios make good partners, as losing 50% of its HP upon switching in is very detrimental to Talonflame. Other physical setup sweepers that benefit from Rotom-W and company removed, such as Azumarill, Mega Scizor, Mega Charizard X, and Dragonite, are also great teammates to exploit the holes left behind by Talonflame. Stealth Rock setters such as Hippowdon and Tyranitar are also appreciated, mostly to wear down Heatran and Rotom-W and bring them into the KO range of +2 Natural Gift. Mega Pinsir works well with Liechi Berry Talonflame, as the two weaken and potentially KO each other's checks with their respective coverage moves. Latios is a great partner for Salac Berry Talonflame, as Talonflame can remove Tyranitar and Heatran which trouble Latios, while Latios can handle Rotom-W and Quagsire relatively well.

Other Options
########

A set with Brave Bird, Roost, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp can be used, which allows Talonflame to stallbreak, revenge kill, and cripple some of its counters all in one set; however, it excels in none of those roles and loses out on a lot of power, making revenge killing with Brave Bird much more difficult. Natural Gift with Salac or Liechi Berry can be used on the Swords Dance set; Salac Berry gives Talonflame a 100 Base Power Fighting move, which it can use to get past Tyranitar and Heatran, while Liechi Berry gives it a 100 Base Power Grass move, which it can use to get past Rotom-W and Tyranitar. Finally, a mixed set with max Special Attack, Fire Blast, and Hidden Power Ice or Ground can be used, allowing Talonflame to get past some of its usual checks and counters such as Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Heatran, and to avoid recoil when using its Fire-type STAB.

Checks & Counters
########

- **Physically Defensive Pokemon**: One of the best ways to deal with Talonflame is through sheer physical bulk, as Talonflame is not very powerful. Physically defensive Gyarados, Slowbro, Zygarde, Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Gliscor, Mandibuzz, Vaporeon, and Krookodile all have excellent physical bulk and are neutral to Talonflame's STABs, and thus can wall it, while slowly wearing it down with its own recoil (and sandstorm in Hippowdon's case). Rock Slide Hippowdon, Gyarados, and Landorus-T can even OHKO it. Keep in mind that any of those Pokemon that can't immediately threaten Talonflame will lose to the Bulk Up set with Taunt, and some of them are heavily crippled by Will-O-Wisp, a common move on the Bulk Up set. Basically, any physical attackers or Pokemon that lack reliable recovery are very prone to getting worn down if Talonflame has Will-O-Wisp. Also, U-turn is another thing to keep in mind, as it can wear down many of those Pokemon, especially those weak to it or lacking recovery, particularly when combined with Stealth Rock damage.

- **Pokemon that resist Talonflame's STABs**: Almost every Pokemon that resists Talonflame's STABs and has passable physical bulk is at least a good check to it, with the exception of Thundurus, which can't switch into Talonflame at all but can revenge kill it, as it can take even one Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird after Stealth Rock damage and OHKO back. Notable such Pokemon are Tyranitar, Rotom-W, Heatran, Rotom-H, Zapdos, and Mega Aerodactyl, with Rotom-W and specially defensive Heatran straight up countering most of Talonflame's sets. However, Heatran loses to the Bulk up set with Taunt and might fail to beat the Swords Dance set too, but it can carry a Rock-type move to beat those sets. Also, while Zapdos doesn't resist Talonflame's Fire-type STAB, it can still avoid the 2HKO from it without Stealth Rock up as long as Talonflame isn't holding a Choice Band, thanks to its good bulk, so it makes for a good check as long as Stealth Rock is off the field. Out of all the Tyranitar sets, only the tank set can repeatedly switch into Talonflame, as all other variants are worn down very fast by U-turn, and if it lacks a Rock-type attack it loses to the Bulk Up set, while getting crippled heavily by Will-O-Wisp. Keep in mind that even though Choice Band Tyranitar can't switch into Talonflame easily for fear of U-turn, it can easily Pursuit trap it after Talonflame KOes something with Brave Bird or Flare Blitz. In general, any Pokemon that is weak to U-turn or lacks reliable recovery might fail to deal with Talonflame after repeated U-turn hits, and any physical attacker is heavily crippled by Will-O-Wisp.

- **Passive Damage**: Stealth Rock is Talonflame's biggest enemy. As long as you can keep Stealth Rock on the field, you can keep Talonflame in check. Additionally, because both of Talonflame's STABs induce recoil, another way to handle Talonflame is to force it to KO or substantially weaken itself. The best way to do this is with Rocky Helmet Garchomp, which given its high HP stat, Rough Skin, and Rocky Helmet causes Talonflame to take tons of recoil. The fact that Garchomp has enough bulk to take a couple of hits from Talonflame helps too. Ferrothorn, especially with Rocky Helmet, is another Pokemon that can almost KO Talonflame through passive damage alone, though it must sacrifice itself to do so.
