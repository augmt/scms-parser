Overview
########
From being a lead to wallbreaking and stallbreaking, Infernape is a versatile monkey that is able to perform a good amount of roles effectively against any kind of playstyle, while pairing well with many late game cleaners. However, each set has competition that really holds it back from being a major threat. The Endeavor set has competition as a suicide lead with Azelf and Terrakion, which are able to completely grab momentum for their team in the early game. The mixed set has a lot of competition with Landorus, Keldeo, and Mega Heracross, which also wallbreak but oftentimes more efficiently, while the stallbreaking set can sometimes be better replaced with Mew, which has much better bulk and access to Defog. That being said, Infernape manages to distinctively hold a strong niche with each set. The Endeavor set can provide more pressure later on in the game and even act as an effective way to hamper almost any sweeper, while the mixed set can use its good coverage to lure a great amount of switch-ins and gain good offensive momentum. Finally, the stallbreaking set can handle Bisharp, Mega Scizor, and Heatran much better than Mew can.

Endeavor
########
name: Endeavor
move 1: Endeavor
move 2: Overheat
move 3: Stealth Rock
move 4: Close Combat / Taunt
ability: Blaze
item: Focus Sash
evs: 168 Atk / 88 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive

Moves
========
Thanks to Focus Sash, Endeavor reliably brings an opposing Pokemon down to 1 HP. Overheat is a good STAB move that hits a lot of Pokemon neutrally. Stealth Rock is mandatory support for almost every team and makes Infernape an effective lead. Close Combat is also a good move that is boosted by STAB and provides Infernape with more coverage, while Taunt lets it stop opposing leads from using Stealth Rock.

Set Details
========
252 Speed EVs with a Naive nature maximizes Infernape's Speed, which is useful for speed tying with Keldeo and Terrakion, and lets it outspeed Pokemon such as Manectric before it Mega Evolves. Focus Sash is mandatory because it allows Infernape to reliably use Endeavor at 1 HP and severely weaken any non-Ghost type Pokemon. Blaze-boosted Overheat does a plethora of damage to most offensive Pokemon. 168 Attack EVs allow Close Combat to KO notable Pokemon such as Heatran and Chansey, the former always being OHKOed after Stealth Rocks, and cleanly 2HKOing the latter. However, if Taunt is preferred over Close Combat, move the Attack EVs to Special Attack.

Usage Tips
========
Oftentimes, using this set as a lead is the best way to use it, even moreso if your team lacks a reliable Defogger or Rapid Spinner to keep Infernape's Focus Sash intact. However, you can also use Infernape's STAB Overheat as a way to stop sweepers such as Mega Pinsir or to easily revenge kill sweepers such as Agility Mega Ampharos. Furthermore, Infernape can psuedo-wallbreak by using Endeavor on a wall such as Mega Venusaur to bring it down to 1 HP and effectively make it useless.

Team Options
========
Offensive Defoggers and Rapid Spinners, such as Latios and Excadrill, respectively, can help preserve Infernape until mid game. Pokemon with similar checks to Infernape, such as Mega Tyranitar and Keldeo, are also nice as Infernape can lure said checks out and proceed to cripple them with Endeavor. A Pokemon that commonly runs Stealth Rock, such as Garchomp, is highly recommended to further increase the unpredictability factor.


MixApe
########
name: MixApe
move 1: Fire Blast / Flare Blitz
move 2: Close Combat
move 3: Mach Punch
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Thunder Punch / Grass Knot
ability: Iron Fist
item: Life Orb
evs: 168 Atk / 88 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive

Moves
========
Close Combat is mandatory, as it is Infernape's strongest Fighting STAB move and allows it to hit Pokemon that are hit neutrally for some solid damage. Fire Blast is preferred as the Fire-type STAB move to hit physically defensive Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Gliscor for solid damage. Flare Blitz hits harder in general and lets Infernape 2HKO Stealth Rock Clefable, a common pivot on many teams, but it really makes Infernape vulnerable to passive damage; it also leaves Infernape walled by the aforementioned threats, making Infernape need Hidden Power Ice to compensate. Mach Punch is extremely useful for revenge killing threats such as +1 Mega Gyarados, +1 Mega Tyranitar, Greninja, and Bisharp, as well as letting Infernape avoid a potential Speed tie with Terrakion and other base 108 Speed Pokemon. Hidden Power Ice can be used as the final move for hitting Landorus-T, Garchomp, Dragonite, and specially defensive Gliscor. Thunder Punch lets Infernape handle many otherwise hard checks on the switch-in, such as Talonflame, Azumarill, Gyarados, and Mega Charizard Y. However, Stone Edge is a nice replacement because it allows Infernape to also hit Mega Charizard X hard while also being able to 2HKO Latios and Latias. Finally, Grass Knot is a solid option, as it allows Infernape to hit three usually solid checks, OHKOing Quagsire as well as 2HKOing Slowbro and specially defensive Hippowdon.

Set Details
========
168 Attack EVs ensure Close Combat is a guaranteed OHKO on Heatran and 2HKOes Rotom-W after Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Ice OHKOes physically defensive Gliscor, Landorus, and Dragonite after Stealth Rock. Even if you decide not to go with Hidden Power Ice, 88 Special Attack EVs also allow Infernape to 2HKO physically defensive Gliscor and Landorus with Fire Blast. This allows Infernape to run Grass Knot or Thunder Punch, making it harder to wall and giving it more utility. Maximum Speed investment is extremely useful in order to tie with other base 108 Speed Pokemon such as Keldeo and to outspeed Pokemon such as Manectric before it Mega Evolves. An alternative option is to run 208 Speed EVs; while missing out on Speed ties with Keldeo and Terrakion, as well as being slower than Manectric, Infernape still outspeeds Garchomp. This allows Infernape to run 132 Special Attack EVs, which allows it to 2HKO physically defensive Clefable and do considerably more damage to Slowbro and Alomomola. Iron Fist is used because it is far more consistent than Blaze, as it always boosts the power of Mach Punch as well as Thunder Punch, if you decide to run it.

Usage Tips
========
Infernape is a mixed wallbreaker rather than a sweeper, so you shouldn't despair when Infernape faints, as it has probably paved the road for your team's sweepers. Infernape's strong STAB moves allow it to break through many walls that are common on stall, such as Chansey, Heatran, Duoblade, and Skarmory. This, combined with Infernape's nice coverage and Speed, allows it to threaten and KO the majority of Pokemon on the switch-in. However, when using Infernape, you need to make sure that you aren't too reckless, as it is easily worn down by Life Orb recoil as well as entry hazards and occasionally sand, especially if you choose to use Flare Blitz. Having a Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch greatly complements Infernape's ability to wallbreak by allowing you to safely switch it in.

Team Options
========
Latios and Latias are some of the best partners for Infernape because they greatly appreciate Infernape's ability to beat Chansey, Heatran, Skarmory, Mega Scizor, Tyranitar, and Bisharp, while making it incredibly hard for many of Infernape's common switch-ins to not take a heavy beating from a Draco Meteor or Psyshock. Offensive Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Azumarill are great options because they check many Pokemon Infernape doesn't like such as Latios, Latias, Clefable, and Keldeo. They also appreciate Infernape's ability to switch in on Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn; Mega Gardevoir especially appreciates Infernape dealing with Heatran and Jirachi, which pose huge threats otherwise. Rotom-W and Mega Manectric are also good options, dealing with bulky Water-types and Flying-types that Infernape might struggle with, such as Slowbro and Talonflame, while providing nice momentum and safely switching Infernape in via Volt Switch. Mega Scizor is also really nice to have because it can abuse switch-ins to Infernape, such as Azumarill or Latios by setting up and posing a huge threat. Finally, Mega Charizard Y appreciates Infernape's ability to beat Bisharp, while Infernape Charizard's sun boosting its Fire STAB.


Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Close Combat
move 2: Will-O-Wisp
move 3: Slack Off
move 4: Taunt
ability: Blaze
item: Leftovers
evs: 212 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def / 40 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========
Will-O-Wisp lets Infernape burn Pokemon such as Bisharp, Mega Scizor, Mega Gyarados, and Azumarill, crippling them. Close Combat is a useful STAB move that allows Infernape to beat Heatran. Slack Off is used for longevity, while Taunt prevents Pokemon such as Mew and Mega Venusaur to use status moves or recover HP.

Set Details
========
Maximum Defense EVs and an Impish nature let Infernape wall Bisharp and Mega Scizor. 212 HP EVs maximize recovery from Leftovers and also allow Infernape to take an Aqua Jet from an Assault Vest Azumarill, allowing Infernape to burn it and severely cripple it for the rest of the match. The remaining 40 Speed EVs let it outspeed Adamant Gyarados.

Usage Tips
========
Send out Infernape on utility Pokemon such as Mew so it can Taunt them and make them unable to do anything, or on Pokemon that can't really hurt Infernape, such as Heatran without Earth Power, Bisharp, and Mega Scizor. Try to use Infernape to lure out threats such as Azumarill or Mega Gyarados and massively lower their effectiveness by burning them.

Team Options
========
Pokemon weak to Bisharp and Mega Scizor such as Latios, Latias, and Jirachi, will appreciate Infernape's ability to switch into those Pokemon and knock them out. Infernape itself appreciates having partners that can to handle bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, because this set has no way to reliably handle these Pokemon. Pokemon such as Swords Dance Mega Scizor and Dragonite that don't appreciate Steel-types such as Magnezone and Heatran stopping them from sweeping teams appreciate Infernape defeating them.


Other Options
########
Infernape can run a Choice Band set with sun support, as it hits very hard with Flare Blitz and also has a very powerful Close Combat for Pokemon that resist Fire-type moves. However, this set will take massive recoil thanks to the damage Flare Blitz dishes out. Infernape also appreciates being able to switch moves, because otherwise a plethora of Pokemon check it fairly easily.

A Nasty Plot set with Close Combat is also an option because it cleanly 2HKOes many otherwise huge threats to special sweepers, such as Chansey and Heatran, while still having Fire Blast and a coverage move of choice. However, Infernape is frail and will get shut down by most revenge killers, often making setting up meaningless.

Checks & Counters
########
**Revenge Killers**: Due to Infernape's sheer frailty, anything that's faster than it will probably KO it, especially if it has super effective priority. If Infernape cannot KO the opposing Pokemon with Mach Punch, you must switch to prevent Infernape from being knocked out. Even with the Endeavor set, Infernape still has troubles with Pokemon like Azumarill and Talonflame, as those Pokemon can avoid taking maximum damage from Endeavor.

**Slowbro and Hippowdon**: Unless Infernape is running Grass Knot, Slowbro and Hippowdon have no trouble switching in on it, as they can abuse their abilities to take out even Endeavor Infernape while remaining healthy themselves.
