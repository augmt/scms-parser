Overview
########

With a rare resistance to the potent EdgeQuake combination; astronomical physical bulk; a wide array of utility moves such as Taunt, Leech Seed, Roar, Spikes, and Spiky Shield; and a solid STAB move in Hammer Arm, Chesnaught is quite the bomb. Speaking of bombs, Chesnaught's nifty ability Bulletproof makes it immune to some bomb- and ball-based attacks, such as Shadow Ball, Sludge Bomb, and Focus Blast. It is also one of the most reliable defensive Spikers in the tier, allowing defensive teams to rack up passive damage incredibly fast. Thanks to its unique typing and physical bulk, Chesnaught also counters some very potent threats in the tier, such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar. Chesnaught's great physical bulk, typing, movepool, and ability make it a huge stop to numerous threatening Pokemon in the tier.

However, Chesnaught's poor special bulk is exploited by weaknesses to common types of moves that often come from special attackers, such as Fire, Ice, Fairy, Psychic, and Poison. It also has a crippling weakness to Flying-types, and because Hammer Arm is usually its only attack, it often offers a free switch-in to big threats such as Mega Pinsir and Talonflame. Chesnaught is also rather slow, hitting an unimpressive base 64 Speed; it is thus pretty much shut down by fast Pokemon with Taunt that don't mind Fighting-type moves, such as Gengar or Thundurus. However, despite its shortcomings and numerous weaknesses, Chesnaught's physical bulk, typing, and movepool make it a great choice for balanced and stall teams alike.

Moves
========

Spiky Shield is very similar to Protect; however, if the opponent uses a move that makes contact on the turn Chesnaught uses Spiky Shield, the opponent will take some passive damage (12%). Spiky Shield can be very useful for scouting and stalling for extra Leftovers or Leech Seed recovery. Leech Seed inflicts passive damage and offers some extra healing to Chesnaught while encouraging switches, which creates free turns. Hammer Arm is a reliable attacking option, dealing with notable threats such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn. The last moveslot is a toss-up between Spikes and Wood Hammer; Spikes is useful for both defensive and offensive teams, while Wood Hammer is an alternative that acts as a stronger secondary STAB attack, though the recoil often makes this option undesirable, and Grass has terrible offensive coverage. Taunt can be used to help keep status away from Chesnaught while also preventing sweepers from setting up, but Chesnaught lacks the Speed to utilize it effectively. Roar is an option to prevent setup and rack up extra entry hazard damage. Synthesis is a great choice if you want reliable recovery, especially since rain is relatively rare, and Chesnaught beats both of the sand summoners, Hippowdon and Tyranitar.

Set Details
========

Full investment in HP and Defense along with an Impish nature is used to maximize physical bulk. Leftovers is necessary as Chesnaught does not usually run Synthesis, but if Synthesis is used, Rocky Helmet is an alternative to further punish users of contact moves. Bulletproof makes Chesnaught immune to moves such as Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb, moves that it would otherwise take heavy damage from, and this ability should always be used instead of Overgrow for this reason.

Usage Tips
========

Using Leech Seed often is the best way for Chesnaught to play. Passive damage on the opponent and extra healing for Chesnaught while forcing switches is just amazing. It's recommended to set Leech Seed up on every foe you possibly can. If Chesnaught uses Leech Seed on a Pokemon that cannot hurt it very much, it is likely that the Pokemon will switch out, and this forced switch should be capitalized on by by setting up Leech Seed or laying Spikes against the switch-in, rather than using Spiky Shield. That said, Spiky Shield is still a great move that is ideal to use against Pokemon that commonly run Choice items, such as Keldeo, to scout moves and appropriately respond. Spikes should be set mainly on switches that Chesnaught forces with its sheer bulk, but try not to waste time setting them when the opponent can get rid of them. Instead, take advantage of these switches by using Leech Seed once more. Likewise, try not to Defog your own hazards, and use a spinner instead. Roar is also a good move to use when you predict a switch, but it's better to use it only when you have entry hazards up or when a boosted Pokemon threatens your team. When facing a boosted enemy that Chesnaught can significantly damage, such as Bisharp, don't waste your time with Leech Seed or Spikes taking unnecessary damage; just go for the KO with Hammer Arm. Chesnaught hates status, so try to keep it free of these afflictions; Taunt can help it in this regard.

Team Options
========

Chansey takes powerful special attacks, absorbs and removes status, and can pass Wishes, making it one of Chesnaught's best partners. In return, Chesnaught can take on many Steel-types that threaten Chansey, such as Bisharp, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn. Heatran and Chesnaught resist every one of each other's weaknesses except Fighting, and they also form a core that sets hazards, and benefits greatly from Leech Seed, making them excellent partners for each other. Rotom-H is another Pokemon that boasts similar synergy with Chesnaught, only missing out on resistances to Poison- and Psychic-type moves, both of which do not have great offensive coverage. Slowbro and Chesnaught form a solid defensive core together; Slowbro sponges Fire-, Psychic-, and  Ice-type moves, while Chesnaught shrugs off Dark- and Electric-type moves. Together, they strongly check Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Charizard X, all of which are extremely powerful and popular Mega Pokemon. Zapdos covers Chesnaught's greatest weakness, Flying, and can also beat Azumarill for Chesnaught with Thunderbolt.

Other Options
========

Chesnaught can opt for a Bulk Up set, but with its subpar Special Defense and numerous weaknesses, it is not an ideal user of the move. Belly Drum can be used for a massive boost in Attack, but Chesnaught lacks the Speed or powerful priority to effectively use it. Seed Bomb can be used over Wood Hammer if the recoil is undesirable. Poison Jab can be used to hit Fairy-types such as Sylveon, and Stone Edge hits common Fire- and Flying-type switch-ins such as Talonflame and Charizard, but the former lacks great coverage and the latter lacks reliability, while both are rather weak outside of hitting their targets. Substitute is an option to ease prediction and give Chesnaught a layer of protection against status and strong moves. This can work well in conjunction with Leech Seed and Spiky Shield against foes such as Talonflame: Chesnaught can simply alternate between Leech Seed and Spiky Shield to rack up significant passive damage. However, Chesnaught is too slow to utilize it very effectively, and the loss of health from Substitute can be detrimental to a Pokemon with no recovery. Furthermore, powerful sound-based moves such as Boomburst, Pixilate Hyper Voice, and Bug Buzz nail Chesnaught through Substitute. Pain Split can be used for semi-reliable recovery, especially in the sand, and can weaken healthy switch-ins. Toxic cripples common switch-ins such as Latias, Volcarona, bulky Talonflame, and Unaware Clefable.

Checks and Counters
========

**Flying-types**: Flying-type attacks easily take out Chesnaught. Talonflame and Mega Pinsir in particular only fear the rare Stone Edge and threaten to either set up on Chesnaught or OHKO it with their STAB moves.

**Taunt**: Any Pokemon with Taunt that resists Fighting-type moves, such as Thundurus and Mega Gardevoir, can easily take on Chesnaught.

**Fire-types**: Fire-type attackers, mostly specially inclined ones, such as Mega Charizard Y, roast Chesnaught with their powerful STAB attacks. Heatran has trouble switching in, and Spiky Shield, Toxic, and Stone Edge can annoy Talonflame, but both beat Chesnaught as well.

**Special Attackers**: Powerful special attackers, such as Landorus, Thundurus, and Latios, can heavily damage Chesnaught with their STAB or coverage moves.

**Entry Hazards**: Even though Chesnaught resists Stealth Rock, the passive damage from Spikes and Toxic Spikes cripple Chesnaught, especially when it doesn't run Synthesis.

**Magic Guard**: Magic Guard users, such as Reuniclus and Clefable, are immune to Leech Seed and can thus freely set up on Chesnaught.

**Fairy-types**: Sylveon, Clefable, and Mega Gardevoir can switch in easily on Hammer Arm, only fearing the rare Poison Jab, and can 2HKO or OHKO Chesnaught with STAB Fairy-type moves, although Mega Gardevoir must watch out for Wood Hammer.
