Overview
########

Entei received a massive buff to its movepool with the transition to XY: Sacred Fire. A move commonly used to define Ho-Oh, Entei makes great use of this move due to its ability to burn common switch-ins such as Garchomp and Azumarill, usually crippling them for the rest of the match. Entei's access to Extreme Speed also allows it to be a powerful revenge killer and provides it a way to get past weakened checks such as Latios. The buff to Defog and a new resistance to Fairy-type moves also make Entei's life much easier. Despite these positive traits, Entei suffers from being walled by Rotom-W, a very common Pokemon in OU. Entei also has to rely on mediocre coverage options such as Bulldoze, which means that it will often be setup bait for dangerous sweepers such as Mega Pinsir and Manaphy if a Choice Band is used. Entei's weaknesses to common Ground-, Rock-, and Water-type moves also make it vulnerable to threats such as Keldeo. Even with the Defog buff, Entei is still weak to entry hazards, meaning that it can be worn down rather quickly. Remember to use Entei to its advantages, so it can be a powerful player on the battlefield.

Moves
========

Sacred Fire is the main attack of the set; it has great power, can force switches, and burn common switch-ins such as Dragonite, Terrakion, Garchomp, and Tyranitar. Extreme Speed is another excellent move to use as it packs priority to combat checks and can outpace other priority moves such as Talonflame's Brave Bird. Finally, Stone Edge lets Entei deal decent damage to Rotom-W on the switch and demolish all the Fire-types which can easily tank a Sacred Fire bar Heatran. While Entei has great coverage with these three moves, it is still walled by Heatran; which is where Bulldoze comes in to OHKO it. However, beware of using Bulldoze, as being locked into it makes Entei setup bait for powerful sweepers such as Dragonite. Entei can use two interesting alternative moves: Hidden Power Grass and Howl. The former allows Entei to 2HKO Quagsire, which takes little damage from its other moves, but it has limited use outside of that. Howl, however, gives Entei sweeping capabilities, but it's inferior to Swords Dance Lucario as a sweeper, as Lucario also has Extreme Speed, but isn't walled as easily due to its better coverage.

Set Details
========

A Choice Band is the preferred item, as it gives Sacred Fire the raw power it needs to deal massive damage to the opposition. An Adamant nature should be used as any other nature is illegal with Extreme Speed, which is a mandatory move on Entei. A Life Orb can be used to switch between moves, but the recoil and the fact that Entei is using Sacred Fire most of the time makes it unappealing. However, with the ability to switch moves, Entei can avoid the need to predict and prevent itself from being setup bait. It also has the niche of beating Talonflame and Latios with a combination of Sacred Fire and Extreme Speed assuming they switch into Entei. Charcoal can also be used to feign Choice Band and boost the power of Sacred Fire without draining health like Life Orb does, although Entei will greatly miss a powered-up Extreme Speed and Stone Edge.

Usage Tips
========

Clicking the 'Sacred Fire' button is the key to using Entei to its maximum potential. Sacred Fire is an amazing move, and whenever Entei gets a chance, it should use it to spread burns and deal massive damage to the opponent. Once everything is weakened late-game, Entei can sit back and use Extreme Speed to clean up the foe's team. Spreading burns is an important objective for Entei, but using Sacred Fire as a pseudo Will-O-Wisp can lead to Entei being KOed early game. In other words, don't use Sacred Fire deliberately against checks and counters hoping for a burn, as the burn chance is not guaranteed. Entei should also play as a hit-and-run attacker if using a Choice Band as Sacred Fire and its coverage moves will force it out easily after a powerful attack. Entei should use its coverage moves only when needed as they often make it setup bait for dangerous sweepers.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can set up multiple entry hazards, such as Skarmory, are amazing partners for Entei. For example, with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, Sacred Fire 2HKOes Hippowdon, making it a bad switch-in. Entei also forces out a large amount of Pokemon, so the damage from the combination of Sacred Fire, entry hazards, and possible burn and/or sand damage will stack up very quickly.

Because Entei is weak to entry hazards, a spinner such as Excadrill is highly recommended so Entei can tank hits with its great bulk throughout the match. A Defogger can be used if your team doesn't have a entry hazard setter. A perfect example of this is Latios as it can come in on Water- and Ground-type moves aimed at Entei and proceed to annihilate Rotom-W and Heatran with Draco Meteor and Earthquake respectively, so Entei can spam Sacred Fire with greater ease.

Mega Charizard Y is also one of Entei's best teammates. With sun support on its side, Sacred Fire will 2HKO almost everything in the metagame bar immunities, and sun also softens Water-type moves from Entei's common checks such as Azumarill. In addition to that, Entei can clean up the mess that Mega Charizard Y leaves late-game with its powerful Extreme Speed. Pairing Entei with setup sweepers that have similar counters such as Mega Pinsir is highly recommended. In the provided example, Entei lures in Rotom-W and deals out a heavy amount of damage to it so Mega Pinsir can muscle its way past it later with Return.

Other Options
########

Due to Entei's horrid movepool, it has limited options. Substitute can be used, but Entei is a sitting duck behind it due to its poor coverage. Entei can use Hidden Power Ice with a Life Orb to lure in and KO Gliscor, but it suffers from four-moveslot syndrome and doesn't like forgoing its primary coverage options. Entei can viably use an Assault Vest, allowing it to combat powerful specially-based wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y. However, its damage output is rather poor, and it is also worn down very quickly. Leftovers is a nice item for extending Entei's longevity, but it still has issues regarding power.

Checks and Counters
########

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types can tank Sacred Fire with relative ease. Rotom-W and Suicune are perfect examples of this. The latter can even set up Calm Minds while draining Sacred Fire's PP with Pressure.

**Gliscor**: Gliscor can recover any damage taken with Poison Heal and can deal a massive amount damage to Entei with Earthquake. However, it cannot switch in without activating its Toxic Orb first, as Sacred Fire can burn as well as deal huge damage to it.

**Fast Ground-types**: Fast Ground-types such as Garchomp can easily force Entei out; however, they cannot switch into Dragonite directly due to the threat of being burned.

**Heatran**: Heatran is immune to Sacred Fire and can threaten Entei back with Earth Power or Toxic. However, it needs to be careful, as Bulldoze can OHKO it, and Heatran fails to beat Life Orb sets. Air Balloon Heatran, however, is very good at handling Entei, as it's immune to Bulldoze and resists all of Entei's other moves apart from Stone Edge.
