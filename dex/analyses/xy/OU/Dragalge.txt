Overview
########

With its new ability, Adaptability, which multiplies its STAB moves' power by 2 instead of 1.5, Dragalge has finally found a niche in OU as a fearsome wallbreaker. Whereas other Dragon-types wallbreakers are easily checked by the vast assortment of viable Fairy-types in OU, Dragalge scoffs at almost all of them, thanks to both being neutral to their STAB moves and annihilating them with its STAB Sludge Wave. While attempts to make defensive sets viable in XY failed, remnants of these attempts can be seen in Dragalge's current playstyle. Dragalge abuses its bulk and typing to switch in on common threats in OU, such as Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, and Thundurus, and destroy practically anything that dares switch in. Other wallbreakers, such as Crawdaunt, lack this defensive utility. Despite its uniqueness and sheer power, Dragalge is not the most threatening Pokemon in OU. Thanks to its low Speed, exploitable typing, and reliance on a move that halves its Special Attack, Dragalge can easily be both revenge killed and made setup bait. But, if you'd enjoy watching "naturally bulky" Pokemon such as Mew, Keldeo, and Zapdos going down with ong neutral Draco Meteor, Dragalge is for you.

move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Sludge Wave
move 3: Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Scald / Focus Blast
ability: Adaptability
item: Choice Specs
evs: 200 HP / 252 SpA / 56 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is the move Dragalge will be using the vast majority of the time. Thanks to its massive 130 Base Power, Adaptability boost, and Choice Specs boost, it's able to do a massive amount of damage to anything but Fairies, Chansey, or Blissey. It's able to OHKO frailer Steel-types such as Bisharp as well as 252 / 0 Mew after Stealth Rock damage. Fairy-types, the absolute best switch-ins to Draco Meteor, are, barring Klefki, annihilated by Dragalge's secondary STAB move, Sludge Wave, which also packs a handy 10% chance to poison its targets. Sludge Wave also gives Dragalge a much more reliable STAB move with which it can hit both Grass-types and neutral targets hard without having to suffer from Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop. Hidden Power Fire is an excellent choice for hitting many of the Steel-types that wall Dragalge's STAB move, such as Ferrothorn and Scizor. The last moveslot is dedicated to hitting Heatran, which walls this set otherwise. Scald is an overall nice move that hits Heatran super effectively and can also burn any potential switch-in that isn't a Fire-type. However, despite its excellent side effect and accuracy, it has a chance not to 2HKO specially defensive Heatran, and it can never OHKO Choice Scarf Heatran. If these two conditions are necessary for your team, you can trade Scald for Focus Blast.

Set Details
========

In order to outspeed Azumarill, which otherwise could OHKO Dragalge with a Choice Band-boosted Play Rough, it's recommended for Dragalge to run 56 Speed EVs. Because Dragalge is a specially based wallbreaker, its Special Attack is maxed out. Dragalge enjoys having mixed bulk, so the remaining 200 EVs are thrown into HP. Likewise, Choice Specs is the recommended item for the set, as it's capable of boosting all of Dragalge's moves to their highest possible power.

Usage Tips
========

Dragalge has excellent special bulk, respectable physical bulk, and a unique defensive typing; exploit all of these characteristics! Dragalge can easily pivot into many threatening Pokemon in OU, including Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, Rotom-W, Mega Manectric, Raikou, Clefable, and Thundurus; tank a hit; and proceed to fire off a ridiculously powerful move on whatever decides to switch in. The majority of the time, the only button you'll be clicking is Draco Meteor, but if the opponent has bulky Steel-types and/or Fairy-types, some more prediction will be necessary. Don't be too shy about using Sludge Wave; despite the power decrease between it and Draco Meteor, it still can accomplish absurd feats such as OHKOing Keldeo after factoring in Stealth Rock damage.

Team Options
========

Despite Dragalge's access to Focus Blast, Hidden Power Fire, and Scald, it is still going to have immense troubles with Steel-types; if you're worried more about these defensive Steel-types, such as Jirachi, Klefki, and Heatran, Dugtrio and Magnezone make excellent partners, as they are capable of trapping and KOing them. Dragalge's low Speed and four common weaknesses also leave it prone to being revenge killed. For instance, Psychic-types, such as Mega Gardevoir and Latios, can easily KO Dragalge after Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop. A Pursuit trapper, such as Tyranitar, is thus a useful teammates for Dragalge to eliminate them. Mega Metagross also makes a great teammate because of its ability to check both Mega Gardevoir and Latios. Dragalge is prone to being revenge killed by Excadrill, and to remedy this weakness, Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Celebi can serve as great teammates.

Trick Room staples such as Bronzong, Cresselia, Porygon2, and Crawdaunt can make pretty good teammates as well, as Dragalge's terrible Speed stat, while normally a huge flaw, actually can allow it to sweep under Trick Room. Defensive cores are also plausible, as Dragalge, despite being only viable for its immense power, actually has good bulk and a great typing. Skarmory resists all of Dragalge's weaknesses except Ice, while Dragalge resists both Skarmory's weaknesses. Needless to say, these two work really well together, with Dragalge able to deal out serious damage and act as a generic check to special attackers and Skarmory as a physical wall capable of setting and removing entry hazards. Unaware Clefable also can make a good teammate, as it can heal off any damage Dragalge might take with Wish. It also can serve as a lure for Poison-type moves, which gives Dragalge opportunities to switch in, and heal off any burns Dragalge might have taken with Heal Bell. Mega Gyarados also can make a good teammate; Dragalge can KO Keldeo, Dragon-types, Azumarill, Chesnaught, and Ferrothorn for Mega Gyarados, while Gyarados can set up on Ground-types and Heatran, both of which give Dragalge trouble. Mega Diancie also makes a good teammate, as it and Dragalge have a lot of checks in common, and therefore can break down the other Pokemon's answers. Dragalge baits in and wears down Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, which opens up the opportunity to sweep for Diancie. In turn, Diancie can take on Jirachi and Heatran better than Dragalge can thanks to its access to Earth Power.

Other Options
########

Hydro Pump is an alternative for the fourth slot on the main set. Basically, it does more damage to specially defensive Heatran than Scald does while having better accuracy than Focus Blast. Sludge Bomb is possibility over Sludge Wave; it trades 5 Base Power and the ability to hit Chesnaught for a 20% increase in the chance to poison. Assault Vest gives Dragalge massive special bulk while still allowing it to hit hard with its STAB moves. Dragon Fang is also a viable item if you don't particularly care about Dragalge's defenses but don't want to be locked into one move. This prevents Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, which is easily 2HKOed even after Draco Meteor's stat drops, from using Dragalge as setup bait. Toxic Spikes is an interesting move on Dragalge that poisons any grounded Pokemon that isn't a Steel-type or Poison-type. However, Dragalge's main checks and counters are Steel-types, so the move isn't as useful. If using Toxic Spikes, Dragon Tail is a possibility to help spread poison on all of the opposing team's Pokemon. If running a set like this, Black Sludge would be the recommended item to give Dragalge passive recovery, and Poison Touch would be a viable ability, as it gives Dragon Tail a chance to poison Pokemon that aren't grounded, which otherwise can bypass Toxic Spikes' poison chance.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Steel-Types**: Steel-types resist Dragon-type moves and are immune to Poison-type moves, so naturally they make the best checks and counters to Dragalge. Klefki is immune to both of Dragalge's STAB types, takes half of its health at most from a Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Fire, and can use Dragalge for Spikes setup. Jirachi takes little from any of Dragalge's attacks, can use Wish to heal off any damage taken, and can threaten with its STAB super effective Zen Headbutt. Mega Metagross can tank any hit and can threaten Dragalge out with a STAB Tough Claws-boosted Zen Headbutt. Metagross must, however, be wary of Scald burns. Doublade takes up to half health from a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor, so it needs Rest in order to be a consistent counter. Specially defensive Heatran can easily switch in on Dragalge's STAB moves. Mega Scizor can switch in on any move except for Hidden Power Fire and Roost off the damage. It must, however, be wary of Scald burns.

**Chansey and Blissey**: Blissey and Chansey avoid the 2HKO from a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor, so both can switch in and subsequently force Dragalge out.

**Revenge Killers**: Dragalge is very slow and has four common weaknesses, so it is very prone to being revenge killed. Latios and Latias can easily revenge kill Dragalge with Draco Meteor or Psyshock. Mega Charizard X can also revenge kill with its Dragon Claw or Outrage, as can Garchomp with either Earthquake, Outrage, or Dragon Claw. Excadrill can easily revenge kill with Earthquake, and Mega Metagross and Mega Gallade can easily revenge kill with Zen Headbutt. Do note that none of these Pokemon should attempt switching in on Dragalge unless they feel like being OHKOed.
