Overview
########

Previously doomed to obscurity, Metagross was gifted a Mega Evolution in ORAS that turned it into a top-tier threat. Tough Claws coupled with contact moves like Meteor Mash, Zen Headbutt, Hammer Arm, and Ice Punch makes Mega Metagross hit insanely hard and a serious offensive threat in the OU metagame. As if that weren't enough, Metagross has a great defensive Steel / Psychic typing and insane 80 / 150 / 110 bulk that allow it to act as a great check for top-tier threats such as Latios, Latias, Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Keldeo. On top of all this, Mega Metagross has a solid base 110 Speed stat that puts it above the majority of the unboosted tier. Additionally, Mega Metagross has access to Rock Polish, which turns it from a powerful wallbreaker into a devastating late-game cleaner once its checks have been removed from play. However, Metagross has a mediocre base Speed before Mega Evolving and weaknesses to common Dark-, Fire-, and Ground-type attacks. Additionally, Mega Metagross is often pressed for moveslots, meaning that it will always be walled by something.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Meteor Mash
move 2: Zen Headbutt
move 3: Bullet Punch / Grass Knot / Ice Punch
move 4: Hammer Arm / Earthquake
ability: Clear Body
item: Metagrossite
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========
Meteor Mash is Mega Metagross's main STAB move, sporting great power and hitting the Fairy-types Mega Metagross checks super effectively. Zen Headbutt is necessary to take on the Fighting- and Poison-types that Mega Metagross checks, while also scoring a crucial 2HKO against Rotom-W, which would otherwise wall Mega Metagross. The third slot is Metagross's most versatile, as it has many viable options to choose from. Bullet Punch is the most optimal move, as it has the most overall utility. It can be used to revenge kill faster threats, avoid Speed ties with opposing base 110 Speed Pokemon when they are weakened, and be used as a reliable STAB move when missing can cost you the game. Grass Knot is also a viable option, as it hits Slowbro, Quagsire, and Hippowdon super effectively, and scores a 2HKO at worst against them. Finally, Ice Punch can be used in this slot for Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, all of which Meteor Mash fails to deal with adequately in many scenarios. Additionally, it hits bulky Grass-types such as Celebi and Tangrowth harder than any other Move Metagross carries. In the last slot, Hammer Arm is given preference as it 2HKOes Ferrothorn and offensive Mega Scizor while also beating Skarmory that lack Counter one-on-one, as the Speed drop lets it hit Skarmory super effectively as it goes for Roost. However, Earthquake is a viable alternative if the Speed drop is unappealing and hitting Jirachi, Magnezone, Heatran, and opposing Metagross is necessary. Thunder Punch is also an option to hit certain bulky Water- and Steel-types for respectable damage, especially Skarmory, Slowbro, Gyarados, and Alomomola. Finally, Pursuit can be used to trap Latios and Latias while also getting chip damage against other targets such as Mega Gardevoir.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed investment is needed to hit as hard and fast as possible, while a Jolly nature is used to ensure a Speed tie against opposing base 110 Speed Pokemon. Clear Body prevents stat drops from Intimidate and Sticky Web. Alternatively, an Adamant nature can be used with HP investment to better act as an offensive tank, as such a set is both more powerful and more durable than the Jolly set. The best EV spread to use is 68 HP / 252 Atk / 188 Spe, which outspeeds everything up to Jolly Excadrill. Additionally, the increase in power from using an Adamant nature is incredible. For example, Mega Metagross achieves a guaranteed 2HKO against physically defensive Mega Sableye, which is an otherwise very solid check to Mega Metagross, as well as a general increase in power.

Usage Tips
========

This set is best used as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker that is capable of reliably checking top-tier threats such as Latios, Latias, Mega Sceptile, Mega Venusaur, and assorted Fairy-types thanks to its great bulk and power. Remember that while Mega Metagross is bulky, it shouldn't always be used as a direct pivot into attacks because it lacks recovery options. Additionally, Mega Metagross can clean up weakened teams late-game if it opts to run Bullet Punch; Healing Wish support in this case is appreciated.

Team Options
========

Magnezone is a great partner for Mega Metagross, as it traps and KOes the Steel-types that ruin Mega Metagross's day while also beating Mandibuzz and the bulky Water-types that give it trouble. Landorus-T and Rotom-W also make for great teammates, as they can U-turn or Volt Switch it into favorable matchups and check Talonflame, which can outspeed Mega Metagross and deal massive damage to it with Flare Blitz. Keldeo is also a great partner thanks to excellent type synergy; it can check all of Bisharp, Mandibuzz and Mega Scizor, while Mega Metagross handles Fairy-types, Latios, Latias, and bulky Poison-types that give Keldeo trouble. Unaware Clefable also walls Calm Mind Mega Slowbro and Mega Sableye, two Pokemon that otherwise give Mega Metagross trouble. Swords Dance Gliscor with Baton Pass makes for a good partner, as it has good type synergy with Mega Metagross and can pass attack boosts to Mega Metagross, which makes it even harder to wall. Lastly, Mega Metagross appreciates entry hazard support to aid in breaking down defensive cores, so Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock such as Landorus-T and Garchomp make for great teammates. For example, Landorus-T can pivot into the Ground-type attacks that target Mega Metagross from the likes of Sand Rush Excadrill or opposing Landorus-T, while Garchomp is able to break down opposing physical walls such as Slowbro and Mega Sableye with a Lum Berry + Swords Dance set. Spikes users such as Chesnaught help as well.


Rock Polish
########
name: Rock Polish
move 1: Rock Polish
move 2: Meteor Mash / Iron Head
move 3: Zen Headbutt
move 4: Hammer Arm / Earthquake / Ice Punch
ability: Clear Body
item: Metagrossite
evs: 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Rock Polish doubles Mega Metagross's Speed, which allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and thus become a devastating late-game sweeper. Meteor Mash and Zen Headbutt are the obligatory STAB moves to make this possible, though Iron Head is an option if missing Meteor Mash poses a problem. Mega Metagross's best coverage move in this case is Hammer Arm, as it hits Dark- and Steel-types super effectively, specifically hitting Air Balloon Excadrill, Air Balloon Heatran and Mega Gyarados. The Speed drop can be an issue, however, so Earthquake can be used instead if Mega Charizard X and Heatran pose a threat. Ice Punch hits Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Dragon-types, which can otherwise tank a hit and hit Mega Metagross back hard for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

176 Speed EVs with an Adamant let Mega Metagross outpace neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon unboosted and outspeed everything up to Adamant Sand Rush Excadrill with Rock Polish. Maximum Attack is needed to deal as much damage as possible and the remaining EVs go into HP for extra bulk. A max Speed spread with a Jolly nature is also viable on this set, particularly for teams that are weak to Keldeo.

Usage Tips
========

Bring Mega Metagross in late-game against something that it forces out to set up for a sweep. If a Healing Wish user such as Jirachi or Latias is on its team, it can be used as a wallbreaker early-game, checking threats such as Fairy-types, Latias, Latios, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Sceptile.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can remove Mega Metagross's checks and counters are crucial for a Rock Polish sweep. Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Raikou take on Talonflame well and can provide Mega Metagross a free switch via Volt Switch or U-turn. Keldeo and Magnezone help break down defensive Steel-types and the former reliably checks Bisharp. Bisharp also makes for a great partner, as it deters Defog thanks to Defiant and helps keep entry hazards up. Furthermore, strong Swords Dance users such as Garchomp, Terrakion, Explosion Landorus-T, and Bisharp can lure in and weaken opposing physical walls such as Slowbro and Mega Slowbro, Skarmory, Alomomola, and Mandibuzz. Finally, a Healing Wish user allows Mega Metagross to be played more recklessly early-game and be brought back to full health once it's ready to sweep.

Other Options
########

Metagross has access to Stealth Rock, so a bulky Stealth Rock set with HP and Attack investment can be used as an entry hazard setter that helps keep Stealth Rock up through its great offensive presence. Even offensive sets can run Stealth Rock effectively due to the amount of switches that Mega Metagross forces. Toxic can be used on bulky walls Mega Metagross has lured in such as Cresselia, Alomomola, and Slowbro. Finally, Substitute is an option to avoid mind games with Bisharp and avoid a Sucker Punch, as well as avoid status from defensive Pokemon that could otherwise give it trouble. Power-Up Punch in combination with Substitute allows Metagross to set up on would-be counters such as Alomomola and Ferrothorn, which have no way of breaking its Substitutes and become complete setup bait. Refresh can allow Metagross to be played more aggressively around status users, as it heals otherwise crippling status like burn and paralysis.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and bulky Mega Scizor can give Mega Metagross trouble, as the former has access to Counter while the latter two can whittle it down. However, if Mega Metagross is carrying Hammer Arm, only bulky Mega Scizor can actually wall it, as Ferrothorn, offensive Mega Scizor, and Skarmory are 2HKOed by the move. Bisharp also revenge kills Mega Metagross with Sucker Punch after a little bit of prior damage.

**Bulky Water-types**: Slowbro, Suicune, and Quagsire wall Mega Metagross if it lacks Grass Knot, as they cannot be 2HKOed by any of Metagross's other moves and have access to recovery moves to heal off any damage taken. Physically defensive Starmie can also check Metagross unless it is running Grass Knot; in addition to this, Alomomola and physically defensive Gyarados are mostly perfect counters. Specially defensive versions of Gyarados can run a spread of 248 HP / 104 Def / 156 SpD in order to avoid the 2HKO from Zen Headbutt after Stealth Rock damage and cripple Mega Metagross with a Thunder Wave

**Faster Pokemon**: Choice Band Talonflame can OHKO Mega Metagross with Flare Blitz, Choice Scarf Landorus-T can 2HKO Mega Metagross with Earthquake while also dropping Mega Metagross's Attack with Intimidate and Mega Manectric can OHKO Mega Metagross with Overheat. Dugtrio holding a Focus Sash also deserves a mention as it can trap Mega Metagross and 2HKO it with Earthquake. Additionally, if Mega Metagross is weakened, Pokemon such as Mega Sceptile and Mega Beedrill can pick it off with Hidden Power Fire and Drill Run, respectively.

**Physically Defensive Walls**: Mega Sableye is a great check to Metagross, as Meteor Mash is the only move with a chance to 2HKO it, and it is able to burn Mega Metagross with Will-O-Wisp. Quagsire, Hippowdon, Suicune, Slowbro, and Mega Slowbro all wall Mega Metagross if it lacks Grass Knot and have access to reliable recovery options that can heal off any damage taken. Physically defensive Mandibuzz, physically defensive Gliscor, physically defensive Mew, and physically defensive Landorus-T can also switch into Metagross easily, although an untimely Attack boost from Meteor Mash can change this. Furthermore, Clear Body ignores Intimidate, so Landorus-T can't actually switch in until Metagross has Mega Evovled. Additionally, Ice Punch, a relatively common coverage move, deals with all of these except Mew. Finally, Skarmory will always beat Mega Metagross that lack Hammer Arm, as Skarmory has the physical bulk and recovery to tank any hits that it can throw at it; if Skarmory has Counter, it can simply switch between Roost and Counter to bring Mega Metagross down. Running a 29 Speed IV on Skarmory ensures that it will not be undersped by Mega Metagross after two Hammer Arms, which helps it immensely in a 1v1 scenario.
