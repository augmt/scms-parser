Overview
########

While formerly outclassed by Deoxys-S, Espeon now fills a useful niche as an OU dual screen setter. Magic Bounce is a solid ability, but Espeon struggles to make ideal use of it because of its frailty and bad defensive typing. However, Magic Bounce is still very useful as it allows Espeon to support Stealth Rock-weak sweepers such as Mega Pinsir and Dragonite without having to worry about them being crippled by Stealth Rock. It is also good at shutting down hyper offensive leads and can prevent Stealth Rock from going up simply by being on the field. 

Dual Screens
########
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Light Screen
move 2: Reflect
move 3: Baton Pass
move 4: Yawn / Psychic
ability: Magic Bounce
item: Light Clay
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Espeon can support Stealth Rock-weak sweepers with Light Screen, Reflect, and Magic Bounce, giving them a much easier time setting up and keeping entry hazards off the field. Baton Pass is useful because it maintains momentum and helps to make the most of the eight turns that Light Screen and Reflect last. It also allows Espeon to escape Pursuit from the likes of Tyranitar and Bisharp. Yawn might sound gimmicky at first, but it is great for forcing switches and allowing a sweeper to come in for free. It also prevents Espeon from becoming setup fodder. Espeon can also run Psychic so that it has a STAB attack to defend itself with, but it is fairly weak without investment or a boosting item, so the move isn't all that useful. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to surprise and OHKO unsuspecting Bisharp, and Hidden Power Fire can be used in order to surprise Ferrothorn and Scizor, but they have little use outside of that.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed investment makes full use of Espeon's good Speed stat, allowing it to outspeed threats like Keldeo and Terrakion. Maximum HP gives Espeon much-needed bulk, important for setting up screens. Light Clay is a must as it extends the number of turns that Light Screen and Reflect are active.

Usage Tips
========

It is usually best to lead with Espeon in order to get dual screens up as early as possible. However, Espeon can also switch in on Pokemon that are entry hazard setters or can't do much to it and proceed to set up screens. It is usually best to set up the screen that corresponds to the main offensive stat of the Pokemon that Espeon is currently facing, as it generally allows Espeon to set up both screens much more easily. After screens have been set up, immediately switch or Baton Pass to a sweeper in order to take advantage of them. If the opposing Pokemon threatens to set up on Espeon, Yawn can be used to force it out and gain momentum with Baton Pass or an opportunity to set up. It is often better to use Yawn and let Espeon faint after setting up screens than keep it around, as this way you can maintain momentum much more easily.

Team Options
========

This set should be used in conjunction with setup sweepers weak to Stealth Rock to give them an easy time setting up. Mega Charizard X abhors Stealth Rock and is fairly bulky, so it is a good teammate for this set. Mega Pinsir, Bulk Up Talonflame, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Volcarona are also good partners for the same reasons. Keldeo is a good partner for this set because it can easily deal with the Dark-types that often switch in on Espeon. Terrakion is similar in this regard and loves getting a Justified boost when it switches into a Dark-type move. Bisharp is a good option, as it appreciates easier setup opportunities and deters opponents from using Defog to remove Espeon's screens.

Other Options
########

Espeon can run an offensive set, but it faces harsh competition from a plethora of other Psychic-types, most notably Latios and Alakazam, both of which outclass offensive Espeon. In addition, such a set is easily walled by common Pokemon and fares even worse against Espeon's usual checks and counters. While a Calm Mind set might seem appealing at first due to Espeon's good Special Attack and Speed stats as well as its immunity to Roar and Whirlwind, it is actually a terrible option; Calm Mind Espeon struggles against many common opponents due to its awful physical bulk, bad defensive typing, and susceptibility to nearly every common form of priority in the OU tier.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dark-types**: Dark-types, particularly Tyranitar, Bisharp, Mandibuzz, and Greninja, are a huge issue for Espeon, as they can easily KO it with their strong STAB moves.

**Scizor**: Scizor can easily come in on Espeon and gain momentum or flat-out OHKO it with U-turn. It can also pick off a weakened Espeon with Bullet Punch.

**Physical Attackers**: Espeon has awful physical bulk, so most physical attackers can easily 2HKO or even OHKO it with a neutral STAB move. Examples include Talonflame, Garchomp, and Excadrill.
