Overview
########

Mega Heracross is one of the deadliest wallbreakers available in OU, as sporting a gigantic base 185 Attack stat and extremely powerful STAB moves, Mega Heracross is one of the hardest hitting Pokemon in the game. Mega Heracross is also a threat to offensive teams, as its respectable bulk and five resistances usually allow it to survive at least one hit and retaliate hard, forcing many switches. Its ability, Skill Link, allows it to take advantage of Rock Blast, Bullet Seed, and Pin Missile to the fullest possible extent, giving Mega Heracross valuable coverage options against a ton of threats. It even has access to Swords Dance to boost its already insane Attack stat to ridiculous levels, allowing for it to function as a potent sweeper. In addition, Mega Heracross's very solid 80/115/105 defensive stats allow it to tank a hit or two, making it surprisingly difficult to take down. To put it simply, Mega Heracross is the definition of a wallbreaker, not only because it is nearly impossible to switch into, but also its amazing move coverage which allows it to break through the vast majority of defensive Pokemon.

Unfortunately, Heracross is plagued with a nasty 4x weakness to Flying-type attacks, on top of its common Fire-, Psychic-, and Fairy-type weaknesses. Its Mega Evolution is also noticeably slower than its non-Mega counterpart, missing the jump on Pokemon such as Dragonite, Heatran, and Gyarados. Mega Heracross is also rather easily worn down and vulnerable to status like burn and Toxic, which amplify this. Nevertheless, Mega Heracross should never be underestimated, because its awesome power and fantastic wallbreaking capabilities make it a force to be reckoned with in the metagame, capable of leaving teams in shambles.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Close Combat
move 2: Pin Missile
move 3: Rock Blast
move 4: Swords Dance / Substitute
ability: Moxie / Guts
item: Heracronite
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Close Combat reaches jaw dropping power coming off Mega Heracross's massive Attack stat, and there's very little that can stomach it easily. It's also its best option for dealing with bulky Steel-types such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Air Balloon Heatran. Pin Missile is also an extremely powerful STAB move, cutting through Psychic-types such as Slowbro and Mew, as well as Dark-types such as Tyranitar. In general, Pin Missile is Mega Heracross's most reliable option against Pokemon that don't take super effective damage from any of its coverage moves, such as Rotom-W or Hippowdon, both of whom are 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Rock Blast provides important coverage against Gengar, Gyarados, Dragonite, and Landorus-T, which would wall this set otherwise. It's also useful for hitting Talonflame and Mega Pinsir on the switch and is Mega Heracross's best option against Fairy-types such as Azumarill and Clefable. Swords Dance gives Heracross a way to boost its Attack stat to terrifying heights, and it can easily clean up defensive teams once it gets up a boost. Alternatively, Substitute is an option, as it blocks revenge killing attempts and status while also easing predictions immensely and punishing predicted switches.

Bullet Seed can be used in the last moveslot, as it boasts the ability to OHKO Azumarill, Quagsire, and physically defensive Rotom-W, while also 2HKOing Hippowdon.

Set Details
========

With the given EVs, Mega Heracross can outspeed Adamant Bisharp while still retaining as much bulk and power as possible. Heracronite is obviously needed in order for Heracross to Mega Evolve into the monster that is Mega Heracross. Moxie is the preferred ability, as if Heracross manages to KO something before it Mega Evolves, it obtains a +1 Attack boost and instantly becomes more terrifying. On the other hand, Guts keeps Heracross from being completely useless if happens to get burned, but its instrumental multi-hit attacks become unreliable, so it's not worth it.

Usage Tips
========

Heracronite turns Heracross into a devastating wallbreaker that is capable of breaking through many defensive Pokemon, including Rotom-W, Chansey, Skarmory, Heatran, Zapdos, Ferrothorn, Quagsire, and much more. Although it can also sweep decently with Swords Dance, it's mostly meant to function as a bulky wallbreaker that can tear apart defensive cores, allowing a teammate can come in and sweep. Don't forget that Mega Heracross is actually rather bulky, capable of surviving a decent amount of even super effective hits and checking the likes of Bisharp.

Team Options
========

Although Mega Heracross lacks a lot of true counters, it is very important to pair it with something that can eliminate them, as well as cover its terrible 4x weakness to Flying-type moves. Thundurus is hands down the best offensive and defensive partner because it checks Flying-types such as Talonflame and Mega Pinsir with ease, and it can also check Gliscor and Landorus-T, which are some of the few counters to Mega Heracross. Keldeo can break through all of the aforementioned Pokemon, as well as offensive Heatran. It also appreciates the elimination of the Grass- and Psychic-types that Mega Heracross can run all over. Heatran and Heracross have near perfect defensive synergy; Heatran resists Fire-, Flying-, Psychic-, and Fairy-type moves, while Mega Heracross shrugs off Fighting- and Ground-type attacks. Scizor can check the bulky Fairy-types that don't fear any of Mega Heracross's coverage moves, such as Clefable and Sylveon. A cleric, such as Sylveon or Clefable, or Healing Wish Latias is appreciated to keep Mega Heracross healthy and status-free, as it's relatively easy to wear down. This allows it to be played more recklessly, too.

Toxic Orb
########
name: Toxic Orb
move 1: Close Combat
move 2: Megahorn
move 3: Facade
move 4: Swords Dance
ability: Guts
item: Toxic Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Close Combat hits very hard after the Guts boost and checks and OHKOs a lot of common Pokemon such as Heatran, Bisharp, Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Mega Lopunny. It can even 2HKO bulky Pokemon that it hits neutrally such as Skarmory and Keldeo. Megahorn hits as hard as Close Combat, but has a fair chance to miss and doesn't have the spectacular coverage Close Combat does. Nevertheless, it allows Heracross to differentiate itself as a Fighting-type, able to crush slow Psychic-types such as Mew, Celebi, Cresselia, and Mega Slowbro. With Megahorn, Heracross can also switch into and 2HKO Mega Sableye, a Pokemon most Fighting-types cannot deal with. Facade is a great complementary move to Heracross's STAB moves. Clefable, Sylveon, Togekiss, Zapdos, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Mega Altaria resist Close Combat and Megahorn, and Heracross easily can deal with them thanks to Facade, which is boosted to a reliable 140 Base Power move once Heracross is poisoned by its Toxic Orb. Swords Dance may seem counterintuitive on a hit-and-run Pokemon such as Heracross, but it's actually very important, as it lets Heracross OHKO Magic Guard Clefable with Facade instead of having to 2HKO it and take a Moonblast in the process. Swords Dance allows Heracross to also act as a premier Gliscor switch-in, as Heracross doesn't mind any of Gliscor's moves, and can therefore set up on Gliscor and defeat it with Facade. Swords Dance won't be used in all games, but it's necessary to deal with various defensive cores, namely those involving Clefable and Gliscor, but also any others with slow Pokemon that can take an unboosted attack from Heracross and OHKO it back, such as Mega Altaria.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed EVs and a Jolly nature are used for outspeeding Pokemon with base 80 Speed, such as Togekiss and Mamoswine, as well as Adamant Excadrill outside of sand. Maximum Attack EVs are used for hitting as hard as possible. Toxic Orb reliably activates Guts.

Usage Tips
========

Against most teams, Guts Heracross acts as a hit-and-run wallbreaker. Try getting Heracross in for free; it is worn down easily by Toxic damage and doesn't like having to take a hit on the switch. A slow U-turn or Volt Switch user is extremely useful for getting Heracross in. With that said, Heracross is not that frail, and can pivot in on weaker moves, such as Mega Sableye's Shadow Ball and Alomomola's Scald, if necessary. Once in, Heracross should use one of its STAB moves. This part is pretty self explanatory: if Heracross is up against Slowbro, Cresselia, or Mega Sableye, it should use Megahorn, and if it's up against Heatran, Ferrothorn, or Tyranitar, it should use Close Combat. Facade should be used against Pokemon that resist both STAB moves, such as Clefable, Gliscor, and Mega Altaria. If you aim to break these threats without either Heracross being either stalled out or severely damaged, Heracross needs to use Swords Dance first. This can be tricky, but try to get Heracross in against a defensive Pokemon that cannot touch it, such as Hippowdon, Mandibuzz, or Alomomola.

Team Options
========

The activation of Toxic Orb is very important; Heracross really needs that 1.5x boost to its Attack to be threatening. It's very important to get Heracross in safely at the end of a turn so that it doesn't have to attack without the boost at any time. Therefore, slow U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, Jirachi, and Choice Band Scizor are really useful. Additionally, Heracross is great at breaking through bulky Psychic-types such as Mew, Cresselia, and Mega Slowbro, making it a great partner for Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Heatran, Landorus, and Keldeo, which struggle to defeat them. Pokemon that appreciate Steel-types such as Heatran being removed, such as Clefable, also make good teammates. Furthermore, Pokemon that desire a teammate capable of setting up on Gliscor, such as Landorus-T and Landorus that lack Hidden Power Ice, enjoy having Heracross as a partner. On the flip side, Heracross enjoys Pokemon that can deal with Gengar, such as tanks and walls in the vein of Goodra, Hippowdon, and Mandibuzz, as well as revenge killers such as Mega Alakazam. Additionally, Heracross finds itself easily revenge killed by Fire-, Flying-, and Psychic-types. Tyranitar helps out against all three, Rhyperior helps with the first two, and bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia and offensive Dark-types such as Weavile take care of the third. 

Other Options
########

Because most of Heracross's usage stems from its Mega Evolution, there really aren't too many other options it can viably run in OU without facing stiff competition from other Pokemon. An Adamant nature can be used to break through Clefable, Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Mandibuzz more efficiently, but this should only be used if your team doesn't already have a way to deal with or weaken them. Megahorn can be used over Pin Missile to utilize Guts more efficiently if it is activated, but it has lower accuracy, fewer PP, and less overall power. Knock Off can be used in the fourth moveslot to remove Eviolite and Leftovers from walls, but it is relatively weak after removing an item; additionally, it's incompatible with Rock Blast, which will leave Mega Heracross more open to Flying- and Fairy-types. Choice Scarf Heracross can function as a great late-game cleaner thanks to Moxie, but it faces fierce competition from other Choice Scarf users too, such as Terrakion.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Pokemon that resist its STABs**: Gliscor and Landorus-T are among the only defensive Pokemon that can actually switch into Mega Heracross's moves without being 2HKOed. Acrobatics Gliscor with enough Speed to outrun Mega Heracross is perhaps the best Mega Heracross counter available, though somehat specialized. Landorus-T has similar effectiveness if it runs Hidden Power Flying or Toxic. Unaware physically defensive Clefable is a pretty solid counter to it as it resists both of Heracross's STAB moves, avoids the 2HKO from Rock Blast, ignores Swords Dance, and can 2HKO in return with Moonblast. However, Unaware Clefable is susceptible to being worn down by residual damage from entry hazards and status, and can be broken through if at least one hit of Rock Blast manages a critical hit and Stealth Rock is up, which has a 28% probability. Over multiple switch-ins, this probability grows higher and higher, so other measures to ensure Mega Heracross is worn down and pivot switches to bring Clefable in on a resisted move should be used as additional precaution.

**Doublade**: Doublade is an excellent weapon for more defensive teams to utilize against Mega Heracross. It takes little damage from any of Mega Heracross's attacks and isn't even 2HKOed by the rare Earthquake or Knock Off; it can cripple Mega Heracross with a Toxic or damage it pretty heavily with its STAB Gyro Ball.

**Flying-types**: Because of Heracross's glaring 4x weakness, Flying-types are the safest checks to Mega Heracross. Talonflame, a prominent OU Pokemon, can take it out with its powerful priority Brave Bird. Mega Pinsir is also a fantastic check thanks to its ability, Aerilate, granting it a powerful STAB Flying-type Return and Quick Attack. Skarmory can't switch in on Close Combat, but it can tank any other hit in addition to one Close Combat and OHKO in return with Brave Bird or Counter.

**Fire-, Fairy-, and Psychic-types**: Powerful Fire-types that can OHKO Mega Heracross such as Victini and both Mega Charizard formes are good checks to it. Mega Gardevoir and Azumarill can threaten Mega Heracross with a powerful Hyper Voice or Play Rough, respectively. Life Orb Latios, Latias, and Mega Alakazam can all OHKO it with powerful Psychic-type attacks. If Landorus carries Psychic, it can easily check Mega Heracross, too, as it resists both of its STAB moves and can tank a Rock Blast if necessary.

**Will-O-Wisp**: The easiest way to deal with Mega Heracross is just to shut it down with a burn. Sableye can ruin its day with a Prankster Will-O-Wisp, as well as Gengar, but keep in mind it still takes significant amount of damage from Rock Blast. Faster variants of Mew and Rotom-W outspeed Heracross and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp.
