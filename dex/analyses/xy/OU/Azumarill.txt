Overview
########

Don't be fooled by its cute and seemingly harmless exterior, because Azumarill happens to be one of the most threatening Pokemon in OU. Gifted with an amazing ability in Huge Power, which gives it a massive Attack stat nearly equivalent to that of Groudon, Azumarill is no slouch when it comes to wallbreaking. It was even given a major buff this generation with its new Fairy-typing, which gives it an incredible STAB combination to go along with its previously bland lone Water-typing, as well as a useful immunity to the Dragon-type attacks, among a few other new resistances. Unfortunately for Azumarill, its very low Speed stat leaves it vulnerable to being revenge killed by common Pokemon such as Thundurus, Mega Venusaur, and Rotom-W. Luckily, Azumarill has access to priority in Aqua Jet and solid 100 / 80 / 80 defenses to help offset its abysmal Speed stat. The new breeding mechanics now make it possible for Azumarill to run both Aqua Jet and Belly Drum on the same set, allowing for it to function as a terrifying sweeper. Despite its few shortcomings, Azumarill is a top-tier threat that every team must prepare for in order to succeed.

Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Aqua Jet
move 2: Play Rough
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Waterfall
ability: Huge Power
item: Assault Vest
evs: 240 HP / 252 Atk / 16 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Aqua Jet is mandatory because without it, Azumarill can't revenge kill weakened Pokemon or outspeed faster Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Volcarona, and Landorus. Play Rough is a powerful STAB move that is great for wearing down Rotom-W, as well as dealing massive damage to Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-types. Knock Off is the preferred move in the third moveslot because Azumarill can screw around with its common switch-ins by removing their item. The major advantage that this set has over the Choice Band set is that Azumarill is no longer restricted to using one move at a time, giving it the freedom to alternate between moves, limiting its pool of reliable switch-ins. Waterfall gives Azumarill a much more powerful Water-type STAB move to hit bulkier Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Heatran.

Set Details
========

While Special Defense investment might seem like a good idea in order to take best advantage of its Assault Vest, Azumarill is not only meant to tank special attackers, but also physical attackers. Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, and Dragonite are dealt with much better by opting for HP over Special Defense investment, so that is what is chosen. 12 EVs are moved from HP to Special Defense in order to reduce amount of damage Azumarill takes from entry hazard and weather damage. With an Assault Vest and the given HP investment, Azumarill can easily tank hits from the likes of Greninja and Keldeo.

Usage Tips
========

Although most of its sets are designed to put immense offensive pressure on the opposing team, this set is meant to transform Azumarill into an amazing offensive tank. Azumarill's massive special bulk when equipped with an Assault Vest allows it to take on a plethora of special attackers, such as Greninja, Kingdra, Landorus, and Keldeo. Azumarill is even able to take on Pokemon it couldn't before, such as Thundurus, which does a maximum of 79% to Azumarill with a Life Orb Thunderbolt and its KOed with the combination of Play Rough and Aqua Jet.

Assault Vest Azumarill best fits on teams in need of a reliable offensive pivot. Azumarill is able to easily switch in on common special attackers that threaten offensive teams, such as Greninja and Keldeo, and can deal massive damage to them in return without losing valuable momentum. Remember to play conservatively with Assault Vest Azumarill, because its lack of recovery and susceptibility to entry hazards can wear it down relatively fast. Only directly switch Azumarill into resisted or weak special attacks, because very powerful special attackers such as Landorus and Mega Charizard Y can still deal a significant amount of damage to it on the switch.

Team Options
========

As usual, this set struggles to break through bulky Grass-types. Mega Scizor is a great offensive partner because it is able to provide Azumarill with useful switching initiative with U-turn and it can set up on Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn. Mega Manectric is able to weaken physical attackers with Intimidate and bring in Azumarill safely with Volt Switch, which makes it immensely hard to break through physically and specially. On top of that, Manectric can lure Electric-type attacks before it Mega Evolves with its Lightningrod ability, OHKO Gyarados, and fry Grass-types such as Ferrothorn with Flamethrower or Overheat. Breloom can deal massive damage to bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune. Entry hazards are a huge problem for Azumarill due to its lack of reliable recovery. Latias is once again the best Pokemon for removing them with Defog, and also has useful Electric- and Grass-type resistances.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Aqua Jet
move 2: Play Rough
move 3: Knock Off / Superpower
move 4: Waterfall
ability: Huge Power
item: Choice Band
evs: 88 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 164 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Because of Azumarill's awful Speed stat, Aqua Jet is an absolute necessity in order to get the jump on faster Pokemon that would normally outspeed it, such as Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Volcarona. Play Rough is an incredibly powerful STAB move that can 2HKO bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Quagsire, and provides very useful coverage against the likes of Greninja, Dragonite, and Keldeo. Knock Off can smack predicted switch-ins and dispose of their item. Superpower is specifically for dealing massive damage to Ferrothorn, as it resists both of Azumarill's STAB moves and could potentially set up entry hazards against it with ease. As for the last moveslot, Waterfall is the preferred option for a much more powerful Water-type STAB attack to hit bulkier threats such as Heatran, Hippowdon, and Mega Scizor, which can all take at least one Aqua Jet.

Although Azumarill doesn't really have too many other viable attacking options, there are a few moves in particular that it can use to get around a few of its counters. Return or Double-Edge can be used to 2HKO Mega Venusaur, which resists every single one of Azumarill's coverage moves, but it's not entirely worth the loss in power from dropping Waterfall.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature give this set maximum power, while the Speed EVs are to outpace minimum Speed Skarmory, which Azumarill can 2HKO after Stealth Rock and a tiny bit of prior damage. The remaining EVs are allocated to HP in order to increase Azumarill's overall bulk; 4 EVs are shifted into Defense so that Azumarill takes less damage from entry hazards. If you prefer Azumarill to have more move flexibility, then Mystic Water is an option for being able to switch between moves and bluff a Choice Band, but Azumarill loses out on a lot of power and the ability to break through bulkier Pokemon, such as Rotom-W.

Usage Tips
========

The purpose of this set is to punch massive holes into the opponent's defenses so a teammate can come in and clean up. Thanks to Aqua Jet and Azumarill's high Attack stat, it can also pose as a decent revenge killer, capable of picking off weakened foes and frail sweepers. One must not forget that Azumarill is also quite bulky, so it's more than capable of taking weaker hits multiple times in a battle if it has to, but keep in mind that without reliable recovery, it can be worn down quite easily. Because of Azumarill's low Speed stat and Choice Band locking it into one move, it's best to use a hit-and-run strategy to get the best results with this set, or else you open up opportunities for the opponent to set up on one of its attacks.

Team Options
========

One of the best offensive teammates that can be paired with Azumarill is Nasty Plot Thundurus because with Hidden Power Flying or Psychic it can deal with some of its biggest counters, such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss, as well as frying Skarmory. Thundurus also benefits from the pressure Azumarill puts on Hippowdon, Chansey, Mamoswine, and Latias, which are some of its most common checks. Rotom-W also checks bulky Water-types and can provide Azumarill with tons of free switch-ins thanks to Volt Switch. Mega Scizor and Talonflame can both set up on Grass-type Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur that threaten Azumarill. Much like Thundurus, Heatran also appreciates the removal of special walls, and can also deal with problematic Pokemon such as Scizor. Even with the recent nerf to Drizzle, Politoed can power up Azumarill's Water-type attacks, allowing for it to be a much more potent wallbreaker. Because Azumarill will be switching in and out quite often, Defog or Rapid Spin support is very beneficial to remove those pesky entry hazards. Defog Latias is by far the best entry hazard remover due to its fantastic defensive synergy with Azumarill, resisting both Electric- and Grass-type moves while Azumarill can easily shrug off Ice-, Bug-, Dragon-, and Dark-type attacks.

Belly Drum
########
name: Belly Drum
move 1: Belly Drum
move 2: Aqua Jet
move 3: Play Rough
move 4: Waterfall / Superpower
ability: Huge Power
item: Sitrus Berry
evs: 92 HP / 252 Atk / 164 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

This set aims to turn Azumarill into one of the most terrifying and unstoppable sweepers in the metagame. For the cost of 50% of its HP, Belly Drum skyrockets Azumarill's Attack stat all the way to a jaw dropping 1744, allowing for it to OHKO the majority of the metagame with Aqua Jet alone. Aqua Jet is the most important attack, because it allows Azumarill to hit Pokemon that would normally be able to outspeed and revenge kill it, such as Landorus, Gengar, and Thundurus. Play Rough is essential to break through Pokemon that aren't KOed by Aqua Jet, such as Dragonite, Rotom-W, Latias, and Gyarados. Waterfall provides Azumarill with a backup Water STAB move to OHKO very bulky Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Skarmory. On the other hand, Superpower is Azumarill's only chance at OHKOing Ferrothorn at full health, but with the added disadvantage of lowering Azumarill Attack and Defense stats, which makes Azumarill more vulnerable to priority moves.

Set Details
========

The EV spread allows Azumarill to outpace minimum Speed base 70 Pokemon and below, while an Adamant nature gives it as much power as possible. A Jolly nature and max Speed gives it the jump on physically defensive Rotom-W before it can retaliate with a Will-O-Wisp, but most tend to run Speed investment. A Sitrus Berry is the preferred item because it gives Azumarill an extra bit of HP after using Belly Drum, which keeps it from being worn down too quickly by residual damage or faster priority users. Leftovers is also a fine option to give Azumarill some form of passive recovery before it sweeps, but it's not nearly as helpful as a Sitrus Berry once Azumarill sets up. Lum Berry gives Azumarill free setup opportunities against Pokemon that carry status-inducing moves such as Rotom-W, but it's too situational.

Usage Tips
========

This set is meant to tear apart teams once its few checks and counters are gone, so it is important not to sweep before they are removed or else it can be cut short. It's best to set up on Dragon-types locked into a move, such as Choice Band Dragonite or Choice Scarf Kyurem-B. Azumarill is also quite bulky, so it can successfully set up on weaker Bug-, Dark-, Water-, Fighting-, and Fire-type attacks. Because Azumarill forces a lot of switches, it finds many opportunities to set up on predicted switches. It's very important to keep Azumarill as healthy as possible before it sets up, because once its HP reaches below 50%, it's no longer possible for it to use Belly Drum.

Team Options
========

As with most sweeping Pokemon, the best partners for this set are the ones that can eliminate Azumarill's checks and counters, allowing for it to sweep without worry. Thundurus can wear down bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, and with Hidden Power Flying it's a great lure to Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. Mega Scizor can set up on Mega Venusaur and most other Grass-types that threaten to cut Azumarill's sweep short. Scolipede can pass Speed boosts to Azumarill so it no longer has to rely so much on Aqua Jet, while Shuckle can use Sticky Web to slow down opposing grounded Pokemon. Users of Rapid Spin or Defog are very important because Azumarill needs to be as healthy as possible before it can sweep; Excadrill is a good spinner while Latios and Scizor can use Defog. Entry hazard support is also extremely important for breaking Focus Sashes, Sturdy, and securing a few OHKOs. Ferrothorn is probably the best partner for the job because it can easily shrug off all Electric-, Grass-, and Poison-type attacks, and use them to freely set up Stealth Rock. Drizzle support from Politoed is also an option to give Azumarill a much more lethal Aqua Jet. Landorus is also a great partner for its ability to fit nicely on pretty much any offensive team.

Other Options
########

Azumarill has a few other move and set options that all have decent potential. A Life Orb can be used on the Choice Band set for more move freedom, but Azumarill's lack of reliable recovery, susceptibility to entry hazards, and recoil from Life Orb can wear it down very quickly. A specially defensive Sap Sipper set with Scald / Toxic / Protect / Knock Off can work well on defensive teams in need of a solid counter to both Charizard forms, Dragon-, and Fighting-types. It's lack of offensive presence and reliable recovery really hurt it though, so make sure to pair it with a cleric and or a Wish passer. A SubPunch set with Leftovers is somewhat viable because it forces a lot of switches and can demolish Ferrothorn, but it requires a lot of prediction to work properly. Encore can give Azumarill opportunities to potentially set up a Belly Drum, but it then misses out on the extra coverage move or the reliability of Waterfall. Aqua Tail is slightly more powerful than Waterfall, but it has a 10% drop in accuracy and loses out on the ability to flinch, and it doesn't score any significant OHKOes.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Skarmory is a fantastic switch-in to most of Azumarill's sets, as it resists Play Rough and can avoid the 2HKO from Waterfall. Ferrothorn walls the hell out of any set lacking Superpower because it resists both of Azumarill's STAB moves. Mega Scizor is extremely bulky and can threaten to set up on Aqua Jet or Play Rough.

**Bulky Water-types**: Rotom-W resists Azumarill's Water-type STAB and can also burn Azumarill with Will-O-Wisp, or it can deal heavy damage to it with an Electric-type attack. RestTalk Gyarados can lower Azumarill's Attack stat with Intimidate and phaze it out with Roar.

**Grass-, Poison-, and Electric-types**: Mega Venusaur is by far the greatest counter to Azumarill in OU, as it resists both of its STAB moves and can threaten back with either Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb. It's also not weak to Ice Punch due to Thick Fat, nor can its item be taken away by Knock Off. Ferrothorn only fears the stray Superpower and is a complete stop to the Belly Drum set. Amoonguss is also a great counter to Azumarill, but it must be careful of a stray Ice Punch. Thundurus, Magnezone, and Mega Manectric are very powerful Electric-types that can deal a ton of damage to Azumarill with Thunderbolt; Mega Manectric can also lower its Attack with Intimidate. Breloom and Gengar outspeed Azumarill and can threaten to OHKO it with their respective STAB moves.
