Overview
########

Togekiss is a Pokemon with a lot of potential that is held back by some major flaws. With good defenses, real offensive presence, a great movepool, and a useful ability, all topped off with a Fairy typing, one might wonder why Togekiss isn't a dominant threat in XY OU. It suffers on account of its secondary Flying typing which gives it weaknesses to Stealth Rock and common attacking types such as Ice, Electric, and Rock that many Pokemon that ought to be walled by Fairy-types can easily target. Because of this, it's defensively overshadowed by Sylveon and Clefable. Offensively, Togekiss suffers due to its weak STAB moves, poor Speed, and the ease with which it is countered by Electric-types, which don't mind Thunder Wave and Air Slash and can retaliate with powerful Electric-type attacks. Despite being generally outdone or inefficient in some ways, Togekiss still has some tricks up its sleeve. Defog, Thunder Wave, Serene Grace Air Slash, defensive stats high enough to stand up to weak super effective hits, and unique typing differentiate Togekiss from its competition; these can sometimes be enough to warrant a teamslot as a defensive Pokemon. Common Electric-types may make offensive Togekiss struggle, but access to Heal Bell, Roost, and Nasty Plot, amazing defensive stats for an offensive Pokemon, and the power to flinch counters into submission turn Togekiss into a fearsome stallbreaker, giving it a good niche. Togekiss can't be put on every team, but with the right teammates it is quite proficient.

Baton Pass
########
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Nasty Plot
move 3: Roost
move 4: Air Slash
item: Leftovers
ability: Serene Grace
evs: 252 HP / 240 SpD / 16 Spe
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Togekiss is part of a small, fortunate group of Pokemon that have access to both Nasty Plot and Baton Pass and can viably pull off the combination. The aforementioned moves transform any of Togekiss's fellow special attackers into deadly offensive forces. It is rather easy for Togekiss to use Nasty Plot and pass the boosts to another teammate thanks to its bulk, Fairy typing, and access to Roost for instant recovery. Baton Pass can also be used to scout for potential switch-ins. When it isn't attempting to pass boosts, Togekiss can use Air Slash to fire off powerful boosted hits and perhaps sweep thanks to Air Slash's neutral coverage and high flinch chance from Serene Grace.

Magic Coat can be used over Roost or Air Slash to get past Roar, Whirlwind, and status users, though this leaves Togekiss either unable to recover HP or unable to attack. Thunder Wave is also a possible choice over Air Slash to have supportive utility outside of Baton Pass, though, again, this leaves Togekiss without a good last-resort attack. Fire Blast is an alternative attack that is slightly stronger than Air Slash and is able to hit otherwise troublesome defensive Steel-types, such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory, hard. Air Slash is generally better, however, due to its flinch chance and generally better neutral coverage against a majority of OU threats, especially Azumarill, Conkeldurr, Keldeo, and Mega Venusaur.

Set Details
========

The defensive investment gives Togekiss great bulk, granting it more opportunities to set up and pass boosts. Depending on your preference, Togekiss can be either specially or physically defensive with a Calm or Bold nature, respectively. Minimal Speed investment allows Togekiss to pull off a slow Baton Pass, which eases prediction and prevents the recipient from taking damage from incoming attacks. However, 16 Speed EVs, are still used to outrun max Speed Adamant Azumarill, which is useful to outspeed to prevent fast variants from unexpectedly revenge killing Togekiss. You can increase the Speed investment, however, in order to outrun other specific threats, such as Crawdaunt, Bisharp, Tyranitar, or threats affected by Sticky Web (if provided), although this somewhat detracts from Togekiss's bulk.


Usage Tips
========

This set is best used when Togekiss's stronger checks and counters aren't present, as Togekiss can become dead weight if it becomes crippled before doing its job. It is recommended to set up in front of walls or offensive threats that can't do much damage to Togekiss, such as Chansey, Sylveon, Magic Guard Clefable, Latias, Quagsire, Sludge Wave-lacking Landorus, Pokemon locked into a Ground- or Dragon-type attack, and paralyzed or burned threats.

One thing to note is that this set operates nicely with the element of surprise; the opponent can switch in a check or counter to Togekiss, only to be met with a powerful special attacker with a Nasty Plot boost under its belt. Unlike other Baton Pass users, Togekiss can pass boosts multiple times, thanks to its bulk and access to reliable recovery. As an important note, as long as your other sweepers can sweep and clean up without constantly needing Togekiss's help, keeping Togekiss alive at all times isn't necessary.


Team Options
========

This set's purpose is to pass Nasty Plot boosts to other teammates, so these teammates should be fast and powerful special attackers. Use Pokemon that are comfortable taking on Togekiss's weaknesses, along with common forms of priority.

Choice Scarf Keldeo is an excellent recipient that can outrun common opposing Choice Scarf users and clean up with or without a +2 boost after Pokemon that resist Water- and Fighting-type attacks are eliminated. It can also operate as a makeshift revenge killer if the foe attempts to set up against your team. Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Thundurus all appreciate a free Nasty Plot boost and are immune to paralysis, while resisting priority attacks like Bullet Punch and Talonflame's Brave Bird. Agility Mega Ampharos is also wonderful in this regard; after an Agility boost, it outruns all relevant unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, and Mold Breaker allows it to blow past threats that rely on their abilities, such as Sturdy Skarmory, Unaware Clefable, and Multiscale Dragonite. Zoroark and Focus Sash Alakazam are decent choices as well; the former's great Dark-type coverage and Illusion ability can cause chaotic mind games, while the latter is virtually guaranteed to get at least two extremely powerful hits off thanks to Magic Guard.

As implied previously, it is recommended to pack standalone attackers that can operate without a boost and clean up after the recipient faints, such as Gengar (preferably with Substitute, so that it can avoid Sucker Punch and other means of revenge killing), and Sheer Force Landorus. Latias is also a decent teammate that can use Defog and Healing Wish to keep Togekiss and its teammates alive longer.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Roost
move 2: Air Slash
move 3: Thunder Wave
move 4: Defog / Heal Bell
ability: Serene Grace
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Roost is needed to keep Togekiss at full strength so it can wall what it needs to throughout the match. Air Slash is Togekiss's main way of damaging the opponent, as even with no Special Attack investment and low Base Power, its high flinch rate in conjunction with Thunder Wave lets Togekiss beat a lot of Pokemon. Thunder Wave works quite well with Air Slash, rendering the opponent unable to move most of the time, and it is very handy in general to cripple a lot of Pokemon that may switch into Togekiss. Defog is one of the primary reasons to use Togekiss over other defensive Fairy-types, as clearing entry hazards is invaluable, and Togekiss's durability makes it a solid choice for the job. Heal Bell is also a good choice, as any team values the support, and other team members may already be able to remove entry hazards.

Some other options can be inserted into the last moveslot such as Aura Sphere, Flamethrower, and Dazzling Gleam, which can get some useful super effective hits and harass typical checks and counters to Togekiss such as Excadrill, Tyranitar, and Bisharp.

Set Details
========

Leftovers is the only choice for a defensive set like this. Serene Grace is much more useful than Togekiss's other abilities, and with Air Slash it is used effectively. The primary EV spread here is fully specially defensive as it capitalizes on Togekiss's strengths, and with full investment Togekiss is capable of soaking up many very powerful special hits. However, a physically defensive spread is viable for Togekiss thanks to its good Defense which eclipses both Clefable's and Sylveon's. Specially defensive Togekiss is better against a number of special attackers such as Landorus, Mega Charizard Y, Kingdra, Gardevoir, and Keldeo, while physically defensive is better against Azumarill, Conkeldurr, Mega Charizard X, and other physical attackers in general. Choose whichever spread suits your team better.

Usage Tips
========

Send Togekiss out on things like Dragon- and Fighting-types as well as pretty much any special attacker lacking a STAB super effective attack, and proceed to support the team in way or another. Roost as needed; you'll generally want to Roost before you switch Togekiss out unless it hasn't lost much HP. Togekiss's first priority when dealing with foes should be to hit them with Thunder Wave. You will want to get rid of Stealth Rock before you bring Togekiss in as it's a real detriment to it. If running Defog, try and get Togekiss in, Defog away the entry hazards, and Roost back up at once.

Team Options
========

Powerful Electric-, Steel-, Poison-, and Rock-types such as Tyranitar, Scolipede, Excadrill, Bisharp, Terrakion, and Thundurus are big threats to Togekiss. Hippowdon deals with these threats rather well. Strong Ice-type moves are also a huge threat to Togekiss and Hippowdon, so defensive Mega Scizor is a fantastic complement to this core, as it easily deals with Kyurem-B, Bisharp, and Mamoswine. If Togekiss is not running Defog, a Defog or Rapid Spin user is almost a necessity. Latios can check some Thundurus, serves as a good check to Terrakion, and can also threaten Kyurem-B. Zapdos can handle Excadrill very well, an otherwise huge threat to Togekiss, as well as being able to Defog. Mega Scizor, as mentioned, is a good partner and can also use Defog. Excadrill resists every single one of Togekiss's weaknesses and can throw Rapid Spin around for it.

Stallbreaker
########
name: Stallbreaker
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Air Slash
move 3: Roost
move 4: Heal Bell / Aura Sphere
ability: Serene Grace
item: Leftovers / Lum Berry
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Nasty Plot boosts Togekiss's Special Attack to threatening levels and is easy to set up against defensive teams. Air Slash's lower power is made up for by its insane 60% chance to flinch the opponent. Though unreliable, considering Togekiss's resilience, Air Slash gives it the ability to fish for a KO while remaining completely healthy. Roost and Heal Bell let Togekiss heal off weak attacks and status, letting it boost up against defensive threats such as Chansey, Heatran, Clefable lacking Calm Mind, and Toxic Hippowdon. All of these moves in tandem make Togekiss a fierce stallbreaker. Heal Bell can be dropped for Aura Sphere to make life considerably easier against Tyranitar and Bisharp, and also get super effective hits on Chansey and Heatran. Though relevant, the latter two targets are actually easier to deal with should Togekiss have Heal Bell, as both rely on Toxic to break it down. Finally, Fire Blast is a considerable option, as it still eliminates Bisharp and can be used to deal with other Steel-types if the team demands it.

Set Details
========

A simple maximum Speed and Special Attack spread maximizes Togekiss's damage output, making it easier to get past defensive threats while also ensuring that most threats will be outpaced. Speed can be dialed back to 180 EVs, which outspeeds maximum Speed neutral base 70s and max positive nature base 60s. The remaining EVs can be put into HP for a bit more bulk. A spread of 72 HP / 252 SpA / 184 Spe with a Timid nature can used if Aura Sphere is elected for, which enables Togekiss to outspeed and OHKO Jolly Bisharp and Jolly Mega Tyranitar while at +2. Without maximum Speed, be more cautious of faster defensive threats such as Zapdos and Gliscor. Leftovers is the ideal item, letting Togekiss take much less damage from weaker attacks and also heal while it flinches the opponent. A Lum Berry can be used if Heal Bell is not, as it gives Togekiss a chance against status in dire situations.

Usage Tips
========

This set can easily set up on many common Pokemon in the stall archetype, and it has the capacity to flinch its counters into submission. The opponent may not anticipate that Togekiss is equipped to deal with status or have such an offensive presence, so it is ideal to save it for late-game when the opponent's team is softened up. When Togekiss gets in, it should boost up, start attacking, and heal as needed; most stall Pokemon will succumb to Togekiss quite quickly. Conceal Heal Bell against stall; if the opponent believes Togekiss is out of the way once it gets hit with Toxic, they will give it plenty of opportunities to boost and get healthy. Against offensive teams, use Heal Bell liberally, as this set is not too proficient against them and supporting teammates can make up for this. Unaware users need to be dealt with by flinching; Quagsire is easy prey as it is almost 2HKOed by Air Slash and can't do much back, while Clefable is a bigger issue. Fortunately, unless it has Calm Mind, Togekiss is bound to beat Clefable by easily healing off status and damage and eventually flinching it enough, as Calm Mind variants are never specially defensive. Because of this, unboosted Air Slash does considerable damage, so the best method of dealing with Unaware Calm Mind Clefable is softening it up through the use of entry hazards or lures, and then finishing with a flinch or two.

Team Options
========

Togekiss doesn't like switching in with Stealth Rock on the field, so Defog and Rapid Spin users are much appreciated. Latios is a good choice as it is a decent answer to some offensive Electric-types and is good in general on offensive teams that this Togekiss will be used on. Scizor can do a number of things on top of Defogging, such as U-turning or using Knock Off on incoming Zapdos, which helps get chip damage for Togekiss to capitalize on; it is also capable of forcing out most Clefable which can be useful in an effort to wear it down. Excadrill can also force out Clefable, throw around Rapid Spin for Togekiss, and (with a Choice Scarf) act as a good answer to Electric-types. It is also good in general against offense, which complements Togekiss's ability against defense. Ways to slow down the opponent, such as other Thunder Wave users like Thundurus and Sticky Web from Smeargle or Shuckle, improve Togekiss's ability to function against offense. Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock to help wear down counters, it also sets up sand to cancel out the recovery of some Unaware Clefable, can lure in and hit Zapdos and Rotom-W with Toxic, and acts as a good answer to Electric-, Rock-, and Steel-types. Terrakion can keep Stealth Rock up with its fast Taunt and deal with some troublesome Steel- and Rock-types.

Other Options
########

Togekiss's movepool is pretty wide, but not many of these moves are appealing. Grass Knot can be used to hit the incredibly relevant Rhyperior that otherwise counters Togekiss, as well as hitting a number of Pokemon weak to the move pretty hard. Seismic Toss lets defensive sets deal consistent damage, but Air Slash is one of Togekiss's best assets, and not using it wastes Togekiss's nice Special Attack stat. Toxic is mildly appealing to hit the Ground- and Electric-types that switch in to stop Thunder Wave, but this makes life far easier for Steel-types like Bisharp and Heatran that hate paralysis. Some miscellaneous support options such as dual screens, Wish, Yawn, Encore, and so on have their uses, but these are generally not as consistent as other options or are done better by other Pokemon. Body Slam can be used to paralyze Ground-types, but it's inconsistent. A Choice Scarf set can put in work, but it still has a poor match-up against offensive Electric-types, Excadrill, Tyranitar, and other offensive staples that limit its potential, and overall it is weak and over-reliant on flinching.

Checks and Counters
########

**Steel- and Poison-types**: Scizor, Bisharp, Excadrill, and Heatran among others are easy checks or counters to Togekiss depending on its set. Steel-types resist both of Togekiss's STAB moves and can retaliate with powerful super effective attacks. Poison-types are also great checks, although there aren't many to choose from aside from Venusaur, Scolipede, and Gengar, two of which Togekiss can KO with Air Slash.

**Unaware Clefable**: Unaware Calm Mind Clefable is a strict defensive counter to offensive Togekiss barring ridiculous flinch hax, as it is able to set up Calm Mind and heal off damage dealt by unboosted Air Slash. Aside from this, Togekiss handles other defensive sets pretty well with Heal Bell.

**Electric-types**: Rotom-W, Zapdos, Thundurus, Raikou, and Mega Manectric are pretty good at countering Togekiss; not only can they switch into Thunder Wave and take a pittance from Air Slash, but they can also deal a lot of damage with their Electric-type STAB moves. Togekiss also typically lacks coverage against them aside from Aura Sphere and Fire Blast, both of which won't likely KO at full health.

**Rock-types**: Resisting Air Slash and having powerful Stone Edges go a long way for Terrakion and Tyranitar, two premier Rock-types in OU that easily check Togekiss. However, neither appreciate paralysis and coverage moves such as Aura Sphere.

**Ice-type Pokemon and attacks**: Ice Beam is a common move in the metagame, which may make life difficult for Togekiss if it isn't fast enough to use Roost. Powerful Ice-types, most notably Mamoswine with its Thunder Wave immunity, make life a pain for Togekiss as they can simply overwhelm it with STAB attacks.
