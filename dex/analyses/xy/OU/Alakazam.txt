Overview
########

Mega Alakazam is an exceptional revenge killer, outspeeding most of the unboosted metagame, while possessing a deadly combination of coverage and power. Alakazam gains Trace upon Mega Evolution, an ability which allows it to revenge kill some of the most dangerous threats in the tier, notably Swift Swim sweepers and Sand Rush Excadrill. It can also be used to acquire Sheer Force and Protean to boost its power to even greater levels, acting as a terrifying late-game cleaner. However, its poor defensive typing and paper-thin defenses make it extremely susceptible to priority, hampering its effectiveness against offensive teams and making it difficult to Mega Evolve safely.

Moves
========

Psychic is Mega Alakazam’s optimal STAB move, as it hits physically defensive Pokemon, such as Mega Vensaur, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon, harder than Psyshock while threatening everything else needed. Focus Blast is used in the second slot to threaten Dark- and Steel-types such as Tyranitar, Mega Gyarados, Heatran, and Excadrill. Opposing Psychic-types, which would otherwise wall Alakazam, are threatened by a super effective Shadow Ball, which deters opposing Psychic-types, such as Mew, Latios, Latias, Mega Gardevoir, and opposing Mega Alakazam, from switching in on Mega Alakazam. In the final moveslot, Mega Alakazam has a number of viable options. Hidden Power Fire is preferred to OHKO Scizor and Ferrothorn as well as hit other Steel-types more reliably. However, either Substitute or Protect can be used to ensure Mega Evolution, especially against offensive teams. Substitute shields Mega Alakazam from status and priority, prolonging its longevity, as well as acting as a buffer against possible revenge killers. Protect guarantees that Alakazam will Mega Evolve, giving it an immediate boost to its Speed and greater general flexibility. It is especially advantageous against rain offense before Mega Evolving, enabling Alakazam to revenge kill Swift Swim sweepers without having to Mega Evolve beforehand due to getting Trace.

Taunt allows Mega Alakazam to shut down Chansey, specially defensive Heatran, Calm Mind Clefable, and entry hazard users. However, naturally strong Pokemon, such as Hippowdon, are able to hurt Alakazam even when Taunted. Additionally, if Prankster is copied by Trace, Taunt can prevent Thundurus from crippling Mega Alakazam with Thunder Wave. Hidden Power Ice is a great option to OHKO Landorus; Focus Sash-lacking Garchomp; specially defensive Gliscor, which avoids the 2HKO from Psychic; and Dragonite, provided Multiscale has been broken. Calm Mind can be used against balance and more defensive teams, punishing its switch-ins, but Mega Alakazam’s frailty hampers its ability to set up, and is still vulnerable to priority and physical attacks. Lastly, Encore can be used to help Alakazam deal with setup sweepers, defensive Pokemon, and Sucker Punch users.

Set Details
========

252 Special Attack EVs maximize Alakazam's Special Attack; upon Mega Evolution, its power is equivalent to a Life Orb user with base 123 Special Attack. 224 Speed EVs allow Modest Mega Alakazam to outspeed +1 Mega Gyarados, but more EVs can be invested into Speed if not running Hidden Power Fire to outspeed maximum Speed Garchomp. Magic Guard is the preferred ability, enabling Alakazam to switch into entry hazards without taking damage before Mega Evolving. Alakazite is needed to achieve Mega Evolution, boosting Alakazam's Special Attack and Speed to incredible levels. As the increase in power is more beneficial when wallbreaking, and base 150 Speed is often enough, Modest is the preferred nature to maximize Mega Alakazam's damage output. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Manectric, Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Timid Choice Scarf Heatran. When using a Timid nature, 224 Speed EVs should be used to outspeed Scarf Tyranitar and Pokemon with base 115 Speed before Mega Evolution. Protect is less effective on Timid Alakazam, as it is able to outspeed most of the metagame even before Mega Evolving.

Usage Tips
========

It is imperative to consider Mega Alakazam's frailty both before and after Mega Evolution, taking into consideration it wants to Mega Evolve as soon as possible in order to receive Trace and the Speed needed to revenge kill effectively. As such, it should only be brought in after a teammate has been KOed or on an obvious switch by the opponent. Before Mega Evolution, Magic Guard allows Alakazam to switch into entry hazards, so Defog or Rapid Spin support is not a necessity. Alakazam’s primary role is to act as a revenge killer, and Trace allows Alakazam to accomplish this in a unique manner, enabling Alakazam to revenge kill Swift Swim sweepers and Sand Rush Excadrill. Additionally, Trace can be used to handle Unaware Calm Mind Clefable, as Unaware ignores accumulated boosts. Heatran sets lacking Earth Power are completely shut down by Taunt. However, it is only necessary to use Taunt when switching in to Heatran to prevent the use of Taunt and Roar; when Heatran switches in on Alakazam, it will be attacking directly. Thundurus is another notable threat that Alakazam is able to handle thanks to Trace, copying Prankster. While Alakazam is best used as a revenge killer, it has sufficient power and Speed to act as a late-game cleaner, especially against unprepared teams lacking priority.

Team Options
========

Strong wallbreakers, such as Landorus, Diggersby, and Crawdaunt, are important teammates for Alakazam, as they are able to cripple or check Chansey and Jirachi; Terrakion is notable for its access to both Stealth Rock and Swords Dance, to break defensive cores, making it one of Alakazam's best partners. Chansey, one of Alakazam’s top counters, is best handled by powerful Fighting-types, such as Breloom and Keldeo. Entry hazards are important to score crucial KOs, especially because Alakazam cannot afford to take a hit. As neither Latias nor Latios are KOed by Shadow Ball without significant prior damage, Pursuit Bisharp is a viable teammate, as is Tyranitar, which can lay down Stealth Rock, Pursuit trap Psychic- and Ghost-types, and handle Talonflame. Pokemon that are able to withstand common priority attacks are also essential teammates, so Heatran, which checks Talonflame, Scizor, and Bisharp, and Amoonguss, one of the few Pokemon that can tank Azumarill's Aqua Jet, are valuable partners to Mega Alakazam.

Revenge Killer
########
name: Revenge Killer
move 1: Psychic
move 2: Focus Blast
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Thunder Wave / Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Fire
ability: Magic Guard
item: Focus Sash
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Generally outdamaging Psyshock, Psychic is chosen as the STAB move. Focus Blast provides necessary coverage against Dark-types, which are immune to Psychic, and Steel-types, which resist Psychic, whereas Shadow Ball hits Psychic-types, which resist both Psychic and Fighting. Thunder Wave is the optimal choice in the final moveslot, as, in tandem with Focus Sash, it enables Alakazam to cripple dangerous sweepers, such as Mega Charizard X and other Dragon Dance users that would otherwise outspeed Alakazam. However, depending on what threatens your team most, Alakazam can also utilize either Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Fire over Thunder Wave. Hidden Power Ice OHKOes both of the Landorus formes, Garchomp, Dragonite, provided Multiscale is broken, and other Pokemon 4x weak to Ice. For more reliable coverage against Steel-types, Hidden Power Fire can be used, notably hitting Ferrothorn and Scizor harder than Focus Blast does.

Set Details
========

252 Special Attack and Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Alakazam to act as a revenge killer, and a Timid nature lets Alakazam outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame. Magic Guard protects Alakazam from all forms of residual damage, allowing its Focus Sash to stay preserved even against sand and entry hazard damage. Focus Sash is the preferred item, guaranteeing at least one hit on the foe if it is intact and letting Alakazam act as a revenge killer of sorts. Due to its Speed, Alakazam is often able to get off a second hit, provided it is not facing a Choice Scarf user.

Usage Tips
========

Due to its frailty, Alakazam is unable to switch into most attacks, and therefore should only be brought in after a teammate has fainted. Additionally, this serves to preserve Alakazam’s Focus Sash, which cannot be broken by entry hazards thanks to Magic Guard. Focus Sash guarantees that Alakazam will survive a hit, giving it the rather unique ability to revenge kill faster threats without a Choice Scarf attached or the ability to take a hit. Prior damage is often needed to score OHKOs, so entry hazard support is appreciated, but the nature of Focus Sash somewhat mitigates this requirement. When facing a Pokemon that outspeeds Alakazam and cannot be OHKOed by it, Thunder Wave can be used to cripple the foe, allowing a teammate to finish it off.

Team Options
========

Without Mega Evolving, Alakazam sees a significant drop in power, so more Dark-types threaten it, making Breloom, Keldeo, and Conkeldurr good teammates. Stealth Rock and other entry hazards are also greatly appreciated, allowing Alakazam to OHKO a greater number of threats. Terrakion is a great teammate, with access to both Stealth Rock and STAB Close Combat to hammer Chansey and other common counters to Alakazam. Pursuit trappers, such as Tyranitar and Bisharp, are also required to take on Latios, Latias, and other bulky Psychic-types.

Other Options
########

While Psychic is the preferred STAB move, Psyshock can be used in conjunction with Taunt to defeat Chansey, one of Alakazam's top counters. When carrying either Substitute or Protect, Disable works well on Mega Alakazam, but requires it to forego important coverage. Grass Knot allows Mega Alakazam to reliably handle Gyarados, OHKOing and 2HKOing Mega Gyarados and Gyarados, respectively, helping with the mindgames. Grass Knot lets Alakazam OHKO both Omastar and Kabutops without having to resort to Focus Blast. Grass Knot also 2HKOes Tyranitar, specially defensive Hippowdon, and Calm Mind Suicune, provided Suicune uses Calm Mind on the first turn. Future Sight can be used to pressure some of Alakazam’s usual switch-ins, as in tandem with powerful teammates, Alakazam's hard counters can be forced into a checkmate position. Finally, Dazzling Gleam threatens Dragon-types, most notably Swift Swim Kingdra.

Checks & Counters
########

**Special Walls**: Chansey is able to wall both of Mega Alakazam's sets due to her high Special Defense and access to recovery, but Alakazam variants carrying Taunt can harass Chansey. Specially defensive Hippowdon is able to switch into Alakazam, survive the second hit, and respond with a strong Earthquake. Specially defensive Jirachi is only 3HKOed by Shadow Ball, while in return, Iron Head 2HKOes Mega Alakazam. Barely scratched by any of Alakazam's moves, specially defensive Togekiss can cripple it with Thunder Wave. Assault Vest Azumarill avoids the 2HKO and KOes Alakazam in return, as does Alomomola, which can then Toxic Alakazam in return. Cresselia comfortably tanks all of Alakazam's moves, crippling it with either Toxic or Thunder Wave.

**Dark-types**: Bisharp can threaten Alakazam with both priority Sucker Punch and Pursuit, but must beware of Focus Blast. Sableye is notable, only fearing the rare Dazzling Gleam, being immune to Psychic and taking little damage from Shadow Ball. Mandibuzz is able to avoid the 2HKO from Alakazam and KO back with either Foul Play or Knock Off.

**Priority Attacks**: Due to its poor typing and general frailty, especially on the physical side, priority is the most efficient way of dealing with Alakazam. Talonflame is able to OHKO Alakazam with Brave Bird, and Mega Scizor fears only Hidden Power Fire, and can respond with a powerful Bullet Punch. Mega Pinsir needs only a little prior damage or a broken Focus Sash to pick off Alakazam, and Bisharp is able to utilize its STAB Sucker Punch against Alakazam once it has switched in.
