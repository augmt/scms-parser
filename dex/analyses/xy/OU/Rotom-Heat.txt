Overview
########

Rotom-H has usually been regarded as a lesser Rotom-W, mostly due to its weakness to Stealth Rock and less useful STAB combination. In addition, as a Fire-type, Rotom-H faces immense competition from Heatran as well, which boasts a much better defensive typing and offers far more flexibility in its support options.  However, Rotom-H does have its merits. It possesses eight resistances and one immunity, compared to Rotom-W's six, and has a Fire-type STAB attack that destroys many of Rotom-W's usual counters. Certain threats alike are handled much better by Rotom-H than by Rotom-W, including Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard Y, Thundurus, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur. In comparison to Heatran, Rotom-H gains an immunity to the Ground-type moves that destroy Heatran, and handles Water-types much better than Heatran does with a momentum-grabbing Volt Switch. Keep these niches in mind and you'll find a Pokemon that is neither outclassed nor overshadowed by anything else.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Overheat
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Pain Split / Rest
ability: Levitate
item: Leftovers / Chesto Berry
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Despite Rotom-H's defensive nature, Overheat remains its main STAB move of choice to threaten most of the Pokemon it counters. Volt Switch provides momentum and switching utility; with Rotom-H's greatly increased longevity, more opportunities to use Volt Switch will arise. Will-O-Wisp cripples many of the attackers that might try to switch into Rotom-H, such as Garchomp and Tyranitar. Finally, Pain Split is one of two choices Rotom-H has for recovery, putting it to decent use with a low HP stat of 50. However, Rest provides a much more thorough form of recovery than Pain Split, particularly in removing the effects of Toxic, at the cost of practically forcing Rotom-H to carry Chesto Berry (and therefore only working reliably once). However, it is also possible to run a second status move in place of recovery. Thunder Wave is better for offensive teams looking to outspeed many of Rotom-H's faster switch-ins, whereas Toxic deals with Rotom-W much more efficiently than Will-O-Wisp does and has better synergy with defensive teams.

Set Details
========

A physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD lets Rotom-H take on many of the physical attackers it walls, including Talonflame and Mega Pinsir. However, a specially defensive spread is equally viable, allowing Rotom-H to take on attackers like Thundurus and Mega Charizard Y better, and the choice of a spread is really up to what the team needs most. Note, however, that +2 Mega Pinsir can OHKO Rotom-H after Stealth Rock if a physically defensive spread is not used. Leftovers gives Rotom-H a reliable long-term method of recovery, healing chip damage that might be incurred from switching into something it walls and making up for the presence of Stealth Rock in particular. However, if Rest is being used, Chesto Berry is the best option, essentially giving Rotom-H a second chance at life.

Usage Tips
========

With a defensive build, Rotom-H can very easily come in on attackers, especially against ones that are already at a severe type disadvantage. Unlike many defensive Pokemon, it can force most of them out, threatening them with one of its STAB attacks or a status move. Because of this, it's essential to have Stealth Rock up on the opponent's side, as many of the Pokemon Rotom-H counters, such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, will be taking massive damage from it. The durability of this Rotom-H makes it very easy for attackers to incur entry hazard damage over the course of a match. Furthermore, prediction against incoming switch-ins is key with this Rotom-H; a timely burn or a smart Volt Switch can easily turn the tide of a battle in your favor. This Rotom-H excels at playing mind games with the opponent, as its wide range of functions and increased utility make it a very relevant defensive threat to many attackers.

Team Options
========

Like with the other sets, Rapid Spin or Defog support is crucial, as Rotom-H cannot perform its defensive duties well if it is taking 25% damage each time it switches in. Powerful, hole-punching Pokemon such as Azumarill or setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Landorus love Rotom-H because it is great at reliably gaining momentum throughout the course of a match, presenting offensive Pokemon with great opportunities to set up or attack. In addition, setup sweepers and defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory will also appreciate the reduced damage output from a burned opponent. However, if being used on a defensive team, teammates must be able to handle powerful physical Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, as they cannot be burnt. Teammates should also be able to handle Pokemon such as Tyranitar that can easily switch in on anything bar Will-O-Wisp and hit Rotom-H for super effective damage. Because Rotom-H handles Talonflame extremely well, Pokemon that are vulnerable to being revenge killed by it will easily appreciate Rotom-H's support.  Keldeo is a great teammate in this regard, especially considering it easily takes out Tyranitar, a major threat to Rotom-H.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Overheat
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Hidden Power Ice / Thunderbolt
move 4: Trick / Thunderbolt
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Unfortunately, the inconsistent Overheat is Rotom-H's only Fire-type STAB, and cannot be replaced. However, it is far stronger than any of Rotom-H's other attacks, boosting its viability greatly, and meshes well with this set's hit-and-run nature. Volt Switch is functionally Rotom-H's most important move, as it allows Rotom-H to safely scout the opponent's team and quickly get itself out of a bad situation. Hidden Power Ice gives Rotom-H the ability to revenge kill popular offensive Pokemon such as Garchomp and Landorus, even outspeeding +1 Dragonite thanks to the Choice Scarf. However, its low power means the aforementioned threats will need to have taken some prior damage for a clean OHKO. Thunderbolt, on the other hand, dishes out a much stronger hit than Volt Switch to foes such as Togekiss, as they can otherwise simply recover the damage taken from Volt Switch. In addition, it lets Rotom-H stay in battle with a STAB attack, which Volt Switch and Overheat do not allow. Finally, Trick lets Rotom-H permanently cripple the walls that aim to stop it, namely Chansey and Sylveon.

Set Details
========

The given EVs maximize Rotom-H's Special Attack and Speed, the two most important stats for this set's success. A Timid nature lets Rotom-H Speed tie with +1 Rotom-W and outspeed +1 Jolly Dragonite and +1 Adamant Excadrill. A slightly bulkier spread of 108 HP / 176 SpA / 224 Spe with a Timid nature lets Rotom-H survive Choice Band Azumarill's Aqua Jet from full health, and outspeeds Mega Alakazam, Mega Aerodactyl, and +1 Mega Gyarados. If more power is desired, a Modest nature guarantees an OHKO on Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice after Stealth Rock, but keep in mind this prevents Rotom-H from outspeeding all of the aforementioned threats, so it generally isn't worth it.

Usage Tips
========

Rotom-H can be brought out against the Pokemon it walls, such Thundurus and Talonflame, taking minimal damage and immediately threatening them. This Rotom-H also functions as a great revenge killer, threatening many popular offensive Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir with one of its STAB or coverage moves after a teammate faints. In addition, Rotom-H functions as an excellent lead, using Volt Switch to gain early momentum. Overheat is usually a powerful move to spam should Volt Switch be a poor choice; however, one must be extremely wary of being locked into Overheat against Heatran or setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Keldeo or Dragon Dance Dragonite.

Team Options
========

Due to this set's hit-and-run nature, Rapid Spin or Defog support is crucial to prevent Rotom-H from being worn down. Good Rapid Spin or Defog users to pair with Rotom-H include Empoleon, Latias, Mega Blastoise, Starmie, Tentacruel, and bulky variants of Scizor, as all share decent synergy with Rotom-H. Pokemon with Volt Switch or U-turn can easily form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-H, as it matches well with common users of the strategy such as Landorus and Scizor. Finally, teammates that attract resisted moves or threats such as Ferrothorn or Talonflame are great for Rotom-H, as smart plays will let Rotom-H easily grab momentum with Volt Switch or fire off powerful Overheats.

Other Options
########

If Quagsire or the rarely seen Gastrodon and Swampert are a major concern, Hidden Power Grass can be used over Hidden Power Ice, seeing as Rotom-H is such a great lure for these Pokemon. However, this is not recommended because it leaves Rotom-H extremely vulnerable to many Dragon-types, which are more common and more important for Rotom-H to target. Hex is another option Rotom-H possesses, becoming a 130 base power move when the opponent is afflicted with a status condition. Although Rotom-H typically has no trouble inflicting status, its low Speed and lack of STAB on the move discourage the use of Hex, along with the fact that Rotom-H is hard-pressed enough to run more than one status move, let alone another attack. Similarly to Hex, Electro Ball has the potential to work in tandem with paralysis. However, Rotom-H is still held back from its aforementioned faults, along with the fact that some of Rotom-H's most popular switch-ins, particularly Rotom-W and Garchomp, are totally immune. Rotom-H can utilize Sunny Day with Heat Rock to be a reliable, bulky sun setter and abuser that resists and gets STAB on Fire-type moves, is immune to Ground-type moves, and has STAB coverage against Water-types, a combination of traits unexhibited in other sun setters. Rotom-H can also utilize dual screens and a slow Volt Switch to aid its teammates in setting up. Electroweb is a unique option that lets a fully invested Rotom-H outspeed anything under fully invested base 150 Speed. Unfortunately, it is an extremely weak move, and Rotom-H would usually rather switch out with Volt Switch. However, Electroweb can be good for forcing switches, especially if entry hazards are up. Choice Specs allows Rotom-H to punch holes in the opponent's team, but the inconsistency of Rotom-H's STABs are simply not worth the extra power. Finally, Rotom-H can use Assault Vest to become an even more effective special tank. However, a complete lack of recovery coupled with a Stealth Rock weakness is extremely bad for a defensive Pokemon, and the support required to keep Rotom-H alive may not be worth it.

Checks & Counters
########

**Special Walls**: Rotom-H can barely touch most special walls, with Toxic being the only somewhat viable option on the defensive set to combat them. However, offensive sets are still hopelessly walled by the likes of Sylveon and Chansey, their best option being Trick (which, in the end, does not prevent them from continuing to be walled.)

**Faster Offensive Pokemon**: Non-Choice Scarf variants of Rotom-H must watch out for many of the faster offensive Pokemon that have the typing or coverage to rip Rotom-H apart before it has a chance to move. Nearly anything that Rotom-H doesn't obviously wall will carry something that can hurt it. Greninja, offensive Tyranitar, and Keldeo all fall under this category.

**Mold Breaker**: Mold Breaker Earthquake from the likes of Excadrill and Haxorus will absolutely shred Rotom-H, hitting past Levitate. It is extremely important that you look for the telltale "________ breaks the mold!" warning when a possible user is sent out.

**Taunt**: Although Taunt by itself is not a huge issue for Rotom-H, and is barely a concern for offensive variants, it can easily prevent defensive Rotom-H from healing or checking sweepers with Will-O-Wisp, which can be extremely problematic. Common users include Thundurus-T, which can potentially muscle through Rotom-H with the aid of Taunt.

**Bulky Setup Sweepers**: Bulky setup sweepers, primarily Fire-types such as Quiver Dance Volcarona and Mega Charizard X, will take a pittance from any of Rotom-H's attacks and cannot be worn down without the aid of Toxic.
