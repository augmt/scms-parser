Overview
########

Porygon2 is a very quirky Pokemon, but it pulls its weight of 71.6 pounds with virtues in many different roles. It has a decent defensive typing as well as solid coverage to handle many threats effectively. Eviolite gives it sky-high defensive stats, and it has moderately high Special Attack to boot. Trace is a phenomenal walling ability, and with proper switching, it can grant Porygon2 fantastic abilities such as Protean or Intimidate. However, the virtual duck is not without its flaws. Porygon2 has a low Speed stat, is prone to being afflicted by status, and its reliance on Eviolite takes away passive recovery from Leftovers. Porygon2's Normal typing gives it a Ghost immunity, but comes with a weakness to Fighting, one of the most common attacking types in the tier. Overall, Porygon2 is an effective threat both defensively and offensively, especially with its coverage, and is easy to fit into almost any team.

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Shadow Ball / Thunder Wave / Toxic
move 4: Recover
ability: Trace
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

BoltBeam provides at least neutral coverage against nearly all opponents, and when backed up by Porygon2's respectable Special Attack, both moves pack quite a punch. Discharge is another potent move that can replace Thunderbolt for the 30% paralysis chance. Shadow Ball helps deal with the many special attackers weak to Ghost-type moves. A status move can be used in this slot instead for more stall-oriented needs. Toxic wears down many attackers and walls, while Thunder Wave slows down faster Pokemon so that Porygon2 and other team members outspeed it. Recover is a necessity, as it is Porygon2's only way of regaining HP.

Set Details
========

A Calm nature and the given EV spread maximize Porygon2's ability to take special hits. Eviolite is, as on any set for Porygon2, a necessity because of the bulk it provides. Trace steals your opponent's ability, which is often helpful.

Usage Tips
========
Porygon2, by virtue of its bulk, can switch into almost any special attacker with ease, even ones as powerful as Mega Charizard Y. Thus, it should be used as a solution for special attackers. It's necessary to use Recover often so Porygon2 doesn't get worn down by powerful attacks, entry hazards, and Toxic. Porygon2 still has the physical bulk to take Psyshocks and weaker physical attacks, but it will be worn down if it does so. Porygon2 can utilize Trace to take advantage of its opponent's ability, allowing it to take STAB attacks from Vaporeon and Houndoom, among others. Heatran's Lava Plume and Gliscor's Toxic, which would otherwise be threatening moves, are also shut down by Trace.

Team Options
========
A spinner such as Excadrill or Defog user such as Mandibuzz, Latias, Zapdos, or Skarmory is recommended to keep entry hazards off the field so as to preserve Porygon2's health. Bulky Pokemon that resist Fighting-type moves such as Landorus-T and Mega Venusaur are also important to handle said Fighting-types. Cleric support from Clefable or Sylveon is much appreciated, as Porygon2 has no way to deal with status. Fairy-types have good synergy with Porygon2, as they can take Fighting-type moves aimed at it, while Porygon2 can easily take most neutral special attacks aimed at them.

Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Recover
move 4: Toxic / Thunder Wave
ability: Trace
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Thunderbolt and Ice Beam are used because they are reasonably powerful and attain great coverage. Recover is an absolute necessity as it allows Porygon2 to heal itself and stall out poisoned opponents. Either Toxic or Thunder Wave can be used in the last slot; keep in mind that Toxic is generally a better choice because of the passive damage it inflicts. Thunder Wave is helpful for crippling hostile sweepers.

Set Details
========

Trace is the preferred ability, allowing Porygon2 to copy many wonderful abilities. Analytic is another option for increased damage output, but lessens Porygon2's walling capabilities, making Trace a generally superior choice. The given EV spread along with a Bold nature maximizes Porygon2's defenses in order to take on most physical attackers.

Usage Tips
========

This set aims to force switches, deal damage, and spread status. In a pinch, this set can be used as a pivot as well. This set stops Salamence, Haxorus, and Garchomp in their tracks. It is necessary to heal up often, as Porygon2 is outsped by most things. It's not recommended to switch Porygon2 into strong attacks because it can be worn down by hazards and repeated hits very quickly. Porygon2 still has great mixed bulk, so it can still take moderately powerful special attacks from Pokemon such as Nidoking, Keldeo, and Clefable.

Team Options
========

Ghost-types such as Gengar make great teammates for their ability to switch into Fighting-type moves and come out on top. Special walls such as Latias and Sylveon can take strong special attacks aimed at Porygon2. As with the first set, hazard removal is very useful. Excadrill, Latios, and Latias are good examples of hazard removers.

Trick Room Support 
########
name: Trick Room Support
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Recover / Tri Attack / Hidden Power Fire
ability: Trace / Download
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Quiet

Moves
========

Trick Room is self-explanatory. The classic BoltBeam combination provides stellar coverage on most of the metagame. In the last slot, Porygon2 can use either Recover for healing or a powerful STAB Tri Attack. Shadow Ball can also be used here to hit Ghost-types, but it's not recommended. Hidden Power Fire is an excellent coverage move, hitting common Steel-types such as Scizor and Ferrothorn. You may opt to run Recover over either Thunderbolt or Ice Beam and keep HP Fire in the last slot if you want healing and coverage for Steel-types.

Set Details
========

This EV spread neglects defensive investment in exchange for full-on sweeping capabilities, though Porygon2 is still quite bulky thanks to Eviolite. A Quiet nature along with 0 Speed IVs minimizes Speed and raises Special Attack in order to "outspeed" most Pokemon in Trick Room and to hit as hard as possible. Trace is a great ability, granting it useful abilities such as Intimidate and Levitate. Download is also helpful to improve your chances of sweeping.

Usage Tips
========

Porygon2 can reliably set up Trick Room for its team, so it should be preserved to do this multiple times. It can also deal good damage under Trick Room, while stomaching many attacks. This is more of a support Pokemon for Trick Room teams, and it can still be used as a sponge for powerful attacks.

Team Options
========

Reuniclus is a solid Trick Room sweeper that works well with Porygon2, tanking Fighting-type moves aimed at Porygon2. Conkeldurr is a fast tank in Trick Room, so it appreciates the support Porygon2 provides. Escavalier has an extremely high Attack stat along with abysmal Speed, making it a great fit. Mega Abomasnow has good bulk, high attacking stats, and is quite slow, but its hail can wear down Porygon2. A few Pokemon that work outside of Trick Room are also necessary, though.

Other Options
########

Porygon2 is such a versatile Pokemon that there isn't much it can't do. The three sets listed are its most popular, but feel free to use any set that fulfills whatever niche you need that Porygon2 can provide. One especially notable alternate move is Foul Play. It provides coverage on Ghost- and Psychic-types, and it is also handy against opponents with high Attack. On defensive sets, Conversion 2 can give Porygon2 useful resistances to moves used by Choice-locked Pokemon. This could also be used on an Analytic sweeper set with BoltBeam and Recover. Psyshock can be replace Thunderbolt or Ice Beam if special tanks such as Conkeldurr are proving a lot of trouble, but this sacrifices the much more useful coverage of Electric- and Ice-type moves as well as some power. Discharge can also be used on any set except Trick Room for the paralysis chance.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-Types**: Offensive Fighting-types are very common in the tier, and are often the best way to deal with Porygon2. Examples include Breloom, Terrakion, Keldeo, and Conkeldurr. 

**Taunt**: Taunt prevents Porygon2 from using Recover, status moves, and Trick Room. This prevents Porygon2 from executing its primary function as a tank. Without any form of recovery, Porygon2 must either switch out or hope to survive temporarily without reliable recovery.

**Item Removal**: Porygon2 is absolutely reliant on Eviolite to work in any given situation, and any one of these moves can eliminate its item in an instant. Thus, Porygon2 should not stay in against Pokemon known to commonly run one of these moves.

**Status**: Toxic and Will-O-Wisp are very detrimental to Porygon2, slowly wearing it down so that strong attackers can overwhelm it.
