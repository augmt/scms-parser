Overview
########

Porygon2 is one of the bulkiest walls in OU with a useful ability in Trace, but it faces tough competition from other walls such as Chansey and Clefable. While it can act as a sponge to absorb strong attacks for its team, its passivity makes it unappealing to some players. Porygon2 is also extremely vulnerable to Knock Off and Toxic, and it lacks Leftovers recovery, all of which make it unreliable. However, it still has some offensive presence and an impressive movepool, which includes Thunder Wave, to support its team.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Ice Beam
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Recover
move 4: Toxic / Thunder Wave
ability: Trace
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 204 Def / 56 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Ice Beam deals heavy damage to Pokemon such as Landorus, Gliscor, and Thundurus. Together with Thunderbolt, it forms the BoltBeam combo, which hits almost everything for neutral damage. Discharge is an option over Thunderbolt if the 30% chance to paralyze is desired. However, it can conflict with Toxic, which can be detrimental. Toxic ensures Porygon2 can beat defensive threats with recovery and deal passive damage to more offensive ones. Thunder Wave stops faster sweepers, but it makes Porygon2 helpless against bulky Pokemon such as Cresselia. It's worth noting that Foul Play is a useful move against physical powerhouses such as Mega Metagross and Mega Charizard X.

Set Details
========

Trace is the preferred ability, allowing Porygon2 to copy many foes' useful abilities. It can copy Heatran's Flash Fire, Dragonite's Multiscale, Slowbro's Regenerator, and Landorus-T's Intimidate. Eviolite is a must, as it increases both Porygon2's Defense and Special Defense, greatly enhancing Porygon2's walling potential. With this EV spread, Porygon2 avoids the 2HKO from Landorus's Earth Power after Stealth Rock damage, and it also avoids the 2HKO from Life Orb Excadrill's Earthquake after sandstorm damage.

Usage Tips
========

Porygon2 must be cautious of Pokemon with the move Knock Off because without Eviolite, it becomes a burden. Porygon2 has problems against certain Calm Mind sweepers, especially Mega Sableye and Clefable, so it is best to switch to a teammate against them to avoid being setup bait. When in doubt, use Recover, as Porygon2 must stay healthy to check the threats it needs to. Against offensive Pokemon without recovery, heal with Recover and wear them down slowly with either Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. Finally, switch out against Fighting-types, as their super effective STAB moves will break through Porygon2's Defense.

Team Options
========

Clerics such as Clefable and Sylveon make for great teammates because of their ability to heal Porygon2 from statuses and also for their resistance to Fighting-type moves. Entry hazards wear Porygon2 down quickly, so Zapdos and Empoleon also make for good teammates because of their ability to use Defog. Porygon2 also has problems against defensive teams, so having a stallbreaker such as Talonflame or Manaphy on its team is helpful.

Other Options
########

STAB Tri Attack hits decently hard, but BoltBeam provides better coverage. Magic Coat is also viable, as it can surprise foes that try to Taunt or status Porygon2. Download is an option over Trace if you want Porygon2 to play a more offensive role. Porygon2 can also run a Trick Room set, as its bulk provides ample opportunities for it to set up. Charge Beam is another option, as it helps Porygon2 muscle through some bulky Pokemon, but it is not a very useful move otherwise. Hidden Power Fire can also be used, as it hits unsuspecting Scizor and Ferrothorn for 4x super effective damage.


Checks & Counters
########

**Calm Mind Sweepers**: Calm Mind sweepers such as Mega Sableye and Clefable stop Porygon2 cold with their bulk and abilities.

**Knock Off**: Knock Off users such as Bisharp and Mega Scizor can remove Porygon2's Eviolite, severely weakening its defenses.

**Swords Dance Sweepers**: Swords Dance sweepers such as Excadrill, Mega Scizor, and Bisharp also do not mind Porygon2's attacks and can set up on it.

**Walls**: Chansey and Ferrothorn do not mind Porygon2's attacks and status moves too much, and they can status it or set up entry hazards on it, respectively.

**Fighting-types**: Keldeo, Conkeldurr, and Mega Lopunny can break through Porygon2 with their respective super effective STAB moves, but Keldeo and Mega Lopunny have to watch out for Thunder Wave and Toxic.
