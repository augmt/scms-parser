Overview
########

Boasting amazing stats across the board, with a ridiculous base 170 Attack, solid 120 Special Attack, decent Speed, and great bulk, Kyurem-B proves to be a force to be reckoned with in OU. It most commonly utilizes a set with Fusion Bolt / Ice Beam / Earth Power  coverage, Roost, and a Life Orb equiped, which devastates defensive and offensive teams alike thanks to its immense power and longevity. This set alone tears apart most OU teams with ease, but that's not all. Kyurem-B also has great versatility, as well as the strongest Outrage in OU to utilize. Kyurem-B isn't without its flaws, as it has crippling weaknesses to Stealth Rock, Fighting, Steel, Fairy, and Dragon, as well as an only decent Speed stat; however, despite all this, Kyurem-B shines as one of OU's preeminent attackers and a threat to every team.

Specially Based Mixed Attacker
########
name: Specially Based Mixed Attacker
move 1: Ice Beam
move 2: Fusion Bolt
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Roost / Outrage
item: Life Orb
nature: Mild / Rash
evs: 56 Atk / 252 SpA / 200 Spe

Moves
========

Ice Beam is a devastating STAB weapon that brings many physically bulky Pokemon to their knees, especially bulky Grass- and Ground-types, achieving feats such as 2HKOing Ferrothorn. Fusion Bolt smashes apart Water-types and most Fairy-types, including Sylveon, Togekiss, Azumarill, and Mega Gardevoir. Earth Power finishes out Kyurem-B's coverage by dealing with various Fire-, Electric-, and Steel-types, most significantly Heatran and Rotom-W. Roost keeps Kyurem-B healthy, mitigating Life Orb and possible entry hazard damage, in addition to allowing it to utilize its decent hit-taking capabilities more reliably. Meanwhile, Outrage lets Kyurem-B break through Chansey, enhancing its destructive capabilities against stall teams greatly at the cost of longevity.

Hidden Power Fire can be run in the last slot if desired to OHKO Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. Focus Blast has the same power against Ferrothorn and murders Tyranitar, a major pain for Kyurem-B in general.

Set Details
========

The EVs provide enough Speed to outrun Adamant Excadrill and maximize Special Attack as it is the focus of this set, with the remaining EVs dumped into Attack for a powered-up Fusion Bolt or Outrage. Choice of power-boosting nature comes down to whether tanking special or physical attacks better is more important. An Expert Belt can be run to bluff some sort of Choice variant, which is a logical conclusion if Kyurem-B lacks a Life Orb or Leftovers, and allow Kyurem-B to surprise Pokemon that come in to resist an attack that Kyurem-B is "locked into." Then, it can surprise the foe by switching attacks, likely taking the foe out. Unfortunately, this makes it both slightly weaker against targets hit super effectively and rather weak against neutral targets, so Expert Belt is typically inferior to Life Orb. A Haban Berry to take on Dragon-type foes or Chople Berry for Fighting-type ones can work, but the loss of power hurts more than needing to switch out against such Pokemon.

Usage Tips
========

The best way to get this Kyurem-B set in is by switching into resisted attacks. Switch it in whenever you find an opportunity and just throw out attacks and something will get hurt. Many opponents will attempt to scout Kyurem-B's moveset by switching around and luring various attacks. The best course of action is to predict opposing switch-ins and punish them with the appropriate attack, catching the opponent off-guard and giving you an advantage. Use Roost when Kyurem-B starts to get low on health. This makes it easier for Kyurem-B to switch in later and take on revenge killers aiming to finish it off with priority attacks.

Team Options
========

Pretty much anything that appreciates a weakened team will love this Kyurem-B, which boasts excellent special coverage and power, as a teammate. Terrakion in particular enjoys its support, as Kyurem-B can remove virtually all of Terrakion's counters, including Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. Defog support is necessary, even with Roost, as entry hazards really put a damper on Kyurem-B's hit-taking ability and thus ease of switching in. Latios makes a stellar teammate for this purpose, as it can use Defog and aids in tearing apart teams with its powerful Draco Meteors. Alternatively, Rapid Spin Excadrill can be used as a hazard remover.

Physically Based Mixed Attacker
########
name: Physically Based Mixed Attacker
move 1: Dragon Claw
move 2: Fusion Bolt
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Iron Head / Outrage
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 56 SpA / 200 Spe
nature: Lonely / Naughty

Moves
========

Dragon Claw is a reliable option for Kyurem-B to spam, possessing a large amount of power with the STAB boost and indiscriminately allowing it to deal damage to many threats. It importantly 2HKOes Chansey after Stealth Rock damage. Fusion Bolt has solid power and coverage that destroys the likes of Mandibuzz, Skarmory, Suicune, Mega Gyarados, and others. Ice Beam mainly hits Ground-types, especially Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon, and does a good chunk to Ferrothorn. Iron Head is generally preferred in the last slot to make Kyurem-B the best wallbreaker possible, 2HKOing Clefable. Outrage meanwhile 2HKOes Chansey and provides a general nuke, though Dragon Claw gets the 2HKO on Chansey after Stealth Rock damage most of the time anyway. Earth Power has the niche of smashing Rotom-W as well as various Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon, most notably Heatran. Roost is another option in the last slot to keep Kyurem-B healthy, but it comes at the cost of threat coverage. However, both Rotom-W and Heatran are already 2HKOed, so it's not that useful of an option. Hidden Power Fire is yet another option in the last slot to OHKO Ferrothorn if desired.

Set Details
========

The Speed EVs allow Kyurem-B to outrun Adamant Excadrill, and full Attack investment boosts physical power, the main focus of this set. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack to strengthen Ice Beam. The choice between Lonely and Naughty for the nature is entirely based on a preference for Kyurem-B to tank special or physical attacks better. Haban Berry is a good alternative in the item slot if you want to have a fighting chance against Latios, Latias, Garchomp, and other faster Dragon-types. Chople Berry also works to take Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Keldeo and Terrakion. The major downside of both items is that they don't boost Kyurem-B's power like Life Orb does, which should always be the main priority of this set.

Usage Tips
========

Basically, you'll want to get this set in on any move it resists and start firing off Dragon Claws and Fusion Bolts, the most powerful and reliable attacking options on this set. If an opposing switch-in is obvious, you might want to predict it, depending on the scenario, to take it out and prevent the foe from Life Orb stalling Kyurem-B with no repercussions. Use Kyurem-B's coverage moves as necessary. Outrage is the move to use against Blissey and Chansey, as well as in scenarios where you don't really care what faints, but want something gone. It's really that powerful against everything that's not a physically defensive Steel-type or Fairy-type.

Preserve Kyurem-B if there's any wall in particular you want to get rid of, as it can do the job most of the time. This might sound like an obvious point, but many players will sack Kyurem-B&mdash;their wallbreaker&mdash;prematurely before it has completed its goals. Kyurem-B can also clean if you remove its checks. If the opponent only has a couple blocks that prevent Kyurem-B from going on a rampage, aim to remove those and Kyurem-B will not disappoint late-game with its coverage and power.

Team Options
========

Virtually anything that's a sweeper will enjoy this Kyurem-B's presence, as it is one of the best wallbreakers and hole punchers in the game. Think Lucario, Mega Tyranitar, Garchomp, etc. Special sweepers will appreciate the removal of Chansey, too, which this set can surprise with an Outrage. Growth Mega Venusaur in particular makes for an excellent partner, capitalizing on the removal of Chansey and other special walls whilst tanking Fighting-type attacks aimed at Kyurem-B with ease. Kyurem-B doesn't need much support on its own, but it definitely does require a Defog user, as entry hazards in conjunction with Life Orb damage will wear it down quickly. Mandibuzz, Latias, Latios, and Mega Scizor can fill this role handily; which one you choose depends on your team's specific needs. Alternatively, you can use Rapid Spin Excadrill.

Substitute Attacker
########
name: Substitute Attacker
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Fusion Bolt
move 4: Earth Power
item: Leftovers
nature: Mild / Rash
evs: 56 HP / 252 SpA / 200 Spe

Moves
========

Substitute shields Kyurem-B from status, Leech Seed (this screws over Mega Venusaur and Gourgeist), priority, and revenge killers, easing prediction immensely and making it overall more difficult for the foe to deal with Kyurem-B. Ice Beam is the strong STAB attack on this set, dishing out heavy damage to all but resisting and specially bulky foes whilst eliminating common defensive Ground-, Grass-, and Flying-type foes, even felling Mega Venusaur because Teravolt ignores Thick Fat. Fusion Bolt dispatches Water-types, such as Gyarados, Azumarill, and Manaphy, and does the most damage of any move to Sylveon and Assault Vest Conkeldurr. Earth Power rounds out the coverage by nailing Heatran, Rotom-W, Jirachi, and Bisharp, among various other Fire- and Steel-type foes.

A physically based set with Dragon Claw over Earth Power and Attack investment is an option if Chansey and Conkeldurr are of particular concern.

Set Details
========

The HP EVs ensure Kyurem-B has an HP number that grants 101 HP Substitutes, which ensures that its Substitutes are not broken by Seismic Tosses from Chansey, while not causing it to take more damage from Stealth Rock. From there, it has enough Speed to outrun Adamant Excadrill with the remaining EVs maxing out its special attacking capabilities. If Mega Garchomp is of particular concern, then 232 EVs can be invested in Speed at the expense of Special Attack to outrun it. You can run a Mild nature if you'd prefer Kyurem-B to take special hits from the likes of Manaphy a bit better, or a Rash nature if attacks from Pokemon like Gyarados are of particular concern.

Usage Tips
========

Getting Kyurem-B in is pretty easy; it has a number of nice resistances, including Electric, Water, and Grass, and generally has pretty good bulk. Once you get an opportunity to switch Kyurem-B in, set up a Substitute and proceed to fire off attacks as appropriate. Kyurem-B is one of the scariest attackers in the game, period. Behind a Substitute, it's just that much more difficult to deal with. You want to err on the side of caution against possible status or Leech Seed users, as getting hit with either is extremely crippling to Kyurem-B, so definitely use Substitute in those scenarios. However, don't waste them; if the opponent can simply break your Substitute after you set it up, then you've just wasted a quarter of Kyurem-B's health for nothing. It can be worth it to scout, though.

This Kyurem-B set doesn't really have the brute force to break through stall teams, struggling with common stalwarts of such teams, including Chansey and Clefable. Instead, it should focus on setting up Substitutes on forced switches when playing against offensive and balanced teams, seeking to hit their less bulky members hard with its excellent coverage.

Team Options
========

Defog support is a must because entry hazards limit Kyurem-B's longevity immensely. Because of this, Latios makes an excellent partner, forming a devastating offensive duo with Kyurem-B that can ravage opposing teams. Rapid Spin Excadrill also makes for a solid choice. Running an offensive Steel-type, such as Bisharp or Scizor, helps against pesky Clefable and Sylveon. As these partner Pokemon carry powerful physical attacks, they can also threaten Blissey and Chansey, meaning they can eliminate virtually all counters to this Kyurem-B. Finally, Pokemon prone to being walled by common defensive Pokemon, such as Terrakion and Keldeo, will love the wallbreaking support Kyurem-B provides. With their counters eliminated, it is often easy for these Pokemon to overwhelm opposing teams.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Dragon Claw
move 3: Fusion Bolt
move 4: Ice Beam / Iron Head
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 32 SpA / 224 Spe
nature: Naughty / Naive

Moves
========

Outrage is pretty much the only move this Kyurem-B will use in many battles. Its sheer power is often needed to take out threats. Dragon Claw is a safer option in the early- and mid-game, especially when Outrage can't be risked. Fusion Bolt hits certain Pokemon like Keldeo and Mega Gyarados for good damage without resorting to Outrage. Ice Beam is filler in the last slot to OHKO Landorus-T. Iron Head is an option to 2HKO Clefable, which is otherwise a perfect counter to this set.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Kyurem-B's physical attacking capabilities and allow it to outrun Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T with the rest dumped into Special Attack to pump up Ice Beam a little bit. If Iron Head is chosen, shift those EVs into HP for a bit of bulk. A Naughty nature is best for this set to deal out actual large damage. Naive is a viable option to outrun Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Excadrill, but most importantly, +1 Adamant Mega Charizard X. Their Defense-reducing alternatives (Lonely and Hasty, respectively) can be run if a better switch-in to common Electric- and Water-types is desired, but tanking priority attacks is of more concern to this set due to its heightened Speed.

Usage Tips
========

This Kyurem-B differs drastically from others in that it isn't really so much of a wallbreaker, but a revenge killer with some surprise factor to it that lets it smack a lot of faster Pokemon that try to revenge kill it with Outrage. Outrage is pretty much the only move that this set will use in most cases; the power is just too necessary to secure kills. Be wary of using it around Fairy-types, naturally, and try and hide the fact that it's a Choice Scarf variant, as this can allow for numerous surprise KOs. One way to hide Kyurem-B's Choice Scarf is to use it to revenge kill something naturally slower than it. This way, the opponent might send out a Pokemon to revenge kill Kyurem-B that winds up getting outsped. The other moves on the set are generally rather unimpressive as far as power is concerned, so they should only be used in situations where you are sure that they cannot be taken advantage of.

Team Options
========

As far as teammates go, taking care of Fairy-types, most notably Clefable and Azumarill, is a must, or the Outrage spam this Kyurem-B pursues will end in disaster. Steel-types, such as Bisharp and Scizor (especially bulky Swords Dance Mega variants), are most proficient at this role. Entry hazards and powerful attackers, such as Choice Band Azumarill and Mega Pinsir, can also aid in wearing them down to the point where they are not longer threats. Opposing bulky Steel-types, such as Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor, can also prove debilitating. Attackers like Keldeo and Latios can keep pressure on them. Keeping opposing entry hazards off the field is also a must; Excadrill and Latios are your best bets for this role.

Other Options
########

A physically based variant of the Substitute attacker set with Dragon Claw over Earth Power can work, but the lack of Earth Power really blows coverage-wise, so you're generally better off with the given set or the physically based mixed set that boasts full coverage. Choice Band might sound like a desirable option given Kyurem-B's gargantuan Attack stat and high-powered STAB Outrage, but has difficult getting around Fairy-types and Ferrothorn, and can't utilize Kyurem-B's excellent coverage effectively. A set that has fallen from favor in BW is Substitute + Hone Claws with Roost and Dragon Tail. Firstly, Fairy-types stop this set in its tracks. More significantly, Defog users threaten to remove the entry hazards this set relies on to deal truly significant damage. These factors in combination with the lack of coverage and power make this set an inferior option this generation. An Assault Vest can be run to serve as an effective check to the likes of Thundurus, but the lack of power is heavily noticed. A bulkier spread for the standard mixed set with Leftovers and Roost is an option to serve as a check to Electric- and Water-types but comes at the cost of much of Kyurem-B's wallbreaking capabilities.

Checks and Counters
########

**Super Effective Priority**: Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor and Mach Punch from Conkeldurr and Breloom can fell slightly weakened Kyurem-B if it's not behind a Substitute.

**Mixed walls**: Pokemon such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, Assault Vest Conkeldurr, and Assault Vest Excadrill that have good mixed bulk handle the Substitute set well. However, they have to watch out for Outrage and some even Dragon Claw, and Ferrothorn with 128 Special Defense EVs cannot even be 2HKOed by Life Orb Ice Beam.

**Fast Fighting- and Dragon-types**: Latios, Latias, Terrakion, Keldeo, and Garchomp can all revenge kill Kyurem-B, forcing it out or eliminating it if it's locked into Outrage and not hiding behind a Substitute.

**Stealth Rock**: Kyurem-B's weakness to Stealth Rock means that if you can keep it up, Kyurem-B loses 25% of its HP upon switching in. This limits Kyurem-B's number of switch-in opportunities and wears it down extremely fast, making it easier to handle overall.

**Status**: Prankster Will-O-Wisp from Sableye limits Kyurem-B's potency to an extent due to neutering Fusion Bolt and Outrage. Non-Prankster Will-O-Wisp users are generally KOed or would rather attack it, so they're not very significant. Toxic makes it faint extremely quickly if it stays in, wearing it down especially quickly with Life Orb and possible Stealth Rock damage. Paralysis makes it much easier to deal with, too, as it allows the large range of Pokemon outsped by Kyurem-B to hit it first.

**Fairy-types**: In particular, physically defensive Clefable and Klefki are immune to Outrage and generally handle Kyurem-B well. Both can handle the Substitute and specially based mixed sets decently, and Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir can even hit it behind its Substitute because Hyper Voice ignores it. However, Iron Head and for all but Clefable invested Fusion Bolt will send them packing.
