Overview
########

Volcarona has a strong offensive presence that defines its role in the OU tier. Capable of destroying teams after a boost, it needs only the slightest invitation to start setting up and ending the game there and then. Its huge threat comes from its potent Fire and Bug STAB attacks and access to coverage moves to beat foes that could otherwise take it on, making it difficult to reliably handle. Access to one of the best boosting moves in the game in Quiver Dance only makes it more threatening to be up against, boosting its huge base 135 Special Attack while giving it the Speed to beat offensive threats and making it harder to take down with special attacks. Its solid albeit unspectacular bulk gives it many setup opportunities, notably on Grass-types such as Celebi and Ferrothorn. However, while Volcarona has great offensive presence, it does have some notable flaws. Its huge weakness to Stealth Rock mandates some form of entry hazard removal alongside it, and while most teams would run this anyway, it means that teams utilizing Volcarona are committed to removing entry hazards at every opportunity, giving free turns to the opponent and losing a lot of momentum in the process. Also, depending on what coverage moves it runs, Volcarona will struggle to get past some common Pokemon in the tier, usually Fire- or Dragon-types, necessitating their removal before Volcarona can attempt to sweep. It also struggles to do anything against stall while the ever common Chansey is still alive, meaning that it can be difficult to utilize in this matchup.

nature: Timid

Moves
========

Even just one use of Quiver Dance puts Volcarona at a great Speed tier, outspeeding Choice Scarf Landorus-T while also giving it the power to sweep through teams. Fire Blast is Volcarona's most powerful STAB move without a negative secondary effect and hits very hard at +1. Giga Drain allows Volcarona to hit Water-type Pokemon that resist its powerful Fire Blast such as Keldeo, Manaphy, and Azumarill. Bug Buzz has good neutral coverage and hits foes which otherwise would be able to stop Volcarona's sweep due to their ability to take even a +1 Fire Blast or Giga Drain, and retaliate with either status or heavy damage, such as Latias, Latios, and Tyranitar. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground allows Volcarona to hit bulky Fire-types such as Heatran and Mega Charizard X, which would otherwise take any hit from Volcarona and either phaze it or just KO it.

Set Details
========

Special Attack is maximised because Volcarona needs as much firepower as possible. The Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Volcarona to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T at +1, and anything under base 92 Speed. The rest of the EVs are put into HP to increase Volcarona's bulk in order to take hits better while setting up. Alternatively, maximum Speed allows Volcarona to at least tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Charizard X before a boost. Passho Berry allows Volcarona to survive a strong Water-type move once, which allows Volcarona to set up on some common Water-types, such as Manaphy, or prevent powerful Water-type priority, such as Choice Band Azumarill's Aqua Jet, from ending its sweep prematurely. Lum Berry allows Volcarona to shake off status once, allowing it to either set up easier against Toxic users or continue its sweep against the likes of Prankster Thunder Wave from Thundurus. Finally, Flame Body allows Volcarona to potentially cripple physical attackers that hit its weaker Defense stat in order to beat it. Getting revenge killed by the likes of Azumarill or Mega Pinsir, for example, will make them vulnerable to Volcarona's Flame Body, and getting lucky enough to get a burn on them will cripple them heavily and help Volcarona's teammates.

Usage Tips
========

Due to Volcarona's huge Stealth Rock weakness, it is absolutely recommended that any entry hazards are removed before Volcarona comes in, as after the damage it takes upon switching in, it will be very difficult to find the chance to set up. Volcarona fares best in the mid- or late-game when its checks have been worn down to a sufficient degree that it might be able to initiate a sweep. It also tends to find more setup opportunities at these points in the game, as it can set up on Pokemon such as -2 Latios and threaten to overwhelm teams. Early-game, Volcarona is best brought in on Pokemon that can't threaten it, such as Celebi and Ferrothorn, and firing off attacks in an attempt to wear down its checks. Volcarona is usually such a threat that opponents will not hesitate to send in their checks to prevent it from doing too much early on, meaning you can utilize this to wear them down. Setting up early with Volcarona is not advised; due to the lack of recovery on this set, it normally only gets one chance to sweep, so judging when is best to start using Quiver Dance is vital to fulfill its potential.

Team Options
========

The first thing you should consider when choosing potential teammates for Volcarona is how you're going to remove entry hazards. Rapid Spin users are fantastic choices, as they allow you to preserve the entry hazards Volcarona appreciates on the opposing side of the field while clearing your side of any hazards. Starmie in particular synergizes well with Volcarona, and it appreciates Volcarona's ability to scare away Ferrothorn and Celebi. If Rapid Spin users can't fit onto your team, both Defog and Magic Bounce users can prevent entry hazards on your side. Latios and Latias are two of the most consistent Defog users in the tier, and can switch into Keldeo and other Water-types if you don't want to use Volcarona's Passho Berry at that point in the game. Mega Sableye can switch into many entry hazard setters in the tier and stop them in their tracks, while Volcarona can aid it in being able to take on many Fairy-types in the tier.

Offensive teammates generally vary depending on the coverage choices made; sets without Hidden Power Ground require a teammate that can remove Heatran, such as Keldeo and Starmie. Dugtrio can even trap it and remove it without needing to predict; however, bringing it in against Heatran can be tricky. Sets without Bug Buzz will generally struggle to break down bulky Psychic-types, so pairing Volcarona with a Pursuit trapper such as Tyranitar or Bisharp can alleviate this issue, and Volcarona can support these Pokemon by taking on the likes of Scizor and Breloom. Whatever coverage options are chosen, Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y will always threaten Volcarona, so team options to deal with these Pokemon are necessary. Both hate Stealth Rock, so setting this up is a great start to beating them. Tyranitar is a very smart option, being able to set up the entry hazard consistently and also check Talonflame, though it must be wary of Mega Charizard Y's Focus Blast. Mega Manectric can threaten both with its powerful Thunderbolt and great Speed, as well as potentially giving Volcarona free switches with Volt Switch. Finally, sun support turns Volcarona into a real nuke, but the only viable setter of it is Mega Charizard Y, which cannot hold a Heat Rock and shares a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, meaning entry hazard removal will be incredibly vital to any team wishing to run this pair.

Other Options
########

Sitrus Berry is an alternative item over Passho or Lum Berry, helping Volcarona if its teammates could not remove Stealth Rock before it came in, allowing it to be at a reasonable amount of health to attempt setting up. However, it only works once and generally doesn't help Volcarona as much in sweeping as the other Berries used. Expert Belt or Charcoal can be used instead of the Berries mentioned; Charcoal powers up the already very spammable Fire Blast, while Expert Belt makes use of Volcarona's great coverage. Life Orb grants Volcarona incredible power and allows it to wallbreak with more success, but it makes Volcarona much more limited to the late-game as a sweeper due to Life Orb recoil racking up if it tries to fire off too many attacks early-game. A bulky set with Quiver Dance and Roost could be used instead of the offensive Quiver Dance set, but it's generally lackluster, as it deprives Volcarona of necessary coverage and does not give Volcarona enough Speed to outspeed fast threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T at +1. As for extra coverage, Hidden Power Ice can be an interesting option, allowing Volcarona to break through the likes of Dragonite, which would otherwise be a strong answer to it. Fiery Dance offers a 100% accurate STAB move with a 50% chance to raise Volcarona's Special Attack, but the power difference between it and Fire Blast is very notable, especially when Volcarona is unboosted.

Checks & Counters
########

**Chansey**: Thanks to its incredible special bulk, Chansey walls even boosted Volcarona effectively and can either wear it down with Seismic Toss or Toxic or choose to paralyze it and take away its chance at sweeping.

**Stealth Rock**: Taking 50% damage as it comes in really hinders Volcarona's ability to set up and makes it that much more susceptible to having its sweep ended by priority.

**Bulky Dragon-types**: Mega Altaria and Dragonite in particular can stop Volcarona in its tracks, not fearing any of its common sets. Bulky Mega Charizard X can do the same to an extent but dislikes boosted Hidden Power Ground, especially if it's taking Stealth Rock damage as it comes in.

**Bulky Fire-types**: Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Assault Vest Entei all serve as solid checks to Volcarona, as most of them can take a hit at +1 and OHKO back. However, if Volcarona's running Hidden Power Ground, Entei can only handle it at +1 or less, while it will destroy Heatran.

**Bulky Water-types**: Pokemon such as Assault Vest Azumarill and Gyarados can check Volcarona but are relatively shaky checks and can struggle to do so effectively if entry hazards are up.

**Faster Choice Scarf Users**: The likes of Choice Scarf Garchomp and Keldeo will do huge damage to Volcarona, outspeeding it at +1.
