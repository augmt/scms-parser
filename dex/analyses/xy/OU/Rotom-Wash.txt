Overview
########
Rotom-W is a premier pivot in the OU metagame that is able to switch into a number of common Pokemon, such as Azumarill, Talonflame, and Landorus-T. Due to its access to Will-O-Wisp and sufficient defenses enabling it to pivot into a number of offensive threats, it is very easy to fit into a balanced or a slower-paced offensive team. However, Rotom-W has a low HP stat, and its lack of reliable recovery makes it easy for the foe to wear it down. In addition, there are a slew of Pokemon in OU that are capable of getting past Rotom-W through sheer power, specific coverage, or through other aspects.

move 2: Hydro Pump

move 4: Pain Split / Rest

item: Leftovers / Chesto Berry
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========
Volt Switch is Rotom-W's Electric STAB move that allows it to regain momentum after pivoting into a threat. Hydro Pump is Rotom-W's secondary STAB that allows it to beat some of the Pokemon it checks, most notably Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Mamoswine, which are immune to Volt Switch. Will-O-Wisp allows Rotom-W to inflict burns on the foe and deter physical attackers. Pain Split can be used when Rotom-W's HP is low to regain some HP, but it tends to be very inconsistent overall due to being dependent on the foe's HP. Rest in tandem with Chesto Berry can be used instead, but Chesto Berry only works once, whereas Pain Split can be used multiple times; it is best used if Rotom-W's team is weak to status.

Set Details
========
248 HP EVs and 252 Defense EVs give Rotom-W close to maximum HP while allowing it to take less passive damage from Stealth Rock, status, etc. Leftovers is appreciated for its passive recovery, as Rotom-W gets worn down rather easily. However, if Rotom-W is running Rest, then Chesto Berry should be used instead. If outrunning particular threats is important, then 44 Speed EVs can be taken from Defense and put into Speed to outrun Jolly Azumarill so Rotom-W will be able to burn it after a Belly Drum, but Jolly Azumarill is not particularly common. Alternatively, 88 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Jolly Crawdaunt, or 128 Speed EVs to outrun Adamant Bisharp, both at the cost of some bulk. A Bold Nature allows Rotom-W to take physical attacks from Pokemon such as Azumarill and Mega Pinsir better. If some more special bulk is desired, Rotom-W can run a mixed defensive spread of 248 HP / 152 Def / 108 SpD to enable it to take hits from Mega Manectric, Landorus, Latios, and Latias much more easily.

Usage Tips
========
Rotom-W should be used to pivot into common Pokemon that it can check, such as Talonflame, Azumarill, Landorus-T, and Sand Rush Excadrill. However, do not let Rotom-W get worn down too much, as it needs to be healthy to handle many of the Pokemon whose attacks it does not resist. Use Volt Switch for scouting and gaining momentum, especially against threats that do not want to stay in on Rotom-W, such as Azumarill, Landorus-T, and Talonflame. Be careful when using Will-O-Wisp if a Conkeldurr or Guts Heracross is on the opponent's team. Otherwise, feel free to use it to cripple opposing Pokemon.

Team Options
========
Landorus-T forms a solid VoltTurn core with Rotom-W that is able to check most physical attackers in OU in tandem with each other. Scizor also can form a VoltTurn core and has good defensive synergy with Rotom-W as well. Rotom-W appreciates teammates that can beat Grass-types that would want to take advantage of Rotom-W. Celebi can beat Breloom and Chesnaught, set up on Ferrothorn, and can check Mega Sceptile, thus making a good teammate. On the same token, Rotom-W is a team supporter, so Pokemon that are troubled by threats that Rotom-W checks, such as Mega Gallade and Mega Lopunny, are good teammates. Setup sweepers appreciate Rotom-W's ability to spread burns and bring them in safely with Volt Switch to make securing setup opportunities easier. Examples include Swords Dance Talonflame and Swords Dance Diggersby.

Other Options
########
Thunderbolt is stronger than Volt Switch if Rotom-W wants more power, but Rotom-W does not have the space for it. However, the advantage of not forcing a switch allows Rotom-W to stay in against Water-types. Thunder Wave can help Rotom-W spread paralysis, but Will-O-Wisp is better overall, as Will-O-Wisp allows Rotom-W to cripple many of the Pokemon it switches into. A Choice Scarf set with Trick has a surprise factor, but wastes Rotom-W's defensive capabilities, one of its key selling points behind its use. Alternatively, Rotom-W can run a specially defensive set that allows it to switch into Landorus, but it forgoes the physical bulk that it needs to stomach attacks from many of the Pokemon it is supposed to pivot into. At the cost of some bulk, Rotom-W can run a more offensive set with 220 HP / 128 SpA / 160 Spe EVs and Hidden Power Fire or Signal Beam that allows it to provide some offensive pressure and lure in Ferrothorn or Celebi, respectively. In a similar vein, a Choice Specs set can be used instead, which gives Rotom-W a chance to provide more pressure against balanced teams.

Checks and Counters
########
**Grass-types**: Grass-types can switch into Rotom-W without taking much from its attack, though some of them, such as Breloom and Mega Venusaur, dislike Will-O-Wisp. Celebi counters Rotom-W, not fearing Will-O-Wisp due to Natural Cure, and is able to set up on it or force it out. Serperior can use Rotom-W as setup fodder, whereas Mega Sceptile gets a free Special Attack boost from Volt Switch due to Lightning Rod.

**Fairy-types**: A number of Fairy-types, such as Magic Guard Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and mixed or specially offensive Mega Altaria can prove to be troublesome for Rotom-W, as Rotom-W struggles to break through most of these Pokemon, whereas they possess the potential to break Rotom-W back.

**Dragon-types**: Rotom-W lacks the ability to pressure Latios and Latias outside of Will-O-Wisp, whereas they can wall it back. Mega Altaria can heal off Will-O-Wisp with Heal Bell or Refresh and proceed to set up on Rotom-W.

**Guts Users**: Guts users, such as Heracross and Conkeldurr, can gain an Attack boost from Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp. However, Heracross will get worn down very easily by Rotom-W's attacks. Conkeldurr, on the other hand, has the bulk to be able to stomach these attacks and hit hard back.

**Specially Defensive Walls**: Specially bulky Pokemon like Chansey and Cresselia can wall Rotom-W and proceed it to cripple it with Toxic.
