Overview
########

Rotom-W is one the best bulky pivots in the tier, thanks to its typing, decent stats, and movepool. Its Electric / Water typing is very useful for taking on powerful and common threats in the tier such as Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, and Azumarill. Levitate in conjunction with its Water typing allows it to check common Ground-types as well, such as Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and even non-Substitute Garchomp. Furthermore, it has the perfect support moves to fit its role, with STAB Volt Switch providing valuable momentum, Pain Split healing it while damaging the opponent, Trick to cripple walls; (most notably Chansey, a common switch-in to Rotom-W, and Will-O-Wisp to threaten physical attackers.

Unfortunately, it is Rotom-W's strengths that have made the metagame adapt around it. While Rotom-W has an amazing typing, its low HP means its bulk isn't as naturally high as it might like. Teams that use Rotom-W to check the previously mentioned Pokemon will often find that it's hard-pressed to cover them all, considering its only recovery move is Pain Split or the unreliable Rest. However, with even the slightest amount of support, Rotom-W can truly shine in this metagame.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Pain Split / Rest
ability: Levitate
item: Leftovers / Chesto Berry
evs: 248 HP / 216 Def / 44 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

This set is the perfect combination of defensive and offensive presence, making it a perfect Pokemon for balanced teams. Rotom-W has access to STAB Volt Switch, which allows it to assume the role of a defensive pivot against Pokemon like Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, and Azumarill. This means that even if the opponent has a Latias, Mega Venusaur, or another counter in the wings, Rotom-W can simply Volt Switch into another Pokemon that has a better match-up against said counter. Hydro Pump is useful for hitting the Ground-types that Rotom-W can usually switch into with ease, namely Hippowdon and Landorus-T. Neither of these Pokemon can take a Hydro Pump well, nor will they appreciate a burn courtesy of Will-O-Wisp. The threat of Will-O-Wisp can also force certain physical attackers to switch. This includes Bisharp, Garchomp, Azumarill, and many others. The last move is dedicated to healing Rotom-W as best as it can. Pain Split is useful because it allows Rotom-W to also run Leftovers, gradually recovering its HP throughout the match. It also damages the opponent if they switch in something like Chansey or Mega Venusaur and Rotom-W is at mid or low health. However, Rest has its merits as well. If Rotom-W gets hit with a status move, Rest is useful for healing it. Rest also completely heals Rotom-W, while Pain Split is dependent on the opponent's health. However, Rest is unreliable, as it can only be used once with a Chesto Berry without putting Rotom-W to sleep. Thunder Wave can be used over Will-O-Wisp, but it is usually an inferior option, as common switch-ins to Rotom-W, such as Latias, Quagsire, Chansey, and Mega Venusaur, dislike burns more than paralysis.

Set Details
========

The 44 Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed Jolly max Speed Belly Drum Azumarill. A physically defensive set is best suited to the metagame, and makes it easier for Rotom-W to counter powerful Flying-types such as Mega Pinsir and Talonflame. 4 EVs are taken out of HP to reach a jump point in Defense with 216 EVs and minimize Stealth Rock damage; especially because Rotom-W's Leftovers are often removed by Knock Off, this outweighs the Leftovers number granted by running full HP investment. A specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 216 SpD / 44 Spe is also perfectly viable, allowing Rotom-W to check common specially offensive threats such as Greninja, Landorus, and Keldeo a bit better.

Usage Tips
========

Rotom-W has a great typing and ability that gives it many useful resistances. Because of this, it is one of the best defensive pivots in the game. However, there tends to be a lot of defensive pressure on Rotom-W, as many people expect it to check Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Azumarill, Garchomp, Mamoswine, and other Pokemon all at once. For this reason, it's important to realize that it is simply not possible to do all these things, so the rest of the team should try and help it do its job. Rotom-W forces a lot of switches, so the option to either Volt Switch or Will-O-Wisp can be tricky. Don't be afraid to use Will-O-Wisp instead of Volt Switch, as only Pokemon like Mega Charizard X can safely switch into a Rotom-W that might Volt Switch or Will-O-Wisp. Sometimes people will even switch in their Ground-type in on a predicted Volt Switch, but none of these appreciate being burned.

Team Options
========

Rotom-W is one of the best users of Volt Switch in the tier, so common users of U-turn also tend to work well with it. Scizor and Landorus-T are among the best partners for Rotom-W. Scizor in particular covers Rotom-W's weaknesses well, and Mega Scizor loves to set up on common switch-ins to Rotom-W, such as Latios, Latias, and Mega Venusaur (beware of Hidden Power Fire and Sleep Powder). Pokemon weak to Mamoswine, such as Dragonite and Garchomp, really appreciate having Rotom-W, as it is nearly a perfect counter to Mamoswine, unless it carries Freeze Dry. Also, Pokemon that don't appreciate Mega Pinsir love having Rotom-W as a partner. Offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo and defensive Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur are both good options. Ferrothorn can somewhat handle Pokemon like Greninja and Manaphy, and can set up entry hazards for VoltTurn teams.

Other Options
########

A Choice Scarf set can be used as an offensive pivot in a VoltTurn core and is able to cripple an opposing defensive Pokemon with Trick. Its main problem is frailty without defensive investment, which makes it difficult for it to check numerous threats it could otherwise. A Choice Specs set can be used for extra power, but usually Rotom-W has better things to be doing and this role conflicts with Manaphy and Keldeo. On a similar note, a Life Orb or Expert Belt set that relies on Pain Split for recovery can be used similar to Gengar, but it runs into the same issue that Choice Specs set does; it's simply outshined as a special attacker. Dual Screens can work, as Rotom-W can also provide valuable momentum, but both Deoxys formes and Latios tend to be more universally useful aside from their crippling Psychic typing. Rotom-W can run Hidden Power Grass to hit Quagsire, but Quagsire is mostly used on stall teams, and those will usually have a better switch-in to Rotom-W than Quagsire.

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Pain Split / Rest
ability: Levitate
item: Leftovers / Chesto Berry
evs: 252 HP / 212 SpD / 44 Spe
nature: Calm

Moves
========
Rotom-W's STAB move combination is truly excellent. Volt Switch makes up the first half of that combination, allowing Rotom-W to pivot in and out of battle with ease, as well as dealing handy chip damage, to wear down would-be counters such as Mega Venusaur. Hydro Pump works extremely well in tandem with Volt Switch, nailing Ground-types such as Excadrill and Landorus that Rotom-W is often called upon to check. This variant of Rotom-W is somewhat more susceptible to physical attacks, which makes Will-O-Wisp even more useful. Crippling physical attackers and generally wearing down the opposing team is great in terms of utility, as common switch-ins including Latias, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur dislike being burned. Unfortunately, Rotom-W's lack of reliable recovery means that its last move is restricted to a choice between Pain Split and Rest. Pain Split is preferred as it allows Rotom-W to carry Leftovers, and it can have the convenient effect of damaging the opponent if they are healthier than Rotom-W. However, Rest is also a viable choice that clears bothersome status and is more reliable when the opposing Pokemon is considerably weakened. Finally, Thunder Wave can be used over Will-O-Wisp to cripple Fire-types, especially Mega Charizard X, but is usually a lesser choice as most of Rotom-W's checks are more hindered by a burn than by paralysis.

Set Details
========
The given EV spread and a Calm nature emphasize Special Defense for Rotom-W to take on the likes of Landorus, Greninja, and Thundurus. 44 Speed EVs are very important in order to outrun Jolly Belly Drum Azumarill and burn it, or KO it with Volt Switch. Leftovers is the item of choice if Pain Split is used, and Chesto Berry for sets using Rest.

Usage Tips
========
Generally speaking, this set is designed to check many of the strong special attackers in the tier, such as Greninja and Landorus. It is wise to use Rotom-W as a pivot rather than a wall, exploiting its excellent typing and ability while spreading burns and switching out when necessary by using Volt Switch. Will-O-Wisp and Volt Switch are the key moves on the set, and they should be used to take advantage of the many switches that Rotom-W tends to force; be wary of Lum Berry or Substitute users in the case of Will-O-Wisp, though. Bear in mind that without physical investment, Rotom-W is less reliable when it comes to countering the likes of Mega Pinsir and Talonflame, so play with slightly more caution against these threats. It is also important to avoid falling into the trap of using Rotom-W too excessively, as it can be worn down fairly easily, especially Pain Split variants.

Team Options
========
Pokemon that form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W are excellent partners. Landorus-T stands out as it has great type synergy and can check strong physical threats such as Mega Charizard X. Scizor works similarly well; Mega Scizor can also easily set up on Pokemon that threaten Rotom-W, such as Latias and Ferrothorn. Hit-and-run attackers such as Choice Specs Keldeo and Mega Medicham make for fantastic teammates, as Rotom-W can often pivot in once they have landed a blow and been subsequently forced out. This set is a particularly effective answer to all variants of Mamoswine, including Freeze Dry sets, and thus works well alongside Garchomp and Dragonite. Ferrothorn and Skarmory can handle most Grass-type Pokemon and lay down entry hazards to enhance the effectiveness of Rotom-W's pivoting.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Grass-types**: Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn are all decent choices to counter Rotom-W. They take very little from either Rotom-W's STAB moves or its rare coverage moves. However, with the exception of Celebi, they don't appreciate being burned by Will-O-Wisp. Ferrothorn can also wear down Rotom-W with Leech Seed and Power Whip. Leech Seed will even mitigate burn damage. Poison Heal Breloom is immune to status, so it also makes for a great switch-in to Rotom-W, and can even use it as setup fodder.

**Bulky Dragon-types**: Neither Latios nor Latias care about being hit by Hydro Pump, and usually don't care much about burns either. They can also 2HKO defensive Rotom-W with a Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor. Bulky Charizard X doesn't mind taking Hydro Pump, Thunderbolt, or Volt Switch, and also cannot be burned or Tricked, making it an excellent switch-in to Rotom-W. Kyurem-B can switch in on any move besides Will-O-Wisp and hit Rotom-W through Levitate with Earth Power thanks to Teravolt.

**Chansey**: Chansey has huge special bulk to tank Volt Switches and Hydro Pumps and Natural Cure to heal itself of burn if it switches into a Will-O-Wisp. It can also Toxic Rotom-W to wear it down and negate its Leftovers recovery. However, Chansey is probably Rotom-W's biggest target for Trick, so Chansey must be somewhat cautious around it.

**Assault Vest Conkeldurr**: Conkeldurr takes relatively little damage from Hydro Pump and Volt Switch and actually enjoys being burned thanks to Guts. Conkeldurr can also Knock Off Rotom-W's item, which it heavily depends on for recovery and utility. With a Guts boost, Drain Punch can score a 2HKO on even physically defensive Rotom-W while recovering Conkeldurr's own health. It does have to watch out for Trick from Choice Scarf Rotom-W, however.
