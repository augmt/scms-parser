Overview
########

- Unique typing allows it to resist the plethora of Dark- and Ghost-type attacks such as Sucker Punch, Pursuit, and Shadow Sneak.
- Received an intriguing buff with Steel losing its Dark-type resistance
- Sports an impressive base 125 Special Attack, 105 Attack, and trolly 97 Speed.
- Has a rather big movepool to accommodate its stats and typing.
- Quadruple weakness to Fairy and relies on Iron Tail / Flash Cannon to bail out of its Fairy-type problems.
- 97 Speed is mediocre as far as sweeping goes.
- Charge Beam and Work Up are its only stat-boosting attacks.
- Faces stiff competition from other Dragon-types such as Mega Charizard X and other Dark-types such as Bisharp.

Mixed Attacker
########
set name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Dark Pulse
move 2: Draco Meteor
move 3: Iron Tail / Superpower
move 4: Fire Blast
ability: Levitate
item: Life Orb
nature: Rash / Mild
evs: 40 Atk / 236 SpA / 232 Spe

Moves
========

- Dark Pulse is Hydreigon's best STAB thanks to Steel-type losing its resistance.
- Draco Meteor gives Hydreigon another powerful STAB to utilize against bulkier threats such as Hippowdon and Mega Venusaur/
- Iron Tail is necessary to 2HKO Clefable and Sylveon while still doing respectable damage to Tyranitar.
- Superpower is Hydreigon's best attack to attempt to bypass Chansey, Blissey, and Impish Tyranitar. It also hits Heatran.
- Fire Blast hits Bisharp and other Steel-types.
- Roost can be used to keep Hydreigon healthy.
- Charge Beam 2HKOes Azumarill on the switch assuming Charge Beam gives Hydreigon a Special Attack boost.

Set Details
========

- 232 Speed EVs outspeed neutral nature Kyurem-B.
- 40 Attack is necessary to 2HKO Clefable and Sylveon as well as 2HKO Blissey and Chansey with Superpower - the latter needing Stealth Rock to 2HKO reliably.
- Rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack to maximize Dark Pulse, Draco Meteor, and Fire Blast's power.
- Rash makes Hydreigon less prone to priority attacks such as Mach Punch and Bullet Punch while Mild allows Hydreigon to take weaker Special Attacks easier.


Usage Tips
========

- Hydreigon is mostly used as a Pokemon that punches holes through bulkier teams instead of attempting to sweep.
- Iron Tail should be utilized if Fairy-types are a huge concern. Alternatively, Superpower should be used if Chansey and Blissey are more problematic.
- Be careful about overusing Draco Meteor as the Special Attack drop can leave Hydreigon vulnerable to being set up on.
- Superpower can also leave Hydreigon more vulnerable to Pursuit as the Defense drop and potential Mild nature makes even resisted Pursuit hurt.

Team Options
========

- Stealth Rock support is great for securing 2HKOes on many Pokemon. Heatran does well at checking the majority of Fairy-types while Pokemon such as Skarmory handle Fighting-types a little easier.
- Pivots such as Rotom-W, Mega Scizor, and Landorus-T also work well with helping Hydreigon have an easier time switching in.
- Without Superpower you'll need some raw power from Pokemon such as Terrakion or Conkeldurr to bust through Chansey and Blissey.
- Mega Venusaur also helps check the majority of Fairy-types such as Azumarill and Sylveon thanks to its Poison-typing and access to STAB Sludge Bomb.
- Sweepers such as Keldeo appreciate the Pokemon that Hydreigon can help eliminate or soften up.


Other Options
########

- Choice Scarf allows Hydreigon to outspeed some common threats and gain surprise on some of them; however, it is not really that fast after a Choice Scarf and the power drop is noticeable.
- Choice Specs hits harder than Life Orb, but it is also more predictable and easier to take advantage of sometimes.
- U-turn is great for scouting and keeps Hydreigon unique.
- Tailwind can boost Hydreigon and its teammates Speed for four turns.
- Work Up boosts Hydreigon's Attack and Special Attack.
- Flash Cannon works for Specs.
- Substitute can be used as Hydreigon can force switches and sometimes attacking head-on isn't always the best option.
- Expert Belt over Life Orb but the power drop is severe; especially with Draco Meteor only hitting Dragon-types for super effective damage.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Without Iron Tail Hydreigon is very prone to Fairy-types such as Clefable, Sylveon, and Azumarill. With Hydreigon having a quadruple weakness to Fairy, KOing it is nothing difficult for Fairy-type Pokemon.

**Special Walls**: Without Superpower Umbreon, Chansey, and Blissey become major headaches for Hydreigon to bypass. Umbreon can wear out Hydreigon with STAB Foul Play while using Wish and Protect to heal itself. Chansey and Blissey take little damage from any attack Hydreigon throws, barring Superpower, and can force Hydreigon out with Seismic Toss.

**Assault Vest Users**: Some Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Machamp can stomach any attack, barring repeated Draco Meteors, and scare off Hydreigon with STAB Drain Punch and STAB DynamicPunch, respectively. Conkeldurr can also revenge kill weakened Hydreigon with STAB Mach Punch.

**Revenge Killers**: Priority attackers such as Conkeldurr, Breloom, and Mega Scizor can finish off a weakened Hydreigon. Hydreigon's mediocre Speed leaves it very vulnerable to revenge killers such as Garchomp, Latias, Latios, and Greninja.
