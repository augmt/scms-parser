Overview
########

Politoed seems like a fairly unimpressive Pokemon at first glance, but it has access to a great ability in Drizzle that makes it a crucial Pokemon for OU rain teams. It's not that bad of a Pokemon either, as its defenses are high enough for it to tank some fairly strong hits and set up rain multiple times in a match. Furthermore, it has decent offensive stats, a Speed stat that places it just above Clefable and Azumarill with a little bit of investment, and an outstanding support movepool with several options it can profit from, such as Toxic, Encore, and Perish Song. With the weather nerf in XY, rain's popularity as a playstyle has decreased, but that doesn't mean it cannot still be effective. Politoed's major flaw is its lack of reliable recovery, which limits its supportive capabilities, but Rest is usually enough for this concern to be minor. It also has Grass and Electric weaknesses that are compounded by the Water-type Pokemon that enjoy the rain support it provides, forcing the rest of the team to compensate for this, and it is really only viable on rain teams, but these factors don't stop Politoed from being the single most effective form of support for rain teams.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Scald
move 2: Toxic / Hypnosis
move 3: Encore
move 4: Rest
ability: Drizzle
item: Damp Rock
evs: 248 HP / 164 SpD / 96 Spe
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Scald is a solid STAB move that is boosted by the rain, which Politoed sets up, and has a useful chance to burn the foe, thus dissuading physical attackers. Toxic wears down bulkier Pokemon and cripples foes such as Latios and Latias that don't really mind a Scald even if it burns. Hypnosis can also be used to put opposing threats to sleep, but it isn't as consistent as Toxic due to its low accuracy and how luck-based the effectiveness of sleep can be in general. Encore prevents Politoed from being taken advantage of by setup sweepers, especially Dragon Dance users and Calm Mind Clefable, and allows it to take advantage of defensive Pokemon that have just used a support move by locking them into the move. The combination of Encore + Toxic is particularly potent against Mega Slowbro, making Politoed an effective check to Calm Mind variants. Rest fills the last moveslot as an important form of recovery for Politoed and allows it to switch in more often to get up rain. A moveslot can also be filled in with Ice Beam, which threatens the Dragon-type Pokemon that like to take advantage of Politoed.

Set Details
========

96 Speed EVs are enough for Politoed to outspeed max Speed Azumarill and lock it into Belly Drum with Encore if it has just used the move. The HP and Special Defense EVs in addition to a Calm nature are conducive to increasing Politoed's longevity and allow it to deal with threats such as Mega Charizard Y. Defense investment and a Bold nature can be run instead to better handle Pokemon such as Talonflame and Tyranitar, but these are fairly easy to cover with teammates and generally not much of a concern for rain teams.

Usage Tips
========

If rain has stopped but is needed for a certain Pokemon to sweep or do its job better, switch Politoed in, as it will summon rain again for eight turns. Politoed is also a good switch-in to other weather setters, as their weather will be removed and replaced by rain; this is especially useful against Mega Charizard Y, which can't reliably use Solar Beam outside of the sun. Try to avoid letting Politoed take a Knock Off, as not having Damp Rock will shorten the length of Politoed's rain by three turns and thus hinder the rest of the rain team. Scald is typically the best option to spam, as it is relatively powerful and nothing really appreciates a burn. Toxic should generally be used to catch Latios, Latias, and certain defensive Pokemon on the switch. Encore foes on their use of a setup move; this will force them to switch. Afterwards, Politoed can decide to switch out if it can't handle the incoming Pokemon.

Team Options
========

Swift Swim users and other Pokemon that profit from rain, such as Mega Swampert, Kingdra, and Tornadus-T, make great partners, as they benefit from Politoed's rain. Ferrothorn is a solid check to Azumarill, which is a significant issue for rain teams, and benefits from the decreased power of Fire-type moves; other Pokemon weak to Fire-type attacks, such as Mega Scizor, Breloom, and Mega Metagross, appreciate Politoed's support for this reason. Other good partners include those that can beat Electric-types that trouble Politoed, such as Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Mega Swampert. Teammates such as Mega Pinsir and Tornadus-T can threaten Grass-types that trouble Politoed and rain teams in general, so they make great partners as well. Last but not least, other Pokemon that can set up rain, such as Thundurus and Zapdos, are good choices for rain teams, as they can serve as back-up rain setters if Politoed is pressured or has been taken out.

Other Options
########

An offensive set along the lines of Hydro Pump / Ice Beam / Focus Blast / Psychic can be run with an EV spread of 56 HP / 252 SpA / 200 Spe and a Modest nature, but it is usually not worth it because it takes away from Politoed's longevity and thus its main role, which is functioning as a rain supporter. Perish Song + Whirlpool is an option to trap and remove certain Pokemon, but it only has situational benefits. Sleep Talk can be run so that Politoed has the ability to move while asleep, but Politoed has a lot of moves fighting for slots as it is, so it is usually forgone. Haze is another option that stop foes from setting up and mess up Baton Pass teams, but Encore generally stops them too and has more utility because it stops defensive Pokemon better. An offensive Choice Scarf set is an option which suits Politoed as a revenge killer but reduces the number of rain turns, which are really important for Politoed to do its job well.

Checks & Counters
########

**Latios and Latias**: Latios and Latias can take any hit Politoed throws at them and deal a lot of damage to it with Psyshock. However, they must be wary of Toxic.

**Chansey**: Chansey takes little damage from Scald and has both Heal Bell and Natural Cure to heal off status while being able to threaten Politoed in return with Seismic Toss, making it one of Politoed's most effective answers.

**Bulky Grass-types**: Bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Celebi threaten Politoed with their STAB attacks and can beat it relatively easily. However, none of them besides Celebi appreciate a Scald burn.

**Electric-types**: Powerful Electric-types, such as Magnezone and Thundurus, can beat Politoed quite easily with one of their STAB attacks.

**Other Weather**: Other weather setters such as Tyranitar and Mega Charizard Y can replace the rain with their abilities, preventing Politoed from supporting its teammates with rain.

**Water-types**: Water-types, especially SubCM Keldeo and Choice Band Azumarill, can be very threatening to Politoed because they resist Scald and can hit it hard.
