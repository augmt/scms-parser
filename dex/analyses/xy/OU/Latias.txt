Overview
########

Excellent Speed, typing, and bulk make Latias a solid threat in OU. By virtue of its Dragon / Psychic typing and reliable recovery, Latias checks common threats such as Thundurus, Landorus, Mega Charizard Y, Rotom-W, Celebi, Starmie, and Keldeo. Latias has an excellent support movepool, most notably including Healing Wish to revive setup sweepers and Defog to clear entry hazards. With access to Stored Power and a significantly bulkier Mega Evolution, Latias has regained its role as a Calm Mind user.

However, Latias faces competition from its twin, Latios, due to its greater offensive presence. Latias is also troubled by common Steel- and Fairy-types in OU, such as Heatran, Scizor, Mega Metagross, Bisharp, Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Azumarill, which prevent it from constantly using its STAB moves and threaten to OHKO or severely damage Latias. Despite its useful resistances, Latias is weak to common attacking types such as Dark, Ice, Bug, Fairy, and Dragon.

Offensive Support
########
name: Offensive Support
move 1: Defog
move 2: Draco Meteor
move 3: Psyshock / Thunderbolt
move 4: Healing Wish / Roost
ability: Levitate
item: Life Orb
evs: 72 HP / 184 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Defog clears all entry hazards from the field to support the team. Draco Meteor is a powerful STAB move that deals heavy damage to many offensive Pokemon such as Landorus, Thundurus, Mega Pinsir, Mega Gallade, and Mega Manectric. Psyshock is a secondary STAB move that targets specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey, Sylveon, and Azumarill, as well as Fighting- and Poison-types such as Keldeo, Breloom, Conkeldurr, Gengar, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss. Alternatively, Thunderbolt hits bulky Water- and Flying-types such as Azumarill, Suicune, Skarmory, and Mandibuzz. Thunderbolt also retains coverage on Keldeo, one of the most important Pokemon Latias is used to check. Healing Wish revives a weakened setup sweeper, giving it a second chance to sweep. Roost can be used if the utility of Healing Wish is not needed for your team, and it allows Latias to check said threats multiple times throughout a battle. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types such as Bisharp, Scizor, and Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fighting scores an OHKO on Bisharp whereas Hidden Power Fire cannot, as well as dealing solid damage to Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar. Surf is yet another coverage move that hits both Landorus formes, Gliscor, Hippowdon, Excadrill, and Heatran for solid damage. Alternate combinations of these moves apart from the given choices, such as a set with three attacks and Healing Wish, can be used if Defog support is not necessary; a set with Healing Wish, Roost, and two attacks can also be used.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature and maximum Speed investment is used to outspeed base 108 Speed Pokemon such as Keldeo and Terrakion and tie with opposing base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Gallade, Latios, Latias, and Gengar. The given EV spread lets Latias avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice without Stealth Rock damage and also hits a Life Orb number. Subsequently, the remaining 184 Special Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO on Landorus after Stealth Rock damage. Alternatively, a spread of 104 HP / 152 SpA / 252 Spe lets Latias survive a Life Orb-boosted Knock Off from Landorus after Stealth Rock damage. Lastly, a simple EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can be used if hitting hard is more beneficial to your team than the bulk.

Usage Tips
========

Latias should pivot into Pokemon that it walls or can take a hit from, such as Keldeo, Thundurus, Landorus, Rotom-W, Starmie, Celebi, and Mega Charizard Y. Despite being Latias's strongest attack, Draco Meteor should be used sparingly due to the numerous Pokemon that resist or are immune to it, and the Special Attack drops can give setup opportunities to deadly sweepers such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Scizor, Mega Sableye, Mega Diancie, and Bisharp. However, Draco Meteor's high power is important when revenge killing threats such as the aforementioned Landorus. That being said, Psyshock is often a fairly safe attack to go for, provided the opponent does not have a Dark-type. It is important to scout for coverage moves from the Pokemon that Latias typically walls, such as Icy Wind from Keldeo, Knock Off or Hidden Power Ice from Landorus and Thundurus, and Ice Beam from Starmie. Use Latias's support moves when given the opportunity versus the Pokemon it checks. Keep in mind that it is important to preserve Latias throughout the battle if the opponent has threats such as Mega Charizard Y or Keldeo.

Team Options
========

Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Conkeldurr, and Mega Lopunny make for excellent teammates, as they check Dark-types, particularly Bisharp. Fairy-types such as Clefable and Azumarill threaten opposing Dragons and check most Dark-types apart from Bisharp. Azumarill also appreciates Latias's ability to switch into Grass- and Electric-type attacks. Setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X, Calm Mind Keldeo, Swords Dance Mega Scizor, Dragon Dance Gyarados, Belly Drum Azumarill, and Manaphy value the support provided by Healing Wish.

Overview
########

With its Mega Evolution having increased bulk and offenses, as well as keeping its good Speed stat, Latias can be quite a troublesome Pokemon to deal with. Thanks to its great defensive typing, which grants it many useful resistances, and access to Calm Mind and reliable recovery, Latias is a certainly force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, it struggles to beat common Steel- and Dark-types, due to mostly being limited to its STAB moves when it comes to coverage. In addition to this, Unaware Clefable completely walls it, lowering Latias's usefulness.

Mega Calm Mind
########
name: Mega Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Roost
move 3: Reflect Type / Substitute
move 4: Stored Power / Psyshock
ability: Levitate
item: Latiasite
evs: 248 HP / 84 Def / 176 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

With Calm Mind boosting its Special Attack and Special Defense, Mega Latias can turn into a fearsome sweeper after just a few boosts. Roost gives Mega Latias reliable recovery, which goes very well alongside its good bulk, giving it great longevity. Reflect Type enables Latias to freely set up on Pokemon that would normally force it out, such as Ferrothorn, Mega Metagross, Tyranitar, and most Fairy-types. Substitute is an option over Reflect Type, as it lets Mega Latias avoid status conditions, such as burn, paralysis, and poison, and play mind games with Sucker Punch users. Stored Power is Latias's primary choice of a Psychic-type STAB move, as it is incredibly powerful after many Calm Mind boosts and is capable of breaking through even the bulkiest Pokemon. However, its damage output is low without any boosts, which is unwanted in many scenarios. Therefore, Psyshock is an option over Stored Power if having immediate power is preferred over the ability to easily sweep after multiple Calm Mind boosts. Running mono-Psychic coverage leaves Mega Latias unable to damage Dark-types, which are moderately common in the current metagame. Therefore, Dragon Pulse is an option over Reflect Type or Substitute to be able to hit most Dark-types for neutral damage. Hidden Power Fighting and Hidden Power Fire are also options over Reflect Type or Substitute if OHKOing Bisharp, 2HKOing Tyranitar, and dealing massive damage to Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn is more valuable to your team than Reflect Type and Substitute's utility or a Dragon-type STAB move.

Set Details
========

The given EVs in Speed let Latias outspeed neutral-natured base 100s, while the remaining EVs are put in HP and Defense to make setting up an easier task. For even more bulk, some EVs can be moved from Speed to Defense. A spread of 248 HP / 180 Def / 80 Speed outspeeds Adamant Excadrill and has an incredible amount of physical bulk. Latiasite is necessary for Latias to Mega Evolve and get the increased bulk it needs to act as a setup sweeper.

Usage Tips
========

If Latias is running Stored Power as its only attacking move, all Dark-types need to be taken care of before Latias can try to set up. Pokemon with Taunt also shut Latias down, so removing these foes before trying to sweep is advised. Mega Evolving as early as possible to gain the increased bulk is smart, as switching in and out becomes easier. However, if there is another potential Mega Evolution on Latias's team, waiting to Mega Evolve may confuse the opponent. Mega Latias fits well on defensive teams, thanks to being a great win condition with the ability to sweep many teams late-game. Using teammates that complement it defensively rather than offensively can lead to success.

Team Options
========

Fighting-types such as Keldeo, Infernape, Breloom, Chesnaught, and Terrakion make for great teammates, thanks to their ability to take on the Dark-types that threaten Latias. Strong physical attackers such as Swords Dance Mega Scizor, Swords Dance Diggersby, and Choice Band Tyranitar are also capable of breaking through Latias. Therefore, defensive Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Keldeo make for good teammates, as they are capable of taking these threats on. Pokemon that complement Mega Latias defensively by taking on some of the Pokemon Latias is unable to handle make for good teammates. Jirachi and Dragalge are capable of beating Clefable, while Hippowdon and Gliscor can handle Bisharp. Lastly, entry hazard support is greatly appreciated, as Latias forces many switches during a battle. Good setters of entry hazards include Ferrothorn, Hippowdon, and Chesnaught.

Other Options
########

A defensive set with moves such as Wish and Reflect Type has some merit, but Latias is generally outclassed as a defensive Psychic-type by Pokemon such as Celebi, Slowbro, and Cresselia. A dual screens set provides support for setup sweepers, but this role is generally better done by Azelf. Ice Beam hits both Landorus formes, Garchomp, Dragonite, and Gliscor for 4x super effective damage.

Checks & Counters
########

**Pursuit Trappers**: Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, Mega Metagross, and Weavile can pick off or KO a weakened Latias. However, all of them must fear a Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Fighting, and Weavile cannot switch into a Draco Meteor.

**Specially Bulky Pokemon**: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey, Hippowdon, and Celebi can easily take a hit from Latias and cripple it or pivot out into a teammate.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Heatran, Ferrothorn, Bisharp, Mega Scizor, and Jirachi resist Latias's STAB moves and threaten it with a strong attack. However, all of them with the exception of Heatran must be wary of Hidden Power Fire.

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Clefable, Mega Altaria, and Sylveon are immune to Draco Meteor and are bulky enough to shrug off a Psyshock.

**Revenge Killers**: Faster Pokemon such as Mega Houndoom, Weavile, and Thundurus and Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Diggersby, and Hydreigon can revenge kill a weakened Latias.
