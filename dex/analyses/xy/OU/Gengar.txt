Overview
########

Gengar returns for another bout in OU, still undisputed as the only Pokemon to consistently remain in the tier across all generations. It has always just been that good, and in XY it is no exception. It resists Fairy and can hit Fairy-types hard with its super effective Poison STAB moves, and the Steel-type losing its Ghost-type resistance makes it easier for Gengar to fit moves onto a set and harder to switch into it. Not all is good for Gengar though, as the presence of new priority users, former Ubers threats, Assault Vest users, and powerful Mega Evolutions leaves Gengar struggling to keep up. However, Gengar still remains as useful and unique as days past, as its typing, ability, and support movepool let it act as a powerful stallbreaker, while its offensive stats and very good Speed tier don't let it down against offensive teams. A number of other traits, such as acting as a spinblocker and an effective Destiny Bond user makes Gengar a rather consistent, yet still unpredictable choice for many teams.

Life Orb Attacker
########
name: Life Orb Attacker
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Sludge Wave
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Taunt / Substitute / Icy Wind
ability: Levitate
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
ivs: 29 HP
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Shadow Ball is Gengar's main STAB attack, as its neutral coverage is fantastic and it deals solid damage to most Pokemon. Sludge Wave is Gengar's secondary STAB attack, giving Gengar the ability to hit Fairy-types and Grass-types for super effective damage. Sludge Wave also hits some additional threats neutrally, such as Mandibuzz, Rotom-W, and Keldeo, and does more damage than Shadow Ball due to its higher Base Power. Focus Blast gives Gengar the ability to hit most Dark-types for super effective damage, dealing a lot of damage to or even OHKOing them. Alongside Shadow Ball it has perfect neutral coverage, and it gives Gengar a way of severely hurting more defensively-oriented Pokemon, such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Taunt is the primary choice for Gengar's last moveslot, as it stops defensively-oriented Pokemon such as Chansey and Amoonguss from healing and using status moves. It also prevents setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Gyarados from setting up. Substitute is an option over Taunt, as it allows Gengar to play around and take advantage of Sucker Punch. It also eases prediction against offensively oriented teams, which often carry Pokemon capable of switching into one or two of Gengar's attacks, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar. Like Taunt, it blocks status afflictions, but coupled with recoil from Life Orb, it will cause Gengar's health to go down fast. Finally, Icy Wind hits specially defensive Gliscor, a Pokemon commonly used to handle Gengar.

Set Details
========

Life Orb is the item of choice for this set, as it maximizes Gengar's damage output while maintaining the ability to switch moves. The given EV spread with a Timid nature makes Gengar's attacks deal as much damage as possible, while using its great Speed stat to its full extent. To take minimal recoil from Life Orb, running 29 HP IVs is required.

Usage Tips
========

Gengar can be very hard to deal with, especially for balanced and stall teams, as it often comes in for free on many staple Pokemon on stall teams. Therefore, bringing Gengar in on Clefable, Quagsire, and Gliscor and Mega Venusaur without Knock Off is advised. Against more offensive teams, Life Orb Gengar can prove to be a problem, as its unpredictability makes it hard to prepare for. Utilizing Gengar's great defensive typing and bringing it in on predicted Fighting-, Ground-, or Normal-type moves is the best way to use it against offensive teams. Many offensive threats, such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, are often Choice-locked, meaning Gengar can fire off an attack without the fear of getting attacked in return. If running Substitute, it's advised to use it carefully, as Gengar's health goes down very quickly with the recoil from both Substitute and Life Orb.

Team Options
========

Entry hazards support is strongly advised for Gengar to have an easier time breaking down bulkier cores. Therefore, Spikes users such as Ferrothorn make good teammates. Wallbreakers that can take advantage of the switches Gengar forces against stall teams, such as Keldeo, Crawdaunt, Mega Gardevoir, and Landorus, make good teammates as well, as the opponent's switch patterns often become predictable. U-turn or Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Mega Manectric make good partners, as they can give Gengar a free switch into their counters, such as Gliscor and Clefable, both of which are beaten by Gengar. Pokemon that appreciate having the likes of Mega Venusaur, Clefable, and Gliscor taken out, such as Azumarill, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Mega Heracross, make great teammates, as breaking down the opposing team becomes much easier when Gengar has broken down their counters. Defensive, bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor make good teammates due to their typing, as they can come in on priority attacks that threaten Gengar.

Hex
########
name: Hex
move 1: Hex
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Sludge Wave / Substitute
ability: Levitate
item: Black Sludge
evs: 8 HP / 248 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Hex allows Gengar to deal a good amount of damage to specially defensive Gliscor without having to take Life Orb recoil. Its 130 Base Power against Pokemon with status makes up for the poor power on Pokemon without status; this can turn Gengar into an unstoppable sweeper against stall teams as well as a decent late-game cleaner if the enemy's team has been weakened by status. Will-O-Wisp is Gengar's own method of spreading status, and is good to spam early- to mid-game in order to weaken the enemy's team if Gengar can't sweep yet. It's also Gengar's best way to wear down Chansey with residual damage, as Chansey is immune to Hex. Taunt prevents walls from recovering from the residual damage Gengar spreads. Sludge Wave is a more flexible option if you prefer a coverage move over Substitute; it is especially useful against Calm Mind Clefable, as it can eat a Hex and boost to avoid the 2HKO even if it has been statused. Substitute enables Gengar to set up on switches or on Pokemon that can't touch it, such as Chansey and Diggersby. It eases prediction a lot, but it is more suited to very defensive teams that apply low amounts of pressure. The choice between Substitute and Sludge Wave depends on your team. Sludge Wave is more suited to teams leaning toward a balanced style, whereas Substitute usually works best on stall.


Set Details
========

Gengar needs to use a Timid nature with maximum investment in Speed to Speed tie with Latios and Latias and outspeed the likes of Keldeo, Terrakion, and Mega Pinsir. Maximum investment in Special Attack provides Gengar with the highest chance to 2HKO specially defensive Gliscor, even after the Poison Heal recovery. If you decide to go with Substitute over Sludge Wave, you might want to try a bulkier spread such as 144 HP / 108 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe. The defensive investment increases Gengar's longevity significantly, which can be crucial for this set to perform well. The EVs make sure Clefable's Moonblast does not break Gengar's Substitute and allow Gengar to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice after Black Sludge recovery. The Special Attack investment ensures that Gengar will always 2HKO Gliscor after Stealth Rock.


Usage Tips
========

Be careful, as Gengar is probably your main win condition against stall teams, so you have to be patient. It can be better to let a teammate faint to let Gengar set up safely instead of switching it in recklessly, given the way it threatens this team archetype. On the other hand, you will probably not have a lot of chances to bring in Gengar, so your planning must be on point to never miss an opportunity and at the same time, never overcommit with Gengar. As this set's utility is greatly reduced against more offensive teams, it is important to make good use of Gengar against these teams as well. Burning a threat at the risk of Gengar's health is usually better than saving it for an unlikely late-game sweep. Inflicting status on annoying special sponges such as Heatran and setting up entry hazards are usually the only requirements securing a good Hex sweep. Hiding the set is really important, because this set carries a surprise factor. If your opponent knows that your sweep relies on Hex, they'll try to make spreading status harder, and will be possibly less afraid of your Gengar early- to mid-game.


Team Options
========

Since spreading status is key, Pokemon that are able to paralyze, burn, or poison enemies are needed. In addition, teammates that can take care of Pokemon that are immune to status such as Heatran, which has great special bulk and can't be burned nor poisoned, deserve a special mention. Ferrothorn or Clefable with Thunder Wave can effectively lure Heatran and even possibly Knock Off its Leftovers. In addition, Pokemon that can use Knock Off are appreciated, given how important residual damage is for Gengar. Mew can spread status, Knock Off items, and handle faster special threats such as Latios and Latias. Gliscor makes for another great teammate because it can spread status, use Knock Off, and stall burned or poisoned Pokemon. VoltTurn partners are important in order to unlock Gengar's potential by providing it possible free switch-ins. Rotom-W and Mega Manectric are good at baiting Chansey in order to create a safe setup opportunity and gear your team toward a faster pace. Electric-types are great teammates in general because they can attract Ground-types; Gengar can take advantage of such Ground-types, especially Choice-locked Landorus-T. Knowing this, your opponent will probably not opt for that move, which gives Electric-types a clear edge during mindgames. When teambuilding with this set, you need to cover the other matchups because Gengar's usefulness will be reduced greatly if it's not maneuvering around defensive cores, especially when it has to face fast Pokemon that don't need to set up such as Talonflame and Thundurus. This set is usually present in defensive teams because they provide Gengar with teammates that are able to handle these sweepers. 

Other Options
########

Gengar has a couple of miscellaneous coverage options that can beat some specific Pokemon, such as Energy Ball, Psychic, and Dazzling Gleam, but these moves have limited application compared to the versatility and strength of Gengar's normal options. Destiny Bond can be used in order to better deal with offensive threats. A Choice Specs set using Gengar's coverage and the lack of resistances to Ghost-type moves may seem appealing, but it requires a lot of support to function. Gengar can also beat pretty much every counter with coverage or Trick, and the power granted by Choice Specs makes it very hard to switch into, but overall, it is inefficient compared to the other sets. A Choice Scarf set can be used to capitalize on Gengar's immunity to Normal-type moves to reliably revenge kill Extreme Speed users, but these are not the biggest threats in the metagame, and it is pretty weak overall. Pain Split is an option for Substitute Gengar to recover health, affording the use of Life Orb in most situations too. It can also hassle some defensive Pokemon like Chansey or Clefable pretty well by discouraging healing, but utility Life Orb Gengar fails to be as effective against stall as Black Sludge, nor as effective as all-out Destiny Bond attacker against offense, so it's a situational middle ground.

Checks & Counters
########

**Heatran**: Specially defensive Heatran is immune to burns, takes Shadow Ball quite well, and does enough with Lava Plume to force Gengar out. However, it is narrowly 2HKOed by Life Orb Focus Blast.

**Bulky Pursuit Users**: Bisharp and Tyranitar are both capable of trapping Gengar with Pursuit, though the right coverage moves on Gengar as well as the threat of Will-O-Wisp can be troublesome.

**Assault Vest users**: Conkeldurr, Raikou, Escavalier, Tyranitar, Tornadus-T, and other Assault Vest users really ruin Gengar's day, and unless they can be neutered with Substitute + Disable, Gengar is fighting a losing battle. However, all typical Assault Vest users are crippled by a burn.

**Strong Choice scarf users**: Choice Scarf Garchomp, Tyranitar, Terrakion, Excadrill, and Landorus-T are all checks to a Gengar that is not behind a Substitute, as they cleanly outspeed and KO it. Tyranitar is especially troubling, as it effortlessly traps and KOes Gengar if it can get in for free.

**Strong Priority Moves**: Scizor, Talonflame, and other powerful priority users have no trouble checking Gengar due to its frailty. Sucker Punch users may seem like a good check, but no Gengar set eschews a countermeasure to this move, whether it be Substitute, Destiny Bond, or Will-O-Wisp.

**Fast Offensive Checks**: Thundurus and Alakazam can easily check Gengar due to its poor defenses.
