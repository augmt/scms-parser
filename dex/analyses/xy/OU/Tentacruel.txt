Overview
########

Tentacruel's unique typing and good defenses allow it to be an effective wall in the OU metagame that can check multiple threats, such as Keldeo, Azumarill, Greninja, and Clefable. It also has a good support movepool, with access to moves such as the crucial Rapid Spin and Toxic Spikes. Unfortunately, Tentacruel's walling capabilities are hindered a by lack of reliable recovery and weaknesses to common types, such as Ground and Electric. It also receives competition from other bulky Pokemon that share a type with it, such as Mega Venusaur, which has better mixed bulk and offensive stats; Rotom-W, which has access to Will-O-Wisp and is only weak to one type; and Starmie, which can also Rapid Spin but has reliable recovery and a better Speed.

Moves
========

Scald is Tentacruel's main STAB move; its burn chance helps Tentacruel check and deter physical attackers. Rapid Spin clears entry hazards from your side of the field. Acid Spray lets Tentacruel check Calm Mind sweepers, such as Clefable and Suicune, by lowering their Special Defense so that they can be easily revenge killed or taken down by Tentacruel itself. Sludge Bomb can be used as a reliable secondary STAB move that lets Tentacruel check Azumarill and Clefable more easily, whilst Knock Off provides nice support and hits Gengar harder than Scald, which is useful for when it tries to spinblock Tentacruel.


Set Details
========

32 Speed EVs let Tentacruel outspeed Jolly Tyranitar and Adamant Bisharp, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into Defense and HP to increase its physical bulk as much as possible. Black Sludge is Tentacruel's only source of recovery and can cripple Trick users. Liquid Ooze is the preferred ability, punishing Leech Seed and Giga Drain users. Rain Dish can be used on rain teams for more recovery.

Usage Tips
========

Tentacruel has the bulk to tank most neutral attacks, but it prefers to switch into resisted hits due to its lack of reliable recovery. After switching in, you should either try to burn the opponent with Scald or use Rapid Spin if entry hazards are present. Before using Rapid Spin, check if the opponent has any Ghost-type Pokemon to spinblock Tentacruel. When they do, attacking might be the best option in order to hit the Ghost-type on the switch. Tentacruel should switch in against Calm Mind sweepers in order to lower their Special Defense with Acid Spray.

Team Options
========

Due to its lack of reliable recovery, Tentacruel appreciates Wish support from the likes of Chansey and Clefable. Ferrothorn resists Electric- and Psychic-type attacks, and Celebi resists all three of Tentacruel's weaknesses and can provide Heal Bell support, while Tentacruel also resists both of Ferrothron's weaknesses and three of Celebi's: Bug-, Poison-, and Fire-type moves. Tentacruel fits well on stall teams, as it can beat common threats to stall such as Calm Mind Clefable and Keldeo. It also has good defensive synergy with Gliscor, which is immune to both Ground- and Electric-type attacks, while Tentacruel resists both Ice- and Water-type attacks.

Other Options
########

Toxic can be used to help stall the opponent; similarly, Toxic Spikes can do so for an entire team, but it is less reliable due to the prevalence of hazard control and Poison-types. Ice Beam hits Dragon- and Flying-types, such as Garchomp and Mandibuzz, for super effective damage. Haze can be used to stop set up setup sweepers, while Mirror Coat punishes special attackers that do not OHKO Tentacruel. Finally, Rain Dance supports Tentacruel's team and gives it passive recovery via Rain Dish. A specially defensive spread can be used to check Pokemon such as Greninja and Gengar.

Checks & Counters
########

**Electric-types**: Electric-type Pokemon, such as Thundurus and Mega Manectric, can switch in on Tentacruel and deal heavy damage with their STAB moves, but they do not want to take too many Scalds or Sludge Bombs. However, Rotom-W resists Water and is fairly bulky, so it can easily switch in.

**Psychic-types**: Mega Medicham, Mega Gardevoir, and other Psychic-types can threaten Tentacruel with their STAB moves. Latios and Latias resist Water and can recover back any health lost.

**Ground-types**: Ground-types dislike switching in on a possible Scald, but Pokemon like Excadrill and Landorus can easily KO Tentacruel with a bit of previous damage.

**Water-types**: Other than a Scald burn, Water-type Pokemon such as Manaphy and Starmie completely wall Tentacruel. Notably, Gastrodon is immune to Water-type attacks and resists Poison-type attacks, so it can easily switch in.

**Special Walls**: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey can easily switch in and take little damage from Tentacruel's attacks, even after Acid Spray's Special Defense drops.

**Setup Sweepers**: Boosted attacks, such as Mega Pinsir's Return and Mega Heracross's Rock Blast, can KO Tentacruel after a little chip damage. All Tentacruel can do to respond is fish for a Scald burn; as such, sweepers immune to burns, such as Mega Charizard X and Substitute Gyarados, can use it as setup fodder.
