Overview
########

Beedrill's Attack and Speed increase drastically upon Mega Evolving, turning what is arguably one of the worst Pokemon in the game into a terrifying glass cannon with the stats and ability to make its attacks really sting. Despite its newfound stat increases and ability making its STAB attacks incredibly powerful, it has poor coverage and still remains incredibly frail. On top of its frailty, it has a weakness to Stealth Rock that limits the number of times it can come in.

Moves
========

Protect is a necessity seeing as Beedrill does not get the Speed boost on the turn it Mega Evolves. Protect also enables it to scout movesets, Choice items, and potential priority attacks. U-turn is Beedrill's go-to move to gain momentum and just a very powerful move in general to get chip damage. Poison Jab is Beedrill's strongest attack and has a great secondary chance of poisoning the opponent. Poison along with Protect helps Beedrill wear down opposing Pokemon. Knock Off is one of the most versatile moves in the game and does exceptionally well against stall. Using Knock Off on Steel-types with Shed Shell can allow a Magnet Pull or Shadow Tag user to trap them later on in the game. Knock Off really excels at dealing with a lot of Beedrill's checks; Landorus-T, Heatran, and Magnezone do not appreciate their items being removed, and Gengar gets OHKOed by it. Meanwhile, Drill Run is primarily for Steel-types without Levitate, such as Heatran, Excadrill, and Magnezone, that resist both Beedrill's STAB attacks.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread allows Mega Beedrill to take priority hits from Choice Band Azumarill and Life Orb Mamoswine while, with a Jolly nature, still outpacing Mega Manectric and Mega Lopunny with. A spread of 252 Atk / 44 Def / 212 Spe with a Jolly nature is recommended if running Drill Run so that Mega Beedrill can outspeed and KO Timid Choice Scarf Heatran with it. Full Speed investment can be run if opposing Mega Beedrill and Mega Sceptile are an issue, but the Defense EVs help so much in tanking priority hits that it isn't generally worth sacrificing them to tie with two relatively uncommon Pokemon. However, the difference in power is evident enough with an Adamant nature that it is a highly viable option for teams that can afford Mega Beedrill underspeeding Mega Lopunny and Mega Manectric. For instance, Adamant Mega Beedrill's Poison Jab is capable of OHKOing Mega Lopunny and Mega Charizard X/Y, while Jolly Poison Jab is always a 2HKO. With Adamant, a spread of 252 Atk / 56 Def / 200 Spe is recommended, as it allows Mega Beedrill to outrun Tornadus-T, and with that Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Adamant Mega Lopunny, while still having some Defense EVs to help tank the aforementioned priority hits.


Usage Tips
========

This set is incredible at maintaining momentum, so keeping up pressure with entry hazards is a great way to weaken the opposing team little by little. Try to keep entry hazards off your side of the field, as Mega Beedrill is quite frail and has a chance to get OHKOed by priority users such as Mamoswine and Dragonite after just one switch into Stealth Rock.

Team Options
========

Landorus-T and Rotom-W work pretty effectively as a core with Beedrill. They're both great pivots and have access to U-turn and Volt Switch respectively. Magnezone and Gothitelle pair up very nicely if Beedrill is utilizing Knock Off for Shed Shell Steel-types. Magnezone also has the ability to form a VoltTurn core with Beedrill. Choice Scarf Magneton may not be as powerful or bulky as Magnezone, but it is capable of outspeeding base 115 to 130 Speed Pokemon that Magnezone cannot outspeed. Latias, Latios, and Excadrill are great partners for keeping Stealth Rock off the field, (comma) which ultimately gives Beedrill more opportunities to stay in the game.

Other Options
########

Beedrill doesn't really have any other effective options. Toxic Spikes, Swords Dance, and Defog might have merit in theory, but the only place they could fit without ruining Beedrill's coverage is Protect, which is irreplaceable due to Beedrill's mediocre Speed before Mega Evolving, an issue that is compounded by its horrific defensive stats.

Checks and Counters
########

Beedrill is difficult to check with defensive Pokemon or Pokemon that resist its moves because of its ability to U-turn out without taking any damage. However, it has still has switch-ins and methods of being checked effectively; defensive ones just aren't always perfect at the job because they don't punish Beedrill for getting momentum with U-turn.

**Stealth Rock**: Beedrill likes to use U-turn frequently in order to keep up momentum. It is pretty difficult to land a hit on it directly due to its great Speed, so keeping up Stealth Rock is helpful as it will limit Beedrill to four switch-ins.

**Priority and Choice Scarf Users**: Beedrill may be fast, but it will not be able to outspeed Choice Scarf users with over 80 base Speed, such as Landorus-T, Keldeo, and Latios. It also has pitiful defenses, so priority attacks will deal significant damage to it if it has taken Stealth Rock damage or been weakened a bit in some other manner.

**Physical Walls**: Landorus-T, Hippowdon, Gliscor, Alomomola, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor can all take a hit from Beedrill, and some are immune to poison. Be wary of the combination of Knock Off and a trapper if using Skarmory, however.

**Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Iron Barbs**: Rocky Helmet on Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Skarmory, Alomomola, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn can punish Beedrill for using U-turn, causing it to lose almost 17% of its health in the process. Garchomp and Ferrothorn are particularly effective because of their abilities Rough Skin and Iron Barbs, respectively; when these abilities are combined with Rocky Helmet, Beedrill loses a total of 29.2% of its health by going for U-turn. Even without Rocky Helmet, these Pokemon are capable of punishing Beedrill's U-turn effectively by virtue of their abilities alone.
