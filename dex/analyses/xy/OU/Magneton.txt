Overview
########

Magneton is mostly outclassed by its evolution, as Magnezone has superior offensive and defensive power, but Magneton's niche lies in its higher Speed, which allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Timid Greninja and Jolly Talonflame when equipped with a Choice Scarf. Magneton has a very good Special Attack that allows it to hit quite hard. It has a good ability in Magnet Pull, which allows Magneton to trap and beat Steel-types. It can use Volt Switch to help keep up momentum for teams. Magneton is immune to paralysis and poison, which allows it to absorb these sorts of status for teammates. It has a decent Electric / Steel typing, though it does have a 4x weakness to Ground-type attacks. Magneton has average defenses, but those are a bit let down by a mediocre HP stat. It has a small movepool with very limited options, which allows it to only fill out a single role effectively. Magneton is also easily beaten by specially defensive Pokemon, though it is capable of switching out against all Pokemon but Ground-types with Volt Switch. It is also rather item-reliant, as without its item, it will be too slow to outspeed several threats.

Moves
========

Volt Switch allows Magneton to keep up momentum as well as switch out of Pokemon that threaten it, except against Ground-types. Thunderbolt has superior power to Volt Switch, which allows it to hit slightly harder. Flash Cannon is another good STAB attack that hits Ground-types which are immune to the former two attacks. Hidden Power Fire is really useful to hit Steel-types, most notably Ferrothorn and Scizor.

Set Details
========

Choice Scarf is the reason why to use Magneton over Magnezone, as it allows Magneton to outspeed Greninja, Talonflame, Starmie, and Dragonite after a Dragon Dance as well as Speed tie Mega Gyarados after a Dragon Dance. Magnet Pull traps Steel-types, meaning Magneton can take care of them. Max Special Attack investment ensures that Magneton hits as hard as possible, and the max Speed investment along with a Timid nature help Magneton outspeed Pokemon with a base Speed of 115 or higher.

Usage Tips
========

Use Volt Switch most of the time in order to gain momentum; however, you should play carefully with it; you cannot risk a Ground-type switching in and forcing you to switch in order to remain healthy. When a Steel-type is on the field, switch into Magneton in order to trap and eventually beat it. Don't switch in on an Excadrill or Heatran, because the former one can OHKO with Earthquake and the latter can take any hit and strike back with a Fire-type STAB attack. Magneton can also be used to clean up with Volt Switch once the foe has been brought down to low health.

Team Options
========

Other U-turn users or Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W make for good partners, as they'll be able to keep up the momentum for the team. Pokemon that beat up Ground-types, such as Greninja, Azumarill, and Venusaur, are really useful too, as Magneton has a hard time against Ground-types. Furthermore, Pokemon that take advantage of the fact that Magneton is capable of beating up Steel-types, such as Latios, Gyarados, Greninja, Mega Altaria, and Mega Beedrill, and those that can clean up after are good partners too. And last, but not least, physical wallbreakers that get rid of special walls that hinder Magneton, such as Bisharp and Azumarill, also make for great partners.

Other Options
########

Analytic can be used for superior power, but that stops Magneton from being able to trap Steel-types, which means that it loses its niche. Sturdy is also a possibility to prevent Magneton from being OHKOed, but again, it cannot trap Steel-types. Eviolite is an option, but that'd waste Magneton's niche as a Choice Scarf trapper and its mediocre HP limits its effectiveness. Hidden Power Ice is another option that helps to hit Dragon-types better, but Hidden Power Fire is better in most situations because Magneton would struggle against Pokemon such as Scizor and Ferrothorn otherwise. Explosion is also an option that can bring in setup sweepers safely after use, though it lacks good power because of Magneton's poor base 60 Attack. Substitute can prevent Magneton from being revenge killed after it KOes a Steel-type, but it cannot really miss out on other attacks.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ground-types**: Ground-types, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Swampert, are immune to Volt Switch and Thunderbolt and can OHKO Magneton with one of their STAB attacks, although the former two cannot reliably switch into Flash Cannon.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Magnezone, and Thundurus-T are capable of tanking any hit, as they resist Magneton's Electric- and Steel-type STAB attacks, and can usually take a Hidden Power Fire and continue by beating Magneton or, in Thundurus-T's case, set up on it.

**Specially defensive walls**: Specially defensive walls, such as Cresselia and Heatran, can take any of Magneton's attacks and set up on it. The latter is capable of straight KOing Magneton with a Fire-type attack.

**Super effective priority**: As Magneton is a bit frail because of its low HP stat, super effective priority, such as Mach Punch from Conkeldurr and Breloom, can easily beat Magneton.
