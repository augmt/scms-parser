Overview
########

Venomoth looks useless at first; poor base stats and weaknesses to common Fire- and Flying-type attacks, as well as Stealth Rock, are never good. However, Venomoth has access to the combination of Quiver Dance and Baton Pass, allowing it to pass boosts to one of its teammates and provide them with an opportunity to sweep. Though it faces competition in this niche from the likes of Gorebyss, Smeargle, and Scolipede, it sets itself apart with its ability Wonder Skin, which can potentially let Venomoth avoid Taunt; access to Sleep Powder, which lets it set up with relative ease; and team synergy, allowing its team to run another Water-type whereas that slot would be taken up by Gorebyss.

Moves
======

Quiver Dance is the only reason to use Venomoth ever, boosting Speed, Special Attack, and Special Defense. Sleep Powder provides valuable free turns, easing setup. Baton Pass allows Venomoth to pass the boosts it has earned to a teammate. Substitute eases prediction, protects Venomoth from status, and also prevents it from getting revenge killed by priority users. It is also very helpful for the recipient of the boosts acquired by Venomoth. Bug Buzz can be used to prevent Venomoth from getting being shut down by Taunt, and it hits fairly hard after some boosts.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs maximize Venomoth's, allowing it to tie with other base 90s. 248 HP EVs give it some decent bulk and minimize Stealth Rock damage. Wonder Skin stops annoying support moves like Thunder Wave and Taunt cold 50% of the time, which, although not to be relied upon, can certainly come in handy. Focus Sash guarantees that Venomoth will set up a Quiver Dance most of he time, while Black Sludge provides passive recovery that heals some of the damage taken from setting up Substitute. Tinted Lens is an option for Venomoth to deal solid damage by itself when passing the boosts would be detrimental to the recipient. However, it makes Venomoth more vulnerable to Taunt and status.


Usage Tips
==========

Bring Venomoth in on Pokemon that don't threaten it, such as Keldeo locked into Sacred Sword and defensive Clefable, and set up Quiver Dance on the switch. Then, if the new Pokemon is slower than +1 Venomoth, it can Quiver Dance again with its Focus Sash, use Sleep Powder, and then Baton Pass. If the Pokemon is faster, use Sleep Powder and then Baton Pass immediately. You should not get greedy unless the extra boosts are necessary: and Venomoth should Baton Pass immediately after it puts something to sleep so that the chances of a successful pass are as high as possible, particularly to a teammate that can threaten the Pokemon that's out easily. If the opponent sends in a Pokemon that may status Venomoth, it is better to use Substitute. Don't set up if your opponent has a phazer or a Pokemon that can check or counter Venomoth or its recipient.

Team Options
============

The best teammates for Venomoth are Pokemon that can effectively take advantage of the boosts it acquires, such as Thundurus, Thundurus-T, Landorus, Keldeo, and Mega Gardevoir. Venomoth also appreciates Defog or Rapid Spin support in order to switch in without losing its Focus Sash. Latios is a good partner as after using Defog, it can provide an easy setup opportunity to Venomoth with Memento.


Other Options
##########

A Quiver Dance sweeping set with Sleep Powder, Bug Buzz, Quiver Dance, and Psychic is an option, as Tinted Lens Venomoth achieves perfect neutral coverage with just two attacks. However, Venomoth is mostly outclassed by Volcarona, which has better bulk, power, and movepool. Sludge Bomb is an option if your team struggles against Fairies.


Checks And Counters
###############

**Priority**: Due to its frailty, Venomoth is prone to being taken out by priority moves, especially if it is down to its Focus Sash. Talonflame and Mega Pinsir in particular threaten with their STAB super effective priority attacks.

**Ditto**: Ditto copies Venomoth, allowing it to pass Quiver Dances to its own teammates as well. It can also copy the boosts passed by Venomoth to its teammates. However, this strategy can be blocked by Substitute. Most people probably won't prepare to counter their own Pokemon in case of Ditto, another reason why it is an effective check.

**Phazers**: Bulky phazers such as Skarmory, Mandibuzz, and Heatran can all take Bug Buzz from Venomoth and get rid of any boosts it has accumulated, messing up the opponent's game plan. Mandibuzz in particular can both Taunt and Whirlwind Venomoth, while being immune to Sleep Powder thanks to Overcoat.

**Taunt Users**: Taunt from foes such as Sableye, Deoxys-S, Tornadus, and Thundurus has the potential to completely shut down Venomoth, though Wonder Skin can make it unreliable. Thundurus can also stop the recipient's sweep prematurely with its priority Thunder Wave.
