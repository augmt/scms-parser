Overview
########

While XY brought Mamoswine few boons, it retains its role as an excellent check to some of the most threatening Pokemon in OU. Mamoswine's high base 130 Attack, coupled with outstanding Ice- and Ground-type offensive coverage and priority in the form of Ice Shard, allows it to KO dangerous sweepers such as Landorus, Garchomp, and Dragonite, as well as deliver crippling blows to opposing walls. Access to Stealth Rock, the useful Endeavor, and Icicle Spear to defeat other Focus Sash leads also enables Mamoswine to run a unique offensive lead set that can provide enormous early-game momentum while still maintaining its revenge killing capabilities.

However, Mamoswine's poor defenses and weaknesses to common attacking types make it difficult to switch into offensive Pokemon, and its relatively low base Speed means that it will often lose to offensive Pokemon that it cannot defeat with Ice Shard. This is compounded by a significant weakness to many priority attacks, notably Bullet Punch, Mach Punch, and Aqua Jet. Mamoswine's offensive lead set faces strong competition from other dedicated leads such as Terrakion and Garchomp, and the new Defog mechanics make the guaranteed Stealth Rock from this set less effective.

Physical Attacker
########
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Ice Shard
move 3: Icicle Spear / Icicle Crash
move 4: Freeze-Dry
ability: Thick Fat
item: Life Orb
evs: 240 Atk / 16 SpA / 252 Spe
ivs: 29 HP
nature: Naive

Moves
========

Mamoswine's movepool is far from expansive, but it has access to everything it needs to be both a strong revenge killer and an excellent wallbreaker. Earthquake is a very powerful STAB move with nice coverage, and Ice Shard provides priority to revenge kill a large number of threats, particularly Dragon-types. Icicle Spear is a crucial secondary STAB option with the ability to break through Focus Sashes and Dragonite's Multiscale. Alternatively, Icicle Crash can be run as a strong, reliable secondary STAB move, boasting a handy 30% flinch chance. Freeze-Dry may seem like an odd choice on a physical attacker, but it provides excellent coverage against bulky Water-types. Physically defensive Rotom-W is 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage, and Gyarados takes massive damage. It also cleanly OHKOes Quagsire, which can be very handy in breaking stall teams, and does heavy damage to Slowbro. Superpower is also viable to smash Ferrothorn and Air Balloon users such as Heatran and Excadrill harder than Mamoswine's STAB moves and cn be used in the last slot.

Set Details
========

A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed offensive Heatran, Adamant Gyarados, and Breloom. Outspeeding Breloom is important, as this ensures Mamoswine's Ice Shard will strike before Jolly Breloom's Mach Punch. The choice of nature is dependent on the moveset. If Freeze-Dry is used, Naive is ideal, though Naughty is also viable for a bit of a boost in power. Jolly or Adamant should always be chosen on sets without Freeze-Dry. The given EV spread emphasizes Speed and Attack, and the 16 EVs in Special Attack guarantee that physically defensive Rotom-W is 2HKOed by FreezeDry after Stealth Rock damage. Mamoswine without Freeze-Dry should maximize Attack and have the remaining 4 EVs in Defense. As it gives a neutrality to Fire-type attacks and a resistance to Ice-type attacks, Thick Fat is the ability of choice, allowing Mamoswine to survive strong Fire-type attacks such as Choice Band Talonflame's Flare Blitz and Choice Scarf Heatran's Overheat. A Life Orb is ideal to maximize attacking power while retaining the versatility of switching moves, and subsequently the 29 IVs in HP minimize Life Orb recoil as well as Stealth Rock damage.

Usage Tips
========

There are very few complexities involved with this Mamoswine set. It should be used to revenge kill opposing sweepers with Ice Shard, as it is difficult to switch in because of its poor defensive typing. For this reason, it is always wise to preserve Mamoswine as much as is prudent during the match. Generally speaking, whenever Mamoswine is not required to use Ice Shard, one should simply use its fantastic coverage to punch holes in the opponents team, as only extremely bulky Pokemon can stomach repeated Life Orb-boosted hits. Keep in mind that Rotom-W should be only targeted with Freeze-Dry on the switch unless it is significantly weakened, while Gyarados must be scouted in order to determine its set before you stay in on it to use Freeze-Dry.

Team Options
========

Mamoswine's vulnerability to strong Water- and Fighting-type attacks makes Mega Venusaur and Latias good partners. In return, Mamoswine can threaten Tyranitar and Heatran. Similarly, Heatran makes a nice teammate, as it can repeatedly switch into Scizor, as well as defeat Skarmory. Mamoswine is generally more suited to offensive teams, as dedicated sweepers appreciate its wallbreaking and revenge killing abilities.


Focus Sash
########
name: Focus Sash
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Icicle Spear / Endeavor
move 3: Ice Shard
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Thick Fat
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

As this set focuses on reliably setting up Stealth Rock, it is the primary move, and with a Focus Sash, Mamoswine is almost certain to set it up. Endeavor makes further use of Focus Sash and effectively turns Mamoswine's poor defensive capabilities into an effective means of crippling an opposing Pokemon. Ice Shard is useful for picking off Pokemon brought down to 1 HP by Endeavor, as well as revenge killing throughout the match. In the last slot, Earthquake is a strong STAB attack that still hits hard despite the lack of a boosting item.

Set Details
========

A Jolly nature is used to set up Stealth Rock as quickly as possible, and, importantly, outspeed common leads such as Breloom and Smeargle, as this set is designed as a lead itself. However, Adamant is viable to provide more power to Earthquake and Ice Shard, particularly if using the latter to revenge kill opposing sweepers later in the game. Focus Sash is vital for this set, as it allows for almost guaranteed Stealth Rock and maximizes Endeavor's potential. Icicle Spear helps against breaking Focus Sashes, breaking through Substitutes and for KOing Dragonite after breaking its Multiscale. Thick Fat is the ability of choice to tank powerful Fire- and Ice-type attacks, particularly if its sash is broken.

Usage Tips
========

You should nearly always be using this set as a lead, as setting Stealth Rock is generally its primary focus. Pokemon that bring Mamoswine to low health or to its Focus Sash can be eliminated by using Endeavor followed by Ice Shard. However, it might not always be ideal to set up Stealth Rock on the very first turn. Against some faster leads, Endeavor can be used immediately on an expected attacking move. The opponent will likely realize that Ice Shard is coming and switch. With good play, this can be your opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. Because of situations like this, it is important to avoid mindlessly laying down Stealth Rock on the first turn, especially if you see the likes of Greninja, Rotom-W, and Terrakion as an opposing lead. Also, be wary about sacrificing Mamoswine early in the game, as Ice Shard remains very useful as a revenge killing tool after its Focus Sash has been broken.

Team Options
========

This set is most suited to offensive teams that benefit from reliable Stealth Rock on the opponent's side. Wallbreakers such as Dragonite and sweepers such as Thundurus appreciate both Stealth Rock support and Mamoswine's ability to cripple an opposing Pokemon via Endeavor. Healing Wish and Defog support from Latias is heavily appreciated, ensuring Mamoswine's Focus Sash is kept intact should it not be used as a lead or not consume its Focus Sash right off the bat.

Other Options
########

As far as alternate moves go, Mamoswine's movepool is quite sparse. Stone Edge has good coverage with Earthquake, but is generally inferior to Mamoswine's Ice-type STAB moves and Superpower. Mamoswine can also make use of a Choice Band for more immediate power than Life Orb, but being locked into Earthquake is undesirable and easy for the opponent to exploit. Likewise, a Choice Scarf allows Mamoswine to act as a dedicated revenge killer; however, it is outclassed by other Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Keldeo, which sport better typing and lock-in options.

Checks & Counters
########

**Physical Walls**: Skarmory can switch into any attack relatively easily and set up hazards of its own or remove Stealth Rock with Defog. Defensive Rotom-W can switch into Icicle Crash and Earthquake easily and threaten to spread burns or just KO with Hydro Pump. Similarly, defensive Gyarados can stomach any single physical hit thanks to Intimidate and deal heavy damage with STAB Waterfall. Both of these Pokemon must be wary of Freeze-Dry, though.

**Common Priority**: Scizor and Azumarill resist Ice Shard and can strike back with a super effective Bullet Punch and Aqua Jet, respectively. Similarly, Talonflame can pick off a slightly weakened Mamoswine with its faster priority in Brave Bird.

**Faster Pokemon Resistant to Ice-type Attacks**: Generally, any naturally faster Pokemon that can take an Ice Shard and KO in return serve as good checks. Keldeo and Greninja are good examples here.
