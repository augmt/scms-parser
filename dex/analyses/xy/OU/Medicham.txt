Overview
########

Medicham has suffered in the lower tiers in the past, but has received new hope this generation thanks to its new Mega Evolution. Its fantastic ability, Pure Power, doubles its Attack stat, and boosts it to an equivalent of base 249 Attack with a positive nature and maximum Attack investment. Additionally, Mega Medicham is the fastest user of Pure / Huge Power and has a good movepool that allows it to annihilate its foes. Unfortunately, it suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, and its coverage moves are generally lacking in Base Power. Medicham also has very poor bulk and is susceptible to almost all forms of priority. It also competes with other physical Mega Evolutions such as Mega Pinsir and Mega Heracross. Despite these flaws, Medicham is a powerful physical attacker worthy of a spot on any offensive team.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: High Jump Kick
move 2: Zen Headbutt
move 3: Fake Out
move 4: Ice Punch / Bullet Punch
ability: Pure Power
item: Medichamite
evs: 16 HP / 252 Atk / 240 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

High Jump Kick is Medicham's main move; just be careful if the opponent has a Ghost-type switch-in or a Pokemon that might carry Protect. Zen Headbutt is Medicham's secondary STAB move and enables it to hit physically defensive Mega Venusaur, which would otherwise wall it. It also allows Medicham to 2HKO any bulky Fairy-type that attempts to come in on High Jump Kick. Fake Out and Bullet Punch together compose pretty powerful priority, which is very useful against quicker offensive teams that normally trouble Medicham. Ice Punch can be used over Bullet Punch to allow Mega Medicham to beat Celebi, Gliscor, Landorus-T, Dragonite, Latios, and Latias, but Fake Out alone can sometimes end up being too weak to get the job done.

Set Details
========

Again, Medichamite is the mandatory item for the all-around massive stat boosts achieved by Mega Evolving. An Adamant nature is preferred to enable Medicham to achieve a guaranteed 2HKO against physically defensive Clefable with Zen Headbutt. 16 HP EVs ensure that Mega Medicham will always survive a Quick Attack from Mega Pinsir.

Usage Tips
========

This Medicham set plays quite similarly to the wallbreaking set. The priority is useful against offensive teams, but less coverage means defensive teams will have an easier time stopping it. It is greatly advised to use Medicham along with means of safely bringing it in due to its fraility. Having sand setters as teammates isn't advised because Mega Medicham will be worn down very quickly, especially because this set doesn't run Drain Punch whereas the wallbreaking set might. This Medicham set is also an incredible anti-lead that can beat pretty much all common leads and Stealth Rock setters other than Garchomp.

Team Options
========

The team options for this set are the same as the ones advised for the wallbreaking set. However, the coverage on this set is limited to Medicham's dual STAB moves, which means that Landorus-T, Gliscor, Slowbro, and defensive Gyarados will completely shutit down. Thus, having teammates to handle these Pokemon is highly suggested.

Wallbreaker
########
name: Wallbreaker
move 1: High Jump Kick / Drain Punch
move 2: Zen Headbutt
move 3: Ice Punch / Baton Pass
move 4: Substitute
ability: Pure Power
item: Medichamite
evs: 16 HP / 240 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

High Jump Kick is Medicham's strongest physical STAB move. While it is powerful, don't be reckless with its usage, as a Ghost-type switch-in, miss, or well-timed Protect can be costly. Ice Punch is used to hit Gliscor, both Landorus formes, Dragonite, and Garchomp for super effective damage. Zen Headbutt is a great secondary STAB move that allows Medicham to heavily damage physically defensive Mega Venusaur, which otherwise takes very little damage from Medicham's attacks. It also lets Medicham beat defensive Fairy-types such as Clefable and Sylveon and deal good damage to Azumarill. Baton Pass is a nice option to use, as it works very nicely with Substitute; you lose important type coverage, but you can simply pass Substitutes to an appropriate teammate that can beat the active foe. In the last slot, Substitute can be very useful to ease prediction as well as keep Medicham from being crippled by status.

Fake Out is also a good option for repeated chip damage, a guaranteed flinch against a big threat, breaking Sturdy or Focus Sashes, and the ability to safely Mega Evolve. Thunder Punch can be used to hit Water-types, primarily Slowbro; it also achieves an OHKO on Azumarill, Talonflame, and Gyarados; however, using this move sacrifices more useful type coverage. If you want, you can use a set with High Jump Kick, Zen Headbutt, Ice Punch, and Thunder Punch for maximum coverage. Fire Punch can be used to OHKO Scizor, Skarmory, and Excadrill, and can be used so that Medicham does not have to worry about using High Jump Kick against Ferrothorn, which can use Protect, but you miss out on a lot of type coverage when using Fire Punch.

Set Details
========

Medichamite is essential for the all-around massive stat boosts achieved with Mega Evolution. An Adamant nature is preferred, as it gives Medicham the ability to guarantee a 2HKO against physically defensive Clefable. 240 Speed EVs are used because Mega Medicham will outspeed Jolly Pinsir before it Mega Evolves and easily live a Quick Attack; 252 Speed EVs are not used, as the final 12 EVs are unnecessary.

Usage Tips
========

While Mega Medicham hits like a nuke, it has trouble switching in, so your team should have ways to bring it in safely, such as a slow U-turn or Volt Switch user. Successfully setting up a Substitute is instrumental to doing heavy damage with Mega Medicham, as you won't have to predict as much: Medicham can attack much more freely when it doesn't fear a potential OHKO in return. Setting up a Substitute on a Fighting-type resistant switch-in is important. Mega Medicham can deal the maximum amount of damage to enemy teams if you have set up a Substitute. It is also advised not to use sand-setting Pokemon in conjunction with Medicham, as Medicham doesn't have any means of recovery and it's very frail.

Team Options
========

Good teammates for Mega Medicham are Pokemon with access to U-turn or Volt Switch, because it doesn't like switching into attacks due to its frailty. Scizor is a great partner because Mega Medicham takes care of many of its checks while Scizor can use U-turn to bring Mega Medicham in safely. Rotom-W is a great Volt Switch user that is capable of stomaching attacks from common priority users that want to pick off Mega Medicham and retaliate by crippling them with a burn. Rotom-W and Landorus-T both have good synergy with Medicham, have access to Volt Switch and U-turn, respectively, and also very importantly take care of the troublesome Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Staraptor so Medicham doesn't have to face them. Mid- or late-game sweepers are great teammates for Mega Medicham because they can sweep with ease after Mega Medicham has broken down the opponent's walls.

Mega Medicham has a mediocre Speed stat, making it vulnerable to revenge killers. A good way to amend this is by pairing it with a Sticky Web user; Smeargle and Shuckle are good users depending on the team. Another way of getting around Medicham's low Speed is by using Prankster Thunder Wave Thundurus; not only can Thundurus check and KO some of Mega Medicham's most common checks, such as Talonflame and Mega Pinsir, but also it can use its priority Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats. Together, Mega Medicham and Thundurus are only stopped by their frailty. Talonflame is a fantastic offensive partner because Medicham opens up a sweep for Swords Dance Talonflame by obliterating its counters. Talonflame easily beats Clefable, an annoying Medicham check. Latias is a good teammate because it can take on Pokemon that can revenge kill Medicham. Healing Wish Latias also allows you to play much more aggressively and not worry as much about taking damage from High Jump Kick because Latias can heal that off with Healing Wish. Lastly, Dark-types in general are good partners for Medicham as they can beat bulky Psychic-types, notably Mew. Bisharp and Choice Scarf Tyranitar are exceptional choices for this role, as they can also trap Psychic-types with Pursuit. Latias and Latios are also very common checks to Medicham, so Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Heatran are good teammates to dispose of them.

Other Options
########

If you want to use Mega Medicham as a sweeper, replace the third or fourth move on either set with Bulk Up. The Defense boost from Bulk Up is mostly unnecessary, but achieving over 900 base Attack is something that even the best physical sweepers can only dream of. Your opponent will also usually expect Medicham to be a wallbreaker instead of a sweeper.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Psychic-types**: Slowbro and Cresselia are complete stops to Mega Medicham, excluding Thunder Punch in Slowbro's case. Stallbreaker Victini with 68 Defense EVs and physically defensive Mew are also full stops, though without that investment they can still both check rather well. Defensive Starmie is another example of a decent Psychic-type check. Latios and Latias can also check Mega Medicham as they are faster and can KO it with Psyshock.

**Ghost-types**: Gengar naturally outruns Mega Medicham and can OHKO it with Gengar's STAB Shadow Ball, though it can't switch into Zen Headbutt or the elemental punches, which OHKO it. Ghost-types also make the use of High Jump Kick extremely risky. Sableye deserves a special mention, as it can burn Medicham with a priority Will-O-Wisp and 2HKO it with Foul Play. Medicham does 2HKO Sableye with a coverage move on the switch, but Sableye has priority Recover. If Medicham has a Substitute up, Sableye can break the Substitute with Foul Play and then burn Medicham. Doublade serves as a perfect counter to Mega Medicham, taking little from any of its attacks and threatening it with a STAB Gyro Ball.

**Priority Users**: Talonflame can revenge kill Medicham with a priority Brave Bird, but it doesn't like switching into any attack. Likewise, Scizor, Bisharp, and other common priority users can pick off a slightly weakened Medicham as long as it isn't protected by Substitute.

**Faster Pokemon**: Strong Choice Scarf users can revenge kill Medicham unless Medicham has a Substitute up, has a priority attack, or has Sticky Web support. Examples of such Pokemon include Landorus-T, Excadrill, Gardevoir, and Kyurem-B. This also applies to naturally faster Pokemon such as Greninja, Gengar, and Latios.
