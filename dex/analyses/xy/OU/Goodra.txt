Overview
########

While Goodra is often outclassed by other Dragon-types such as Latios and Garchomp, it finds its niche in OU as an exceptional special tank, being able to take hits from the likes of Mega Charizard Y, Gengar, Thundurus, and Landorus. Goodra is a good user of Assault Vest thanks to its expansive movepool, respectable bulk, and Dragon typing, which gives it resistances to Fire-, Water-, and Electric-type attacks. Goodra has a variety of coverage moves to hit common switch-ins to Dragon-types, such as Fire Blast, Earthquake, and Sludge Bomb. Sap Sipper is a great ability in OU, allowing Goodra to absorb Grass-type attacks from Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Breloom. Unfortunately, Goodra is very slow, which is problematic in a very fast-paced metagame. Goodra is also susceptible to entry hazards and residual damage, and has no form of reliable recovery. Lastly, due to Goodra's lack of power, it is easily walled.

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is Goodra's most powerful STAB move, hitting anything that doesn't resist it very hard. Dragon Pulse can be used as a more reliable STAB move, though it is less powerful than Draco Meteor. Fire Blast provides great coverage, hitting Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Bisharp super effectively. Sludge Bomb is helpful to smack Fairy-types, such as Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, and Azumarill, and also has a helpful chance to poison the opponent. Alternately, Thunderbolt can be used to hit Skarmory, Gyarados, and Talonflame more reliably. Thunderbolt also hits Water-types such as Azumarill, Starmie, Keldeo, Omastar, and Politoed hard. Earthquake is Goodra's best way of hitting Heatran, 2HKOing it all the time, even with a Modest nature. Muddy Water can be used to hit Tyranitar and Landorus hard while still retaining coverage on Heatran.

Set Details
========

Sap Sipper gives Goodra an immunity to Grass-type moves, particularly Leech Seed and Spore from the likes of Ferrothorn and Breloom. Assault Vest increases Goodra's already high Special Defense to exceptional levels. 16 Speed EVs are used to outpace Adamant Azumarill if Goodra needs to get off an attack in a pinch. Maximum Special Attack is used to hit as hard as possible. The rest of the EVs are put in HP to capitalize on Goodra's good bulk while decreasing the damage taken from entry hazards. A Modest nature is used over a Rash or Mild nature because even with an Attack-decreasing nature, Earthquake will still 2HKO Heatran. Alternatively, 44 Attack EVs can be used to guarantee an OHKO on Heatran with Earthquake after a Sap Sipper boost.

Usage Tips
========

Assault Vest Goodra is best used as a pivot into special attackers such as Thundurus and Mega Charizard Y, as well as Grass-type attacks, as Goodra can easily take the hits and hit hard back with a powerful Draco Meteor or the proper coverage move. Due to the lack of a power-boosting item, prediction is important to hit incoming Steel-types with Fire Blast and Fairy-types with Sludge Bomb. Draco Meteor should be used sparingly, as the Special Attack drops can turn Goodra into setup fodder for the opponent. It is important to remember that Goodra is not a special wall, and more of a tank due to its lack of recovery. Many Pokemon that Goodra typically wall have ways of handling Goodra, such as Trick on Rotom-W, so it is important to be wary of such things.

Team Options
========

Wish passers and clerics such as Sylveon and Clefable help with Goodra's lack of reliable recovery. Steel-types such as Skarmory and Heatran have good synergy with it; the former can also remove entry hazards, which are troublesome for Goodra. Alomomola is a notable Wish passer that pairs very well with Goodra, as Goodra easily switches into the Grass- and Electric-type attacks that threaten Alomomola, while in return, Alomomola can take some Ice-type attacks and handle some physical attackers. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Magnezone and Scizor are helpful to bring in Goodra safely. Assault Vest Goodra should be used with other teammates to provide offensive pressure, otherwise Goodra will get worn down quickly.

Other Options
########

Goodra can use Dragon Tail to phaze out opponents, but Goodra generally needs as many coverage moves as possible. Goodra can also utilize a Rain Dance set with Hydration and Rest to circumvent its lack of reliable recovery. A physical or mixed set with moves such as Power Whip and Outrage may seem appealing but is outclassed by Garchomp. Ice Beam can be used to OHKO both Landorus formes and Gliscor, but doesn't hit much else relevant. Curse can be used to potentially sweep, but the lack of coverage moves will have Goodra walled by many Pokemon. Lastly, Counter can be used to get a surprise KO on a physical attacker.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Clefable and Sylveon can easily wall and set up on Goodra if it does not predict the switch and 2HKO them with Sludge Bomb, due to Calm Mind. Azumarill can OHKO Goodra and switch easily into anything but Sludge Bomb, and avoids the 2HKO if it has an Assault Vest. Mega Gardevoir can also threaten Goodra with Hyper Voice.

**Specially Bulky Pokemon**: Chansey walls Goodra no matter what moves it runs. Heatran also beats Earthquake-lacking Goodra with Toxic. Mega Venusaur is not weak to any of Goodra's coverage moves, and can survive a Draco Meteor then recover off the damage with Synthesis. Specially defensive Hippowdon, Mew, Jirachi, Tyranitar, Mega Tyranitar, and Gliscor are also good counters to Goodra. Alomomola also counters Goodra if it doesn't carry Thunderbolt. Hippowdon can stomach most of Goodra's attacks and whittle it down with Sandstorm damage and deal decent damage in return with Earthquake. Jirachi resists Goodra's Dragon-type STAB moves, avoids the 2HKO from Fire Blast, and it stalls it out with the combination of Wish and Iron Head flinches. Gliscor can also stall out Goodra with Toxic and Roost.
