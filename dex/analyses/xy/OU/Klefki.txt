Overview
########

Klefki's wide support movepool, which includes Spikes, Thunder Wave, and dual screens, coupled with Prankster allow it to function as a very effective support Pokemon. Its Steel / Fairy typing gives it numerous resistances and immunities to common attacking types, allowing it to check threats such as Mega Gardevoir, Mega Pinsir, Latios, and Weavile. Notably, Prankster Thunder Wave allows Klefki to act as a catch-all stop to most setup sweepers. Klefki has access to Magnet Rise, which gives it the ability to avoid Ground-type attacks for five turns, which alleviates one of its only two weaknesses. Unfortunately, Klefki has subpar stats overall and lacks significant offensive presence.

Spikes
########
name: Spikes
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Thunder Wave
move 3: Magnet Rise / Toxic
move 4: Play Rough / Foul Play
ability: Prankster
item: Leftovers / Sitrus Berry
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Careful / Calm

Moves
========

Spikes quickly rack up damage on grounded Pokemon, and Klefki finds many opportunities to set them up due to its great defensive typing. Thunder Wave cripples offensive Pokemon and halts setup sweepers such as Mega Pinsir and Mega Gyarados. Magnet Rise allows Klefki to avoid Ground-type attacks from Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Excadrill, and the Landorus formes. Toxic is an alternate choice to hit Ground- and Electric-types, which are immune to Thunder Wave, such as Hippowdon, Thundurus, and Raikou. Play Rough ensures that Klefki is not completely shut down by Taunt, and it has good neutral coverage overall. Foul Play hits Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Jirachi, Excadrill, and non-Mega Gyarados.

Set Details
========

Full HP investment is used to maximize Klefki's solid bulk, and a Careful nature and the Special Defense investment allows it to better take hits from the likes of Starmie, Keldeo, Thundurus, Gengar, and Mega Gardevoir. A Calm nature should be used with Foul Play, as preserving Klefki's Attack stat is not needed with Foul Play. Alternatively, a physically defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD and a Bold nature can be used to handle threats such as Weavile, Dragon Dance Mega Altaria, Mega Lopunny, and Azumarill. Leftovers provide passive recovery, while a Sitrus Berry gives Klefki immediate recovery when it reaches low HP, giving it more opportunities to set up layers of Spikes. Prankster gives priority to all of Klefki's status moves.

Usage Tips
========

Klefki should pivot into resisted or immune attacks from Pokemon such as Latios, Weavile, Mega Altaria, and Gengar. Klefki should set up layers of Spikes early on when it forces switches into a Ground- or Electric-type trying to absorb a Thunder Wave or against a paralyzed foe. Magnet Rise should be used versus Ground-types such as Mamoswine and Landorus-T to avoid their attacks.

Team Options
========

Klefki is a great team supporter and fairly self-sufficient Pokemon, although there are many offensive Pokemon that appreciate its support. Pokemon whose checks and counters are grounded Pokemon, and are thus worn down by Klefki's Spikes, such as Mega Sharpedo, Mega Gyarados, and Scizor make for good teammates. Pokemon with Defiant such as Thundurus or Bisharp deter the use of Defog to clear Klefki's Spikes, but are not always necessary due to how Klefki puts immense pressure on the two most common Defog users, Latios and Latias. Water-types such as Keldeo and Gyarados are good teammates to handles the Fire-types that trouble Klefki.

Dual Screens
########
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Fairy Lock
move 4: Foul Play
ability: Prankster
item: Light Clay
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Reflect and Light Screen give Klefki's teammates invaluable support by significantly decreasing the damage from opposing Pokemon's attacks. This support is extremely helpful for setup sweepers that rely on taking an attack and boosting. Fairy Lock prevents both Pokemon in play from switching out in the turn that it is used, which is helpful when Klefki is about be KOed so a teammate can use the opposing Pokemon as setup bait or to just fire off an attack. Foul Play prevents Klefki from being Taunt and setup bait from the likes of Thundurus, Talonflame, Mega Scizor, and Mega Charizard X. Spikes are a great entry hazard that quickly rack up damage on grounded Pokemon, but Klefki struggles to fit them on this set.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP investment is important to take hits while setting up screens, and a Calm nature helps agaisnt the likes of Taunt users such as Gengar, Thundurus, and Mega Gardevoir. Light Clay increases the duration of Light Screen and Reflect. Prankster gives priority to all of Klefki's support moves, particularly Light Screen and Reflect. A physically defensive EV spread can be used to lessen the damage taken from physical attacks and Psyshock.

Usage Tips
========

This set works best as a lead for offensive teams to quickly set up Light Screen and Reflect for setup sweepers. If the opponent has a more physically oriented team, then it is more useful to set up Reflect, and if they have a more specially oriented team, then Light Screen is better. Fairy Lock should be used when Klefki is about to be KOed so a teammate can either set up on or KO the trapped Pokemon.

Team Options
========

Klefki is fairly self-sufficient, and it usually provides more team support than it needs in return. Setup sweepers such as Scizor, Azumarill, Landorus-T, and Mega Charizard X are excellent teammates that appreciate the screens that Klefki provides. Pokemon with Defiant such as Bisharp and Thundurus deter the use of Defog from the likes of Latios and Latias, which would waste Klefki's efforts by getting rid of the screens.

Other Options
########

Flash Cannon OHKOes Mega Diancie, which bounces back Klefki's Spikes and status moves, takes little from Foul Play and Play Rough, and can use Klefki as setup fodder. Dazzling Gleam targets Mega Sableye, 2HKOing physically defensive variants most of the time. Magic Coat bounces back opposing entry hazards and status moves. Heal Block prevents defensive Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Hippowdon, and Chansey from using recovery moves. Switcheroo is an alternate way of disrupting offensive Pokemon by giving them a Choice item, status orb, or crippling their Speed with a Lagging Tail.

Checks & Counters
########

**Taunt Users**: Taunt users such as Thundurus, Mega Gardevoir, and Gengar prevent Klefki from using its support moves such as Spikes, Thunder Wave, Light Screen, and Reflect. However, the latter two are severely crippled by Thunder Wave.

**Defensive Pokemon**: Defensive Pokemon such as Heatran, Hippowdon, Rotom-W, Gliscor, and Slowbro are major nuisances for Klefki due to its lack of offensive presence. Gliscor gets a notable mention, as it is not affected by either Thunder Wave or Toxic and shrugs off Foul Play and Play Rough thanks to its great Defense.

**Offensive Pressure**: Offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo, Thundurus, Mega Metagross, Azumarill, and Talonflame can break through Klefki with repeated hits, although most of them are crippled by Thunder Wave.

**Magic Bounce**: Pokemon with Magic Bounce, particularly Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie, bounce back Klefki's Spikes and status moves, can easily take most of Klefki's attacks, and use Klefki as setup fodder. Mega Sableye should be wary of the occasional Dazzling Gleam, while Mega Diancie is OHKOed by the rare Flash Cannon.
