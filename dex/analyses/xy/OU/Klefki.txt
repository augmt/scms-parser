Overview
########
Possessing one of the most sought-after abilities in Prankster and a movepool that complements it nicely, Klefki stands out in OU as a potent support Pokemon. It is the only Pokemon in the game with the combination of Prankster and dual screens or Spikes, and Prankster makes it very effective atusing these moves, as it doesn't have to worry about the burdens of Speed benchmarks, freeing it to direct its EVs towards bulk instead. Klefki's tremendous defensive typing makes it difficult to wear down during the course of a match. It isn't just limited to dual screens and Spikes, though, as it has an array of other support moves to assist its team with, including the uniquely helpful Fairy Lock. However, Klefki shares a common tendency with many other support Pokemon: it lacks a large offensive presence, which makes it fairly easy to switch into. Mediocre stats prevent Klefki from really making the best out of its fantastic defensive typing, and a lack of Taunt is quite disappointing, as it renders Klefki vulnerable to Taunt itself while also making it much easier for Pokemon to set up entry hazards against it. Overall, Klefki is a rather niche Pokemon, but Prankster definitely enables it to perform its role successfully.

Dual Screens

nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

Moves
========
The goal of this set is to set up Reflect and Light Screen to benefit both Klefkiand its team. Not only do Light Screen and Reflect aid Klefki in setting up Spikes, but they also assist teammates trying to set up with boosting moves. Prankster is the icing on the cake, allowing Klefki to set up the relevant screenagainst the opponent regardless of Speed. Spikes provide even more support, benefiting teammates by potentially turning 2HKOs into OHKOs. Klefki's signature move, Fairy Lock, is an excellent move in the last slot, as it prevents both Pokemon in play from switching out in the turn after it is used, allowing it to be used as Klefki is about to be KOed so that a teammate that threatens the trapped Pokemon can setup behind the dual screens Klefki has set. However, one can use an offensive move in order for Klefki to not be total Taunt bait. Foul Play discourages physical attackers from setting up on Klefki, whereas Play Rough is a STAB attackthat 2HKOes Latios and Conkeldurr and is generally a more powerful option. Toxic can also be used to pressure Defog users such as Mandibuzz and Zapdos, which threaten to remove Klefki's Spikes and dual screens. Thunder Wave, another status move, can also be used, as the usefulness of Prankster Thunder Wave is immense in slowing down faster Pokemon.

Set Details
========
Light Clay is the item of choice to increase the duration of Reflect and Light Screen to eight turns. Klefki invests in its Defense as much as possible in order to take attacks such as Earthquake easier. However, Klefki can easily be modified to tank hits better from special attackers by investing in its Special Defense.

Usage Tips
========
This set does best as a lead for hyper offensive teams, as it gives frailer setupsweepers the bulk they need to set up and destroy teams. This includes teams with Shell Smash users, as most Shell Smash users have poor special bulk. It also helps frail wallbreakers destroy opposing offensive teams that would otherwise have the power to revenge kill them. It is not wise to sacrifice Klefki once it sets up dual screens to provide an advantage in momentum, as it can take advantage of its great typing and decent bulk to attempt to set up dual screens multiple times throughout the game. Fairy Lock should be used right before Klefki is about to be KOed so that a teammate can come in and either set up or KO the trapped Pokemon. An example is trapping Landorus before it uses Earth Power, so that Mamoswine can revenge kill it the next turn with Ice Shard.

Team Options
========
This Klefki set works wonders on hyper offensive teams in need of a dual screens user that's resilient and can offer defensive synergy. Klefki doesn't need much support itself, so its teammates are almost always ones that require its support instead. Virtually all setup sweepers make great use of dual screen support, but examples of Pokemon that especially love it include Belly Drum Azumarill, Tail Glow Manaphy, Shell Smash Gorebyss, and Dragon Dance Mega Gyarados. Thundurus can form an effective double Prankster paralysis core, and it can also prevent Defog users from removing Klefki's dual screens with Taunt. Thundurus can also run a Defiant set to discourage Defog by threatening to come in and receive a +2 Attack boost. Defiant Bisharp can also receive a +2 Attack boost from Defog, making it a good partner as well.

Other Options
########
Klefki can run a pretty potent utility set with Spikes and Thunder Wave which can setup Spikes on Pokemon that it forces out thanks to its great typing, while also acting as a utility check to dangerous sweepers. A full Toxic stalling set with Torment is a potentially viable option, though it lacks a way to deal with Steel-types. Imprison is also an option, albeit a rather niche one, to stop opposing users of dual screens such as Espeon from setting up alongside Klefki. An offensive Calm Mind set which attempts to sweep with moves such as Draining Kiss, Flash Cannon, and Psyshock is possible, but Klefki's low offensive stats and the low Base Power of its STAB moves make it quite a weak sweeper. Lastly, Switcheroo is a neat disruption tactic when paired with items such as Lagging Tail, Choice Scarf, and Toxic Orb, and it is especially effective given that defensive Pokemon are the most likely choices to switch into Klefki.

Checks & Counters
########
**Defensive Pokemon**: Klefki typically has no way of doing anything to most bulky Pokemon, especially ones that resist Play Rough or don't take much damage from Foul Play. More importantly, as Klefki unfortunately doesn't have access to Taunt, any of these bulkier Pokemon that commonly use Taunt themselves can completely prevent Klefki from doing anything notable, gaining momentum as Klefki si forced to switch out. Heatran and Gliscor are common defensive Pokemon that carry Taunt; Heatran 4x resists Play Rough, while Gliscor can take advantage of Klefki switching out to set up a Substitute and potentially Toxic stall a foe. Other bulkier Pokemon such as Skarmory and Hippowdon can't completely stop Klefki from setting up dual screens, but they don't mind any of Klefki's attacks and can potentially phaze out a Pokemon trying to set up from behind the dual screens Klefki has set.

**Offensive Pressure**: In general, Klefki has very little offensive presence, and lacks a way to recover from attacks reliably, which somewhat nullifies its invested defenses. However, most setup sweepers can't set up on Klefki, as it can paralyze them with Thunder Wave. Therefore, the best way for offensive teams to check Klefki is to constantly use their STAB attacks to wear Klefki down until it faints. Some of the best Pokemon to wear down Klefki with include Electric- and Ground-types such as Thundurus, Mega Manectric, Excadrill, Landorus, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, as they are all immune to Klefki's Thunder Wave by virtue of their typing. The Ground-type Pokemon also have a super effective STAB move to threaten Klefki with, while Thundurus has Prankster Taunt to prevent it from setting up its dual screens.

**Trick and Encore**: By being Tricked a Choice item from a Pokemon such as Latios, Klefki can only use one move each time it switches in, causing it to kill momentum. Meanwhile, Encore also locks Klefki into a single move, but it is not permanent.

**Defog**: The move Defog and its users are both detrimental to Klefki, as the move itself will remove the dual screens that Klefki has set, and common users of the move such as Zapdos, Skarmory, and Mandibuzz can also easily switch into Klefki and aren't bothered by anything that it can do, bar the rare Toxic in the case of Zapdos and Mandibuzz.
