Overview
########

Once the king of ORAS OU, Salamence has been left with little to do in the tier after the banning of Salamencite. However, its all-around high stats, great movepool, good typing, and useful ability in Intimidate give it a niche as a bulky Defogger that can threaten the majority of the bulky entry hazard users in the tier. Although it cannot beat many short-lived entry hazard users such as Garchomp and Mamoswine, Salamence's longevity allows it to hang around throughout the match and gives it many chances to support the team. Overall, while Salamence is by no means the best Defogger in OU, it carves out a niche for itself with its solid combination of attributes.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Defog
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Hydro Pump / Earthquake
move 4: Roost
ability: Intimidate
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 180 Def / 80 Spe
nature: Timid / Jolly

Moves
========

Defog allows Salamence to perform its primary role of hazard control. Salamence's next two moves allow it to threaten common entry hazard users. Fire Blast roasts Spikes users such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Klefki, as well as attaining coverage on Scizor and Excadrill, both of which are easily checked by Salamence. The next attacking move is a choice between Hydro Pump and Earthquake. Hydro Pump threatens Ground- and Fire-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Gliscor, Landorus-T, Rhyperior, and Talonflame and also deals meaningful damage to Heatran. On the other hand, Earthquake hits Heatran, Tyranitar, and specially defensive Jirachi for significantly more damage than Fire Blast does and also boasts perfect accuracy. Finally, Roost increases Salamence's longevity and allows it to stall out weaker Stone Edges from Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Landorus-T.

Set Details
========

80 Speed EVs combined with a Speed-boosting nature allow Salamence to outspeed everything up to Jolly Diggersby, including Pokemon such as Timid Heatran (which can Taunt Salamence before it uses Defog), Adamant Lucario, and Adamant Excadrill outside of sand. Then, HP is maximized, and the rest of the EVs are put into Defense for optimal bulk. A Timid nature is preferred when using Hydro Pump, to minimize damage from Foul Play and confusion, but Salamence prefers a Jolly nature when using Earthquake, as with it, Salamence is guaranteed to 2HKO Tyranitar without Stealth Rock damage and OHKO specially defensive Heatran. Salamence never needs a nature that decreases its bulk or Speed, because Fire Blast still deals enough damage with a Special Attack-lowering nature. Leftovers is preferred over alternatives such as Rocky Helmet to provide longevity, which is important because of Salamence's Stealth Rock weakness. Leftovers also helps Salamence take various attacks that would otherwise 2HKO it, such as Life Orb Diggersby's Return.

Usage Tips
========

Salamence should be switched directly into any entry hazard user it can beat, such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, Heatran, Jirachi, Empoleon, Klefki, or Skarmory, before it sets up Stealth Rock, ensuring that Salamence does not take any crippling Stealth Rock damage, and then either use Defog or attack it. Make sure Salamence avoids status, as poison and burn damage severely cut its longevity, while paralysis prevents it from Roost stalling moves such as Stone Edge from the likes of Hippowdon and Landorus-T. On the flip side, Salamence loves having its foes crippled by Toxic, which helps it stall them out easily.

Team Options
========

Salamence fits onto bulky defensive teams that appreciate a Defogger that isn't afraid of bulky entry hazard users. Cleric support is mandatory to peel burns or Toxic poison from Salamence; Chansey has good defensive synergy with Salamence and can use Toxic to poison foes, while Clefable can switch into dangerous Dragon-types and threaten them with STAB Moonblast or set up on bulky Water-type Pokemon with Calm Mind. Celebi is also a good partner, as it can handle the Water-types that like to switch into Salamence while also offering Heal Bell support. In return, Salamence can handle Pokemon such as Scizor and Ferrothorn, which see Celebi as setup fodder.

Beyond clerics, Heatran has very good defensive synergy with Salamence and can check threats such as Latios, Latias, and Clefable. In return, Salamence can threaten Ground-types with its Hydro Pump and can take Fighting- and Water-type attacks easily as well. Specially defensive Skarmory can check Dragon-types such as Latios, Latias, and Garchomp as well as Fairy-types such as Altaria, Diancie, and Gardevoir. Additionally, Salamence carrying Defog frees up a slot Skarmory's moveset to fit on Spikes or another support move. Between the two, most physical attackers are checked, and Salamence can handle Fire-types that threaten Skarmory as well as check strong Water-types such as Choice Specs Keldeo. Finally, bulky Talonflame appreciates Salamence's role as a bulky Defogger and ability to switch into physical walls such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon and to threaten Heatran. In return, Talonflame can set up on Fairy-types and threaten Pokemon such as Celebi, which can stall Salamence out.

Other Options
########

Salamence has a wide movepool, but not many options are viable for it in OU. Toxic could be considered to cripple Pokemon such as Slowbro, Hippowdon, and specially defensive Talonflame, but the opportunity cost of losing valuable coverage makes it a subpar choice. Dragon Tail could be considered over Hydro Pump or Earthquake if the team has adequate means of dealing with Heatran, it allows Salamence to phaze Pokemon that try to set up on it and also deters Dragon-types such as Latios from freely switching into Salamence. Finally, Salamence can use Refresh to remove crippling status, but because all four of Salamence's moveslots are vital, it's usually better off being paired with a cleric.

Alternatively, Salamence can use a Choice Scarf set with Moxie or a boosting Dragon Dance set. The former is not recommended, because of the prominence of Fairies, which can take advantage of Salamence when it's locked into Outrage, whereas the latter is outclassed by Dragonite, which has better bulk and finds more opportunities to set up, thanks to Multiscale.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Stealth Rock Leads**: Stealth Rock Clefable is the premier counter to Salamence, as it can beat Salamence in a one-on-one situation and prevents it from doing its job as an "immediate" Defogger. If Salamence isn't carrying Hydro Pump or Toxic, Hippowdon can force it into a standstill, which will eventually end in favor of Hippowdon because Stealth Rock has more PP than Defog does.

**Fairy-types**: Salamence is complete setup fodder for Pokemon such as Clefable, Sylveon, and Azumarill, which can all threaten it with their powerful STAB attacks.

**Hard-hitters**: Although the nature of Salamence's set makes it hard to prevent it from Defogging, Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, Garchomp, and offensive Starmie can switch into it as it Defogs and threaten an OHKO.

**Bulky Setup**: Pokemon such as Slowbro, Gyarados, Keldeo, specially defensive Gliscor, and Celebi can take or stall out Salamence's attacks and set up on it.

**Water-types**: Gyarados, Keldeo, and Rotom-W all take little damage from Salamence's attacks and can either cripple it with status or set up on it.
