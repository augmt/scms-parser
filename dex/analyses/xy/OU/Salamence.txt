Overview
########
Generation VI wasn't very kind to Salamence, due to the introduction of the Fairy-type. Salamence is now limited to what it can do, as there are now safe switch-ins to its Dragon-type STAB moves. Salamence also finds itself outclassed in its usual roles this generation as well. For instance, Mega Charizard X now outclasses it as a Dragon Dance sweeper in that it has better coverage and Tough Claws. Salamence's role as a revenge killer also faces competition from Garchomp, which is immune to Thundurus's Thunder Wave, has access to STAB Earthquake, and isn't weak to Stealth Rock. Salamence is also very susceptible to priority moves such as Sucker Punch and Ice Shard.

However, Salamence has many redeeming qualities. Salamence has dangerously high mixed attacking stats, allowing very few Pokemon to switch into Salamence's onslaught. Salamence's wide movepool also complements it nicely, and its high Speed stat allows to function as a revenge killer. Salamence's great ability in Moxie allows it to boost its Attack to even higher levels.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Dragon Claw
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Fire Blast
ability: Moxie
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naughty

Moves
========

Dragon Claw is a reliable STAB move, while Outrage is used late-game for more power. Earthquake provides much-needed coverage against Heatran and Tyranitar. Fire Blast is used to hit physically defensive Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory.

Set Details
========

A Choice Scarf boosts Salamence's Speed, giving it revenge killing capabilities. Moxie allows Salamence to boost its Attack every time it finishes off an opponent. 252 Attack EVs with a Naughty nature maximizes Attack. 252 Speed EVs maximizes Salamence's Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted tier with a Choice Scarf. A Naive nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Mega Charizard X at +1, but the power loss is noticeable.

Usage Tips
========

Salamence uses this set as a revenge killer and to pick off weakened opponents. Outrage is best used late-game when all of Salamence's checks and counters are weakened or gone, as the Attack boosts from Moxie, combined with Outrage, provide a massive damage output. That being said, using Outrage the first turn that Salamence is in is not advised.

Team Options
========

Defog users and Rapid Spinners such as Mew and Excadrill are great partners, as they can get rid of Stealth Rock, as every time Salamence switches into it, it loses a quarter of its health, and Salamence does find itself switching out often. Entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Skarmory is helpful, as it weakens opponents, making it easier for Salamence to OHKO them. Wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y make for good partners, as they can weaken enough Pokemon for Salamence to sweep effectively late-game. Choice Specs Magnezone is an especially good partner as it can weaken opponents and covers Salamence's weaknesses, while Salamence does the same in return for all of Magnezone's weaknesses. Dragon-types such as Garchomp are also good partners as they can also wallbreak effectively.

Other Options
########

Salamence has many toys that it can play around with. Salamence can run a Dragon Dance set, but it is mostly outclassed by Mega Charizard X and Dragonite because they both have better coverage and better abilities. Salamence can run a mixed set, as it has a wide array of special attacks such as Draco Meteor and Hydro Pump. Salamence has other coverage moves such as Zen Headbutt, Brick Break, and Crunch, but they either provide redundant coverage or Salamence can hit most of the targets of these moves harder with its STAB moves. Salamence has support options such as Wish, Defog, and Tailwind, but they are better used by other Pokemon and are a waste of Salamence's potential.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Clefable, and Gardevoir can take a hit from Salamence and OHKO it with a STAB move.

**Priority**: Sucker Punch from Bisharp and Ice Shard from Mamoswine or Weavile can both easily get rid of Salamence. Talonflame can also revenge kill Salamence with Brave Bird.

**Stealth Rock**: Stealth Rock takes a quarter of Salamence's health every time it switches in, and Salamence finds itself switching in and out quite often due to the fact that the opponent will usually send out a check after Salamence has revenge killed a Pokemon.

**Physical Walls**: Most physical walls, such as Slowbro, can take Salamence's attacks well and stall it out.
