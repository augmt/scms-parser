Overview
########

Zapdos is a great defensive check to several threats thanks to a few traits. The first is reliable recovery in the form of Roost, allowing it to stay healthy throughout the match, unlike many other Electric-types. The second is its solid bulk, which, coupled with a good defensive typing, allows Zapdos to check some of the tier's most dangerous threats, such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Scizor, Landorus, and Tornadus-T. The third is its ability to pressure offensive teams with the combination of its decent power, rather good coverage, and Roost stalling. Finally, Zapdos has access to Defog and the ability to beat Bisharp, something no other Defogger can do besides Mandibuzz. Unfortunately, Zapdos is held back by a Stealth Rock weakness, which is an especially large issue for a Defog user, and does not have the sheer bulk that some other defensive Pokemon possess. Furthermore, the Thundurus formes, both of which boast much more useful offensive abilities and Nasty Plot to help muscle through walls, outclass Zapdos offensively. When using Zapdos, be mindful of its limitations and play to its strengths, and it will be very effective.

Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Thunderbolt / Volt Switch
move 2: Roost
move 3: Defog / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Heat Wave / Toxic
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 176 Def / 68 SpA / 16 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Thunderbolt is Zapdos's best STAB option, packing respectable power thanks to its base 125 Special Attack. Roost helps keep Zapdos alive and mitigates its weakness to Stealth Rock. Defog gives Zapdos the excellent utility of keeping entry hazards off of the field. However, for teams already running Mega Sableye or a spinner, Hidden Power Ice can be run to hit Garchomp, Landorus, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, all of which are Pokemon that it wants to check. Heat Wave is the best option in the last slot to hit Steel-types like Scizor, Bisharp, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn very hard, although Toxic can also be effective as a method of wearing down common switch-ins like Mega Altaria, Landorus-T, and Tyranitar while allowing Zapdos to check Mega Slowbro.

Set Details
========

The EVs and Bold nature are designed to maximize Zapdos's physical bulk while outspeeding Adamant Bisharp. Instead of max HP investment, 4 EVs are moved to Defense so that Zapdos takes less damage from Stealth Rock while hitting a Defense jump point. The 68 Special Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO on Mega Pinsir with Thunderbolt, a Pokemon that Zapdos is meant to counter. Leftovers is the best item by far to improve Zapdos's longevity.

Usage Tips
========

Try not to switch Zapdos into Stealth Rock too much without using Roost in between, as keeping it from being worn down by entry hazards is worth the loss of some momentum. When Stealth Rock is on the field, don't use Zapdos to handle things that will probably just U-turn out like Scizor; Zapdos will get worn down quickly if you do. Instead, save Zapdos for your opponent's sweepers that you can't handle otherwise, such as Azumarill and Mega Pinsir. Try to keep Zapdos away from status because it hurts its longevity, especially Toxic. In general, try to keep Stealth Rock off the field as much as possible.

Team Options
========

Physical Fighting-types are good teammates for Zapdos as they can scare away or set up on Tyranitar and Chansey, two Pokemon that like to switch in on Zapdos. Mega Gallade, Mega Lopunny, and Terrakion are particularly good choices. Cleric support from the likes of Clefable, Mega Altaria, and Chansey is also nice to alleviate Zapdos's status woes. Wish support from them can also help Zapdos switch into Stealth Rock and powerful attacks without being forced to Roost, and Zapdos can take Steel- and Fighting-type attacks for them. In turn, they can switch into Pokemon such as Latios that beat Zapdos. Many Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Mega Charizard X can set up on Zapdos, so having a physically defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon to handle them is very helpful. Latios is a major issue for Zapdos, especially Calm Mind variants, so Pokemon such as Clefable, Tyranitar, and Heatran make for solid teammates.

Specaially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Thunderbolt / Volt Switch
move 2: Roost
move 3: Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Defog / Heat Wave
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 64 Def / 180 SpD / 16 Spe
nature: Calm


Moves
========

Thunderbolt is Zapdos's best STAB option, hitting decently hard. Volt Switch, while significantly weaker, is useful to gain switch initiative and momentum, although it isn't effective if Stealth Rock is on the field as it forces Zapdos to incur damage from the hazard for a second time. Roost keeps Zapdos healthy to take on opposing threats repeatedly. Hidden Power Ice is for Landorus, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Defog is generally preferred in the last slot to remove Stealth Rock and other entry hazards, although if you already have a form of hazard removal, Heat Wave is a solid option to hit Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Scizor, Bisharp, and Excadrill.

Set Details
========

The given EVs maximize Zapdos's special bulk, allowing it to counter Landorus as well as survive a +2 Return from Mega Pinsir after Stealth Rock damage while outpacing Adamant Bisharp. Leftovers is crucial to survive +2 Return from Mega Pinsir after Stealth Rock damage and increases Zapdos's overall longevity.

Usage Tips
========

Stealth Rock is a huge issue for Zapdos, so make sure to use Defog before switching out. If Stealth Rock is up, don't use Zapdos to take on Pok√©mon such as Scizor that will most likely just U-turn out, because it just wears Zapdos down. In general, try to keep Zapdos at decent health so that it can take on the likes of Landorus and Mega Pinsir.

Team Options
========

This Zapdos is particularly well-suited for teams that have difficulties with Landorus, a major threat in the OU tier. Having a cleric Pokemon such as Clefable or Chansey is fantastic for removing crippling status from Zapdos. Good physical walls like Hippowdon and Gliscor that handle powerful physical setup sweepers, such as Swords Dance Excadrill and Mega Charizard X, support Zapdos, as Zapdos is setup fodder for them. Finally, a Pokemon to handle Mega Altaria, such as Clefable, bulky Talonflame, Mega Venusaur, or Jirachi, is crucial.

Other Options
########

Zapdos has several other options for sets. SubToxic can be pretty effective on Zapdos, but it has issues with common Steel-types and is difficult to fit with the number of options that Zapdos wants to fit in. Roar is a good move for racking up entry hazard damage and phazing out boosting sweepers. Discharge is another STAB option with a nice chance to paralyze, but it lacks the power of Thunderbolt; for example, it can't OHKO Mega Pinsir. U-turn is an option over Volt Switch if you don't want to be stopped by Ground-type Pokemon before switching out. Zapdos also gets Agility and Baton Pass, but passing offensive boosts, which Zapdos cannot do, is much more effective in OU.

Checks & Counters
########

**Stealth Rock**: Making sure Stealth Rock stays on the field is the easiest way to deal with Zapdos. Good Stealth Rock users include Terrakion, Tyranitar, and Landorus-T, since all of them can force Zapdos out.

**Special Walls**: Zapdos doesn't have the firepower to get past dedicated special walls such as Chansey and Mega Venusaur. Tyranitar and Hippowdon can handle Zapdos if it lacks Toxic, and the former even threatens it with a Rock-type STAB.

**Dragon-types**: Many Dragon-types, such as Dragonite, Kyurem-B, Mega Charizard X, and Latios can set up on or do major damage to Zapdos.

**Setup Sweepers**: If Zapdos doesn't have Toxic, it becomes setup bait for Mega Charizard X, Mega Altaria, Clefable, and other common setup sweepers.

**Neutral STAB Attacks**: Even fully invested, Zapdos doesn't have the raw bulk to take strong, neutral STAB attacks from the likes of Latios, Talonflame, and Mega Lopunny.

**Rock- and Ice-types**: Pokemon such as Kyurem-B, Mamoswine, Terrakion, and Tyranitar can all take Zapdos out with relative ease.
