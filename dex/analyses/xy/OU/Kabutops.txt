Overview
########

Kabutops is one of the best Pokemon on rain hyper offense, due to its ability, Swift Swim, and great Attack, which lets it 2HKO some of the best physical walls in the OU metagame after a Swords Dance. While Kabutops has a small movepool, it has everything it needs. The only Pokemon not covered by its STABs alone, Ferrothorn, loses to a Swords Dance-boosted Low Kick. Gastrodon and Chesnaught are 2HKOed by Low Kick on the switch as well. Another great trait about Kabutops is that it stops Talonflame on rain offense teams. However, despite all that Kabutops has going for it, it does have some flaws, including lackluster Special Defense and a mediocre defensive typing, meaning that its decent Defense stat rarely comes into play. Another glaring flaw is that outside of rain, Kabutops isn't an excellent Pokemon due to the huge drop in Speed. Nonetheless, Kabutops is an excellent sweeper to use on rain teams.

Physical Attacker
########
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Waterfall
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: Swords Dance / Rapid Spin
move 4: Aqua Jet / Low Kick
ability: Swift Swim
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Waterfall is the primary STAB, which is boosted under rain and is capable of OHKOing most offensive Pokemon. Stone Edge is the secondary STAB and has excellent coverage alongside Waterfall. Swords Dance allows Kabutops to boost its already good Attack, but Rapid Spin can also be used if necessary, providing utility at the cost of power. However, Swords Dance is preferred because a +2 Waterfall in the rain OHKOes Skarmory after Stealth Rock. Low Kick is an awesome move for dealing with Pokemon that resist Kabutops's STAB, such as Ferrothorn, but Aqua Jet is good for revenge killing.

Set Details
=======

252 Attack and Speed EVs maximize Kabutops's offensive potential. Life Orb provides a significant power boost at the cost of some HP. An Adamant nature provides a power boost, as a Jolly nature only allows Kabutops to beat Choice Scarf Terrakion, which can be handled by Aqua Jet.

Usage Tips
========

Kabutops is free to sweep when its counters or checks are taken out or weakened. If your Politoed must be sacrificed, be sure that you can bring Kabutops out straight after. Under normal circumstances, rain lasts just long enough for Kabutops to sweep, but only if brought out right after rain is set up. Kabutops functions even better as a sweeper after a boost from Swords Dance. The best times to use Swords Dance is when Kabutops can force out the opponent, such as when against Charizard Y, or when it can finish them off with an Aqua Jet, which is a situation where you can predict them to switch. If at any given time Kabutops needs to switch out to avoid being OHKOed, switch it out, even if it means losing the last turns of rain.

Team Options
========

Politoed is one of the best Pokemon you could ever team Kabutops up with, and for one sole reason: Drizzle. Drizzle causes rain to start when Politoed switches in, and rain is necessary for Kabutops to function. Tornadus is also a great rain setter, as it has access to priority Rain Dance due to Prankster. Most Stealth Rock setters can work well with Kabutops, as it slowly weakens the opposing team and knocks certain Pokemon into KO range. Mega Scizor works well with Kabutops under rain due to the fact that Fire-type moves are weakened, and Mega Scizor has decent special bulk. Latios also works well with Kabutops, as it can beat many Pokemon that mess with its rain offense. Rotom-W is immune to Earthquake, which threatens Kabutops, and provides the utility of Volt Switch, as well as also getting a huge boost from the rain when using Hydro Pump. Lastly, Kingdra breaks many walls Kabutops has trouble with, and works well with Swift Swim as well, forming an offensive rain core.

Other Options
########

Kabutops can run a utility/support set consisting of Rapid Spin, Stealth Rock, Waterfall, and Stone Edge. However, Kabutops would rather use its offensive presence instead of being supportive to a team. Hone Claws could be used to boost its Attack by one stage rather than two, but boost the accuracy of Stone Edge as well. Knock Off is a nice utility move but it gains no additional coverage. Lastly, Kabutops can use a Lum Berry to escape the consequences of a burn or paralysis, which would halve its Attack or quarter its Speed, respectively.

Checks & Counters
########

**Weather Control**: Any other weather, with the occasional exception of Sand due to the Special Defense boost, is bad for Kabutops. This removes the boost to Water-type moves and the Speed boost from Swift Swim.

**Bulky Grass-types**: Mega Venusaur completely walls Kabutops as Kabutops can't OHKO it with a boosted Stone Edge and Mega Venusaur can OHKO with a STAB Grass-type attack. Chesnaught has high defenses, resists both of Kabutops's STABs, and can OHKO it with Wood Hammer. Gourgeist has high enough Defense to take a Stone Edge and can burn Kabutops. Breloom also resists both of Kabutops's STABs and can use Bullet Seed to OHKO. Ferrothorn can completely counter Kabutops if Kabutops does not have Low Kick.

**Counter-types**: Keldeo resists both of Kabutops's STABs, isn't heavy enough to take considerable damage from Low Kick, and OHKOes with Secret Sword. Rotom-W can live an unboosted Stone Edge and can use Volt Switch or Will-O-Wisp to beat Kabutops. Thundurus can OHKO Kabutops and can live a single unboosted Aqua Jet. Lastly, Gastrodon resists both of Kabutops's STABs and can 2HKO with Earth Power or burn Kabutops with Scald.

**Prankster**: Sableye can use Prankster Will-O-Wisp and then OHKO with Foul Play if Kabutops has used Swords Dance. Klefki can use Thunder Wave to take away the Speed boost from Rain.

**Mega Gyarados** Gyarados can set up on an -1 Kabutops thanks to Intimidate and OHKO with Earthquake.

**Choice Scarf Terrakion**: Terrakion can only check Kabutops if Kabutops does not have Aqua Jet or a Speed-boosting nature, but it can OHKO with Close Combat.
