Overview
########

While Moltres's Fire / Flying typing offers an unattractive 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, it also provides an array of resistances that allows it to fulfill an interesting defensive niche in the OU metagame. Its ability, Pressure, and its access to reliable recovery in the form of Roost are handy for a defensive Pokemon, allowing Moltres to stall out Pokemon that it checks by virtue of its typing, such as Lucario, Scizor, and Conkeldurr. Unfortunately, the Flame Pokemon is weak to common Water-, Electric-, and Rock-type attacks, which, in addition to the above-mentioned Stealth Rock weakness, means that Moltres faces significant competition for a position on a team. However, when used correctly, Moltres can be very difficult to take down.

move 3: Roost
move 4: Flamethrower
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 160 SpD / 100 Spe
nature: Calm

Moves
========

The combination of Substitute, Roost, and Toxic works excellently with Pressure to stall out slower opponents. Substitute provides protection from status, which otherwise cripples Moltres, and is easy to set up thanks to Moltres's handy resistances. Any defensive Pokemon worth its salt loves a form of recovery; Roost provides this longevity for Moltres. Toxic is a great way to cripple common switch-ins, especially bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Azumarill. Finally, Flamethrower is a decently strong STAB attack that has the added advantage of denting many Pokemon that don't mind Toxic, such as Steel-types, Mega Venusaur, Poison Heal Gliscor, and Celebi.

Set Details
========

The given EVs and Calm nature emphasize special bulk, allowing Moltres to check the likes of Alakazam, Landorus, and Mega Charizard Y, while also minimizing Stealth Rock damage and allowing Moltres to outspeed Adamant variants of Bisharp and Breloom. Leftovers is the item of choice for its useful HP restoration.

Usage Tips
========

This set is designed to stall out opposing Pokemon with passive damage from Toxic while keeping healthy with Roost. Moltres should try to set up a Substitute on Pokemon that cannot break it, such as Gliscor, or when it is expected that the opponent will switch out. A good example of when to use Substitute is if Moltres is on the field against a Ferrothorn. Keep in mind that if Moltres is not safely behind a Substitute, Toxic should nearly always be used to hit Water-types as they switch in, which will force Moltres out otherwise. It is also important to remember that Pressure will double the PP cost of moves used against Moltres, so it is feasible to stall out the PP of moves such as Stone Edge or Hydro Pump through the use of Substitute and Roost. Because Stealth Rock takes a huge 50% of Moltres's HP upon switching in, you should play cautiously when it is on the field, as using Substitute once before switching out will make Moltres only useful as death fodder unless you've previously removed Stealth Rock. Although this set invests in Special Defense, Moltres's typing allows it to check physical attackers, too. Scizor and Conkeldurr can do very little outside of Knock Off, and Ground-types such as Excadrill that lack a Rock-type coverage move will be completely shut down.

Team Options
========

This Moltres set is best suited for defensively inclined or balanced teams. In order for it to be effective, Defog or Rapid Spin support is a necessity; Excadrill has nice defensive synergy with Moltres and can demolish Tyranitar and Heatran with its STAB Earthquake. Mega Blastoise coves Moltres's Water-type vulnerability and Moltres can comfortably switch into Grass-type attacks aimed at Mega Blastoise. As far as Defog users go, Latios is an excellent choice, particularly variants carrying Earthquake, as they effectively lure and remove Heatran and deal nice damage to Tyranitar. Defensive, bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Gourgeist-XL are great partners as they can switch into Electric- and Water-type moves. In return, Moltres can check Fire-type threats such as Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. Teammates that can handle fast physical attackers such as Terrakion, Garchomp, and Talonflame are wise choices; Landorus-T and Rotom-W are effective in this pivot role and can often bring Moltres in safely with U-turn and Volt Switch, respectively. Landorus-T can also set up Stealth Rock to wear down opposing Pokemon.

Other Options
########

Moltres has several other useful options at its disposal. Will-O-Wisp and Roar can potentially be used over Substitute and Toxic on the defensive set, allowing Moltres to prevent dangerous opponents, such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Mega Gyarados, from setting up. An offensive set with Choice Specs and Hurricane is an option as it hits extremely hard, but this set is held back by strong competition from other rain abusers such as Tornadus-T, as well as Moltres's low Speed. Defog is possibly viable, though Moltres struggles to find space for it in its moveset. In addition, Moltres will often have to switch into Stealth Rock in order to use Defog, so entry hazard removal is best left to teammates.

Checks & Counters
########

**Stealth Rock**: As Stealth Rock removes 50% of Moltres's health upon switching in, it prevents Moltres from countering many of the threats it otherwise could and leaves it far more prone to being revenge killed.

**Special Walls**: Tyranitar, Heatran, and Chansey easily take Moltres's STAB moves. Tyranitar can retaliate with Stone Edge or Pursuit, though it doesn't like Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. Specially defensive Heatran is immune to Flamethrower and Toxic, and can lay down Stealth Rock or cripple Moltres with Toxic. Chansey can take any hit comfortably, heal potential poison with Natural Cure, and ruin Moltres with status. Rotom-W resists Moltres's STAB moves and can hit back with Hydro Pump or Volt Switch, and Rest variants are unworried by Toxic.

**Status Damage Immunity**: Magic Guard Clefable can't be worn down with Toxic and takes little damage from Flamethrower. Substitute users that resist Flamethrower such as Garchomp and Gyarados can set up a Substitute that defensive Moltres cannot immediately break. Similarly, setup sweepers carrying a Lum Berry can boost without fear against Moltres. Dragonite is a good example.

**Faster Pokemon**: Naturally faster Pokemon with super effective moves such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Starmie, and Thundurus make for good checks, especially if Moltres is not behind a Substitute.
