Overview
########

Even though Chandelure is not a standard choice in OU, it has a few things going for it. For starters, it has an amazing STAB combination that only Tyranitar resists, along with a fantastic Special Attack stat. This makes Chandelure a decent Choice Scarf user, being able to revenge kill a plethora of fast Pokemon and clean up late-game. Furthermore, Chandelure's access to Taunt makes it an effective stallbreaker, especially when combined with Substitute and its useful resistances, which allow it to take advantage of many common defensive Pokemon, such as Chansey, Clefable, Heatran, and Mega Venusaur. Finally, Flash Fire can be situationally useful to pivot around Mega Charizard Y and for the power boost.

And that's where the good things end. Chandelure is slow for a Choice Scarf user, rendering it unable to outspeed many Speed-boosting Pokemon, such as Mega Charizard X, and common Choice Scarf users, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Keldeo. Also, Chandelure is weak to Stealth Rock and Pursuit and has mediocre bulk, all of which make it much harder to use than its competition, Choice Scarf Heatran. Finally, Chandelure has many common weaknesses, namely to Water-, Ground-, Dark-, and Rock-type moves, meaning that it can be quite hard to switch in and is very susceptible to revenge killing, as almost any faster or priority-using Pokemon can OHKO it, including Azumarill and Bisharp.

Stallbreaker
########
name: Stallbreaker
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Fire Blast / Will-O-Wisp
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Taunt
ability: Flash Fire
item: Leftovers
evs: 160 HP / 156 SpA / 192 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Shadow Ball is Chandelure's most spammable move and 2HKOes many Pokemon neutral to it. Fire Blast 2HKOes specially defensive Gliscor and OHKOes most Steel- and Grass-types, while Will-O-Wisp cripples Tyranitar and is more reliable than Fire Blast against Chansey, as Fire Blast's low PP can backfire against Chandelure. Without Will-O-Wisp, Chandelure can't do anything to Chansey, though you still win the PP war. Will-O-Wisp also deals with Azumarill, especially Assault Vest sets, which would otherwise be a big problem to Chandelure. Substitute eases prediction, helps avoid Bisharp's Sucker Punch, and lets Chandelure take advantage of Pokemon that can't break the Substitute, such as Clefable, Chansey, defensive Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, Heatran without Earth Power, Mega Scizor without Knock Off, and Amoonguss. Taunt shuts down the recovery of walls such as specially defensive Mega Charizard X, Chansey, Alomomola, and Suicune, letting Chandelure get past them and become an effective stallbreaker. Hex can be used over Shadow Ball when using Will-O-Wisp, as those two moves have great synergy together and give to Chandelure a 130 BP move against burned Pokemon. However, Hex is situational, as it's weaker than Shadow Ball against targets that aren't burned.

Set Details
========

The EV spread allows Chandelure to outspeed Jolly Tyranitar, Adamant Bisharp, and Timid Magnezone and to make Substitutes that don't break from defensive Mega Venusaur's Sludge Bomb and Clefable's Moonblast. Flash Fire lets Chandelure check Mega Charizard Y and take advantage of the power boost it will sometimes get from Fire-type moves. If using Will-O-Wisp over Fire Blast, it is advised to use a Timid nature with a spread of 160 HP / 136 SpA / 212 Spe, in order to outrun Jolly Mega Heracross and Dragonite, along with Mega Gyarados and Gyarados before they set up a Substitute or OHKO Chandelure.


Usage Tips
========

This set's main purpose is to help combat stall teams and break down defensive cores by taking advantage of certain Pokemon, such as Mega Venusaur, Clefable, Steel-types, and Chansey. Therefore, bring Chandelure in against one of those Pokemon and use Substitute or Taunt, depending on the situation. When you have a Substitute up, Chandelure can start doing some work with its attacks or Will-O-Wisp. Be sure to set up Stealth Rock before sending Chandelure in, as it needs the additional damage to pressure Mega Charizard X and Chansey - remember that Fire Blast only has 8 PP and is Chandelure's only way of doing damage to Chansey and 2HKOing specially defensive Gliscor. Against offensive teams you can play more recklessly with Chandelure and just try to deal as much damage as possible before going down, so don't be afraid to make aggressive double switches and risky plays, as Chandelure has little value against offensive teams anyway.

Team Options
========

A reliable Stealth Rock setter helps Chandelure harass its defensive checks, such as specially defensive variants of Mega Charizard X, Earth Power Heatran, Talonflame, and Gyarados, making it an essential tool for effective stallbreaking. Clefable, Taunt Terrakion, and Fire Blast Tyranitar are able to keep Stealth Rock up against the anti-hazard Pokemon of stall teams, such as bulky Starmie, Defog Skarmory, and Defog Zapdos. Chandelure appreciates anti-hazard support of its own, which means that Latios, Latias, and Starmie are all good partners; in addition, they also help against some of Chandelure's checks and counters, such as Keldeo and Garchomp. Finally, Chandelure also needs partners to cover Tyranitar, Water-, and Ground-types, all of which Mega Venusaur, Breloom, Keldeo, Amoonguss, and Rotom-W are all good at doing.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Overheat
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Hidden Power Fighting / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Trick / Energy Ball
ability: Flash Fire
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========

Overheat and Shadow Ball are Chandelure's main moves, with Overheat opening holes early-game and Shadow Ball covering Pokemon that resist Fire-type and cleaning up late-game. Hidden Power Fighting 2HKOes Tyranitar and OHKOes Bisharp, two Pokemon that can switch into at least one of Chandelure's STAB moves and trap it with Pursuit. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Dragonite after Stealth Rock, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T, while also hitting Tyranitar for a decent amount of damage. Trick cripples defensive Pokemon that wall Chandelure, such as Chansey, specially defensive Heatran, Alomomola, and Suicune. However, Energy Ball is Chandelure's best shot against Keldeo, Terrakion, Mega Gyarados, Manaphy, Rotom-W, and Azumarill, while also being its strongest move against Tyranitar, if it lacks Hidden Power Fighting. Will-O-Wisp can be used alongside Trick, as it allows Chandelure to bypass Bisharp's Sucker Punch and burn common checks and counters, such as Azumarill, Tyranitar, and Terrakion, after it has Tricked away its Choice Scarf. Memento is another move that can be used in the last slot, allowing Chandelure to reliably cripple Pokemon that it can't revenge kill, such +1 Mega Tyranitar and +1 Mega Gyarados, and let its teammates take care of them. Memento can also be used to provide setup chances for sweepers.

Set Details
========

A Modest nature is the best option for the extra power, which is one of Chandelure's main advantages as a Choice Scarf user. If, however, outspeeding Adamant Dragonite, Gyarados, and Mega Gyarados after one Dragon Dance is important, a Timid nature should be used, as well as Energy Ball and Hidden Power Ice, in order to allow Chandelure to revenge kill those threats effectively.

Usage Tips
========

If you need Chandelure to check a threatening Pokemon, play safely with it; if not, feel free to play recklessly and even Trick away Chandelure's item early-game in order to cripple key defensive Pokemon. However, beware of Pursuit users, especially Tyranitar. Making double switches and using Chandelure as a means of forcing switches is the best way to use it if Tyranitar is on the opposing team. There is no need to predict a lot if the opponent lacks a Pursuit user, as Overheat dents even some Pokemon which resist it, such as Keldeo, which faints the second time it switches in if Stealth Rock is up. Finally, beware of Mega Evolutions when you want to use Trick, especially specially defensive Mega Charizard X and Y, both of which wall Chandelure.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can take advantage of Tyranitar, Ground-types, Water-types, and special walls are good teammates, with Breloom and Keldeo being perfect for this job. Also, entry hazards removal support is needed in order for Chandelure to be able to switch in and out as freely as possible. Starmie is a great spinner in general and beats Tyranitar and most Ground-types with Hydro Pump; some Water-types such as Keldeo with Psyshock; and Gyarados, Alomomola, and Slowbro with Thunderbolt. Mega Scizor with U-turn and Defog can bring Chandelure in safely and check many Ground-types, such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Garchomp; along with some Water-types, mainly Azumarill; and any Tyranitar without Fire Blast. Wallbreakers also pair well with Chandelure and help it clean up, especially those able to lure and weaken bulky Ground- and Water-types. Life Orb Swords Dance Terrakion is an excellent example of this, being able to lure, weaken, and even KO Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon, while also being able to take advantage of Tyranitar.

Other Options
########

Chandelure can use Pain Split, Will-O-Wisp, or Substitute in tandem with Shadow Ball, Fire Blast, and Hidden Power Fighting, with Life Orb or Leftovers (if using Substitute). Pain Split extends Chandelure's lifespan and lets it take advantage of Chansey without having to run Taunt, Will-O-Wisp helps avoid Bisharp's Sucker Punch and cripple common checks such as Tyranitar and Azumarill, and Substitute eases prediction and shields Chandelure from revenge killers, priority users, and Bisharp's Sucker Punch.

Checks & Counters
########

**Rock-types**: Tyranitar is a hard counter to any Chandelure lacking Will-O-Wisp or Hidden Power Fighting, and it has Pursuit to make sure that Chandelure can't switch out. Terrakion, Mega Aerodactyl, and Rhyperior can take Chandelure's Fire-type moves and are thus good checks to the Choice Scarf set, but all of them are 2HKOed by Shadow Ball.

**Water-types**: Of all the Water-types, Assault Vest Azumarill is the best answer to Chandelure, only fearing Will-O-Wisp from the stallbreaking set. Keldeo, Gyarados, Rotom-W, Manaphy, and Suicune are all decent checks to the Choice Scarf set, being able to switch into Overheat at least once and threaten Chandelure with Water-type attacks, but they have a harder time dealing with the stallbreaking set, which isn't locked into a single move.

**Fire-types**: Specially defensive variants of Heatran, Mega Charizard X, and Talonflame are great checks to Chandelure, being able to avoid the 2HKO even from Shadow Ball as long as Stealth Rock is off the field. Talonflame has to watch out for Special Defense drops, though, because it is 2HKOed at -1 and can't OHKO Chandelure back. Heatran loses to the stallbreaking set if it doesn't carry Ancient Power or Earth Power.

**Ground-types**: Garchomp and specially defensive Hippowdon are good answers to Chandelure, with the latter being a hard counter to Chandelure. Specially defensive Gliscor counters the stallbreaking set if it lacks Fire Blast, while Diggersby is immune to Shadow Ball, allowing it to act as a situational check to the Choice Scarf set if used in tandem with a solid Fire resist.

**Faster Pokemon with super effective moves**: While faster Pokemon threaten most frail Pokemon, they are an even bigger concern for Chandelure because most offensive Pokemon have moves that hit it for super effective damage. Any faster Pokemon with such a move will most likely OHKO Chandelure.

**Miscellaneous**: Chansey walls the Choice Scarf set, but it must watch out for Trick. Bisharp and Weavile can Pursuit trap a Choice Scarf Chandelure locked into any move other than Overheat or Hidden Power Fighting. Stealth Rock is a good way to keep Chandelure in check. Finally, Assault Vest Conkeldurr and Assault Vest Tornadus-T can check Chandelure once or twice.
