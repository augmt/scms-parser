Overview
########

With its devastating offensive capabilities and inability to be revenge killed in sand, Excadrill is the face of sand offense in the OU tier. In sand, it is pretty much impossible to revenge kill Excadrill, causing offensive teams major problems. Balanced teams typically have enormous trouble stomaching Swords Dance-boosted hits, which annihilate the likes of Slowbro and Gliscor. Additionally, Excadrill has access to Rapid Spin, which allows it to act as a great entry hazard remover. Excadrill also has a solid typing that makes up for its rather mediocre bulk, allowing it to go toe-to-toe with Pokemon such as Latios and Raikou.

However, despite how solid of a Pokemon it is, Excadrill is not without its flaws. Its Speed stat is far from stellar outside of sand, leaving it vulnerable to being revenge killed. Its defenses and typing leave it vulnerable to being revenge killed by common priority attacks, especially when it has been weakened a bit. To make matters worse, Excadrill has poor type synergy with Hippowdon and Tyranitar, which are required as partners in order to set up sand. All in all, Excadrill is a devastating offensive threat in the OU tier and a crucial component of sand offense.


Sand Rush Sweeper
########
name: Sand Rush Sweeper
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Swords Dance / Rapid Spin
ability: Sand Rush
item: Life Orb / Air Balloon
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Earthquake and Iron Head are Excadrill's STAB moves, sporting high power and fantastic coverage. Life Orb-boosted Earthquake is extremely powerful, 2HKOing standard Ferrothorn and generally pummeling pretty much any Pokemon that does not resist it. Iron Head has a useful chance to flinch and hits most non-grounded foes, such as Latios, Landorus-T, and Gengar, for a high amount of damage. Rock Slide is Excadrill's best coverage move, hitting Flying-types such as Thundurus, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir super effectively. It is also Excadrill's best option against Rotom-W and Skarmory. The last slot is a choice between sweeping capability and team support. Swords Dance turns Excadrill into a fearsome balance breaker; for instance, it gives it a high chance to KO Slowbro and standard Choice Scarf Landorus-T after Stealth Rock damage with Earthquake. However, Rapid Spin is a viable alternative if removing entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, is important for Excadrill's teammates.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Excadrill to hit as hard and fast as possible. An Adamant nature is generally preferable for the power boost, allowing Earthquake to 2HKO Ferrothorn with no boost and Slowbro with a boost. However, A Jolly nature is also a viable option to tie with opposing Excadrill at worst, outrun +2 Jolly Gyarados, and outrun neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Gardevoir. Life Orb is the preferred item to increase Excadrill's damage output, but easily wears Excadrill down. An Air Balloon can be used instead to gain free switches into Choice-locked Ground-types and improve Excadrill's matchup against opposing Ground-types in general; it can be used to gain extra opportunities to spin or beat the likes of Hippowdon, Gliscor, and Landorus-T if Excadrill uses Swords Dance on the switch. Teams that struggle with Ground-types will appreciate Air Balloon the most.

Usage Tips
========

If Excadrill is running Swords Dance, it acts as a great wallbreaker early-game. For example, a +2 Life Orb Earthquake is powerful enough to OHKO standard Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock damage. Excadrill is also capable of cleaning up weakened teams late-game, after its checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened and priority users have been KOed. Additionally, Excadrill is a decent check to any Fairy-type not named Azumarill thanks to its Steel typing. It can also check Flying-types under sand, as it is capable of beating Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, and Thundurus. Try to keep Excadrill as healthy as possible by keeping it away from attacks under most circumstances, as it might otherwise potentially be put in range of opposing priority attacks.

Team Options
========

Excadrill needs sand support to function, so either Smooth Rock Tyranitar or Hippowdon should be used alongside it. Bulky Grass-types give Excadrill trouble, so Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Scizor, and Mega Charizard Y make for great teammates. Bulky Water-types also pose a problem, so Pokemon such as Thundurus, Celebi, Tangrowth, and Raikou make for great teammates. Additionally, Pokemon such as Keldeo, Azumarill, Breloom, and Celebi can deal with the bulky Ground-types that Excadrill hates. Latias and Celebi are excellent teammates, as they can check Rotom-W and provide Healing Wish support for Excadrill. Finally, rain teams give Excadrill nightmares, so teammates that are able to take on common rain sweepers are recommended, such as Celebi, Tangrowth, and Ferrothorn.

Bulky Spinner
########
name: Bulky Spinner
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Rapid Spin
move 4: Toxic / Stealth Rock
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Earthquake and Iron Head are Excadrill's STAB moves, and they provide decent coverage against Electric-, Steel-, and Fairy-types. Rapid Spin is used to remove entry hazards from Excadrill's side of the field to support its teammates. Toxic is a great move, as it allows Excadrill to cripple the bulky Ground-, Grass-, and Water-types that like to switch into it. Thanks to Mold Breaker, it is able to hit Mega Sableye through Magic Bounce. However, Stealth Rock is a viable alternative, as Excadrill ignores Magic Bounce with Mold Breaker and has the longevity to set it up multiple times throughout the match.

Set Details
========

While full HP and Special Defense investment might look odd on Excadrill, the EVs allow it to tank some special hits it otherwise couldn't, including some super effective ones such as Clefable's Flamethrower and support Heatran's Lava Plume. It is also able to switch into Draco Meteors from Latios quite consistently and can tank a Fire Blast from Mega Altaria if required. Some Speed investment in order to outrun standard Rotom-W, which normally hits 219 Speed, and hit it with Earthquake may be run if desired. Mold Breaker allows Excadrill to ignore Mega Sableye's Magic Bounce and hit Levitate users, such as Rotom-W. Leftovers gives Excadrill passive recovery.

Usage Tips
========

This set is best used as a bulky Rapid Spinner that pivots into certain special attackers, such as Clefable, Sylveon, Raikou, and Latios. It can then proceed to use Rapid Spin againsy these targets, as they have no way of dealing significant damage to Excadrill. Additionally, this set is capable of luring in and crippling many of Excadrill's normal checks, such as bulky Ground-, Grass-, and Water-types, with Toxic.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate entry hazard removal, such as Talonflame, Dragonite, Thundurus, and Kyurem-B, are able to take advantage of Excadrill's spinning capabilities. Pokemon that beat bulky Water- and Ground-types, such as Celebi, Tangrowth, Keldeo, and Raikou, are good partners. Clefable appreciates Excadrill's ability to handle most Steel-types, and in return it takes on the Fighting-types that threaten Excadrill. Additionally, it is able to pass Wishes to Excadrill to keep it healthy.

Other Options
########

With a Choice Scarf, Excadrill becomes a fast Rapid Spinner, but setup sweepers can easily take advantage of an Excadrill locked into Rapid Spin. Return is a viable option on the Sand Rush set because it hits Rotom-W harder than any other move and has decent coverage in general. Substitute allows Excadrill to avoid status moves as well as Bisharp's Sucker Punch, which often awards it a free turn. A type-resist berry, such as a Chople or Passho Berry, allows Excadrill to avoid being revenge killed by Mach Punch and Aqua Jet, respectively, which often allows it to score a surprise KO. Finally, an offensive Stealth Rock set equipped with a Focus Sash can be used as a decent lead that sets up Stealth Rock and is capable of spinning away the opponent's entry hazards.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types, such as Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Alomomola, can tank hits from Excadrill and threaten it with a super effective Scald that can potentially burn it. However, these Pokemon struggle to handle Swords Dance Excadrill, which has a high chance to KO Slowbro and Alomomola after Stealth Rock damage with +2 Earthquake. It can also KO Rotom-W with +2 Rock Slide if it has already taken a Rock Slide from Excadrill. Quagsire can stomach hits from non-Life Orb Excadrill fairly effectively. Mega Slowbro is a perfect counter, being able to tank even Swords Dance-boosted Earthquakes while OHKOing in return with Scald after Excadrill has taken Stealth Rock and Life Orb damage.

**Ground-types**: Landorus-T (particularly defensive variants), physically defensive Gliscor, and Hippowdon are fantastic answers to Excadrill, possessing the raw bulk to tank its attacks and the ability to KO in return with STAB Earthquake. Garchomp can tank a hit from Excadrill and KO it in return with Earthqake, while physically defensive variants can actually switch in as they are not 2HKOed by Earthquake.

**Steel-types**: Skarmory is the best Excadrill counter in the game, able to tank any attacks from it with ease and set up hazards, go for Defog, phaze it out, or hit it back with Counter or Brave Bird. Physically defensive Mega Scizor is a fairly solid answer, only fearing the 2HKO from Adamant Life Orb-boosted Earthquake and being able to heal off the damage or KO Excadrill with Superpower. Ferrothorn, particularly with a more physically defensive spread than normal, can tank hits from Excadrill, though standard variants do not enjoy tanking Life Orb-boosted Earthquakes. Air Balloon Heatran can be used as an offensive check to Excadrill, avoiding Earthquake while being able to KO with Fire Blast. Choice Scarf Magnezone can trap and KO weakened Excadrill with Hidden Power Fire if it gets in after sand expires. Finally, Bronzong is a perfect counter to Excadrill.

**Physically Defensive Pokemon**: While not necessarily fantastic switch-ins with Stealth Rock on the field, Mew, Mega Sableye, Mandibuzz, and physically defensive Celebi can all serve as effective checks to Excadrill.

**Priority Moves**: Breloom, Azumarill, Conkeldurr, Crawdaunt, and Bisharp are capable of KOing Excadrill with their priority moves after a bit of prior damage. If Excadrill is sufficiently weakened, Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, and Choice Band Dragonite are capable of picking Excadrill off as well. However, they all can only revenge kill it, as Excadrill is capable of severely damaging them on the switch.
