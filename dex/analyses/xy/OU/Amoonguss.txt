Overview
########
While Amoonguss may not be one of the first choices for a team, it has several unique qualities that help it stand out. Its great defensive typing gives it useful resistances to Water-, Electric-, Fighting-, Fairy-, and Grass-type attacks, letting it wall a myriad of common and dangerous threats such as Azumarill, Keldeo, and Thundurus. Where Amoonguss truly shines, however, is with its access to Spore, the only 100% accurate sleep-inducing move in the game. Amoonguss is also incredibly difficult to wear down due to its great bulk, defensive typing, awesome ability in Regenerator, access to Giga Drain, and immunity to Toxic. However, Amoonguss has one major flaw: after putting an opposing Pokemon to sleep, it can't do much to stop another Pokemon from setting up on it. It also faces competition from Mega Venusaur, which is much faster, boasts overall higher stats, and has two fewer weaknesses thanks to Thick Fat. However, between Regenerator, Spore, and the fact that Amoonguss does not take up a team's valuable Mega Evolution slot, Amoonguss certainly has value over its fellow Grass / Poison types. Overall, despite its shortcomings, if Amoonguss is played carefully, it can provide invaluable support to nearly any defensive or balance team.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Spore
move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Hidden Power Fire / Foul Play
move 4: Clear Smog / Sludge Bomb
ability: Regenerator
item: Black Sludge
evs: 252 HP / 136 Def / 120 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========
Spore is one of the main reasons to use Amoonguss. Giga Drain is boosted by STAB and heals Amoonguss, adding to its already great bulk and longevity. Hidden Power Fire is useful for hitting Scizor and Grass-types, particularly Ferrothorn, as they are immune to Spore, , while Foul Play prevents Amoonguss from being setup fodder for physical attackers. Clear Smog lets Amoonguss remove Calm Mind boosts from Pokemon such as Suicune and stop them from setting up on it, however, some Pokemon such as Talonflame can still use it as setup bait. In addition, Steel-type sweepers such as Lucario and Scizor are not affected by Clear Smog, so they have free reign to set up on Amoonguss if it has already put something else on the opposing team to sleep. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb can be used, as it is Amoonguss's strongest and most reliable STAB move and has a 30% chance to poison the foe.

Set Details
========
The given EV spread lets Amoonguss take on Belly Drum Azumarill, as well as Keldeo and Thundurus. Black Sludge is the preferred item, as it provides passive healing. Alternatively, Leftovers can be used over Black Sludge, but Black Sludge is more useful because it cripples Trick users and deters them from using Trick on Amoonguss at all.

Usage Tips
========
As it is a pivot, Amoonguss will be switching in very often throughout the match. It is very easy to switch in thanks to its resistances, Regenerator, and its ability to wall common Pokemon. Spore is a very powerful tool and should not be used thoughtlessly. Amoonguss will most often only be able to put one foe to sleep in the entire match, so take note of which Pokemon you want to put to sleep before mindlessly clicking Spore. In addition, the mere threat of Spore is also very useful. Predicting which Pokemon the opponent will use as sleep fodder and capitalizing on it not only gains momentum but also allows you to possibly put a more dangerous Pokemon on the opponent's team to sleep later in the battle. However, Amoonguss can be helpless against certain Pokemon after it has already put something else to sleep. Successfully using Spore to its greatest potential requires prediction and clever planning. To prevent Amoonguss from being setup bait after Spore has been used, you can utilize double switches to deter the opposing team from setting up on it.

Team Options
========
Amoonguss isn't too support-reliant, as it is usually the one doing the supporting. It can be paired with other Regenerator users such as Slowbro to form a solid defensive core that can be very difficult to break through. Rotom-W and Heatran are good partners, as they have fantastic synergy with Amoonguss and can handle Talonflame rather well. Clefable is a nice teammate to handle Latios. Good switch-ins to Mega Charizard Y, such as Chansey, Latios, and Dragonite, are appreciated. Other standard defensive Pokemon such as Quagsire, Gliscor, and Skarmory fit well on many of the same teams as Amoonguss does.

Other Options
########
Synthesis can be used to give Amoonguss even more recovery, though it is redundant with Regenerator, and the moveslot is better used on one of Amoonguss's main options. Stun Spore lets Amoonguss cripple Pokemon after it has already put something to sleep, but it isn't really worth the moveslot. Energy Ball can be used as it has 15 more Base Power than Giga Drain, though Amoonguss generally appreciates the recovery of Giga Drain too much to give it up.

Checks & Counters
########

**Setup Sweepers**: After it has put something to sleep, Amoonguss is setup fodder for a wide variety of Pokemon, especially ones that threaten it initially or are immune to Clear Smog. Scizor can set up on Amoonguss if it lacks Hidden Power Fire, while Dragonite and Mega Tyranitar can set up on Amoonguss regardless of its moves. Fire-types such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard X, and Volcarona threaten Amoonguss with their powerful STAB moves and can also set up on it.

**Strong Fire-, Flying-, Ice-, and Psychic-types**: Amoonguss might be very bulky, but like most Pokemon, it does not take super effective STAB moves very well. Mega Medicham, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, Latios, Heatran, and Kyurem-B can all dent Amoonguss with their respective STAB attacks. Similarly, Thundurus with Psychic or Hidden Power Flying can break through Amoonguss.

**Steel-types**: Amoonguss has problems beating certain Steel-types. As a Grass / Steel type, Ferrothorn is immune to Spore, Clear Smog, and Sludge Bomb, takes very little damage from Giga Drain, and is at best 3HKOed by uninvested Hidden Power Fire. Bisharp fears Spore and Hidden Power Fire, but it can do rather well against Amoonguss one-on-one. Skarmory fears none of Amoonguss's attacks, including Hidden Power Fire, but it must be cautious of Spore.

**Grass-types**: In general, opposing Grass-type Pokemon are a problem for Amoonguss, as they are immune to Spore and Amoonguss is not powerful enough to break through very many them, even with super effective attacks. Mega Venusaur in particular is neutral to Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Fire.

**Clerics**: Heal Bell and Aromatherapy users are able to heal opposing teams of status spread by Amoonguss in a single turn. Chansey in particular laughs at Amoonguss's attacks and, thanks to Natural Cure, can't be crippled by Spore.
