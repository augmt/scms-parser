Overview
########

Heatran is an extraordinarily versatile and effective Pokemon in the OU tier. With excellent bulk and a nice defensive typing, it can serve as a check to an enormous amount of top-tier threats, such as Latias, Latios, Clefable, Mega Scizor, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard X. Due to these traits, it can serve as an effective bulky support Pokemon, boasting the ability to take advantage of many bulkier foes with the Taunt + Toxic combination. However, a defensive set is not all that Heatran can pull off in OU; it can also serve as an offensive Stealth Rock setter with the ability to beat Mega Sableye, stallbreaker, trapper, check to various Ground-type move users with Air Balloon, Choice Scarf user, and so much more. Having all these options means that Heatran can be molded to fit whatever purposes its team requires and is a true team player. Unfortunately for Heatran, it has weaknesses to Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks, which are extremely common in OU and threatening for it. Additionally, some of the Pokemon that Heatran is meant to handle can lure it in and then KO it, such as Superpower Mega Scizor, Knock Off Mega Venusaur, Earthquake Latios, and Focus Blast Clefable.

Specially Defensive

evs: 248 HP / 192 SpD / 68 Spe

Moves
========

Lava Plume is a basic STAB option with a useful burn chance to punish common switch-ins, especially physical attackers such as Azumarill and Landorus-T. Toxic is critical for Heatran to cripple bulky Water-types, wear down Keldeo, and actually handle Roost Latios, Mega Charizard X, and Talonflame; it also prevents Pokemon from setting up for free. Taunt is is crucial for Heatran to deal with Calm Mind Clefable and is incredibly useful against balanced and stall teams, allowing Heatran to wear down defensive Pokemon, such as Chansey, Mandibuzz, and Mega Venusaur, when combined with Toxic and defeat slower Heatran that lack Earth Power. Protect is an excellent option to scout opposing Pokemon, prevent Choice Scarf Landorus-T from keeping momentum with U-turn, punish a potential double switch when it is first used, rack up Toxic damage, and increase Heatran's longevity by giving it extra turns of Leftovers recovery. Roar is another solid option to phaze setup sweepers, ensuring Heatran can deal with the likes of Mega Charizard X and Talonflame when Toxic damage won't be enough. While Roar makes Heatran unable to deal with Clefable in a last Pokemon scenario, it still allows Heatran to phaze Clefable and is enough as long as you have a secondary method of dealing with Clefable. The last slot is typically occupied by Stealth Rock because Heatran is perhaps the single most consistent Stealth Rock user in the OU tier, boasting a good matchup against every common Defog user, including Latios, Latias, Skarmory, Mandibuzz, and Zapdos, and threatening Excadrill while being able to set up the entry hazard on a high number of popular Pokemon; it also has a good matchup against Mega Sableye in the sense that Mega Sableye hates burns, so the opponent can actually be punished for switching Mega Sableye in to reflect Stealth Rock. Earth Power prevents faster opposing Heatran from stalling this Heatran out with Taunt, hits Mega Diancie and Tentacruel, and makes dealing with Mega Charizard X easier. Another option is Stone Edge if Heatran's team doesn't really have other ways of checking notable threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Talonflame, particularly Taunt variants. Ancient Power boasts perfect accuracy, but it doesn't do enough to specially defensive Talonflame variants to be worth it.

Set Details
========

The given EVs allow Heatran to outrun minimum Speed Suicune, Mega Venusaur, and Mandibuzz, which is useful with Taunt. The extra bulk afforded by Special Defense investment makes this Heatran more consistent than fast support variants at dealing with Latios, as those take about 40% from Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock damage, while this takes about 30%. This Heatran is also able to deal with the likes of Mega Manectric much more consistently, Thunderbolt 2HKOes faster Heatran variants after they tank a Volt Switch; Choice Specs Raikou also falls under this umbrella, as it 2HKOes fast Heatran with Choice Specs-boosted Thunderbolt, whilst it only 3HKOes this spread. Specially defensive Heatran also only takes approximately 60% from Mega Charizard Y's Focus Blast, 50% from Rotom-W's Hydro Pump, 70% from Gengar's Focus Blast, and 65% from +1 Mega Slowbro's Scald, allowing it to cripple them with a Toxic or, in Gengar's case, hit back with a Lava Plume. The Speed investment on this set can be altered based on team-specific needs and personal preference. If outspeeding Suicune isn't important, it's generally advisable to run at least enough Speed to outspeed standard Mega Venusaur&mdash;which typically hits 200 Speed to outrun minimum Speed Azumarill&mdash; so that it doesn't get opportunities to heal up against Heatran. Outrunning Rotom-W to hit it with Toxic before it Volt Switches out and potentially block a Pain Split can also be useful; something to keep in mind is that Rotom-W typically runs 44 Speed EVs to outrun Jolly Azumarill (hitting 219 Speed), so enough investment to hit 220 Speed is the minimum necessary. To a further extent, maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature can be used to outpace specific threats such as Adamant Excadrill outside of sand, Jolly Mega Scizor, Jolly Bisharp, Jolly Breloom, and Adamant Diggersby.

Usage Tips
========

This Heatran should be pivoted into Pokemon it beats, such as Latios, Clefable, Mega Venusaur, and Ferrothorn, in order to get Stealth Rock up as soon as possible; it can be pivoted in more recklessly than fast Heatran variants because it has more bulk to sponge hits. In some scenarios, it may be best to fire off a Toxic immediately in order to wear down a threatening Keldeo or Azumarill that will be more inclined to switch in directly when they anticipate Stealth Rock as opposed to Toxic. Scouting for lures such as Earthquake Latios and fast Superpower Mega Scizor is imperative with this set because you don't want to lose Heatran just because you were careless. If the opponent has a Pokemon that Heatran is necessary to deal with, such as Talonflame or Mega Charizard X, exercise extra caution. Due to its excellent special bulk, Heatran actually has the capacity to tank Scalds from bulky Water-types and even a Hydro Pump from Rotom-W and cripple them with a Toxic; unless keeping Heatran healthy is absolutely necessary, keep in mind the advantages of crippling these Pokemon with a Toxic, especially if wearing them down is compulsory for a teammate to sweep. Finally, if using Protect, keep in mind that it should only be used in scenarios in which it can't be punished; Protect can actually give certain foes of a free turn of setup if misused.

Team Options
========

Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, Slowbro, Celebi, Ferrothorn, Latios, and Latias make for great teammates to deal with offensive Water-types, particularly Azumarill and Keldeo. A solid teammate that resists Fighting to switch into Mega Lopunny and Mega Gallade is crucial; Clefable, Landorus-T, defensive Mega Altaria, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Sableye (in the case of Mega Gallade) are some examples of Pokemon that can fulfill this role. A pivot for Landorus-T and physical Ground-types in general is pretty important; some choices are Rotom-W, Slowbro, your own Landorus-T, and Gliscor. A Pokemon that deals with Mega Diancie, as it shuts down Heatran completely outside of Lava Plume burns and OHKOes with Earth Power, is also recommended; Ferrothorn, Celebi, Chansey, Mega Scizor, and Mega Venusaur make for excellent partners due to this. Finally, Heatran should not be used as a sole answer for Latios or Scizor, as both have options to bypass it. Ferrothorn, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Clefable are great partners to deal with Earthquake Latios; Clefable is particularly effective, as it deals with many of the other threats mentioned. Mega Manectric, Keldeo, and Choice Scarf Magnezone are a few examples of teammates that can deal with Superpower Mega Scizor.

Offensive Stallbreaker
########
name: Offensive Stallbreaker
move 1: Magma Storm
move 2: Earth Power
move 3: Taunt
move 4: Toxic / Solar Beam
item: Leftovers / Air Balloon / Power Herb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Heatran often lures in specially defensive walls and bulky stallbreakers, such as Chansey and Mew, and can trap them with Magma Storm; after doing so, Heatran can beat the foe with the combination of Taunt and Toxic. When playing against offensive teams, Magma Storm also deals nice chip damage to common threats to Heatran such as Keldeo and Azumarill, especially when your team has entry hazard users. Trapped foes cannot switch out, helping Heatran gain switch initiative, which really helps against offensive teams. Earth Power nails opposing non-Earth Power variants of Heatran, Tentacruel, and Mega Diancie; it is especially effective because opponents often assume that Leftovers Heatran are not running Earth Power. The move is also a solid option to hit Adamant Excadrill outside of sand without the risk of missing. Taunt is needed to stop Pokemon Heatran has trapped from recovering. It is also great against Calm Mind Clefable specifically, and while Magma Storm may not gain passive damage on this Pokemon, it does still trap it and, paired with Taunt, ensures that Heatran has a good chance beating it providing you do not allow it to get many boosts. Taunt also has the utility of preventing slower Stealth Rock setters from setting up the entry hazard and incoming Defog users from clearing the field of entry hazards. Toxic helps Heatran quickly whittle down threats such as Mew and Chansey, especially after they have been trapped by Magma Storm, as the passive damage racks up and these threats are dispatched of quickly. It also helps wear down common switch-ins such as Azumarill and Keldeo, making this annoying set even more difficult to switch into as well as being necessary to break stall, as it cripples bulky Water-types such as Slowbro. An interesting alternative is Solar Beam, which, combined with Power Herb, provides Heatran with a solid option to deal with Keldeo and Azumarill, which Heatran lures in. Moreover, it pairs well with Magma Storm's trapping capability to eliminate bulky Water-types such as Slowbro from the match. Lastly, Protect is another option that gives Heatran another turn of Leftover recovery while also stalling out potential poison and Magma Storm damage.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread lets Heatran outspeed a plethora of threats such as Adamant Excadrill and Jolly Mega Heracross, both of which are decimated by Magma Storm; it also lets Heatran outrun and 2HKO standard bulky Will-O-Wisp Mega Charizard X with Earth Power. Other uses of the spread include outrunning Mega Tyranitar, standard stallbreaker Mew, Adamant Gyarados, Dragonite, Breloom, and Bisharp, giving Heatran the ability to cripple them with a Toxic, prevent setup with Taunt, or fire off a powerful Magma Storm. Maximum Special Attack investment is given to hit as hard as possible, wearing down stall quicker and making Heatran more difficult to switch into when facing against offensive teams. Leftovers is the preferred item due to the usefulness of passive recovery and ability to bluff standard defensive Heatran variants. Air Balloon is also an option if Ground-types, particularly Sand Rush Excadrill, pose a major threat to your team. Power Herb is slashed because it is required if using Solar Beam, eliminating the charge turn of the move and thus actually allowing Heatran to be used as an effective lure.

Usage Tips
========

Playing with this set requires caution and prediction. When facing stall teams, it's usually a good idea to lead with Heatran and try to bait Pokemon such as opposing Heatran or Chansey , which can both usually be beaten, and pave the way for strong special attackers that are walled by Heatran or Chansey, such as Mega Charizard Y, Thundurus, and Volcarona, to break through the opposing team.
When playing against more offensively oriented teams, Heatran needs to be played more carefully. Try to get it in on an opposing Scizor, Latios, or Latias and start to spam Magma Storm to wear down switch-ins and get some damage on the opposing team. This is particularly potent when combined with entry hazards to rack up even more residual damage. The choice between Leftovers and Air Balloon has a significant impact on how you use Heatran. With Leftovers, Heatran can be used to bluff a defensive set and claim victims such as Chansey and Heatran. Leftovers also gives Heatran more longevity, something that it loves to have against stall teams. With Air Balloon, Heatran can force a lot of switches against offensive teams against Pokemon such as Choice-locked Landorus-T, becoming a greater issue to deal with due to its temporary Ground immunity. As Air Balloon is a common item on offensive Heatran, keep in mind that the opponent will be more likely to scout for Earth Power. If using Solar Beam, exercise care in not using it unless you are sure it will connect with its intended target, as it is practically useless without the charge turn being eliminated by Power Herb.

Team Options
========

This set has quite a lot of utility. Heatran packs great resistances and immunities and can be used on just about any team. Steel typing with a Fire immunity lets Heatran check nearly every Grass-type in the game, and it is immune to Toxic and burns, making it a great asset. This set does appreciate entry hazard support in the form of both Spikes and Stealth Rock to help wear down switch-ins which are hit by Magma Storm. Ferrothorn is a great partner, as it can set up both entry hazards and has great synergy with Heatran, dealing with threats such as Kyurem-B, Azumarill, and Mega Gyarados. In general, Heatran is susceptible to strong STAB Fighting-, Water-, and Ground-type attacks. You need to make sure you have an answer for these. Latios and Latias are both great partners for Heatran, as they handle Keldeo, Landorus, and Mega Charizard Y pretty well. It's also worth adding that, against stall, Heatran often loves Healing Wish support from Latias, as it is easily worn down, increasing Latias's utility as a teammate. Landorus-T is also a great partner for Heatran, providing an answer to Earthquake Mega Charizard X, opposing Landorus-T, and Terrakion in addition to Stealth Rock support. Clefable is also worth a mention, as it's a great switch-in to Rotom-W, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gallade, all of which cause major issues for Heatran. Finally, Mega Venusaur partners well with Heatran, as it takes care of Keldeo, Azumarill, Thundurus, and Mega Lopunny.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Fire Blast / Magma Storm
move 2: Earth Power
move 3: Flash Cannon / Hidden Power Ice / Stone Edge
move 4: Stealth Rock
item: Air Balloon
nature: Timid
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

The main factor that distinguishes this set from more defensive Heatran variants is a powerful Fire Blast, which makes Heatran quite difficult to switch into and 2HKOes Mega Sableye variants that lack a significant amount of Special Defense investment. Alternatively, Magma Storm can be used to trap and whittle down slower defensive Pokemon such as Clefable, Hippowdon, and Gliscor. The increased accuracy of Magma Storm over Fire Blast can also be crucial at times. Earth Power provides important coverage on the likes of Mega Charizard X, Tentacruel, Mega Diancie, Tyranitar, and opposing Heatran. Flash Cannon targets Fairy-types which Heatran is used to check, such as Mega Altaria, Sylveon, Togekiss, and most notable, Clefable. Hidden Power Ice is another attacking option to hit Gliscor, Garchomp, Dragonite, as well as defensive Landorus-T. Finally, Stealth Rock is a fantastic move on Heatran and one of Heatran's main uses as an offensive Pokemon because Heatran pressures common forms of entry hazard removal. Stone Edge is an option in the third slot to hit the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. If one of the coverage moves in the second or third slots is not necessary due to team support, Taunt or Toxic can be used to cripple the likes of Chansey, Mew, and Water-types in general. Note that these moves work extremely well in tandem with Magma Storm to defeat said Pokemon one-on-one after trapping them.

Set Details
========

The EVs are simple yet effective, ensuring that Heatran outspeeds Mew, defensive Landorus-T, Breloom, Bisharp, Adamant Excadrill, and Mega Scizor while giving Fire Blast as much power as possible. Air Balloon is a useful item to cover Heatran's Ground weakness and is particularly useful for teams weak to Sand Rush Excadrill. On the other hand, Leftovers grants Heatran a rather significant amount of added longevity, which can definitely prove helpful in the long-term by making Heatran more difficult to wear down with repeated attacks; however, as this Heatran is generally run on more offensive teams, the utility of Air Balloon outweighs longevity in most cases.

Usage Tips
========

This Heatran should be played aggressively, punishing switches with status and breaking down defensive cores with the combination of Fire Blast and Taunt + Toxic. Taunt is also a solid choice to prevent an opposing Pokemon from setting up if required, and Toxic should typically be used on the switch, as Heatran does not want to stay in on the Water-types it wants to to target with the move. Heatran should not be pivoted recklessly into attacks, however, as it lacks the longevity required to do so. If the opponent has a Pokemon that Heatran is required to deal with, such as Talonflame or Mega Charizard X, be sure to conserve its HP.

Team Options
========

This set is primarily useful on offensively minded teams that appreciate power as opposed to defensive consistency in Heatran. As it is rather easy to wear down due to its lessened bulk and lack of Leftovers if running Air Balloon, don't use it as the team's sole check to Pokemon such as Talonflame and Latios. Its offensive and defensive synergy is one of the primary reasons to put in on a team; its resistances and ability to take advantage of threats such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Clefable can make it a valuable contributor. Air Balloon should generally be used on teams that struggle with offensive Ground-types, particularly Sand Rush Excadrill. Partners to take on Fighting-types and Water-types that can take advantage of Heatran to some extent are crucial; some specific Pokemon that need to be covered are Mega Lopunny, Azumarill, and Keldeo. Mega Venusaur is a perfect partner for this role, handling all three effectively and synergizing well with Heatran overall as Heatran deals with Talonflame and Latios, which threaten Mega Venusaur greatly. Latios and Latias make for solid choices to check Keldeo, and Latias even provides Healing Wish support to increase Heatran's longevity if required. Both can also revenge kill Belly Drum Azumarill, which often uses Heatran as setup fodder. Mega Altaria checks both Mega Lopunny and Keldeo while having a favorable matchup against Azumarill if the Azumarill is a bit weakened and possessing the potential to set up for a sweep on these Pokemon. Mega Manectric, Thundurus, and Mega Sceptile are some other partners that can help pressure Water-types.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Overheat / Fire Blast
move 2: Flash Cannon
move 3: Earth Power / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Stone Edge / Ancient Power
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Timid
evs: 28 HP / 252 SpA / 228 Spe

Moves
========

Overheat is the preferred STAB option for its sheer nuking power; for instance, Keldeo is only able to switch in once before being 2HKOed the next time it switches in. Its overall damage output, especially against Landorus, Landorus-T, and Mega Lopunny, is rather significantly greater than any of Heatran's other STAB options. That said, Fire Blast is a decent option if the lack of Special Attack drops is valued over a bit more power and accuracy. Flash Cannon is Heatran's secondary STAB attack and is very spammable; it also provides crucial coverage on Mega Diancie, Latios, Mega Altaria, Mega Gardevoir, Clefable, Kyurem-B, Azumarill, Tyranitar, and Terrakion. Earth Power hits Mega Charizard X and opposing Heatran, which are important enough targets to make it a solid move option. Hidden Power Ice is another solid choice for the third moveslot, allowing Heatran to revenge kill +1 Adamant Dragonite if its Multiscale is broken in addition to hitting Garchomp and providing crucial OHKOs on Landorus, Landorus-T, and non-specially defensive Gliscor (it still 2HKOes specially defensive variants, which is useful). The last slot is filled with either Stone Edge or Ancient Power, which are both Rock-type attacks that are used to hit Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame. Stone Edge is typically the superior choice because it OHKOes Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, even with an Attack-reducing nature, something that Ancient Power does not do. However, Ancient Power is much more forgiving if the opponent chooses to switch out, as it hits off of Heatran's significantly higher Special Attack stat and boasts perfect accuracy as well as the necessary damage output on Mega Charizard X if Hidden Power is chosen over Earth Power. Moves such as Hidden Power Electric to prevent Gyarados from using Heatran as setup fodder and Toxic to cripple bulky Water-types can be substituted in depending on team-specific needs. Flamethrower and even Lava Plume are also options if a reliable STAB attack is desired; Lava Plume is meant to function like Keldeo's Scald, possessing the potential to cripple the likes of Azumarill and Gyarados if they switch into Heatran.

Set Details
========

The EV spread provides Heatran with enough Speed to outrun Mega Lopunny and maximizes its power so as to increase its revenge killing capabilities. The remaining EVs are placed into HP for a bit of extra bulk. Timid is pretty much the only nature option, as outspeeding Mega Lopunny is crucial; Modest shouldn't be considered for the most part.

Usage Tips
========

This set is generally meant to be played in a hit-and-run style, firing off an attack and then switching out. That doesn't necessarily mean that Heatran should always be switched out directly after attacking, as it should stay in if it has a favorable matchup, but the opponent's response to Heatran is usually something that forces it out, such as Keldeo or Azumarill. It can sometimes clean late-game with Flash Cannon, but situations that allow for this aren't that common. Although it does have some revenge killing utility, particularly for Dragon Dance Mega Altaria and&mdash;if it has Hidden Power Ice&mdash;Dragonite, the Choice Scarf is mainly used as a means to hit faster foes with Heatran's powerful attacks. In some scenarios, Heatran can be pivoted into Mega Charizard Y and Mega Gardevoir, though be wary of making this obvious, as they can predict the switch with Focus Blast; it's a decent mix-up if you've been playing around these Pokemon in different ways over the course of the match, however. This Heatran is a pretty poor direct switch-in for attackers such as Talonflame and Latios due to its low defensive investment and lack of Leftovers, so switch it into those Pokemon sparingly.

Team Options
========

This Heatran should be used on offensive and balanced teams that appreciate Heatran's defensive contributions but already have a Stealth Rock user, need a leg up on faster Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny, or require Heatran to check Mega Gardevoir and Mega Charizard Y. Azumarill and Keldeo are massive pains for Heatran, being able to switch in at least once depending on the set, making partners such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, Latios, Mega Altaria, Clefable, and Amoonguss effective teammates. Other Talonflame, Latios, and Latias checks are preferable, as this Heatran is not well-equipped to serve as a check to them due to its neutered defensive capabilities; the aforementioned Clefable and Ferrothorn can handle Latios and Latias effectively, while Rotom-W, defensive Landorus-T, Slowbro, and Hippowdon are good answers to Talonflame. In general, the defensive pivots mentioned are crucial so that your team has a safety net when Heatran is inevitably forced out by any of the ubiquitous Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attackers in the tier. Mega Charizard Y is a notable teammate that provides sun support for Heatran, increasing the damage output of Heatran's Overheat or Fire Blast to incredible levels.

Other Options
########

SubToxic is a decent set for Heatran that allows it to put enormous pressure on opposing Pokemon by getting behind a Substitute and serving as a general nuisance to the opposing team by wearing down the foe with status and damage from Heatran's Fire-type STAB move. The primary issue is that it's walled by specially defensive Gliscor, a common threat, and is pretty much forced to run Taunt unless it wants to lose to Clefable. This forces it to forgo Protect, which makes Heatran play in a rather a clunky manner by limiting its recovery and preventing it from getting useful extra turns of Toxic damage. Will-O-Wisp is a decent move choice for fast variants of Heatran, enabling it to check Bisharp effectively while also crippling Azumarill and Tyranitar. The issue with it as an option is that it gives Heatran no way of damaging Mega Charizard X or Talonflame and is less crippling to bulky Pokemon that don't mind the loss of Attack. A physically defensive EV spread is an option for the bulky set if the extra reliability against Talonflame and Mega Charizard X is appreciated. It also does some neat things such as allowing Heatran to survive a Close Combat from Mega Pinsir and an Earthquake from Latios with relative ease. However, this comes at the cost of either Speed or Special Defense, both of which are overall more useful for Heatran. Flame Charge provides somewhat of a surprise factor and lets Heatran clean up late-game. Rest fully heals up Heatran, but leaves it helpless as setup fodder for various sweepers.

Checks & Counters
########

**Water-types**: Water-types are the absolute best way of stopping Heatran, resisting its STAB moves and hitting it super effectively with their powerful attacks. Keldeo, Azumarill, Rotom-W, Manaphy, Gyarados, Starmie, and Suicune are just some examples taken from the myriad of Water-types in the OU tier that can switch into and pressure Heatran. However, most of these Pokemon are crippled by Toxic.

**Ground-types**: Specially defensive Gliscor and Lum Berry Garchomp, outside of Hidden Power Ice, are flawless answers to Heatran, not caring about status and boasting a 4x super effective STAB move. Other versions of Garchomp and Gliscor in addition to Landorus, Landorus-T, Diggersby, Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Excadrill (shaky due to its Fire weakness) are some examples of other Ground-types that, while they may not enjoy switching into Heatran due to a potential Lava Plume burn, they can put tons of pressure on it by virtue of their Ground-type STAB moves.

**Fighting-types**: Mega Lopunny, Terrakion, Keldeo, Gallade, and Hawlucha are some examples of powerful Fighting-type attackers that put immense amounts of pressure on Heatran. However, outside of Keldeo, they're not great switch-ins, as they fear a Lava Plume burn and are forced out by Choice Scarf variants.

**Knock Off**: Defensive Heatran absolutely despises Knock Off because Leftovers is its only form of recovery and is crucial to its survival. Mega Sableye, Mega Venusaur, and Ferrothorn are particularly effective users of the move because Heatran normally can switch into them for free and do as it pleases.

**Residual Damage**: As Heatran lacks recovery outside of Leftovers, smart play can allow it to be worn down via residual damage. Entry hazards and Leech Seed can potentially even limit Heatran's opportunities to switch in, as damage from them will rack up quickly so long as Heatran doesn't get too many Leftovers recovery turns.

**Special Sponges and Pokemon that Resist Fire**: Chansey, Blissey, Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Goodra can all tank Heatran's attacks easily by virtue of their bulk or resistances while being able to pressure it effectively. Chansey does not fare well against sets with Taunt, though, as it will be worn down quickly between Stealth Rock and potential Toxic damage without the ability to recover its health, so it has to be mindful of how frequently it switches in and how much health it is losing.

**Lures**: Due to Heatran's exploitable Water, Fighting, and Ground weaknesses, some Pokemon that lure in Heatran can opt to run moves in order to potentially KO or weaken it. Earthquake Latios, Surf Latias, fast Superpower Mega Scizor (only a threat to slower Heatran variants), Earthquake Mega Charizard X, Focus Blast Clefable, opposing Heatran with Earth Power, Hidden Power Ground Volcarona, Taunt Talonflame, and Knock Off Mega Venusaur are some examples of options that can be employed to prevent Heatran from handling these Pokemon effectively and even get it out of the way for a partner that struggles with it.

**Dugtrio**: Although it's not a good option for the majority of teams, Dugtrio is the single best way to ensure Heatran is taken out of the picture for Pokemon that struggle in its presence, such as Talonflame, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard X. It shouldn't be switched into Heatran directly, though, as Lava Plume will bring it down to its Focus Sash and has a sizable chance to burn, meaning that Dugtrio would accomplish nothing if Lava Plume happens to burn. However, if it can be brought in safely through a well-timed double switch, the use of Volt Switch or U-turn, or a sacrifice it can assuredly remove Heatran from the match.
