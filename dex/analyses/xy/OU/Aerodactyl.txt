Overview
########
Mega Aerodactyl has a great Speed tier that allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, and some of the boosted metagame. It is often seen on teams as an offensive check to Diggersby, Mega Lopunny, Mega Beedrill, and Flying-types such as Talonflame and Mega Pinsir. Mega Aerodactyl has a very wide movepool consisting of moves such as Roost, Fire Fang, Ice Fang, Aqua Tail, and Earthquake. Its ability, Tough Claws, boosts the power of contact moves by 1.33x, allowing Mega Aerodactyl to use moves like Fire Fang and Aerial Ace. Aerodactyl also has decent bulk for an offensive Pokemon; however, it is held back by its weakness to Stealth Rock and common priority moves such as Bullet Punch and Aqua Jet.

OU All-Out Attacker
########
name: OU All-Out Attacker
move 1: Stone Edge
move 2: Aerial Ace
move 3: Fire Fang / Earthquake
move 4: Aqua Tail / Ice Fang
ability: Pressure
item: Aerodactylite
evs: 248 Atk / 44 Def / 216 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========
Stone Edge picks off Pokemon such as Talonflame and Mega Pinsir, while Aerial Ace cleans up weakened teams. Fire Fang nails common Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Skarmory. Earthquake can OHKO Magnezone and Heatran, and reliably 2HKO Mega Manectric and Empoleon while also hitting Steel-types such as Bisharp harder than Fire Fang. Aqua Tail hits most Ground- and Rock-type Pokemon and does more damage than Earthquake to Tyranitar thanks to the Tough Claws boost. Ice Fang nails Landorus-T and Gliscor. Keep in mind that Fire Fang should be used with Aqua Tail, and Earthquake should be used with Ice Fang. Roost keeps Mega Aerodactyl constantly healthy.

Set Details
========
216 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature let Mega Aerodactyl outspeed everything up to Mega Sceptile with a positive nature, while 44 Defense EVs allow it to avoid being 2HKOed by Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Attack so that it can hit harder. Aerodactylite gives Mega Aerodactyl much more Speed, bulk, and power.

Usage Tips
========
Mega Aerodactyl can be used to clean up weakened Pokemon. When using it early-game, try to soften up bulkier Pokemon for a teammate to sweep later. Thanks to Mega Aerodactyl's great Speed, it can be used to revenge kill slower Pokemon such as Mega Gallade.

Team Options
========
A way of getting rid of entry hazards is mandatory due to Mega Aerodactyl's crippling weakness to Stealth Rock; for this reason, Defoggers such as Latios and Latias make for great partners. Pokemon that can set up entry hazards such as Ferrothorn, Hippowdon, and Heatran are also good partners. Ferrothorn has great defensive synergy with Aerodactyl, while Hippowdon can set up a sandstorm to boost Aerodactyl's Special Defense. Heatran and Rotom-W can help Aerodactyl take on Flying-types better, as without recovery, it cannot singlehandedly take on both Talonflame and Mega Pinsir. Teammates that like Flying-types gone such as Breloom are also good partners, as Aerodactyl can handle most offensive Flying-types. Keldeo and both Thundurus formes are good teammates, because Keldeo can reliably get rid of Landorus-T and Gliscor, while both Thundurus formes can take on the bulky Water-types that trouble Aerodactyl. Dragalge is a strong wallbreaker with its Choice Specs set, weakening bulkier walls for Aerodactyl to sweep later. It can also utilize Toxic Spikes set to wear down bulkier walls that despise being poisoned. Because Mega Aerodactyl despises status, Pokemon such as Magic Guard Clefable or Reflect Type Starmie are good partners, as they can easily absorb status for it. Celebi can also absorb status, while its Swords Dance Baton Pass set can amplify Mega Aerodactyl's offensive presence. Celebi also counters Rotom-W, which Mega Aerodactyl has difficulty with.

Other Options
########
Hone Claws can boost Mega Aerodactyl's Attack, allowing it to hit harder, but Mega Aerodactyl is frail and has a hard time setting up. Stealth Rock is another option, but it is better to leave this to another teammate, because Mega Aerodactyl needs to run as many moves as it can. A stallbreaker set with Taunt and Roost is not as effective due to Mega Sableye outclassing it, though it is still an option. Defog can be used if your team lacks an entry hazard remover, but using your Mega Evolution as a Defogger is not recommended. Mega Aerodactyl also has a weakness to Stealth Rock, making it an unreliable Defogger. Iron Head 2HKOes Mega Altaria and Clefable after Stealth Rock damage while also OHKOing Mega Diancie even after a Defense boost from Diamond Storm. Pursuit can trap Gengar and Starmie, removing them from the picture before they can switch out to a check or counter.

Checks & Counters
########
**Physical walls** : Skarmory and Hippowdon can easily defeat Mega Aerodactyl due to their great physical bulk. Skarmory can use it as entry hazard bait and can discourage it from retaliating offensively with Counter. Hippowdon can easily stall Mega Aerodactyl out with Toxic or do heavy damage with Stone Edge, but it fears Aqua Tail.
**Priority users**: Azumarill, Mamoswine, and Scizor can all KO Aerodactyl with their respective priority moves; however, Scizor has trouble switching in on Fire Fang.
**Bulky Water-types**: Mega Slowbro, Quagsire, Alomomola, Suicune, Mega Gyarados, Mega Swampert, Rotom-W, and Empoleon can easily switch in on any attack and proceed to force Mega Aerodactyl out with their respective Water-type STAB moves.
**Choice Scarf users**: Choice Scarf Landorus-T can easily switch in on any move, barring Aqua Tail or Ice Fang, and OHKO with Stone Edge. Garchomp deals heavy damage with Outrage, while Keldeo's Scald can easily KO Mega Aerodactyl. Choice Scarf Latios's Draco Meteor has a good chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock damage, basically forcing Mega Aerodactyl out.
**Steel-types**: Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, Klefki, and Magnezone can easily switch in on anything except Earthquake or Fire Fang. Meteor Mash and priority Bullet Punch both hurt a lot, while Klefki can use priority Thunder Wave to neuter Mega Aerodactyl. Magnezone easily OHKOes with Thunderbolt.
**Fast Electric-types**: Mega Manectric and Raikou can both revenge kill Mega Aerodactyl, as they can OHKO with Thunderbolt or confer their team some momentum with Volt Switch. Mega Manectric's Intimidate also makes Mega Aerodactyl's damage output lower.
**Status**: Mega Aerodactyl is completely neutered by burns and paralysis, making Pokemon with Prankster such as Sableye and Klefki great checks.
