Overview
########

When wielding its Mega Stone, Aerodactyl can Mega Evolve into a powerful Pokemon with a blazing fast Speed stat of 150 and a high Attack stat of 135. Mega Aerodactyl's typing enables it to check Talonflame because Aerodactyl resists Talonflame's main STAB attacks and can easily OHKO in return with its own STAB moves. This is quite important for hyper offense teams, which often lack a solid way to stop Talonflame. Birdspam, in general, is also taken care of quite nicely, as Aerodactyl easily defeats Staraptor and Mega Pinsir. Mega Aerodactyl has surprisingly good 80 / 85 / 95 defenses, which allows it to sponge some neutral hits, and, with its unique resistances, it has nice longevity. Its ability boosts its coverage moves to even more powerful levels and acts as a recoil-less Life Orb. Its movepool is also quite large and enables it to utilize many options. Additionally, the combination of Taunt and Roost allows it to stay healthy throughout the match. However, Mega Aerodactyl's weakness to the ever-present Stealth Rock is a real damper, as it instantly strips away 25% of Aerodactyl's health just for switching in. Its typing comes with unfortunate weaknesses to common Water-, Rock-, and Ice-type moves as well. Common priority moves of these types such as Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch and Azumarill's Aqua Jet are also a massive thorn in Aerodactyl's side. Finally, its Speed isn't stellar when running Adamant before it Mega Evolves, leaving it outsped by quite a few Pokemon.

Stallbreaker
########
name: Stallbreaker
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Aerial Ace
move 3: Aqua Tail
move 4: Roost
ability: Pressure
item: Aerodactylite
evs: 244 Atk / 44 Def / 220 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Taunt is the main focus of this set and allows Aerodactyl to shut down many defensive threats, such as Chansey, that rely on status moves; it also prevents these threats from recovering health. Taunt also allows Mega Aerodactyl to beat threats it normally can't, such as Skarmory, Mew, and Hippowdon lacking Stone Edge. Aerial Ace hits Mega Medicham, Mega Heracross, and Keldeo super effectively. Running Aerial Ace ensures that Mega Aerodactyl can beat Grass-types that would otherwise wall it, such as Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Breloom, and allows it to revenge kill Keldeo as well as have a 100% accurate move to hit Mega Pinsir with. Aqua Tail gets great coverage and hits Ground-types such as Landorus and Hippowdon, while it also hits some other Pokemon such as Terrakion and Heatran for super effective damage. Aqua Tail and Taunt allow Mega Aerodactyl to beat Skarmory, which it cannot do otherwise. Roost is Mega Aerodactyl's form of recovery, mitigating hazard damage and allowing it to stay healthy throughout the match. This set could also run a coverage move to handle a specific threat to your team; however, it usually covers most of the metagame as it is. Rock Slide is a notable option over Aqua Tail because of its ability to OHKO Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Staraptor, Mega Charizard Y, and Thundurus, which Aerodactyl cannot otherwise do.

Set Details
========

44 Defense EVs are very important because they enable Mega Aerodactyl to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird all the time. 244 Attack EVs allow Mega Aerodactyl to OHKO Keldeo with Aerial Ace and Terrakion with Aqua Tail, while the Speed investment outspeeds Pokemon with base 110 Speed before Mega Evolving, and anything up to Greninja after Mega Evolving. This spread also gives defensive teams some offensive pressure, because Mega Aerodactyl can outspeed and revenge kill many Pokemon thanks to its high Speed. For more defensive teams, an EV spread of 248 HP / 204 Def / 56 Spe with a Jolly Nature can be run, providing more physical bulk to handle the likes of Talonflame and Mega Pinsir reliably while outspeeding up to Mega Pinsir. Aerodactylite is chosen over another item such as Leftovers to enable Aerodactyl to Mega Evolve and gain bulk, power, and Speed. In the long run, Aerodactylite provides many more benefits than Leftovers does, and Roost keeps it healthy as it is.

Usage Tips
========

Should the opponent carry a Talonflame, it's best to preserve Mega Aerodactyl to wall it. This is also a great idea against Birdspam teams in general. Keep in mind that this set is meant to break stall and thus is most effective against stall teams. When facing Stall teams, Taunt is key. Taunt prevents hazards from being set, status from being spread, and recovery moves being used. Taunt is great against entry hazard leads as well, meaning that leading with Mega Aerodactyl isn't a bad idea either, as it can Mega Evolve early on in the game while keeping hazards off the field. Taunt also prevents Mega Aerodactyl from being inflicted with status. Roost should be used when Mega Aerodactyl's health is low, but it should not be used recklessly, as it has limited PP. Keep in mind that Roost removes Mega Aerodactyl's type temporarily, meaning it can be hit with Earthquake on the turn it used Roost.

Team Options
========

Cleric support from Sylveon or Clefable is always helpful to remove status ailments and keep Mega Aerodactyl alive and healthy. These Pokemon also have good synergy with Mega Aerodactyl, which is an important factor to consider when choosing any teammate. Toxic support is great because Taunt means that any poisoned Pokemon cannot recover its health, effectively crippling it. Hazard removal is beneficial because Mega Aerodactyl is weak to Stealth Rock, thus making Rapid Spin support from Excadrill or Defog support from Latios a good idea. Quagsire has nice synergy with Mega Aerodactyl and can wall powerful threats such as Garchomp that Mega Aerodactyl struggles against. Partners such as Kyurem-B or Landorus that can break through Mega Venusaur are much appreciated.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Stone Edge
move 2: Earthquake / Fire Fang
move 3: Ice Fang
move 4: Aerial Ace
ability: Pressure
item: Aerodactylite
evs: 212 Atk / 44 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Stone Edge is a powerful STAB move, and, although it's not boosted by Tough Claws, it hits quite hard. Earthquake completes the infamous EdgeQuake combo and gets nearly flawless coverage. Fire Fang is also very helpful because it's boosted by Tough Claws and hits Steel-types, while also hitting Skarmory. Ice Fang is further boosted by Tough Claws and is important to hit Landorus and Garchomp, while also hitting Hippowdon for decent damage. Aerial Ace is another STAB move boosted by Tough Claws; it also hits Mega Venusaur and gets decent coverage all around. Aqua Tail isn't listed but is certainly a viable option to hit Hippowdon harder than Ice Fang; however, Ice Fang gets much better coverage all-around and specifically hits Garchomp very hard. Hone Claws is Mega Aerodactyl's only way to boost Attack, but the result is somewhat subpar compared to what other setup sweepers such as Azumarill can do. Stealth Rock is another option because it provides support for its team and wears down potential switch-ins, although this is better left to a teammate.

Set Details
========

The EV spread maximizes Mega Aerodactyl's power and Speed while avoiding the 2HKO from Talonflame's Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird. The Speed EVs can be readjusted to outspeed certain Pokemon as well; for example, with 176 Speed EVs, Mega Aerodactyl can outspeed max Speed Greninja after Mega Evolving and invest more in bulk. Adamant nature increases Mega Aerodactyl's damage output, while Jolly doesn't allow Mega Aerodactyl to outspeed anything notable. Aerodactylite is used over a Life Orb or a Choice Band to allow Aerodactyl to Mega Evolve and gain Tough Claws, Speed, bulk, and a lot more benefits than other items provide.

Usage Tips
========

It is best to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, to gain bulk and Speed. This is important because it can be outsped by quite a bit before Mega Evolution, so be cautious! Using coverage moves when they are super effective is a given, and this set has plenty of coverage moves to hit the vast majority of OU with. This set plays fairly simply, and there's not much to explain: attack when appropriate is the main objective of this set. Prediction is also a key factor for this set, as if a Pokemon can correctly predict what move Mega Aerodactyl will use, the opponent can gain a free switch-in to a potential check or counter. Mega Aerodactyl can be used either early-game or late-game. When used early-game, it should focus on wearing down offensive teams so a teammate can sweep a bit later in the match, while it can clean up late-game if its partners have worn down bulkier Pokemon. Also, do note that thanks to Mega Aerodactyl's naturally high Speed, it can revenge kill some slower Scarfers.

Team Options
========

As mentioned previously, Rapid Spin or Defog support is needed, making Latios and Excadrill good partners. Keldeo offers nice synergy and can break through Hippowdon with ease. Landorus is another wallbreaker that greatly helps by breaking down bulkier teams. Klefki is an interesting partner that gets great synergy with Aerodactyl, can set Spikes to wear down switch-ins, and paralyzes Choice Scarf users threatening to revenge kill Mega Aerodactyl. Hazard support, in general, is very useful to wear down bulkier Pokemon and other switch-ins, making Tyranitar and Ferrothorn good partners as well. Hippowdon offers good synergy and provides sand, which wears down the opponent slowly and boosts Mega Aerodactyl's Special Defense.

Other Options
########

Crunch is the first option because it provides nice coverage all-around and is also boosted by Tough Claws. Rock Slide is usable over Stone Edge for accuracy, but Stone Edge's power is greatly missed. Tailwind is a useful option as a last-ditch effort to allow a weakened sweeper to come in after Mega Aerodactyl has fainted and try to sweep once again. Iron Head is boosted by Tough Claws and hits Fairy-types hard, but has little use aside from this. A lead with Focus Sash and Stealth Rock could be used thanks to Aerodactyl's naturally high Speed. Thunder Fang hits Slowbro and other Water-types, while also being boosted by Tough Claws, but it has little use otherwise. Roar can be used to phaze, but Mega Aerodactyl is not bulky enough to pull it off and is much too fast as well. Fire Blast hits Skarmory and Ferrothorn very hard, but Fire Fang is often a much better choice. Finally, Rock Polish could be used if you really wanted to be super fast, but it's often a wasted moveslot.

Checks & Counters
########

**Common Weaknesses**: Mega Aerodactyl is weak to common Electric-, Ice-, Rock-, Steel-, and Water-type attacking moves, and it doesn't have the bulk to stomach these hits very well.

**Defensive Walls**: Bulkier Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Slowbro can survive even super effective attacks and can regain health, while slowly wearing down Aerodactyl.

**Bulky Attackers**: Bulkier Pokemon that also have offensive presence such as Landorus-T and Rhyperior are good checks that can immediately threaten Mega Aerodactyl.

**Priority**: Mega Aerodactyl is weak to Aqua Jet and Bullet Punch, both of which circumvent Mega Aerodactyl's naturally high Speed and hit it hard.
