Overview
########

Gorebyss is most widely known for its ability to use the Shell Smash + Baton Pass combination. On top of that, it has powerful STAB moves, most notably Hydro Pump and Surf.However, Gorebyss isn't entirely threatening on its own when facing most of the tier, which is why SmashPassing is the most effective strategy for Gorebyss to use. Even then, it's only capable of using SmashPass effectively once per game, as its White Herb is consumed after one use. It also has low Special Defense, which makes it hard to set up on special attackers. Despite this, the ability to pass boosts and make top threats such as Landorus and Keldeo almost impossible to deal with gives it a decent niche in the OU tier.

SmashPass
########
name: SmashPass
move 1: Shell Smash
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Surf / Hydro Pump
move 4: Substitute / Ice Beam
ability: Swift Swim / Hydration
item: White Herb
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Shell Smash drastically increases Gorebyss's Attack, Special Attack, and Speed at the expense of its Defense and Special Defense. These are the boosts that are passed to another Pokemon, as Baton Pass transfers Gorebyss's stat changes to an ally and switches them in. Surf is a powerful STAB move that allows Gorebyss to benefit from Shell Smash itself. Hydro Pump is a more powerful STAB move that can be used in place of Surf, though it has worse accuracy. Substitute allows Gorebyss to avoid status, and it can even possibly pass a Substitute to another Pokemon. Ice Beam can be used to deal with Grass- and Flying-type Pokemon.

Set Details
========

White Herb removes the Defense and Special Defense drop caused by Shell Smash. Maximizing HP increases survivability, while maximizing Speed lets Gorebyss outspeed most of the tier after a Shell Smash, most notably Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Mega Manectric. A Calm nature is used to increase Gorebyss's Special Defense, as it has trouble surviving special attacks. Swift Swim allows Gorebyss to outspeed most Choice Scarf users at +2 if it's raining. Hydration allows Gorebyss to recover from status, again, in the event that it's raining. Generally, Swift Swim is the preferable option, as being able to beat some rain teams is really helpful, although it is somewhat niche.

Usage Tips
========

Use Shell Smash to increase Gorebyss's offensive ability, then use Baton Pass. This will transfer those incredible boosts to another Pokemon, preferably to a sweeper of some sort. Substitute should be used if you suspect that the opponent is going to use a status move. A Thunder Wave, Spore, or Dark Void can turn a good situation into a dangerous situation quickly, but having your opponent waste a turn destroying Gorebyss's Substitute can turn the situation back in your favor. Don't set up if it gives the opponent a chance to set up as well unless you know that Gorebyss can defeat the opposing Pokemon by itself. It can be very difficult to pull off a second SmashPass later in the game, as White Herb will have been consumed and Gorebyss will likely be at lower health. Gorebyss alone as a sweeper is too slow, weak, and outclassed. However, if the need arises, Gorebyss can be used late-game to clean up or rack up a few more KOs. White Herb will be consumed if any of Gorebyss's stats are lowered, so avoid things like Sticky Web and Defog in order to keep its White Herb intact.

Team Options
========

As Gorebyss is completely devoted to supporting its team through SmashPassing, the Pokemon that are on its team are almost as important, if not more important than itself. Pokemon such as Dragonite and Kyurem-B that are too slow or too weak to outright sweep that could use a little boost really benefit from Shell Smash being passed to them. Espeon is especially notable, as it can receive a SmashPass from Gorebyss and not be Roared out or crippled with status thanks to Magic Bounce. Specifically, Pokemon that can absorb Electric- and Grass-type attacks on the switch that would benefit from the boosts are good partners for Gorebyss. Charizard takes Grass-type attacks really well, and its sweeping potential is exponentially bolstered by a Shell Smash boost. Landorus and Garchomp are immune to Electric-type attacks and both of them do very well with a Shell Smash boost. Unaware users, specifically Quagsire and Clefable, make the entire Shell Smash + Baton Pass combination useless. A Grass-type attack from a Pokemon like Venusaur can deal with Quagsire, while a Steel-type attack from a Pokemon such as Bisharp makes short work of Clefable. Incidentally, all of these Pokemon greatly benefit from a SmashPass. The final notable bit is dual screens support from the likes of Azelf, which makes it much easier for Gorebyss to pull off a pass.

Other Options
########

The only really other viable option is using Gorebyss itself as a Shell Smash sweeper. This is dangerous, however, as Gorebyss isn't strong enough to handle several of the threats in OU.

Checks & Counters
########

**Taunt**: Taunt can keep Gorebyss from using at least two of its moves and keep it from performing its main function. Sableye, as well as some other Prankster Taunt users, ultimately stop Gorebyss from being of use to its team. Prankster Taunt users can even taunt Gorebyss at +2, preventing it from using Baton Pass.

**Phazing and Stat Resets**: Roar, Whirlwind, and Dragon Tail force a switch to another Pokemon, removing any boosts Gorebyss might have acquired. Haze and Clear Smog resets Gorebyss's stats without forcing it out. All of these moves ultimately stop Gorebyss from Baton Passing stat boosts to other Pokemon.

**Passable Status**: Baton Pass passes off stat changes, but it also sends off volatile statuses, like Leech Seed and Confusion. This can inhibit not only Gorebyss, but whatever Pokemon it passes off to.

**Choice Scarf users**: Choice Scarf Garchomp, Landorus-T, Kyurem-B, and Excadrill can all outspeed Gorebyss after a boost and hit it extremely hard.

**Grass-types**: Grass-type moves, particularly specially based Grass-type moves, can seriously damage Gorebyss. Some bulky Grass-types, such as Thick Fat Venusaur, can even soak up Ice Beam without much of a problem.

**Electric-types**: Bulky Electric-types, such as Rotom-W, don't take much damage from either of Gorebyss's attacks and can potentially take out Gorebyss before it passes its boosts. Prankster Thunder Wave from Thundurus can cripple Gorebyss and potentially the Pokemon it is passing to.

**Unaware**: Unaware Quagsire and Clefable are a problem, as they completely ignore any boosts that Gorebyss itself has or has Baton Passed to another Pokemon.a
