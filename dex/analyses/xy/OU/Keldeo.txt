Overview
########

Keldeo is one of the biggest threats in the OU tier. Thanks to its solid Speed, good wallbreaking capabilities, and notorious ability to wear down its checks with Scald burns, it excels offensively. It is also good defensively, thanks to its solid bulk and great defensive typing that enables it to check many powerful threats such as Bisharp, Mega Gyarados, and Heatran, which makes it very easy to fit on teams. Unfortunately, its lack of coverage moves and its commonly resisted STAB coverage give it a rather large pool of checks. And while its Speed is good, it is still outsped by a good number of Pokemon such as Latios, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Metagross. Even so, Keldeo's attributes enable it to often outlast its checks, and it is a threat every team needs to prepare for.

Substitute + Calm Mind
########
name: Substitute + Calm Mind
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Calm Mind
move 3: Scald
move 4: Secret Sword
ability: Justified
item: Leftovers
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Substitute enables Keldeo to protect itself from status and take advantage of defensive Pokemon that cannot deal enough damage to it to break the Substitute, such as Heatran, Alomomola and non-Psyshock Slowbro. It also eases prediction against offensive teams and stops Bisharp from beating Keldeo if it has been brought into Sucker Punch's KO range. Calm Mind has excellent synergy with Substitute, increasing not only Keldeo's power but also its bulk, which helps it set up even further against defensive Pokemon and stops it from being revenge killed as easily by special attackers. Scald is an accurate, drawback-free, reliable STAB move with a great secondary effect that enables Keldeo to wear down checks such as Latias, Slowbro, and Mega Venusaur. Secret Sword is Keldeo's most accurate special Fighting STAB move and enables it to hit special walls such as Chansey.

Set Details
========

Leftovers gives Keldeo some more longevity and enables it to set up more than just four Substitutes in one game. However, Salac Berry may be used in order to give Keldeo a better chance at sweeping offensive teams, while also enabling it to bluff a Choice item, which can help it set up Substitutes. Though it may seem odd to maximize offenses on a bulky setup sweeper, Keldeo needs an offensive spread so as to not be too heavily reliant on Calm Mind and still be able to check slower attackers as well as Speed tie with opposing Keldeo and Terrakion.

Usage Tips
========

This set acts as a good win condition against balanced and stall teams. Try to set up on Pokemon that are typically used as answers to Keldeo, such as Alomomola and Tentacruel as well as Slowbro and Starmie lacking Psyshock. Don't attempt to sweep with Calm Mind until Keldeo's counters are gone. Substitute is good to use against status users or Pokemon Keldeo can force out, but use it sparingly, as otherwise Keldeo may get too low on health to be able to switch into certain threats later. Do not use Substitute if the opponent has Pixilate Hyper Voice users such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Altaria, as they can hit through said Substitute.

Team Options
========

This set really benefits from a way to remove Latios and Latias, be it through Pursuit support, a lure, or wearing them down with powerful attacks. It also requires a switch-in to them, as it is especially vulnerable to them. You also want to remove Keldeo's other checks, namely Mega Venusaur, which can easily win one-on-one even after one Calm Mind boost; Celebi, which can use Perish Song to force Keldeo out; and any of Keldeo's offensive checks, such as Talonflame and Thundurus. Mega Metagross is an excellent partner for Keldeo because it can check Mega Venusaur, Mega Gardevoir, and Grass-, Fairy-, and Psychic-types in general, while even being able to Pursuit trap Latios and Latias and lure Mega Slowbro. In return, Keldeo deals with Pokemon such as Bisharp, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon, which threaten Mega Metagross.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Scald
move 2: Secret Sword
move 3: Hydro Pump
move 4: Icy Wind / Hidden Power Bug / Hidden Power Electric / Taunt
ability: Justified
item: Choice Specs / Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Scald is Keldeo's main STAB move. It is very spammable, has high PP, hits quite hard after the Choice Specs boost, and wears down usual switch-ins such as Latios, Mega Venusaur, and Slowbro. Secret Sword is Keldeo's best Fighting STAB move and lets it break through Chansey very easily and reliably. Hydro Pump is very powerful and is needed to break past bulky Pokemon such as Clefable, Jirachi, and Mew. Icy Wind hits Latios, Latias, and Dragonite, 2HKOing them after the Speed drop, and deals a good amount of damage to Amoonguss and Celebi. Hidden Power Bug can be used to cleanly OHKO Celebi while also hitting Latios, Latias, Slowbro, and Starmie. Hidden Power Electric is Keldeo's best option against bulky Water-types such as Gyarados, Slowbro, Suicune, Starmie, and Alomomola. Hidden Power Flying enables Keldeo to hit Mega Venusaur while also hitting most Grass-types. Hidden Power Grass is an option for hitting Gastrodon as well as most Hidden Power Electric targets, but it is generally inferior to it because Gyarados is more common than Gastrodon. If a Life Orb is used, Taunt helps Keldeo break down defensive Pokemon by denying their recovery and stops Pokemon like Alomomola, Slowbro, and Gastrodon from statusing it.

Set Details
========

Choice Specs gives Keldeo a huge amount of firepower and turns it into a great wallbreaker. A Life Orb can be used if you don't want to lock Keldeo into one move; however, Keldeo benefits from the extra power of Choice Specs and dislikes getting worn down by Life Orb recoil. Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment enables Keldeo to be as fast and powerful as possible. A Timid nature is important to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon as well as Garchomp, and to Speed tie with Terrakion and opposing Keldeo.

Usage Tips
========

Scald should be used a lot early-game in order to wear down switch-ins such as Latios and Mega Venusaur with a potential burn, and it is the main move Keldeo will be using against offensive teams. Hydro Pump is often needed in order to to break past certain Pokemon and is therefore useful against defensive teams. However, if the opponent has a Pokemon that can take two Hydro Pumps and recover off the damage, such as Mega Venusaur, Scald is the better move because the burn chance will potentially cripple the switch-in, which will pay off more in the long run. If everything on the opposing team has been weakened to the point where Hydro Pump 2HKOes, it should be used. Try not to get Keldeo statused, as it relies on repeated opportunities to fire off its powerful STAB moves and can get stalled out more easily if it is poisoned or burned.

Team Options
========

Because Keldeo is checked by bulky Water-types such as Azumarill, Slowbro, and Alomomola, a Grass-type such as Celebi, Breloom, or Ferrothorn can make for a good partner. A Fire-type can help deal with Grass-types such as Celebi, Amoonguss, and to a lesser extent Mega Venusaur. Heatran specifically pairs very well with Keldeo because it can also deal with Latios and Latias and switch into Talonflame. Latios and Latias are solid partners for Keldeo given their ability to deal with most of Keldeo's Water- and Grass-type checks. Keldeo likes support from something that can weaken its checks, particularly Latios, so that it can attack more freely; as such, Pokemon with similar checks, such as Mega Charizard Y and Life Orb Terrakion make for decent partners. However, make sure that you also pack something that can easily switch into the Keldeo check you're trying to wear down. A teammate that can switch into fast Electric-types, such as Latias, Hippowdon, or Raikou, is appreciated because they easily outspeed and OHKO Keldeo. Pursuit support from Tyranitar, Bisharp, or Weavile can help trap Psychic-types that wall Keldeo, such as Latios, Latias, Slowbro, Cresselia, and Celebi, though the latter can evade Pursuit trapping via Baton Pass.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Scald
move 2: Secret Sword
move 3: Hydro Pump
move 4: Icy Wind / Hidden Power Electric
ability: Justified
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Scald is Keldeo's safest STAB move and the main move it will be using to revenge kill weakened threats and clean up weakened teams. The burn chance can cripple some switch-ins such as Azumarill and Chesnaught and wear down others such as Latios and Mega Venusaur. Secret Sword is by far Keldeo's best Fighting STAB move because its ability to deal physical rather than special damage enables Keldeo to get past special walls such as Chansey. Hydro Pump is Keldeo's most powerful move and allows it to revenge kill healthy Pokemon that can survive a Scald. Icy Wind enables Keldeo to hit Latios and Latias, and the Speed drop enables Keldeo to somewhat neuter them or outspeed them next turn if they are holding a Choice Scarf themselves. It also hits Dragonite quite hard. Hidden Power Ice may be used for the extra damage, but the 5 Base Power increase is insignificant compared to the Speed drop in most cases. However, it has a higher chance of OHKOing Naive Garchomp and guarantees the OHKO after Stealth Rock, so it may be used for that reason. Hidden Power Electric lets Keldeo reliably revenge kill non-Mega Gyarados and also gives it an option with which to hit Starmie and other bulky Water-types such as Slowbro. Hidden Power Bug 2HKOes Celebi, which no other move can do, while also hitting Latios, Latias, and Starmie for decent damage. Hidden Power Flying is an option for hitting Mega Venusaur as well as other Grass-types such as Celebi and Chesnaught; however, Venusaur isn't particularly common and isn't hit hard without a boosting item.

Set Details
========

A Choice Scarf enables Keldeo to outspeed most of the metagame, notably outspeeding Mega Lopunny, Mega Metagross, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Latios. Maximizing Special Attack and Speed improves Keldeo's revenge killing capabilities. Justified is Keldeo's only ability. A Timid nature enables Keldeo to outspeed opposing Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp and Victini, Kabutops in rain, and Adamant Dragonite at +2, as well as Speed tie with opposing Choice Scarf Keldeo and Terrakion. Additionally, it enables Keldeo to still outspeed a large portion of the metagame if it gets its Choice Scarf removed by Knock Off. A Modest nature still lets Keldeo outspeed most of the metagame and may be preferred to increase Keldeo's damage output. However, it fails to outspeed certain key threats, most notably Jolly Mega Charizard X after one Dragon Dance.

Usage Tips
========

This set should be saved for the mid- or late-game to check a certain threat to your team. However, it can make for a decent lead for its ability to anti-lead Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Mamoswine, and Terrakion. Although it is a good switch-in to the likes of Heatran and Bisharp, be cautious when switching Keldeo in on these Pokemon because you may need to keep it unscathed to better take on certain threats such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar. In these cases, try not to get it worn down by status and other residual damage and attempt to prevent its Choice Scarf from being Knocked Off. Use Hydro Pump only if you need the extra power to revenge kill something, because Scald is more reliable.

Team Options
========

This set mostly fits on balanced and offensive teams as a check to the likes of Landorus-T, Bisharp, (comma) and Mega Gyarados, which can be threatening to these types of teams, and as a revenge killer in general. It should be paired up with a good answer to Latios and Latias, such as Heatran or Clefable. Most bulky Steel-types make for good partners because they handle Fairy- and Dragon-types that threaten Keldeo; Ferrothorn is especially notable for its ability to deal with Azumarill and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria. Choice Scarf Tyranitar is an excellent partner for its ability to Pursuit trap Latios and Latias, while Keldeo in return can revenge kill Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Tyranitar, which easily use Choice Scarf Tyranitar locked into Pursuit as setup fodder. Grass-types make good partners for Keldeo because they deal with Water-types Keldeo can't break past, such as Azumarill and Slowbro. Celebi in particular is a great partner because the only Water-types it loses to are Mega Gyarados, Mega Sharpedo, and Crawdaunt, which are very easily checked by Keldeo, and because it can pass a Nasty Plot boost to it.

Other Options
########

Expert Belt enables Keldeo to bluff a Choice item. However, Life Orb or Salac Berry is generally better because Keldeo's lack of coverage means it cannot hit many Pokemon super effectively. An offensive Calm Mind set with three attacks and a Life Orb can turn Keldeo into a powerful setup sweeper; however, the Substitute + Calm Mind set is generally better due to the added bulk provided by Leftovers and Substitute's ability to dodge status. Endeavor combined with Substitute or a Focus Sash can enable Keldeo to severely weaken a threat, but it is quite gimmicky and unreliable. Focus Blast is an option for hitting certain physical walls that resist or are immune to Water such as physically defensive Gastrodon, Tangrowth, and Suicune; however, its bad accuracy and inability to hit Chansey for serious damage make it a far weaker option than Secret Sword.

Checks & Counters
########

**Psychic-types**: Psychic-types that resist Water or have enough special bulk to take on Keldeo can handle it without too much difficulty. Latios and Latias are both very common checks that can take any move bar Choice Specs Icy Wind and OHKO back with Psyshock. Slowbro and Mega Slowbro can take a Hydro Pump and strike Keldeo with Psyshock; even without Psyshock, they can handle Choice sets by recovering repeatedly, although they lose to any set that runs Substitute, Calm Mind, or Taunt. They are also unable to switch into Choice Specs Hidden Power Electric or Bug unless they are running full Special Defense investment. Slowking is a hard counter to Keldeo, not even fearing super effective Hidden Powers thanks to its special bulk. Starmie is a very good Keldeo counter,by virtue of outspeeding it and not fearing Scald burns thanks to Natural Cure. However, much like Slowbro, it needs Psyshock to handle Substitute + Calm Mind sets and fears Hidden Power Electric and Bug. It also cannot switch in repeatedly if it is running an offensive set. Cresselia has enough bulk to take any hit and can retaliate with Psyshock. Gothitelle can trap Keldeo, survive any hit, and KO it back with Psychic or Psyshock. Wobbuffet can trap and check Choice sets, but it cannot handle Substitute + Calm Mind or Taunt sets. Mega Gallade and Mega Metagross can take any of Keldeo's hits from full HP and OHKO back with Zen Headbutt. However, they need to be at full health to survive a Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump, are outsped and 2HKOed by Hydro Pump from the Choice Scarf set, and hate getting burned by Scald. Mega Alakazam can also outspeed and OHKO Keldeo, but it takes a huge amount of damage from the Choice Specs set, being OHKOed by Hydro Pump, and cannot handle the Choice Scarf set. Mew is a decent check to Choice sets and can use Synchronize to reflect Scald burns onto Keldeo, but it is 2HKOed by Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump, and unless it runs Psyshock, it loses to Substitute + Calm Mind sets.

**Water-types**: Bulky Water-types can check Keldeo without too much difficulty. Gyarados switches into any move bar Hidden Power Electric and can set up a Substitute in front of Keldeo, and although it hates getting burned by Scald, it can circumvent this by running Lum Berry. Alomomola can handle Choice sets rather well but loses to both Substitute and Taunt sets. Gastrodon is immune to both Scald and Hydro Pump and can easily take a Secret Sword if it runs a physically defensive spread, and although it struggles against Substitute + Calm Mind sets, it can break Keldeo's Substitute with Earthquake. However, it loses to Taunt sets regardless. Seismitoad can also handle Keldeo thanks to Water Absorb, but it lacks reliable recovery and therefore cannot beat it consistently. Tentacruel is a soft check to Choice sets, but it cannot switch into them multiple times and loses to Substitute + Calm Mind sets.

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types resist Secret Sword and are usually quite specially bulky, enabling them to take Keldeo's Water-type moves rather well and hit back super effectively. Clefable is a good Keldeo check thanks to Magic Guard enabling it to ignore Scald burns, but it can be 2HKOed by Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump and takes a lot of damage from Choice Specs-boosted Scald if running a physically defensive spread. Azumarill can take any hit bar Hidden Power Electric from the Choice Specs set, which it even takes rather well if holding an Assault Vest, but is crippled by Scald burns. Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir can both take any hit and OHKO back with Hyper Voice, and they are particularly good checks to the Substitute + Calm Mind set because Hyper Voice hits through Substitute. Mega Altaria is a very good answer to Keldeo, resisting its dual STABs and even taking Icy Wind quite well, being able to switch into Scald without being particularly troubled by burns thanks to Natural Cure and Heal Bell, and also having access to Hyper Voice to hit though Keldeo's Substitutes. Togekiss is a decent check to Keldeo because it has enough special bulk to take its Scalds as well as access to Heal Bell to remove any burns; however, it cannot switch into Keldeo properly after Stealth Rock and struggles to beat the Choice Specs set.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types are able to take Scalds very well and therefore serve as good answers to Keldeo, as long as they are not weak to Fighting. Celebi is one of the best Keldeo counters, as it resists Keldeo's STABs and can take even Choice Specs Icy Winds, only fearing Hidden Power Bug, while it deals a lot of of damage back with Giga Drain. Serperior can take any hit, outspeed Keldeo, and threaten it with a powerful Leaf Storm; however, it has more trouble against Choice Scarf sets. Tangrowth is a solid check that can easily take Secret Swords thanks to its physical bulk; however, it is hit quite hard by Icy Wind and Hidden Power Bug from the Choice Specs set, though an Assault Vest set can take these hits better. Gourgeist fears Icy Wind but can take most other hits quite well. Mega Sceptile can take Scalds extremely well, but it is OHKOed by Icy Wind and takes a massive amount of damage from Secret Sword, even being OHKOed by the Choice Specs set after Stealth Rock damage. Chesnaught can deal with Keldeo decently, but it loathes both Scald burns and Icy Wind, and if it gets burnt, it can no longer break Keldeo's Substitutes with Drain Punch.

**Flying-types**: Flying-types can take Keldeo's Sacred Sword very well and can usually outspeed and KO it with their super effective STAB moves. Tornadus-T is a good check to Keldeo, being able to switch into both of its main STAB moves well, especially if carrying an Assault Vest, and OHKOing back with Hurricane. However, it has trouble with Choice Specs-boosted Icy Wind, and the Life Orb set is OHKOed by Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump and takes a huge amount of damage from Choice Specs-boosted Scald as well. Talonflame and Mega Pinsir cannot switch into Scald or Hydro Pump, but they can switch into Secret Sword very easily, with the former OHKOing back with Brave Bird and the latter dealing a huge amount of damage with Quick Attack. Although it can neither outspeed Keldeo nor hit it super effectively, Dragonite resists Keldeo's dual STAB, which enables it to switch into any move from Keldeo bar Icy Wind, with Lum Berry curing a potential Scald burn. Zapdos can run a specially defensive spread to take on Keldeo decently, but it too fears Choice Specs-boosted Icy Winds and Hydro Pumps.

**Poison-types**: Poison-types serve as good checks to Keldeo, especially because most of them resist Water or are immune to it. Mega Venusaur is a good counter to Keldeo, taking any hit bar Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Flying, although it does get worn down by Scald burns rather fast. Amoonguss has access to Regenerator and can hold Black Sludge, which makes it less prone to getting worn down by Scald burns; however, it struggles against Icy Wind variants. Dragalge can take any hit bar Choice Specs-boosted Icy Wind and hit back very hard with its Adaptability-boosted STAB moves. Toxicroak is immune to Water thanks to Dry Skin, making it a good Keldeo check, though it can be OHKOed by Hidden Power Flying.

**Faster Electric-types**: Although they cannot switch in too well, fast Electric-types such as Raikou, Mega Manectric, and Thundurus serve as decent checks to Keldeo because of their ability to outspeed it and hit back for super effective damage. However, none of them can reliably check the Choice Scarf variant, which can outspeed and 2HKO them.
