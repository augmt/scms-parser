Overview
########

The superstar of BW, Keldeo returns to OU in XY to continue to wreak havoc upon the tier. It has a great offensive and defensive typing, giving it multiple opportunities to switch in allowing it to hit a majority of the tier for neutral damage. Keldeo's signature move, Secret Sword, allows it to bypass many special walls such as Chansey, giving it a major niche over other special attackers such as Mega Charizard Y. Combined with its excellent base 129 Special Attack and base 108 Speed, this makes Keldeo a powerful sweeper and revenge killer capable of devastating unprepared teams.

Unfortunately, the transition to XY was not very kind to Keldeo. The changed mechanics of Drizzle mean that Keldeo can no longer take advantage of rain as well as it could in the past generation, and the introduction of new threats such as Fairy-types, which resist Secret Sword, and Talonflame, which can easily revenge kill Keldeo, make Keldeo's life much more miserable than it was in the past. To make matters worse, Keldeo also faces a large amount of competition with Greninja for a teamslot, as Greninja has greater Speed, a much better ability, and a better movepool. Despite these shortcomings, Keldeo remains an excellent Pokemon in OU and is a great option on any offensive team.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Secret Sword
move 3: Scald
move 4: Icy Wind / Hidden Power Flying
item: Choice Specs
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Keldeo's excellent Speed, power, and coverage make it one of the premier wallbreakers of OU. Hydro Pump is Keldeo's main STAB move due to its high Base Power and excellent neutral coverage. Secret Sword is Keldeo's secondary STAB attack, as it is not only more reliable than Hydro Pump but also hits common specially defensive walls with lower Defense stats such as Chansey and has excellent coverage with Hydro Pump. Scald is used as a more reliable Water-type STAB attack. Its 30% burn chance is able to cripple many of Keldeo's common checks, such as Mega Venusaur, Azumarill, and Latias, making it an excellent option. Icy Wind is generally the best coverage move in the third slot, primarily to 2HKO Latios cleanly as well as 2HKO Latias with a bit of prior damage. It is also a useful option to OHKO Dragonite if Multiscale is broken and 2HKO weakened Amoonguss and Celebi. Hidden Power Flying is used primarily to 2HKO one of Keldeo's best checks, Mega Venusaur. It is also Keldeo's best option against Amoonguss and Celebi. Hidden Power Electric is also an option to OHKO Gyarados, which is often tempted not to Mega Evolve on Keldeo so it can get up a free Dragon Dance.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature is used to allow Keldeo to outspeed important threats such as Garchomp, Landorus, and Kyurem-B. Choice Specs is the recommended item, as it allows Keldeo to hit as hard as possible. If you prefer that Keldeo has the freedom of switching moves, then Life Orb can be used, but do note that Keldeo loses a lot of power without the Choice Specs and will be crippled by the Life Orb recoil. An Expert Belt can be used over both items, as it allows Keldeo to feign a Choice item. However, Expert Belt makes Keldeo significantly weaker than it would be if it is using a Choice Specs or Life Orb, making it the inferior item choice in most scenarios.

Usage Tips
========

Keldeo's high Speed and powerful STAB attacks make it perfect for mid- to late-game, as it can easily sweep the foe's team once its checks and counters are weakened. Keldeo still works very well early-game as well, as it can use its excellent coverage to enable another Pokemon such as Mega Tyranitar and Scizor to sweep later in the game. Keldeo's excellent typing and decent bulk also make it a great switch-in to Rock-, Fire-, and Steel-types, as it can OHKO a majority of these types of Pokemon with its powerful STAB attacks.

The choice between using Hydro Pump and Scald depends on the current scenario. If Keldeo's counters such as Mega Venusaur and Azumarill are still intact, it is generally best to use Scald, as its 30% burn chance can cripple many of these Pokemon. If all of Keldeo's counters are either heavily weakened or eliminated, it is generally the best to use Hydro Pump, as its higher Base Power allows Keldeo to OHKO Pokemon that it could otherwise not take down with Scald, such as specially defensive Heatran and Scizor, after Stealth Rock damage. Hydro Pump is also the better move to use if the Pokemon Keldeo is up against can only be OHKOed by Hydro Pump and not Scald.

If the opponent has has Latios or Latias, it is generally a good idea to switch to a Pursuit user when Keldeo is active, as both of these Pokemon are common switch-ins to Keldeo. Keldeo should also be very cautious of what move it is using if it has Choice Specs, as various Pokemon may switch into a resisted attack and force Keldeo out.

Team Options
========

Keldeo appreciates entry hazard support to weaken its checks and counters. Garchomp and Ferrothorn are excellent partners for this role. Pursuit support from Bisharp or Tyranitar is recommended, as Keldeo appreciates the removal of Pokemon such as Latios and Latias from the match. Heatran is able to check a majority of Keldeo's common checks and counters, including Mega Venusaur, Latios, Talonflame, and Trevenant. Electric-types such as Rotom-W, Mega Manetric, and Thundurus are also good partners, as they are able to defeat Water-types such as Slowbro, Tentacruel, and Jellicent while also being able to provide momentum to switch Keldeo in safely with Volt Switch. Scizor is also able to provide momentum with U-turn while also defeating common Fairy- and Dragon-type Pokemon that are able to check Keldeo. Rain support from Politoed or a manual rain setter such as Thundurus is also appreciated, as it increases the power of Keldeo's Water-type STAB attacks, making it much more difficult to defeat.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Scald
move 3: Secret Sword
move 4: Hidden Power Electric
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Choice Scarf Keldeo's moveset is very straightforward, consisting of its STAB attacks and one appropriate coverage move. Hydro Pump is Keldeo's most powerful option, dealing significant damage to Pokemon that don't resist it. Running two Water-type STAB moves may seem redundant, but Scald plays an important role. Its high chance of inflicting a burn to cripple would-be counters, along with its perfect accuracy, makes it the ideal early-game tool. Secret Sword has the fantastic benefit of hitting the Defense of its target, making Chansey and other specially bulky Pokemon far less threatening to Keldeo. In the final slot, Hidden Power Electric is the preferred option as it allows Keldeo to reliably beat Gyarados as well as hit Azumarill super effectively. If desired, Hidden Power Ice can be used to target Latios and Latias, as well as revenge kill +1 Dragonite if its Multiscale is broken. Icy Wind can be chosen if revenge killing both Gyarados and Dragonite is required, replacing Scald.

Set Details
========

The EV spread is relatively standard for a Choice Scarf user, emphasizing Speed and Special Attack. A Timid nature is preferred to ensure that Keldeo outspeeds other Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp, Terrakion, and opposing Keldeo, as well as getting the jump on Swift Swim Kabutops. Alternatively, a Modest nature allows Keldeo to hit noticeably harder and is a decent option if the above Pokemon are not considerable threats to your team.

Usage Tips
========

As with most Choice Scarf users, Keldeo can revenge kill a great number of boosted threats such as Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Garchomp. Additionally, Keldeo can outrun and defeat common, naturally faster Pokemon such as Gengar, Greninja, and Thundurus, all of which may be taken by surprise as Choice Specs is a very popular item on Keldeo.

Many Pokemon can comfortably switch into Keldeo's attacks, particularly as this set lacks any kind of boosting item. As such, Scald plays a key role early in the game to try to punish the likes of Azumarill and Mega Venusaur with a burn. It is nearly always wiser to try for a burn than use a coverage move, as the burn can deal more damage in the long run.

Keldeo is also a very effective late-game cleaner as it is either faster than or as fast as all common Choice Scarf users and resists many priority attacks, including Bullet Punch, Sucker Punch, Ice Shard, and Aqua Jet. It must be wary of Talonflame's Brave Bird and Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack, however.

Team Options
========

Choice Scarf Keldeo is well-suited to offensive and balanced teams, where it can revenge kill troublesome Pokemon such as Greninja. Tyranitar is an excellent teammate for Keldeo, as it can dispatch Latias and Latios with Pursuit, potentially paving the way for Keldeo to sweep late-game. Bisharp is also a great choice for a teammate, as it effectively pressures Chansey with Knock Off and Pursuit. As this set cannot break walls very well, it requires support from the likes of Landorus, which can also lure and weaken Latias with Knock Off.

From a more defensive standpoint, Ferrothorn is a good partner as it can check Azumarill and handle Electric-, Psychic-, and Grass-type attacks aimed at Keldeo. It is also very effective at wearing down the opposing team through Leech Seed, Spikes, and Iron Barbs damage. In return, Keldeo can threaten Heatran, Landorus, and, to an extent, Mega Charizard Y. Latias works well with Keldeo, providing a solid answer to Mega Venusaur while appreciating Keldeo's ability to pressure Tyranitar and Bisharp. Bulky Mega Scizor is another useful teammate, as it can set up on Latias that lack Hidden Power Fire, Assault Vest Azumarill, and Chansey, as well as threaten Clefable and Mega Gardevoir. Keldeo can deal with Heatran, Landorus-T, and Gliscor for Scizor.

SubCM
########
name: SubCM
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Scald
move 4: Secret Sword
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Substitute protects Keldeo from status and revenge killers while it gets in enough Calm Mind boosts under its belt to get enough power to sweep late-game. Scald is Keldeo's STAB move of choice, and its 30% chance to burn the opponent makes it able to debilitate Keldeo's checks, such as Azumarill and Mega Venusaur. Secret Sword is Keldeo's secondary STAB move, allowing it to bypass Chansey's monstrous bulk with ease, while also allowing it to beat opposing Calm Mind users, most notably Suicune. There are not many other options for moves in this set. Hydro Pump is a Water-type STAB move that is much stronger than Scald, but Scald's higher PP, as well as the ability to burn things for Keldeo to set up on, is much more appreciated.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature with maximum Speed EVs allows Keldeo to Speed tie with opposing Keldeo and Terrakion. Maximum Special Attack investment allows Keldeo to hit as hard as possible, especially after a couple of Calm Mind boosts. Leftovers is the item of choice for this set, as Keldeo appreciates having some recovery to create more Substitutes. A Life Orb could be used for more power, but the lack of recovery, as well as the additional recoil, will wear Keldeo down exceedingly quickly.

Usage Tips
========

The idea behind this set is for Keldeo to set up a Substitute and use Calm Mind on a Pokemon like Heatran and Alomomola that do not threaten it much. This set can be annoying for stall to face, but it needs to be played correctly in order to be. For example, Keldeo should spam Scald in the early- or mid-game to weaken its checks and fish for a burn. One should not be too reckless with the use of Substitute, as it can wear Keldeo down quickly, but do not be afraid to use it if it can pay off. Once Keldeo's checks have been weakened in the later parts of the game, Keldeo can set up Substitute and proceed to Calm Mind away and set up its sweep.


Team Options
========

Latios and Latias are a huge pain for this set because they outspeed Keldeo and can bypass any of its Calm Mind boosts with Psyshock. For this reason, Choice Scarf Tyranitar is a good teammate for Keldeo, as it can Pursuit trap them. While it is not as effective as Tyranitar due to its lower bulk, Bisharp can Pursuit trap Latios and Latias as well and can handle Unaware Clefable, which stops Keldeo in its tracks. Landorus-T can pivot into Talonflame and Mega Pinsir should they try to KO Keldeo with their STAB Flying-type attacks, and it can also set up Stealth Rock to wear down Keldeo's checks. Mega Venusaur can stop this set as well, so teammates like Latios, Latias, Talonflame, or Pinsir that can handle it make for good partners. Should Talonflame or Pinsir be paired with Keldeo, another teammate will be needed to handle the stacked weaknesses to Thundurus, such as Assault Vest Raikou or Choice Scarf Magnezone. Mega Alakazam pairs well with Keldeo, being able to handle Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and to some extent the Lati twins, whereas Keldeo can handle Tyranitar and Bisharp, which give Alakazam a lot of trouble. Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon can KO Keldeo through its Substitute with a Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice. Jirachi can reliably switch into both Gardevoir and Sylveon, and if used on a more balanced team, can pass Wishes to Keldeo so it has more health to create Substitutes.

Endeavor
########
name: Endeavor
move 1: Endeavor
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Hydro Pump / Scald
move 4: Secret Sword
ability: Justified
item: Salac Berry
evs: 8 HP / 248 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Endeavor is a very unexpected move, especially coming from Keldeo, as it is usually holding using Choice Specs or Life Orb. Endeavor is almost guaranteed to surprise your opponent because it cuts the foe's HP to equal that of the user. Substitute allows Keldeo to avoid being afflicted with status while lowering its health to maximize Endeavor damage and activate its Salac Berry. Hydro Pump and Secret Sword are Keldeo's bread and butter STAB moves that are capable of KOing many Pokemon in the tier. Scald can be used over Hydro Pump for its chance to inflict burns, which can help when trying to weaken opposing walls or cripple threats that may attempt to switch in. It also has better accuracy.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature with maximum Special Attack and Speed investment is used in order to hit as hard as possible while maintaining as much Speed as possible. By using a Salac Berry, Keldeo is able to increase its Speed after its health drops below 25%, which helps when facing faster, offensive teams. After activating its Salac Berry, Keldeo doesn't have to worry about Speed tying with opposing Keldeo or Terrakion. It's also able to use Endeavor to weaken faster threats such as Latios, Thundurus, and Mega Manectric. The given EV spread maximizes Endeavor's damage, allowing Keldeo to lower the opposing Pokemon's health to 1 HP with Endeavor after using Substitute four times.

Usage Tips
========

Endeavor Keldeo is used as a lure to weaken popular checks and counters to Keldeo such as Mega Venusaur, Azumarill, and Amoonguss. It's possible for Keldeo to masquerade as a common Choice Specs variant early-game to lure the opponent into a false sense of security. Wait until mid- to late-game before revealing Substitute + Endeavor. Use Substitute until Keldeo's health drops below 25%, then use Endeavor to cripple Keldeo's common checks and counters. This set is best used on offensive or balanced teams that have trouble with specific walls. For example, one would use Endeavor to cripple Clefable and secure a Mega Tyranitar sweep. Because of its ability to easily weaken walls, Endeavor Keldeo can serve as an excellent win condition.

Team Options
========

Keldeo needs support from Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Scizor to deal with Psychic-types, namely Latios and Latias. Mega Charizard Y is also a great teammate for its ability to get rid of bulky Water- and Grass-type Pokemon that attempt to wall Keldeo. Mega Tyranitar, Mega Gyarados, Mega Charizard X, Terrakion, Landorus, and Bisharp all value Keldeo's ability to cripple the tier's top defensive Pokemon, including Mega Venusaur, Clefable, Gyarados, and more. Other Fighting-type Pokemon also benefit from the set's capabilities. For example, Terrakion no longer has to worry about Fairy- or Poison-types after they've been crippled by Keldeo, meaning it can dish out powerful Close Combats with little resistance.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Hydro Pump / Scald
move 3: Secret Sword
move 4: Hidden Power Flying
ability: Justified
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

With Calm Mind, Keldeo uses its fairly unique typing, high power, and good natural bulk to set up and sweep the opposing team. Hydro Pump is Keldeo's recommended Water-type STAB move due to its high Base Power. Despite Hydro Pump's excellent Base Power, Scald can be used in its place as a more reliable STAB attack, as the Special Attack boost makes up for Scald's lower Base Power. It also has a 30% burn chance, which is able to cripple many of Keldeo's counters such as Latias, Azumarill, and Mega Venusaur, as well as increase the amount of Keldeo's setup opportunities. Secret Sword is Keldeo's secondary STAB move, receiving great coverage with Keldeo's Water-type STAB attacks and hitting special walls such as Chansey for super effective damage. Hidden Power Flying hits many of Keldeo's common checks, such as Mega Venusaur and Chesnaught, for super effective damage and receives perfect neutral coverage with Secret Sword and Keldeo's Water-type STAB attack. Icy Wind is an alternate coverage move that Keldeo can utilize to defeat various threats such as Dragonite and Salamence.

Set Details
========

Leftovers is the preferred item choice to increase Keldeo's longevity, making it easier for Keldeo to set up multiple Calm Minds. Life Orb can be used to give Keldeo a much greater damage output and allow it to function as a mid-game wallbreaker. Alternative items Keldeo can use include Lum Berry and Coba Berry. Lum Berry can be used if you prefer that Keldeo avoids taking damage from status moves, while a Coba Berry allows Keldeo to take moves such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack much better, but in general, both of these items are inferior to Life Orb and Leftovers.

Usage Tips
========

Keldeo is best used late-game once its checks and counters are removed, as it can set up Calm Mind with little to no trouble and sweep the foe's team. Keldeo can still be used as a mid-game wallbreaker if it is using a Life Orb and sweep later in the match. If the opponent has a faster check to Keldeo such as Latias or Talonflame, Keldeo should generally postpone setting up Calm Mind and either attack with its powerful STAB attacks or switch out into a Pokemon that can defeat its checks.

The primary obstacles in Keldeo's sweep are Latios, Latias, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir, so it should be your number one priority to remove these threats. Having a Pursuit user such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, or Scizor can keep Latios and Latias in check, while having Stealth Rock down on the field can put both Talonflame and Mega Pinsir in a bad position.

Keldeo's excellent typing also allows it to set up Calm Mind against Dark-, Steel-, and Rock-types such as Bisharp, Scizor, and Tyranitar. Setting up one to two times is generally enough for Keldeo to sweep.

Team Options
========

Landorus and Ferrothorn are great partners for Keldeo, as the entry hazards they provide weaken a majority of Keldeo's counters. Scizor is also a great partner, as it is able to provide momentum with U-turn while also being able to defeat a large majority of Keldeo's checks and counters. Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus are also able to provide momentum for Keldeo with Volt Switch while also checking Water- and Flying-types that generally give Keldeo trouble. Heatran is a great partner, as it can set up Stealth Rock while also defeating a large majority of Keldeo's checks, including Latias, Sylveon, and Mega Venusaur. Bisharp and Tyranitar are also great partners, as they are able to Pursuit trap a large majority of Keldeo's counters, making it easier for Keldeo to sweep. Keldeo also appreciates rain support from Politoed or a manual Rain Dance user such as Thundurus, as it boosts the power of Keldeo's Water-type STAB moves, making it generally easier for Keldeo to sweep.

Other Options
########

Keldeo's small movepool leaves it with very few alternative options.Taunt is a viable move that Keldeo can run, allowing it to prevent moves such as Defog and Thunder Wave, although Keldeo loses to a majority of the Pokemon utilizing these moves anyway. Rain Dance is a viable move Keldeo can use to boost the power of its Water-type STAB attacks, but Keldeo rarely has room to run it. Substitute can be used to take advantage of the switches Keldeo forces. Other Hidden Power types can also be to hit niche targets, such as using Hidden Power Grass for Gastrodon or Hidden Power Psychic for Tentacruel.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Mega Venusaur is a good answer to Keldeo, as apart from Hidden Power Flying, Keldeo cannot significantly damage Mega Venusaur, while Mega Venusaur can recover all of its health lost with Synthesis and 2HKO Keldeo with Giga Drain. However, it dislikes the residual damage from a Scald burn, which can rack up quickly with the lack of Leftovers and Stealth Rock damage. Amoonguss and Celebi are other bulky Grass-types that resist both of Keldeo's STABs and don't care that much about Icy Wind or Hidden Power Flying. They're also much harder to wear down, as Amoonguss has Black Sludge and Regenerator to prevent it from being worn down as easily between Stealth Rock, burn, and repeated assaults. Meanwhile, Celebi possesses Natural Cure to heal burns upon switching out and a more reliable recovery option in Recover.

**Water-types**: Slowking is possibly the best Keldeo counter, as it fears little from any of Keldeo's attacks; is extremely difficult to wear down between Slack Off, Leftovers, and Regenerator; and can cripple it in return with a status or hit it hard with a super effective Psyshock. Azumarill can tank Keldeo's attacks with relative ease and OHKO it with Play Rough or Belly Drum on the switch out, though it has to watch out for a Scald burn, which wears it down quickly and neuters its attacking capabilities. Tentacruel is another solid answer. Although Slowbro might seem like a good answer, it actually has a chance to be 2HKOed by Choice Specs Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock damage, which can be assured with a Scald burn. Alomomola can actually take hits from Keldeo pretty well, but can't actually do that much in return and isn't too hard to wear down into Hydro Pump 2HKO range with a Scald burn and Stealth Rock damage. Despite not being good counters, it and Slowbro can serve as good pivot switches into Keldeo, easily tanking at least one hit and recovering off most of the damage taken as they switch out to an appropriate response for the likely Choice-locked attack.

**Dragon-types**: Latios and Latias resist Keldeo's STAB attacks and are able to OHKO with their respective super effective STAB attacks. They can heal up with Roost to do so consistently throughout the match. Dragonite resists both of Keldeo's STAB attacks and can either OHKO Keldeo with a Choice Band-boosted Outrage or set up Dragon Dance, though unless it carries a Lum Berry, doesn't like a burn. All of these Pokemon take significant damage from Choice Specs-boosted Icy Wind, so they have to watch out for it.

**Revenge Killers**: Talonflame is able to easily revenge kill Keldeo with its priority Brave Bird. However, Talonflame is unable to switch into Keldeo's Water-type STAB moves and will lose to Keldeo if it has a Substitute up. Mega Pinsir is in a similar situation as Talonflame, except it requires Keldeo to have taken some prior damage before its Quick Attack is able to KO it. Alakazam and Thundurus are able to switch into Keldeo's Fighting-type STAB attacks and OHKO it with their respective STAB attacks. Greninja can OHKO with Extrasensory and Mega Aerodactyl with Aerial Ace. However, all of these Pokemon are OHKOed by one of Keldeo's Choice Specs-boosted attacks after Stealth Rock damage, and thus cannot be considered reliable answers by any means.
