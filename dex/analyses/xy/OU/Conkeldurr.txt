Overview
########

Conkeldurr is the definition of a tank. A powerful base 140 Attack coupled with base 105 HP and a solid base 95 Defense allows it to not only take hits but also dish them out. It also has access to recovery in Drain Punch, which when combined with Guts, makes it a great switch-in to common status users such as Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Heatran, as Conkeldurr is able to beat them. Conkeldurr also has amazing coverage moves as well as a resistance to Stealth Rock. Its poor Speed is made up for by a priority move in Mach Punch, while its average Special Defense is remedied by Assault Vest. However, with Fairy-types such as Azumarill and Clefable running around and its inability to switch into common threats, Conkeldurr is a hit-or-miss Pokemon.

Moves
========

Drain Punch is Conkeldurr's main STAB move, providing 50% of the damage dealt as recovery. Mach Punch gives Conkeldurr priority and can be used to pick off weakened opponents. Ice Punch gives Conkeldurr excellent coverage against bulky Ground- and Flying-types such as Gliscor and Landorus-T, as well as Dragon-types such as Latios and Latias. Knock Off cripples any Pokemon, as none appreciate losing their item. It also allows you to take on Stall Breaker Mew with ease. Stone Edge allows Conkeldurr to take out its common checks such as Pinsir, Talonflame, and Charizard on the switch. Poison Jab is a great move on Conkeldurr, allowing it to deal massive damage to Fairy-types, most notably Azumarill and Clefable, which are both 2HKOed after a bit of prior damage.

Set Details
========

Conkeldurr is a tank, taking hits while hitting back like a truck. Assault Vest is the item of choice as it raises Conkeldurr's Special Defense greatly, allowing it to take attacks from powerful special attackers such as Mega Charizard Y and Thundurus. An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment allows Conkeldurr to hit hard with its great coverage. 20 Speed EVs allows it to outpace opposing Conkeldurr and Hippowdon, allowing Conkeldurr to potentially beat Hippowdon one-on-one if Guts is activated. The rest of the EVs are put in Special Defense to maximize bulk, allowing Conkeldurr to take hits from the aforementioned specially offensive threats. Guts allows Conkeldurr to freely switch into common status moves such as Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon such as Thundurus and Rotom-W, giving Conkeldurr a free Attack boost, and with Assault Vest, Conkeldurr is easily able to take them on.

Usage Tips
========

Thanks to Assault Vest, switching into special attackers without strong super effective STAB moves is of little concern for Conkeldurr. Keep in mind that Conkeldurr's only form of recovery is Drain Punch, which is not always reliable, so Conkeldurr should be kept healthy if it is needed to check special threats. It can easily switch into status moves from common Pokemon such as Heatran, Thundurus, and Rotom-W while recovering any damage done with Drain Punch. Don't be afraid to make a prediction and fire off the appropriate coverage move to hit a switch-in hard. Conkeldurr is a Pokemon that forces a lot of switches, so firing off repeated Drain Punches can allow your opponent to freely switch in threats that can outspeed and take out Conkeldurr such as Latios.

Team Options
========

Conkeldurr isn't really a Pokemon that you can base a team around, but it can fit on many offensive or balanced teams. Conkeldurr appreciates teammates that can come in on strong Flying- and Fairy-type attacks aimed at it. Rotom-W is an excellent partner, as it can take attacks from Talonflame and Mega Pinsir, has Pain Split to recover back the damage, and is also a great switch-in to Azumarill, which otherwise threatens Conkeldurr. Landorus-T is also a nice choice as it comes in on Flying-type moves, shrugs off the damage, and is able to set up Stealth Rock or pivot out with U-turn, which also allows Conkeldurr to easily switch into common Landorus-T counters such as Rotom-W. Latias is another notable choice as it comes in on Mega Venusaur and Choice Specs Keldeo, which threaten Conkeldurr, and is able to knock them out. Latias also provides Defog support as well as a switch-in to Landorus, which can threaten Conkeldurr with Psychic. Be wary of Knock Off variants though. Partners such as Bisharp and Tyranitar that can trap and take on strong Psychic-types are also excellent partners, paving the way for Conkeldurr to do major damage. Heatran provides Conkeldurr with Stealth Rock support and also shrugs off hits from Clefable, Sylveon, and Mega Venusaur, barring Earthquake. Clefable and Kyurem-B are also nice teammates as they are both able to take on Mega Venusaur, and the former can also set up Stealth Rock.

Other Options
########

Bulk Up is an option, allowing Conkeldurr to raise its Defense while boosting its Attack, but losing the immediate bulk from Assault Vest as well as not being a great switch-in to common special attackers such as Thundurus can make Bulk Up Conkeldurr hard to fit on teams. Thunder Punch is a solid choice for hitting Mega Gyarados that think that they can set up before Mega Evolving. It also dents Charizard and Talonflame switch-ins as well as bulky Water-types such as Azumarill. Fire Punch can be an option for taking on Mega Scizor, which would otherwise set up on Conkeldurr. Superpower has more Base Power, but the lack of recovery and the stat drops are detrimental. Facade can be a strong option, as combined with Guts it gives Conkeldurr a powerful attack. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge to trade power for accuracy.

Checks & Counters
########

**Flying-types**: Strong physical Flying-types such as Talonflame and Mega Pinsir force out Conkeldurr with their STAB moves, though they need to be wary of switching in on Stone Edge.

** Fairy-types**: Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Gardevoir, Togekiss, and Clefable can all outspeed Conkeldurr and threaten to OHKO or 2HKO Conkeldurr, though they do not appreciate switching into Poison Jab as it threatens to 2HKO most of them.

**Psychic-types**: Both Latios and Latias can OHKO Conkeldurr with STAB Psyshock; however, they cannot switch in on Knock Off or Ice Punch or they will be heavily damaged. Alakazam can also defeat Conkeldurr with its Psychic-type STAB moves of choice, but is much more frail than Latios and Latias and can never switch in directly, as if it switches in on a Knock Off and is taken down to its Focus Sash, it can then be KOed by Mach Punch.

**Physical Walls and Tanks**: Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Mega Scizor can all shrug off attacks from Conkeldurr if Guts is not activated and recover their HP back. Slowbro threatens Conkeldurr with its Psychic-type STAB moves while Mega Scizor can set up on it. Mega Venusaur can take any attack and either heal with Synthesis or threaten to 3HKO Conkeldurr with Sludge Bomb.
