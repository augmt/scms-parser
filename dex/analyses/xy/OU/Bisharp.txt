Overview
########

Bisharp remains a top-tier threat in ORAS OU, as it sports numerous positive traits that allow it to take on many different team archetypes. Defiant, STAB Knock Off and Sucker Punch, and the ability to check many top-tier threats, such as Latios, Latias, and Clefable, make Bisharp a good choice for many offensive teams. Additionally, it can act as a great setup sweeper with Swords Dance or support the team by using Pursuit to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Latios and Gengar. However, it still has a few drawbacks, such as a nasty 4x weakness to Fighting-type attacks, average-at best-Speed, and the tendency to be setup bait for many Mega Evolutions. Additionally, Bisharp is often reliant on Sucker Punch to deal with faster Pokemon, which leads to many 50-50s that can sway the game in either side's favor depending on the outcome.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Knock Off
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Iron Head
move 4: Sucker Punch
ability: Defiant
item: Life Orb / BlackGlasses / Lum Berry
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Knock Off is Bisharp's main STAB move, as it hits incredibly hard and has utility in removing items. Swords Dance boosts Bisharp's attack to insane levels and puts immediate pressure on a lot of offensive teams. Iron Head hits Fairy-types super effectively and is Bisharp's best bet against many Mega Evolutions, such as Mega Sableye and Mega Venusaur. Sucker Punch hits faster Pokemon that Bisharp would otherwise be unable to touch.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed investment is used to hit as hard and fast as possible, while a Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed key threats such as defensive Landorus-T and Rotom-W as well as Adamant Mega Altaria, Dragonite, Gyarados, and Diggersby. An Adamant nature can be used instead if this is unnecessary, as it gives Bisharp a noticeable power boost. For example, it ensures an OHKO on Choice Scarf Landorus-T after Stealth Rock damage, something that Jolly Bisharp cannot achieve. If this option is chosen, 52 EVs can be moved from Speed to Special Defense to avoid the OHKO from Life Orb Latios's Hidden Power Fire after Stealth Rock damage, which can help prevent Sucker Punch 50-50s. Life Orb is the preferred item, as it boosts the power of all of Bisharp's attacks, although Black Glasses can be used if the recoil from Life Orb is unappealing, which is the case when using the aforementioned EV spread. Additionally, a Lum Berry is an option to aid in setting up on bulky Water-types, as Bisharp will no longer have to worry about random Scald burns. It also helps with Will-O-Wisps from the likes of Rotom-W, Mega Sableye, and Mega Gardevoir.

Usage Tips
========

This variant of Bisharp is best used as a late-game sweeper against offensive teams, so consider saving it for after its checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened. However, Bisharp can act as a powerful wallbreaker early- or mid-game against more defensively oriented teams, so bringing it in early versus a Pokemon it can set up on, such as Stealth Rock Clefable, is advisable. Additionally, Bisharp makes for a good revenge killer thanks to its powerful Sucker Punch, which can be used to revenge kill certain sweepers such as Gengar, Mega Metagross, and Sand Rush Excadrill after prior damage. Note that Sucker Punch, as it requires the foe to use an attack in order to work, can be taken advantage of in certain situations by providing the foe with free switches or a Substitute. When using Bisharp, it is important to recognize 50-50 situations where the foe has a non-attacking move and will attempt to stall out Sucker Punches; the 50-50 is that Bisharp can stop using Sucker Punch at any point and go for an attack, which the foe can potentially punish with well-timed attack of their own. There isn't any specific strategy related to getting out of these scenarios, but try and avoid them as much as possible.

Team Options
========

Bisharp struggles immensely with Fighting-types, so teammates that can handle Pokemon such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gallade are appreciated. Such Pokemon include Clefable, Celebi, and Mega Metagross. Choice Band Azumarill also makes for a good teammate, as it can take on Pokemon that are able to stomach an unboosted Sucker Punch from Bisharp, such as Landorus, Garchomp, and Mega Charizard X. Pokemon that can capitalize on Bisharp's ability to remove Fairy-types also synergize well with it, such as Latios, Latias, Mega Gallade, and Keldeo. Lastly, Bisharp is able to deter the removal of entry hazards via Defog thanks to Defiant, so heavy offense suicide leads such as Garchomp, Azelf, Mamoswine, and Landorus pair well with Bisharp.

Pursuit Trapper
########
name: Pursuit Trapper
move 1: Knock Off
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Pursuit
ability: Defiant
item: BlackGlasses / Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 52 SpD / 204 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Knock Off is Bisharp's main STAB move, as it hits insanely hard and has utility in removing items. Iron Head is Bisharp's secondary STAB move and is used to hit Fairy-types, such as Clefable and Sylveon, and Tyranitar hard. Sucker Punch is used to hit faster threats that Bisharp would otherwise be unable to touch. Pursuit allows Bisharp to trap Psychic- and Ghost- types such as Gengar, Latios, and Latias.

Set Details
========

The EV spread, while specific, serves two key roles. Maximum Attack investment increases Bisharp's damage output, while the Special Defense EVs allow Bisharp to survive Life Orb Latios's Hidden Power Fire after Stealth Rock damage from full health, which is crucial as it prevents Sucker Punch and Pursuit 50-50s. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize Bisharp's damage output, although a Jolly nature can be used if the extra Speed is beneficial. If running a Jolly nature, an EV spread of 204 Atk / 52 SpD / 252 Spe should be used, as it preserves Bisharp's Speed while achieving the same bulk benchmark. The preferred item for this set is Black Glasses, as it boosts the power of Bisharp's Dark-type STAB moves and doesn't cause recoil, which is important because this variant of Bisharp will be switching into attacks more often. A Life Orb can be used to hit harder with all moves; however, the recoil limits Bisharp's switch-in opportunities. Defiant punishes foes that use Defog and turns Intimidate and Sticky Web into a liability for the opponent.

Usage Tips
========

The primary function of this set is to Pursuit trap targets such as Latios and Gengar to allow a teammate to set up a sweep. To do this, keeping Bisharp around until its targets have been removed should be a number one priority. Double switches or switching Bisharp in after the target has KOed one of its teammates is the safest way to do this, although a manual switch works just as well. However, if the opposing team lacks a target for Bisharp to Pursuit trap, Bisharp can still function as a wallbreaker or late-game cleaner thanks to its powerful Knock Off and Sucker Punch. Additionally, it can be used to deter the use of Defog, as the opponent risks giving Bisharp a free Attack boost.

Team Options
========

Teammates that appreciate the removal of Pokemon such as Latios and Latias make excellent partners for Bisharp. Such teammates include Landorus and Keldeo. Additionally, Latios, Latias, and Azumarill make good teammates, as they can take on the Fighting-types that give Bisharp trouble. Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Fairy-types, such as Keldeo, Garchomp, and Mega Gallade, make for good partners, as they can capitalize on Bisharp's ability to remove these threats from play. Lastly, Bisharp appreciates entry hazard support to ensure more OHKOs and 2HKOs, so Stealth Rock setters such as Garchomp and Landorus-T pair well with it.

Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Knock Off
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Pursuit
ability: Defiant
item: Assault Vest
evs: 192 HP / 220 Atk / 96 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Knock Off is Bisharp's main STAB move, as it hits incredibly hard and has utility in removing items from opposing Pokemon. Iron Head is Bisharp's secondary STAB move and is used to hit opposing Fairy- and Rock-types such as Clefable and Tyranitar super effectively. Sucker Punch is Bisharp's much-needed priority move, as it allows Bisharp to hit faster Pokemon before they can move. Pursuit is used in the last slot to trap Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, and Gengar.

Set Details
========
The Attack investment hits the last available jump point, while the Speed EVs let Bisharp outspeed maximum Speed Azumarill. The rest of the EVs go into HP to help Bisharp better tank hits. Alternatively, these EVs can go into Special Defense to further boost Bisharp's special bulk along with Assault Vest, although this sacrifices a notable amount of physical bulk and is usually not worth it. An alternative EV spread of 192 HP / 252 Atk / 64 SpD can be run, as it gives Bisharp more power and bulk overall. However, it risks being outsped by Pokemon near its Speed tier running Speed investment, so it may not be worth it. Additionally, a more offensive EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed certain threats while still having the benefit of the added special bulk provided by its Assault Vest. Assault Vest improves Bisharp's special bulk significantly. For example, it no longer risks being 2HKOed by Life Orb Latios's Draco Meteor, which allows it to Pursuit trap Latios more reliably. Defiant is the ability of choice because it punishes opponents that use Defog and turns Intimidate and Sticky Web into a liability for the opponent.

Usage Tips
========

This variant of Bisharp is better able to switch into special attackers such as Latios and Gengar, and can either threaten them out with a super effective move or trap them with Pursuit. It also acts as a more reliable check to Fairy-types such as Clefable and Sylveon, as it takes much less damage from their Fairy-type STAB moves. Lastly, Bisharp can deter the use of Defog thanks to Defiant, and this variant can put it to good use by surviving hits it would otherwise fall to thanks to its good bulk.

Team options
========

Keldeo and Landorus make for good teammates, as they appreciate the Pursuit support Bisharp provides. Additionally, Bisharp appreciates Pokemon that are able to take on Fighting-types, such as Latios, Latias, and Clefable. Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Fairy-types, such as Mega Gallade, Latios, Latias, and Keldeo, pair well with Bisharp. Additionally, this variant of Bisharp appreciates VoltTurn support to get in safely, as it better allows Bisharp to preserve its bulk for when it's needed. Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Raikou are good options for this role. Lastly, entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T and Garchomp appreciate Bisharp's ability to deter Defog, while Bisharp appreciates the entry hazards to secure more KOs.

Other Options
########

Taunt can be used to punish defensive Pokemon like Skarmory and Quagsire that want to heal up against Bisharp or, in the case of Skarmory, go for a Defog or layer of Spikes. This makes Bisharp a more effective stallbreaker, but Swords Dance and Pursuit are typically superior options because they are better in matchups outside of stall. A Stealth Rock set with a Focus Sash can be used as a good hazard setter that beats most Defoggers and Rapid Spinners one-on-one, although there are usually better options out there for laying down entry hazards. Finally, Low Kick allows Bisharp to take on opposing Ferrothorn and opposing Bisharp more reliably, while also 2HKOing Heatran.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Many Fighting-types, such as Mega Lopunny, Terrakion, Breloom, and Conkeldurr, are able to check Bisharp, as they resist Knock Off and can score an easy OHKO with one of their STAB moves. Keldeo, Cobalion, Lucario, and Infernape also resist Iron Head, which makes them reliable checks that are able to switch into Bisharp repeatedly.

**Opposing Dark-types**: Many opposing Dark-types take little damage from Iron Head and resist Knock Off, which allows them to switch into Bisharp quite reliably. Mandibuzz, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Sableye can switch into Bisharp without fearing any of its attacks. Mandibuzz can Roost stall and wear Bisharp down with Foul Play, Mega Gyarados can set up a Dragon Dance on it, and Mega Sableye can burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Additionally, opposing Bisharp carrying Low Kick can check Bisharp well. Choice Scarf Tyranitar also deserves a mention, as it resists Sucker Punch and can OHKO Bisharp with Superpower.

**Mega Evolutions**: Mega Evolutions take reduced damage from Knock Off, and many either resist Iron Head or take little damage from it. Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, Mega Venusaur, Mega Scizor, and Mega Sableye all fear very little from Bisharp. Additionally, many of them can use Bisharp as setup bait, as Bisharp's only way of dealing notable damage to them is with Sucker Punch, which can be taken advantage of.

**Will-O-Wisp and Substitute**: Rotom-W, Heatran, defensive Mega Charizard X, Bulky Talonflame, and fast variants of Mew, can all burn Bisharp with Will-O-Wisp, which effectively renders Bisharp useless if it is not carrying a Lum Berry. Additionally, Substitute blocks Sucker Punch, giving the user a free turn against Bisharp. Users of Substitute such as Gyarados, Excadrill, Gardevoir, and Thundurus are able to defeat or cause significant damage to Bisharp with a free turn.

**Physically Bulky Pokemon**: Bulky Ground-types such as Gliscor, bulky Garchomp, Quagsire, and physically defensive Hippowdon fear little from Bisharp's attacks and can KO it back with STAB Earthquakes, while the latter two also have reliable recovery. Additionally, Pokemon such as Chesnaught, Mega Slowbro, Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Counter Skarmory can defeat Bisharp if it lacks Swords Dance.
