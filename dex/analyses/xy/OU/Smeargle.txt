Overview
########

Smeargle looks like an odd choice for competitive play at first glance with its all-round abysmal stats; however, with access to every move, Smeargle finds itself a niche in OU. With Spore and Stealth Rock, Smeargle is one of two viable Sticky Web users, allowing it to function as an effective support choice for slow sweepers, such as Swords Dance Diggersby. To aid in this role, Smeargle has access to moves such as Taunt, Parting Shot, Magic Coat, and even Dark Void, which makes it the only OU Pokemon able to put Grass-types and Overcoat users to sleep. All in all, Smeargle isn't that great of a Pokemon, but fulfills certain support roles that no other Pokemon can, giving it a place in the OU metagame.

Sticky Web
########
name: Sticky Web
move 1: Sticky Web
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Spore / Dark Void
move 4: Magic Coat
ability: Own Tempo
item: Focus Sash
evs: 96 HP / 120 Def / 40 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Sticky Web is a valuable support move, lowering the Speed of all grounded opponents by one stage to allow for slower attackers to shine. Stealth Rock is an important entry hazard for offensive Pokemon to secure KOs and get general chip damage on opposing Pokemon. To facilitate setting them up, Spore is run to put an opposing Pokemon to sleep, crippling it for what often turns out to be the remainder of the match and making setup effortless. Dark Void is a viable alternative to put Grass-types, such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn, and Overcoat users, such as Mandibuzz, to sleep, but it has a chance to miss that makes it much less reliable in virtually every other scenario. Magic Coat is used to bounce back opposing entry hazards and Taunt.

Set Details
========

The EVs prioritize Speed so that Smeargle can outrun as many opponents as possible. From there, they serve to balance its defenses. A Focus Sash is necessary because even with the defensive investment, pretty much every attack is going to KO Smeargle in one hit, so it needs the guaranteed survival to get much of anything useful done.

Usage Tips
========

Smeargle is best utilized in the lead position to ensure an unbroken Focus Sash. The first move should be to put the foe to sleep and then to set up Sticky Web, followed by Stealth Rock. Magic Coat should be used to stop opposing entry hazard setup and Taunt as necessary.

Beware of setting up Sticky Web against teams with Bisharp. The Speed reduction is not of much consequence for it, and Defiant will gain it a +2 Attack boost, making it extremely difficult to handle.

Team Options
========

Pokemon such as Swords Dance Diggersby, Crawdaunt, and Mega Medicham love slower opponents so they can fire off their ridiculously high-powered attacks freely, thus enjoying Smeargle's support. Carrying a Bisharp can also be beneficial, as it turns Deoxys-D and Deoxys-S reflecting Sticky Web with Magic Coat into a beneficial scenario because of Defiant. Moreover, it discourages Defog and can take advantage of it, as a +2 Bisharp is extremely threatening. Pokemon such as Greninja and mixed Thundurus that put pressure on opposing Defog users also make good teammates to help prevent Smeargle's hard work from being undone.

Other Options
########

The best alternative option is a SmashPass set, which has the advantage of Spore over Gorebyss, granting it numerous setup opportunities that Gorebyss wouldn't have. An entry hazard-setting variant of Smeargle with Stealth Rock, Spikes, a sleeping move, and a filler was pretty usable last generation. However, the Defog buff has rendered this set rather poor in the generation shift. A gimmicky set with Trick Room / Spore / Endeavor / Dragon Rage can be annoying, putting a foe to sleep and bringing another down to 1 HP, then finishing it off with Dragon Rage. However, the rise of priority in XY has reduced the effectiveness of this set immensely. No other move is really worth running, as Smeargle has abysmal offensive and defensive stats that make it pretty useless outside of its limited niche.

Checks and Counters
########

**Non-Sucker Punch Priority Users**: If a foe has already been put to sleep after having brought Smeargle down to its sash, a priority user can finish it off. Think Mega Scizor, Azumarill, and Mega Pinsir. Sucker Punch users don't work because Smeargle doesn't attack, though.

**Damaging Weather**: Choice Scarf Tyranitar outruns Smeargle and prevents it from doing anything by bringing it down to its Focus Sash, at which point it is KOed by sandstorm.

**Magic Bounce**: Espeon and Mega Absol bounce back Spore, Dark Void, Sticky Web, and Stealth Rock, rendering Smeargle useless.

**Magic Coat**: Used by the likes of Deoxys-S and Deoxys-D, Magic Coat bounces back Spore, Dark Void, Sticky Web, and Stealth Rock in a similar fashion to Magic Bounce.
