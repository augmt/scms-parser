Overview
########

In a tier rife with Dragons of all shapes and sizes, Haxorus maintains several noteworthy traits over its dragon brethren. It retains the highest Attack stat of all non-legendary Dragon-types, surpassed only by Kyurem-B and Mega Garchomp, neither of which have access to Dragon Dance. Haxorus's pure Dragon typing, being oddly uncommon, makes it far less susceptible to non-STAB Ice attacks that are often carried for the likes of Dragonite and Garchomp. Furthermore, Haxorus's relatively rare ability, Mold Breaker, allows it to disregard Pokemon with otherwise problematic abilities like Levitate Rotom-W, Filter Mega Aggron, Unaware Clefable, numerous Sturdy users, and Multiscale Dragonite. However, Haxorus is not without its faults. Haxorus's overall lack of bulk means that it is easily 2HKOed by strong neutral hits and is potentially vulnerable while setting up. Fairy-types will also make you hesitate to use Outrage, meaning that it isn't just the ubiquitous Steel-types it needs to worry about anymore. While Haxorus has enough coverage options to handle most Steel- and Fairy-types, it can't cover everything and can find itself hard-walled without the right team support. Base 97 Speed is acceptable for wallbreaking and sufficient with enough boosts to clean up late-game with an unresisted Outrage. Haxorus has the right stats, ability, moves, and typing to perform its role very well.

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Taunt / Poison Jab
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Life Orb / Lum Berry
evs: 16 HP / 252 Atk / 240 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Dragon Dance is Haxorus's boosting move of choice, giving it the power and Speed he needs to rip through weakened walls and slower sweepers. Earthquake is great for handling Steel-types like Heatran and Klefki, and is also great for hitting Rotom-W. Taunt completely shuts down would-be walls like Skarmory that don't carry Brave Bird, helping Haxorus nab additional boosts. For wallbreaking or sweeping, Outrage will benefit Haxorus the most with its insane power, as Dragon Claw and Dual Chop severely lack power in general and prevent Haxorus from fulfilling its role.

Set Details
========

Dragon Dance is the better boosting move to let Haxorus compete with hyper-offensive teams, as the Speed boosts are crucial. Once Haxorus ideally gets to +2, simply use Outrage, assuming no Fairy-types remain, and never look back. 240 Speed EVs maintains an advantage over Jolly Dragonite and other max Speed base 80s as well as Jolly Gyarados, and max Speed Kyurem-B if you choose a Jolly nature. Life Orb gives Haxorus some extra oomph and compensates in situations where it can't get as many desired Dragon Dances in, helping it continue its rampage. Haxorus is still threatening without boosts against slow or weakened Pokemon like Heatran and Tyranitar with Earthquake, or Breloom with Poison Jab. Taunt often makes slow walls like Chansey and Skarmory switch out, giving Haxorus breathing room to boost.

Usage Tips
========

Haxorus requires safe opportunities to boost to overpower sturdy walls and bypass faster and frailer threats. Getting two Dragon Dances is your goal and is often enough to shift the odds in your favor against many would-be checks and counters. A weakened team with Steel- and Fairy-types eradicated simply cannot stand up to its mighty Outrage. Don't try to switch Haxorus into anything, and ideally remove priority users beforehand. A slow Volt Switch or U-turn is a reliable method of getting Haxorus in unscathed against favorable matchups. Rotom-W can be Taunted and often has to Volt Switch out as a result, which Haxorus fortunately resists. Heatran fears Earthquake, and Air Balloon versions can safely be Taunted and thus are unable to use Substitute, Will-O-Wisp, or Roar. Having Stealth Rock is generally helpful against priority users such as Talonflame and Dragonite. Zapdos carries no threatening moves and is easy to set up against, with Taunt as insurance. Ferrothorn that lack Gyro Ball are also pure setup and Taunt bait, and Earthquake doesn't activate Iron Barbs or incur Rocky Helmet damage.

Team Options
========

Most Steel-types protect Haxorus from all three of its weaknesses. Heatran's plethora of resistances and great bulk make it a reliable team player with Fire STAB for other Steel-types and the ability to lay Stealth Rock. Any U-turn or Volt Switch user can help get Haxorus in for free against an unwilling opponent, allowing for more boosting opportunities. Rotom-W is a popular choice that is easy to fit onto most teams and is a good answer for Talonflame, Scizor, Air Balloon Heatran, and Landorus-T, slows down faster enemies with Thunder Wave, and can scout with Volt Switch. Rotom-H similarly handles Talonflame but is also great against many Steel-types such as Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn, handily resisting their common moves and threatening to OHKO with Overheat. Being immune to burn as well as paralysis like Rotom-W is also beneficial. Landorus-T can prompt switches with Intimidate and can U-turn Haxorus in safely on top of setting up Stealth Rock. Klefki protects you from opposing Dragon-, Fairy-, and Ice-type attacks, has access to Prankster Thunder Wave, can set up dual screens for Haxorus to boost behind more safely.


Stallbreaker
########
name: Stallbreaker
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Outrage / Dual Chop
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Poison Jab / Taunt
ability: Mold Breaker
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb
evs: 16 HP / 252 Atk / 240 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance with Mold Breaker makes Haxorus an insane wallbreaker and the most potent Dragon-type capable of defeating Fairy-types. Outrage is for maddening power, but Dual Chop is better for handling Substitute and Focus Sash users, especially Substitute Kyurem-B. Earthquake hits the majority of Steel-types and +2 Poison Jab makes short work of even Unaware Clefable, Azumarill, Togekiss, and Sylveon.

Set Details
========

For pure wallbreaking purposes, Swords Dance gives Haxorus the power it needs to be one hell of an anti-stall Pokemon. Lum Berry is a great item to let Haxorus boost in the face of slower walls that would depend on a burn or Toxic to cripple it, and is recommended if Haxorus forgoes Taunt. Otherwise, use Life Orb to wallbreak better. However, Lum Berry does cure confusion caused by Outrage, so keep that in mind. 240 Speed EVs keeps Haxorus faster than max Speed neutral-natured Kyurem-B, which can be crucial without Dragon Dance to boost its Speed, and a Jolly nature guarantees it. Mold Breaker is by far Haxorus's best and most consistent ability, ignoring Sturdy, Multiscale, Magic Bounce, Unaware, and Levitate.

Usage Tips
========

As a pure stallbreaker set, Haxorus is forgoing Speed for power. Use a Lum Berry to setup in the face of would-be threats, and after it has taken out Steel- and Fairy-types with Earthquake and Poison Jab you are free to demolish with Outrage. Chansey can waste a turn trying to use Toxic if Haxorus has a Lum Berry, and a +2 Outrage is a guaranteed OHKO after Stealth Rock or with Life Orb and no Stealth Rock. Thundurus is OHKOed by Outrage no matter what, so don't attempt to use Swords Dance when it has priority Taunt and instead hope it wastes a turn using Thunder Wave or Nasty Plot.

Team Options
========

Stallbreaker Haxorus struggles against hyper-offensive teams, and as such wants naturally fast partners and priority users. Assault Vest Conkeldurr is great for sponging some special hits as well as status effects and has Mach Punch. Mega Aggron is also very bulky and has Thunder Wave and Dragon Tail to slow down or phaze the opponent. Bisharp threatens Fairy-types and Defog users with Defiant and has Sucker Punch. Azelf is a great dual screens user and can lay some entry hazards for easier KOes, as well as threaten fast and frail threats like Keldeo, Landorus, Thundurus, and Terrakion. Talonflame is one of the best priority users around, and Tailwind makes Haxorus immediately more threatening and better suited for fighting balance and heavy offense. Klefki has access to priority Thunder Wave and dual screens while resisting all of Haxorus's weaknesses. If you opt to have a Chansey for Wish, Aromatherapy, and Natural Cure support, you can rationalize forgoing Lum Berry for Life Orb. Choice Scarf Excadrill is a natural at handling fast threats and can spin the opponent's entry hazards away while preserving your own. Focus Sash Alakazam is also insanely fast and is able to revenge kill or eliminate fast sweepers with strong special attacks. Terrakion is also a fast teammate that doesn't particularly mind Talonflame's priority and even benefits from Sucker Punch, courtesy of Justified.

Other Options
########

Low Kick is Haxorus's best attack against Ferrothorn and can OHKO Mamoswine and Mega Gyarados at +1, as well as hitting Heatran that carry Air Balloon. Rock Slide is a fair choice on Choice Scarf sets, being able to hit many of the faster 4x weak Pokemon like Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona with the potential to flinch. Superpower with Swords Dance is the most efficient way to consistently deal with Skarmory, but offers little else. Dragon Claw is Haxorus's most conservative and reliable STAB move if you hate Outrage's lock-in and Dual Chop's accuracy, but it comes with a severe reduction in power. Aqua Tail provides good neutral coverage with Dragon-type attacks and can be particularly useful against Air Balloon Heatran and Excadrill, but leaves Haxorus walled by Azumarill and Ferrothorn.

Checks & Counters
#########

**Airborne Steel-types** Haxorus's most common sets are not tailored to handling airborne Steel-types. Without Taunt for Skarmory or Aqua Tail for Air Balloon Heatran and Excadrill, Haxorus will be hard-pressed to come out on top.

**Speedy Sweepers** Pokemon with immediate access to Speed and power like Keldeo and Landorus demolish stallbreaker sets, and even then certain Choice Scarf users like Garchomp and priority users can take advantage of Dragon Dance Haxorus, even after a boost. Requiring setup time to be effective puts Haxorus at an immediate disadvantage against most Pokemon that outspeed it.
