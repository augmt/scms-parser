Overview
########

Sylveon is a very well-rounded Pokemon in the OU metagame, and its godly Fairy typing opens up many opportunities for it to shine. Its Pixilate-boosted STAB Hyper Voice plows through anything that doesn't resist it. Sylveon's good base 110 Special Attack along with its many coverage options allow it to take on the threats it needs to. Sylveon also possesses an expansive support movepool and great special bulk, allowing it to aid its team by providing Heal Bell and Wish support and by tanking continuous hits. However, Sylveon is somewhat frail on the physical side with only base 65 Defense, which limits its tanking ability. It is also very slow, sitting at a mere base 60 Speed, so it is easily revenge killed. Most importantly, it faces competition as a bulky Fairy-type from Clefable, which also learns Heal Bell and Wish, boasts better stat-boosting moves and physical bulk, and has access to abilities such as Magic Guard and Unaware. Despite this, Sylveon still makes a viable choice as a Fairy-type in OU if used properly.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Hyper Voice
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Ground / Shadow Ball
move 4: Baton Pass
ability: Pixilate
item: Choice Specs
evs: 240 HP / 252 SpA / 16 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Hyper Voice is boosted by Pixilate and allows Sylveon to hit Pokemon behind Substitutes; it hits resists fairly well, 2HKOing Mega Scizor and even Metagross before it Mega Evolves. Psyshock hits the Poison-types that resist Hyper Voice, such as Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Tentacruel. You can use either Hidden Power depending on what your team struggles with the most; Hidden Power Fire is for eliminating Ferrothorn and Scizor, and Hidden Power Ground is for removing Heatran. Alternatively, Shadow Ball gives Sylveon a fighting chance against Mega Metagross, Jirachi, and Bronzong. Baton Pass is used to help Sylveon pivot around, as it baits in various Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon that its teammates can defeat.

Set Details
========

Full investment in HP and Special Attack maximizes Sylveon's bulk and power. 16 Speed EVs are necessary to outspeed uninvested Tyranitar. This set can also use a spread of 168 HP / 252 SpA / 88 Spe to outspeed and 2HKO Skarmory. If you want Sylveon to be faster, an EV spread of 68 HP / 252 SpA / 188 Spe will let it outspeed specially defensive Heatran, Knock Off Mandibuzz, and most variants of Mega Venusaur. Choice Specs maximize Sylveon's offensive capabilities, and Pixilate changes Hyper Voice to a Fairy-type move and boosts its power.

Usage Tips
========

Sylveon is slow, so don't stay in on faster threats like Latios and Garchomp unless it is close to full health. Even though this set is good for wallbreaking, the opponent can easily take advantage of Sylveon being locked into one move. Baton Pass and the coverage moves on this set are mainly for hitting predicted switches, so this set requires careful prediction to be used to its fullest potential.

Team Options
========

Fire-type attackers such as Mega Charizard X and Y can deal with the Steel-types that give this set trouble such as Bisharp and Magnezone. Ground-types such as Garchomp can use Earthquake to beat the Fire-types that resist Hyper Voice, most notably Heatran. A physical tank, such as Landorus-T, is able to sponge physical attacks which Sylveon cannot survive with its average Defense. Landorus-T also doubles as a check to Mega Metagross, which is required when using Sylveon. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Excadrill will bolster Sylveon's longevity, as it will be switching out often. It also has great offensive synergy with Mega Gallade and Bisharp because it is able to destroy Mega Sableye with Hyper Voice. Also, Sylveon can Baton Pass to Mega Gallade against a Poison- or Steel-type, or to Bisharp against Jirachi. A Psychic- or Flying-type, such as Latios or Talonflame, will deal with Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss.

Cleric
########
name: Cleric
move 1: Wish
move 2: Heal Bell / Toxic
move 3: Protect
move 4: Hyper Voice
ability: Pixilate
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 220 Def / 36 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Wish allows Sylveon to reliably heal itself and its teammates. Heal Bell is for removing status problems from its team. Alternatively, Toxic is a great move on any defensive Pokemon, putting a timer on opposing defensive Pokemon and setup sweepers. Protect is crucial in allowing Sylveon to reliably heal itself with Wish, provide a few extra HP of Leftovers recovery, and stall with Toxic if it is running it. Even though Sylveon's Special Attack is uninvested, a Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice will still do serious damage to several Pokemon and stops Sylveon from being complete Taunt bait.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment in HP allows Sylveon to pass the largest Wishes possible to its teammates and maximize its overall bulk. The 220 EVs in Defense allow Sylveon to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Latios's Psyshock, and 36 EVs are placed in Special Defense to avoid the 2HKO from Landorus's Earth Power. Leftovers provide passive healing, allowing Sylveon to remain on the battlefield even longer. Pixilate changes Hyper Voice to a Fairy-type move and greatly boosts its power.

Usage Tips
========

This set is all about tanking both physical and special hits. Make sure to Wish pass only if Sylveon is already healthy or is expendable at that point in the battle. Heal Bell's low 8 PP means you will not be outstalling users of status-inducing moves, especially because Sylveon will not run Toxic alongside it, so don't abuse it.

Team Options
========

This set works best on balanced teams that appreciate a cleric. Other defensive Pokemon that lack reliable HP recovery, such as Landorus-T, make for great Wish recipients. Setup sweepers that hate status problems, particularly Mega Gyarados and Mega Charizard X, appreciate Sylveon's Heal Bell support. As Sylveon struggles against Flying-type spam, Electric- or Steel-types make for good partners, such as Zapdos or Jirachi, respectively. A Pokemon that handles Steel-types well, such as Keldeo, covers one of Sylveon's major weaknesses. A Psychic- or Flying-type, such as Latios or Talonflame, can defeat Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss.

It is important to note that Clefable is typically a better choice than Sylveon. It has better abilities, higher physical bulk, similar support options, and greater versatility between Stealth Rock, coverage options, Thunder Wave, and sweeping capability with Calm Mind. Sylveon should only be chosen when the special bulk is an absolute necessity.

Calm Mind + Baton Pass
########
name: Calm Mind + Baton Pass
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Substitute / Wish
move 4: Hyper Voice
ability: Pixilate
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Calm Mind boosts Sylveon's Special Attack and Special Defense to high levels. Baton Pass lets Sylveon give a Calm Mind boost or two to one of its teammates, in addition to letting it pivot around. Substitute allows Sylveon to pass shields against status moves and weaker attacks to its teammates. Alternatively, Wish allows Sylveon to provide them with recovery instead. Hyper Voice prevents this set from being Taunt bait and it hits hard when boosted by Calm Mind.

Set Details
========

Full investment in HP and Defense maximizes Sylveon's physical bulk, with 16 Speed EVs that are necessary to outspeed uninvested Tyranitar. Leftovers provide Sylveon with passive healing to promote its longevity. Pixilate changes Hyper Voice to a Fairy-type move and greatly boosts its power, allowing Sylveon to take advantage of the Calm Mind boosts it accumulates.

Usage Tips
========

Try to set up a Calm Mind either on a defensive or a slow offensive Pokemon that does not threaten Sylveon, such as Chansey or Tyranitar, respectively. Use Baton Pass before Sylveon takes too much damage. If the opponent packs a threat to Sylveon, particularly Bisharp or Excadrill, prediction is the key to using Baton Pass. You should use it on the predicted switch to keep up momentum. If running Wish, use it when Sylveon's health is low, or when you want to Baton Pass to a weakened teammate. If running Substitute, use it against slower users of status moves, then proceed to safely set up Calm Mind as the opponent tries to break the Substitute.

Team Options
========

This set works best on bulky offense teams that do not rely on constant momentum. Almost any fast and reasonably bulky special attacker appreciates the boosts to their Special Attack and Special Defense. This set has trouble against Steel-types such as Excadrill, Scizor, and Mega Metagross, so a Fire-type such Mega Charizard Y can deal with them. Mega Charizard Y doubles as a great Baton Pass recipient due to its strong Special Attack and decent bulk, and it appreciates the Wish support this set provides due to its double weakness to Stealth Rock.

Other Options
########

Calm Mind along with 3 attacks, or Calm Mind with 2 attacks and Substitute, allow Sylveon to deal with threats that its usual Calm Mind set lures in, such as Mega Scizor. However, this set makes Sylveon a standalone Pokemon, and it should be the one giving support as opposed to receiving it, so Baton Pass combined with Calm Mind is generally superior.

Checks & Counters
########

**Poison-types**: Poison-types such as Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Gengar can switch into a Hyper Voice and threaten Sylveon back with a STAB attack. However, all Poison-types must be careful of Psyshock.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Scizor, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Jirachi can tank Sylveon's Hyper Voice and hit it back with a physical STAB move. Heatran deserves a special mention because it is 4x resistant to Hyper Voice. Nonetheless, most Steel-types are vulnerable to Hidden Power Ground, while Scizor, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn must watch out for Hidden Power Fire.

**Physical Attackers**: Very strong physical attackers such as Mega Charizard X, Azumarill, Diggersby, and Mega Pinsir can severely damage even physically defensive variants of Sylveon.

**Phazing**: Users of Whirlwind and Roar, particularly Skarmory and Heatran, can disrupt Sylveon from trying to heal itself with Wish, as phazing moves bypass Protect.

**Taunt Users**: A fast Taunt from a Pokemon that resists Hyper Voice such as Gengar or Heatran shuts down Sylveon's cleric and Baton Pass sets.
