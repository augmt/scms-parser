Overview
########

Skarmory is an exemplary Defog user and physical wall. With a stellar base 140 Defense and Steel / Flying typing to back it up, Skarmory is guaranteed to find opportunities to get rid of entry hazards against nearly any team. Whirlwind, Taunt, Brave Bird, and Counter allow it to take on a multitude of defensive and damaging roles. Thanks to its typing, stats, and the recovery afforded by Roost, Skarmory can reliably check many prominent physical attackers, such as Gallade, Lopunny, and Mega Pinsir.

However, Skarmory has several shortcomings. It possesses relatively low HP and Special Defense, meaning that it is unable to stand up to most special attackers without a significant amount of Special Defense investment. The entry hazards it can lay with ease have less of an impact due to Defog. In addition, Skarmory requires a moderate degree of team support to cover its weaknesses to popular Fire- and Electric-type moves. Although Skarmory has an amazing support movepool, it has a serious case of four-moveslot syndrome. This, combined with the threat of extremely powerful physical attackers such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Metagross, makes Skarmory easy for the opponent to overwhelm despite its physical walling capabilities. As a defensive Defogger, Skarmory faces intense competition from Mandibuzz's higher overall defenses and valuable resistance to Ghost- and Dark-type moves.

Moves
========

Roost, the most important move Skarmory carries, allows it to stay healthy throughout the match and continuously switch in against physical attackers to either wall them or use Defog. However, if your team already has a means of entry hazard removal, Spikes can be used in the second slot so Skarmory can support its team with entry hazards. Spikes can also be used in Skarmory's last two moveslots, but is counterproductive when used alongside Defog and may put too much pressure on Skarmory to fill multiple roles. Brave Bird is Skarmory's most reliable way of checking attackers weak to Flying-type moves, such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Gallade. Counter is a viable option over Brave Bird to fare better against some setup sweepers such as Bisharp and Mega Scizor and, in conjunction with Sturdy and Taunt, can stop a lot of physical attackers. However, Counter relies too heavily on Sturdy and can allow Skarmory's foes to inflict extremely high amounts of damage. Additionally, due to Skarmory's low Speed, its foe can set up or attack before Skarmory is able to Taunt it. Counter also renders Skarmory completely helpless against any Pokemon that doesn't carry a physical attack and setup sweepers carrying Taunt. When using Counter, a Bold nature should be used, as it lessens the damage taken from Foul Play and confusion. The moves in the final slot deter Pokemon that try to set up on Skarmory. Whirlwind prevents Pokemon such as Swords Dance Bisharp and Dragon Dance Gyarados from sweeping by phazing them out and racks up entry hazard damage on the opponent. On the other hand, Taunt is more effective against defensive Pokemon that could easily lay entry hazards against Skarmory, such as Ferrothorn. If Stealth Rock doesn't fit anywhere else on the team, Skarmory can use it, but it is usually better off supporting its team with Defog or the more exclusive Spikes.

Set Details
========

Skarmory runs full HP and Defense EVs to maximize physical bulk, its most valuable statistical trait. An Impish nature should be used to maximize Skarmory's Defense without reducing its Speed or the power of Brave Bird. Leftovers offers Skarmory longevity, while Rocky Helmet can inflict damage on users of contact moves such as Metagross, Pinsir, Bisharp, Rapid Spinners, and U-turn users. Rocky Helmet can prevent Rapid Spin from removing entry hazards if the damage it inflicts causes the Rapid Spinner to faint. Skarmory can use Shed Shell to prevent itself from being trapped by Pokemon such as Magnezone and Gothitelle. However, since both of these Pokemon are relatively uncommon, it is more optimal to use Leftovers or Rocky Helmet. Shed Shell is most viable on hard stall teams, where each member of the defensive backbone is extremely significant to the team's success, and allows the user to play more safely.

A specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to turn Skarmory into a capable mixed wall. The investment allows Skarmory to act as a wall or use Roost to stall a variety of Pokemon, including Hidden Power Fire Latios and Latias, Gengar, Mega Diancie, Mega Gardevoir, Scarf Keldeo, and Landorus, as well as Pokemon that rely on non-STAB Fire Blast for coverage, such as Garchomp and Tyranitar. When using the specially defensive spread, Leftovers is imperative on Skarmory to help it avoid the 2HKO from various attacks, such as Latios's Hidden Power Fire. Brave Bird or Iron Head is also mandatory to allow Skarmory to damage the special attackers it can wall.

Usage Tips
========

Skarmory's main role is often to remove entry hazards, so it should generally be kept very healthy until either the opponent's entry hazard setter is gone or a last-ditch effort is required to remove entry hazards for an important play. It is a good idea to keep Skarmory healthy if the opponent has a physical sweeper that can be stopped by its Whirlwind or Counter, such as Dragon Dance Mega Altaria or Mega Pinsir. Despite Skarmory's array of resistances, its easily-exploited weaknesses to Fire- and Electric-type moves means it must be wary of switching into many attackers, even those that must use coverage moves to inflict super effective damage, such as Garchomp's Fire Blast and Latios's Thunderbolt. If keeping Skarmory alive is crucial, it is a good idea to scout for these moves by double-switching. However, these coverage moves are less effective against Skarmory with Special Defense investment, as it usually has the bulk to scout them by using Roost instead.

Team Options
========

Skarmory typically functions best either on more defensive teams or as part of a defensive core, as both provide defensive teammates that patch up its weak points. Chansey works particularly well with Skarmory, as their respective defensive stats function well together against almost any attacker that is not using a mixed set. Specially defensive Heatran also works well, as it can stop many of the Fire-type attackers that try to break through Skarmory. Hippowdon can work well with specially defensive Skarmory, soaking up physical hits while also stopping offensive Volt Switch users such as Manectric or Raikou hoping to gain momentum by forcing Skarmory out. In return, Skarmory can check Pokemon that threaten Hippowdon, such as Latios, Breloom, Serperior, and Celebi.


Other Options
########

Iron Head, a niche attack, can be used over Brave Bird to hit Pokemon such as Diancie, Gardevoir, and Tyranitar super effectively. Skarmory is also able to use the recoil-free Drill Peck over Brave Bird, although the loss in power is noticeable and Skarmory is not usually hampered by the Brave Bird recoil.

Skarmory has all the tools necessary to use a Custap Berry in the lead position, having access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Taunt to shut down slower Taunters or entry hazard users. Skarmory can use the Custap Berry to either set up another layer of entry hazards, or use Brave Bird to KO itself, preventing the foe from using Defog or Rapid Spin and giving the Skarmory user a free switch into something that threatens the Defog or Rapid Spin user. However, due to the prevalence of Magic Bounce Pokemon such as Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie, and the ease at which opposing defensive teams can Defog away entry hazards, this set is an inconsistent and niche option and mainly shines against offensive teams.


Checks & Counters
########

**Special Attacks**: Strong special attackers, such as Mega Charizard Y and Thundurus, can easily bring down any Skarmory set. Electric-types can simultaneously force Skarmory out and gain momentum by using Volt Switch, making it almost imperative that Skarmory gets paired with a bulky Ground-type. In addition, many physical attackers with fairly high Special Attack stats can carry Fire Blast specifically for luring in and hitting Skarmory for massive damage.

**Taunt**: Skarmory has trouble getting past Pokemon with Taunt, as they prevent it from healing, phazing, and removing and setting up entry hazards. Setup sweepers that possess Taunt, such as bulky Gyarados, are especially dangerous, particularly if Skarmory is the team's primary method of dealing with them.

**Trapping Abilities**: Magnezone, Gothitelle, and Wobbuffet are particularly troublesome to Skarmory. Gothitelle and Magnezone are capable of easily KOing Skarmory with their powerful special attacks. Wobbuffet, while extremely uncommon, can easily lock Taunt-less Skarmory into a useless move and provide its teammates with a valuable setup opportunity.
