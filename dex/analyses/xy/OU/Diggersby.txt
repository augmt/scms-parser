Overview
########

Although Diggersby might not look impressive with its generally low stats, its great ability Huge Power doubles its Attack stat, making it an excellent wallbreaker. Immunities to Ghost- and Electric-type attacks give it opportunities to set up and an immunity to Thunder Wave. Access to great boosting moves in Swords Dance and Agility and surprisingly great STAB coverage backed up by the elemental punches and Knock Off make Diggersby a fearsome Pokemon that all teams should prepare for. However, Diggersby is not without flaws; weaknesses to common Grass-, Ice-, and Fighting-type moves make it somewhat hard for Diggersby to effectively sweep. Lackluster Speed and bad bulk also hold Diggersby back, as it is easily revenge killed by anything that can survive a Quick Attack. Fast Pokemon such as Mega Metagross make this flaw noticeable. Diggersby's weaknesses to common priority moves such as Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, and Ice Shard are also annoying for it.

Physical Attacker
########
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Return
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Quick Attack
move 4: Swords Dance / Fire Punch
ability: Huge Power
item: Life Orb / Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Return is Diggersby's primary STAB move, boasting incredible breaking power and excellent neutral coverage. Earthquake is Diggersby's other STAB move, hitting most Pokemon that resist Return hard, particularly grounded Steel-types. Quick Attack is a rather strong priority attack that makes Diggersby a legitimate threat against offensive teams. Swords Dance boosts Diggersby's Attack stat to insane levels, allowing it to 2HKO Skarmory with Life Orb-boosted Return and making Quick Attack a potent cleaning tool. However, Skarmory often carries Counter, so Fire Punch is a useful option to 2HKO it on the switch; it also OHKOes Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, which otherwise beat Diggersby 1v1.

Set Details
========

Full Attack and Speed investment maximize Diggersby's offensive capabilities. Life Orb is the preferred item to hit even harder while still being able to switch moves, but a Focus Sash can prevent Diggersby from being revenge killed or help it set up against offensive teams. It also makes Diggersby a pretty effective lead that can do a lot of damage right off the bat and potentially get some surprise KOs. An Adamant nature is preferred to do as much damage as possible and thus maximize Diggersby's wallbreaking potential. A Jolly nature can, however, be used to improve Diggersby's matchup against offensive teams by making it capable of outspeeding Breloom, Jolly Bisharp, Adamant Excadrill, most Mew variants, Timid Heatran, Adamant Dragonite, Adamant Gyarados, and Jolly Mega Tyranitar, among others. Note that both Jolly and Focus Sash are generally poor options if not running Swords Dance, as Diggersby needs all the raw power it can get without the potential to boost.

Usage Tips
========

This set works best early- or mid-game to weaken or just defeat walls for teammates to sweep later. Do not set up on anything offensive except for Choice-locked Electric- or Ghost-types, because with Diggersby's bulk it simply won't work, unless it has a Focus Sash. It is, however, easy to set up on passive Pokemon such as Chansey. A +2 Return 2HKOes Skarmory after Stealth Rock damage, and a +2 Quick Attack can OHKO or come close to OHKOing a lot of offensive Pokemon, including Mega Sceptile, Mega Gallade, Thundurus, and Tornadus-T. Even without a Swords Dance boost, a Life Orb-boosted Quick Attack can revenge kill less bulky Pokemon.

Team Options
========

Skarmory is Swords Dance Diggersby's best check on defensive teams, so Magnezone is a great teammate to remove it. Mega Pinsir and Diggersby weaken each other's counters and checks, and together with Magnezone they form a great core. If using this core, teammates with Knock Off are necessary because Skarmory always has a Shed Shell to escape from Magnezone. Examples of these would be Azumarill, Bisharp, Mamoswine, and Scizor. Pokemon that can switch into Mach Punch, Aqua Jet, and Ice Shard users such as Breloom, Crawdaunt, and Mamoswine are good teammates. Examples of these are Azumarill, Mega Venusaur, and Keldeo. While not necessary, Pursuit support from Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Weavile is useful to remove Gengar, which hard counters this set. Healing Wish support is amazing, as it lets Diggersby get a second attempt at sweeping. With it, Diggersby can wallbreak for itself early-game, and then clean up late-game. Latias is easily the best user of Healing Wish.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Return
move 3: Knock Off / Wild Charge
move 4: U-turn
ability: Huge Power
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Earthquake is Diggersby's primary STAB move and the move it should be using the most outside of U-turn. Return is a secondary STAB move that hits a lot of Pokemon that are immune or resistant to Earthquake, and it is one of the reasons to use Choice Scarf Diggersby over Choice Scarf Landorus-T, the other reason being access to Wild Charge to hit Skarmory with. Knock Off hits Gengar, which is immune to both of Diggersby's STAB moves, as well as the occasional Bronzong, and is a generally good utility move with which to remove items, most notably Shed Shell from Skarmory. Wild Charge removes the need to Knock Off Skarmory's Shed Shell, as Diggersby has a good chance of 2HKOing Skarmory on the switch with Stealth Rock up. U-turn is mandatory to take advantage of any switches Diggersby causes to gain momentum. It also OHKOes Celebi, which can survive a Return.

Set Details
========

252 Attack EVs maximize Diggersby's damage output. 252 Speed EVs let Diggersby outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame with a Choice Scarf, with the few relevant exceptions being Mega Alakazam, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Sceptile. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, and some slower Choice Scarf users such as Magnezone and Tyranitar; due to the high viability of Mega Lopunny in this metagame, Adamant isn't really an option. A Choice Scarf is the chosen item for this set, as it makes Diggersby capable of outspeeding and surprising many common offensive threats.

Usage Tips
========

Diggersby does not like being locked into either one of its STAB moves, so predict well and use U-turn a lot to prevent it from becoming setup fodder for a foe such as Mega Sableye or Landorus and to wear down Diggersby's checks and counters so it can clean up late-game with its powerful moves. With a Choice Scarf, Diggersby can be a decent revenge killer, but it is not exactly the best choice for this role, because its Speed is still not high enough to revenge kill Speed-boosting sweepers such as Gyarados and Mega Altaria, and it is defeated by strong priority attacks from Pokemon such as Azumarill and Dragonite.

Team Options
========

If using Wild Charge, this set baits Skarmory pretty well, so Pokemon that appreciate it being weakened or removed, such as Excadrill, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Metagross, are good teammates. Other Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Raikou and Talonflame can form a VoltTurn core with Diggersby and keep the momentum on your side. Entry hazard setters such as Heatran, Mamoswine, and Ferrothorn force foes to take hazard damage every time they switch in, making them easier to wear down for Diggersby to clean up late-game. As Choice Scarf Diggersby fails to revenge kill Speed-boosting sweepers, Pokemon such as Thundurus and Talonflame are good partners to revenge kill them instead. Powerful wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B, Mega Heracross, and Mega Pinsir can help soften up the opposing team for Diggersby to clean up. Magnezone is an obvious teammate that can remove Skarmory, one of Diggersby's best checks, once Skarmory's Shed Shell has been Knocked Off.

Other Options
########

A double dance set with Agility, Swords Dance, Earthquake, and Return could be used, but although Diggersby has good STAB coverage to make it work, it lacks the bulk to effectively pull it off without dual screens support. A Choice Band set could be used with the same moves as the Choice Scarf set, but it's mostly outclassed as a wallbreaker by the Swords Dance set. Diggersby can use an offensive Spikes set that takes advantage of the switches it forces to lay down Spikes and wear the opponent down. Ice Punch can be used to lure in and OHKO offensive variants of Landorus-T, while defensive variants come very close to getting OHKOed. However, variants with no HP or Defense investment already get 2HKOed by Return anyway, which is why Ice Punch is not a preferred option. Substitute is a useful move to protect Diggersby from status and could be used over Swords Dance, Fire Punch, or Knock Off. Jolly Diggersby can easily set up a Substitute on Pokemon such as Mega Sableye, Ferrothorn, and Mew, but the move requires it to hold Leftovers for longevity, limiting Diggersby's offensive capabilities.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ghost-types**: As it is immune to Diggersby's STAB moves, Gengar can freely switch in against the Swords Dance set and do whatever it wants. It also puts a lot of pressure on the Choice Scarf set because Gengar gets free switches against Diggersby's STAB moves. Mega Sableye cannot safely switch in against Diggersby, but if it has not yet Mega Evolved, it can burn Diggersby with a priority Will-O-Wisp and proceed to stall it out.

**Strong Priority Attacks**: Because of Diggersby's lackluster bulk, it struggles to survive strong priority attacks such as Crawdaunt and Azumarill's Aqua Jet, Mamoswine and Weavile's Ice Shard, Breloom and Conkeldurr's Mach Punch, and Talonflame's Gale Wings Brave Bird.

**Faster Pokemon**: Fast Pokemon that resist Quick Attack, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Heatran, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, can take a +2 Quick Attack pretty well and KO Diggersby rather easily in return. It should be noted that Diggersby's Choice Scarf set actually outspeeds the latter two and takes care of them very easily with a STAB Earthquake.

**Defensive Pokemon**: Although Diggersby breaks through a lot of walls, there are some defensive Pokemon Diggersby struggles with. Base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Mew and Celebi can outspeed Diggersby and burn it or use Giga Drain, respectively. Landorus-T can switch into the all-out attacker and Choice Scarf sets and do huge damage back. Landorus-T is, however, not hard to wear down due to its lack of reliable recovery. Skarmory resists both of Diggersby's STAB moves, but it needs Counter to actually defeat it. Skarmory also fails to wall Fire Punch variants and can be trapped by Magnezone if its Shed Shell has been taken away. Physically defensive Mega Slowbro and Alomomola can also come in for free and can threaten Diggersby with Scald, though Alomomola cannot come in safely against Swords Dance Diggersby.
