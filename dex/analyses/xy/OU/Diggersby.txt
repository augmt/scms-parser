Overview
########

Unlike all of the other early-game rodents before it, Diggersby is quite capable of holding its own in the competitive scene. Contrary to what its base stats and appearance would suggest, Diggersby is one of the most powerful Pokemon in the OU metagame. With Swords Dance, Diggersby makes for a great sweeper that demolishes stall and offensive Pokemon, thanks to its good neutral coverage and powerful STAB Quick Attack. It can also run an effective Choice Scarf set, which allows it to act as a great cleaner against offensive teams. However, Diggersby has its fair share of flaws. Its mediocre Speed and bulk make it difficult to set up against offensive teams, and its reliance on Quick Attack makes it quite susceptible to opposing priority. However, despite these flaws, Diggersby is still an offensive juggernaut that is easily capable of plowing through teams with little support.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Return
move 4: Quick Attack
ability: Huge Power
item: Focus Sash / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Swords Dance boosts Diggersby's Attack to insane levels and gives it the capability to sweep teams. Earthquake and Return are Diggersby's obligatory STAB moves. Quick Attack is incredibly powerful at +2 and lets Diggersby sweep weakened offensive teams and single threats with ease.

Set Details
========

Maximum EVs are invested in Attack and Speed so Diggersby can hit as hard and fast as possible. Adamant is the preferred nature to get the 2HKO on Skarmory after Stealth Rock damage and to hit harder in general, but Jolly can be used if you wish to outspeed Jolly Breloom, most Mega Charizard X, Mega Tyranitar, Mega Gyarados, and Adamant Excadrill. Both Life Orb and Focus Sash are viable item choices on this set. While Life Orb gives Diggersby a much easier time breaking through stall, Focus Sash is useful against offensive teams, as finding time to set up against such teams can be difficult.

Usage Tips
========

The general strategy should be to come in on something Diggersby forces out, such as Heatran or Chansey, and set up a Swords Dance. Diggersby should generally set up either early- to mid-game to open holes for another sweeper or later after the opposing team has been sufficiently weakened to sweep for itself. Even if Diggersby doesn't get a chance to set up, it is still quite useful because Quick Attack is strong enough to revenge kill a variety of weakened threats. If Team Preview shows that the opposing team has a Gengar or other important checks, it is best to withhold from sweeping until said checks are eliminated.

Team Options
========

Pursuit users such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar or Bisharp make good teammates as they can trap and remove Gengar. Sweepers that benefit from walls being weakened or removed, such as Mega Pinsir, pair well with Diggersby as they can wear down each other's checks so that one of them can sweep. Healing Wish Latias lets Diggersby have a second chance at sweeping if it has been weakened. It is especially useful as a teammate to Focus Sash variants of Diggersby. Dual screen leads such as Azelf work well with Diggersby because they can give it an easier time setting up.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Return
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Wild Charge
move 4: U-turn
ability: Huge Power
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Return and Earthquake have great neutral coverage together, despite being resisted by several common types in OU. Diggersby's STAB combination is only resisted by two Pokemon in OU: Skarmory and Gengar. Wild Charge is used because it 2HKOes both of these Pokemon. U-turn is useful for wearing down the opposing team and gaining momentum.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread lets Diggersby hit as hard and fast as possible. Adamant is the preferred nature because the extra Speed given by a Jolly nature does not let Diggersby outspeed anything important besides opposing Adamant Dragonite and Gyarados. 

Usage Tips
========

Choice Scarf Diggersby makes a great cleaner against offensive teams thanks to its high Speed and power. With this set, it is generally best to wear things down with U-turn early-game and then clean late-game with Diggersby's strong STAB moves. This set also works as a decent revenge killer, though it isn't overly effective in this role because it isn't fast enough to outspeed most boosted threats and easily falls to strong priority from sweepers such as Dragonite and Azumarill.

Team Options
========

As this set lacks power compared to the Swords Dance set, powerful wallbreakers such as Terrakion and Kyurem-B make good partners to Choice Scarf Diggersby, as they give it an easier time cleaning. Diggersby is too slow to revenge kill sweepers that boost their Speed, so Pokemon that stop setup sweepers, such as Thunder Wave Thundurus and Choice Band Talonflame, are useful teammates.

Other Options
########

Choice Band is a decent item on Diggersby; however, overreliance on locking itself into Quick Attack and a general lack of utility compared to Diggersby's other sets make it a subpar option. Diggersby is a decent user of Spikes thanks to its superb ability to force switches. An Agility set is usable, but Diggersby isn't really powerful enough to sweep through teams without an Attack boost. In addition, a +2 Quick Attack is powerful enough to beat most would-be offensive checks anyway.

Checks & Counters
########

**Skarmory**: Despite the fact that it is 2HKOed by +2 Life Orb Return and Choice Scarf Wild Charge after Stealth Rock, Skarmory is the best defensive answer to Diggersby because it can switch into Swords Dance Diggersby, take a boosted hit, and phaze it out.

**Gengar**: Gengar is immune to Diggersby's STAB moves, so it is naturally a good check to it. Gengar can also cripple Diggersby with Will-O-Wisp or hit it hard with Focus Blast, but it is 2HKOed by Wild Charge, so it cannot beat all Diggersby variants.

**Faster Attackers**: The OU metagame is filled to the brim with strong and faster Pokemon, several of which can revenge kill even a boosted Diggersby. Choice Band Talonflame, Breloom, and Mega Pinsir are all good checks to Diggersby thanks to their strong priority moves. As far as the Swords Dance set is concerned, there are several threats that can tank or are resistant to a boosted Quick Attack; these include Garchomp, Terrakion, Aerodactyl, Excadrill, and Lucario.

**Gourgeist-S**: While it is almost never seen in OU, Gourgeist-S is a great answer to Diggersby. It resists Diggersby's STAB combination, has good physical bulk, and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp.
