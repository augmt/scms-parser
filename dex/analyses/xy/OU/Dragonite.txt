Overview
########

Dragonite's stats, movepool, and ability make it a big threat in OU. Dragonite's great overall stats, most notably its base 134 Attack stat, allow it to wallbreak and majorly dent teams. Dragonite also has access to Dragon Dance, and it is one of the best users of the move in the entire tier. Dragonite's wide movepool provides it with many coverage options, ranging from the elemental punches to Superpower, as well as Outrage for a powerful STAB move. A move that stands out, however, is Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed's +2 priority allows Dragonite to revenge kill prominent sweepers in the tier as well as outprioritize priority users such as Talonflame. Dragonite's ability, Multiscale, is also one of its selling points. Multiscale halves the damage Dragonite takes at full health, allowing it to safely set up Dragon Dance or revenge kill Pokemon that would otherwise OHKO it, such as Latios and Latias.

However, Dragonite does have multiple flaws. Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Azumarill make it harder to use Outrage throughout the match, as they can easily switch into and OHKO Dragonite with their STAB moves. Dragonite's over-reliance on Multiscale sometimes can make it difficult to set up or hit safely, as Multiscale can easily be broken through various methods such as weather damage and Rocky Helmet. Dragonite's weakness to Stealth Rock is also pretty major, as it breaks Multiscale and slices off a quarter of Dragonite's health. Dragonite's mediocre Speed also makes non-Dragon Dance sets harder to use, as an unboosted Dragonite will usually be outsped by threats such as Thundurus and Garchomp. Dragonite also lacks a reliable physical Flying-type STAB move outside of the weak Aerial Ace.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Outrage
move 2: Extreme Speed
move 3: Thunder Punch
move 4: Superpower
ability: Multiscale
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

Moves
========

A Choice Band-boosted STAB Outrage is insanely strong and will usually OHKO anything that doesn't resist it. Dragon Claw is an option over Outrage for more consistency and to stop the risk of opposing Fairy-types switching in. However, the power drop is very noticeable, as most OHKOs that Dragonite can achieve with Outrage will turn into 2HKOs. Extreme Speed is a +2 priority attack that provides the priceless utility of not only killing off weakened sweepers that have set up but also revenge killing priority users such as Talonflame. Thunder Punch is a coverage move that hits targets Dragonite would otherwise have trouble hitting, such as Azumarill and Skarmory. Superpower is used to hit Steel- and Dark-type targets such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Bisharp, and Tyranitar. Earthquake can be used over Superpower if the stat drops are a problem. Fire Punch is an option to hit Mega Scizor harder, though frailer opponents will usually be hit harder by Outrage.

Set Details
========

252 Attack EVs maximize Dragonite's offensive potential, allowing it to hit extremely hard. 252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature maximize Dragonite's Speed and allow it to outspeed neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon and Jolly Mega Heracross. An Adamant nature, however, is typically preferred to increase Dragonite's damage output, which is especially relevant when revenge killing foes with Extreme Speed. A Choice Band is the item of choice to considerably increase Dragonite's damage output. Multiscale is to ensure that Dragonite can safely get off a hit without risking being KOed.

Usage Tips
========

Dragonite should abuse its power to wallbreak early-game and weaken opposing Pokemon to the point where sweepers on your team can easily finish them off. However, mid- or late-game, Dragonite best uses this set to do damage and switch out as a hit-and-run attacker. Dragonite can also act as a revenge killer by using Extreme Speed to finish off weakened opponents. This variant of Dragonite should usually switch out when there is an opposing check sent in, as Dragonite will retain its power, unlike Dragon Dance Dragonite. Preserving Multiscale should still be kept in mind, but it does not tends to be as much of a priority as it is for other Dragonite sets. Due to the fact that Outrage locks Dragonite in for two to three turns, it should only be used late-game to clean up opponents, as using it early-game makes Dragonite a setup fodder.

Team Options
========

This Dragonite tends to switch out very often, and Stealth Rock breaks Multiscale as well as taking a quarter of Dragonite's health away, so Rapid Spin and Defog support is needed. Excadrill has great defensive synergy with Dragonite, making it a good choice for a Rapid Spinner. Latios and Latias provide great Defog support, as they are quick and can also weaken opposing threats. Latias not only provides Defog support but also can use Healing Wish to allow Dragonite to recover health. Magnezone is a great partner as it forms a DragMag core with Dragonite, punishes Fairy-types, and has amazing defensive synergy. Bisharp is also a good partner, as it can also punish Fairy-types with Iron Head and Pursuit trap Latios and Latias. Entry hazard support from Mamoswine or Tyranitar is also great, as it weakens the opponent and increases the chance of Dragonite scoring a KO. Sweepers that can make great use of Dragonite's wallbreaking skills are extremely great partners. Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Gyarados appreciate having bulkier Pokemon such as Azumarill and Landorus-T weakened. Clefable checks Greninja, absorbs Will-O-Wisp, and can provide Wish support as well as set up Stealth Rock.

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Extreme Speed
move 4: Fire Punch / Earthquake
ability: Multiscale
item: Lum Berry
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

Moves
========

Dragon Dance is the main move on the set, boosting Dragonite's Attack and Speed and setting it up for a sweep. Outrage is a STAB attack that will usually OHKO most opposing Pokemon that don't resist it after a Dragon Dance. Extreme Speed is a +2 priority move that is used to outprioritize other priority users, most notably Talonflame. It also Choice Scarf users that would otherwise revenge kill Dragonite. Fire Punch hits Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Air Balloon Excadrill. Earthquake, on the other hand, can be used to OHKO Heatran, Manectric, and Magnezone. Dragonite has quite a few other options that it can use on this set. Thunder Punch can be used to hit Azumarill and Togekiss harder than a neutral Fire Punch. Roost can be used to fix a broken Multiscale, but Dragonite loses important coverage, which is usually more of a downside. Dragon Claw can be used over Outrage for more consistency and to avoid the risk of a Fairy-type switching in and walling Dragonite for a few turns, but the power drop is very noticeable.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature allows Dragonite to hit extremely hard. Maximum Speed investment is necessary to outspeed Pokemon such as Latias, Latios, and Greninja when Dragonite is at +1. Lum Berry is the best item for Dragonite, as it prevents Dragonite from being crippled from status users such as Thundurus and Sableye as well as curing the confusion from Outrage. Lum Berry is used over a Life Orb because the recoil from Life Orb breaks Multiscale. Multiscale allows Dragonite to set up Dragon Dance more easily.

Usage Tips
========

Dragonite should be used as a cleaner or as a mid- or late-game sweeper, when Dragonite's checks and counters are weakened or gone. Setting up early-game tends to be bad because priority can easily wear Dragonite down and bulkier Pokemon can easily Toxic stall Dragonite until it is susceptible enough to priority. Dragonite should never be sent in when Stealth Rock is up, as it breaks Multiscale and takes a decent portion of Dragonite's health away. Dragonite can easily set up on Pokemon that rely on status, such as Chansey, as Lum Berry will easily remedy any status. That being said, Dragonite should stay away from Knock Off users, as Lum Berry is very important to ensure that Dragonite can safely set up. Multiscale should not be relied on to tank Ice-type attacks, as almost any strong Ice-type attack will easily OHKO Dragonite, even with Multiscale.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard removal support is vital so that Dragonite performs effectively. Excadrill stands out for this role as it has amazing defensive synergy with Dragonite and can easily take care of Fairy-types as well as spin away hazards. Latias can use Defog to get rid of hazards and provides Healing Wish support as well. Magnezone forms the DragMag core and gets rid of opposing Fairy- and Ice-types. Magnezone can also lure in Ground-type moves that Dragonite is immune to, and Magnezone can keep up momentum by using Volt Switch. Wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B and Mega Charizard Y can weaken opponents so that Dragonite can clean more easily. As a bonus, Mega Charizard Y sets sun, negating Tyranitar's and Hippowdown's sand. Dual screens support makes setting up easier. Klefki in particular has dual screens as well as Spikes and Prankster. Clefable can check Greninja, negate Will-O-Wisp with Magic Guard, and provide Wish support, as well as set up Stealth Rock.

Bulky Roost
########
name: Bulky Roost
move 1: Roost
move 2: Dragon Claw
move 3: Extreme Speed
move 4: Fire Punch / Superpower
ability: Multiscale
item: Leftovers
nature: Adamant
evs: 216 HP / 64 Atk / 228 SpD

Moves
========

Dragonite's great defensive stats allow it to pull off a bulkier set that sponges hits better while still dealing decent damage. Roost allows Dragonite to regain health and reactivate Multiscale. Dragon Claw is a STAB attack that is used over Outrage, as any defensive Pokemon does not want to be locked into a move. Extreme Speed finishes off opponents that are weakened by Dragon Claw. Fire Punch hits Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Skarmory decently hard. On the other hand, Superpower can hit Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Bisharp harder, but it lowers both Attack and Defense. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple some opponents, but missing out on coverage isn't very good.

Set Details
========

64 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature reach a jump point that allows Dragonite to beat many opponents with the simple combination of Dragon Claw and Extreme Speed. The remaining EVs are put into special bulk. Leftovers is the preferred item as it provides passive recovery. Multiscale allows a healthy Dragonite to take hits even better.

Usage Tips
========

While this Dragonite has an offensively based moveset, it should not be used recklessly like other variants of Dragonite and should take a more defensive approach. The main strategy of this set is to take strong special hits, such as Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast and Latios's Draco Meteor, and retaliate by hitting extremely hard in return. This Dragonite set also can switch into threats that would otherwise harm it, such as Keldeo and Landorus. As usual, Dragonite should not switch in when Stealth Rock is up, as it is much more vulnerable to attacks with Multiscale broken.

Team Options
========

Any form of entry hazard removal is appreciated, as Stealth Rock breaks Multiscale and makes Dragonite more susceptible to attacks. Excadrill makes a great partner as it removes hazards, has great defensive synergy with Dragonite, and can eliminate Fairy-types. Heatran makes a good defensive partner because Dragonite and Heatran cover each other's weaknesses perfectly, it can eliminate Fairy-types, and it can set up Stealth Rock. Heatran can also do a great job at gradually wearing down Dragonite's checks. Clerics such as Clefable and Sylveon are good partners, as they can easily remove burns, Toxic poison, and paralysis. Bulky Dragonite works well on offensive teams in general, which appreciate Dragonite's bulk and good offensive presence.

Other Options
########

Dragonite has many options it can work with, given its good movepool. Dragonite's rain set from BW with Hurricane, Thunder, and Superpower was very effective at wallbreaking, but due to the fact that rain has been limited to 5 turns in XY, and that Dragonite's mediocre Speed ruins the momentum for Swift Swim users, such a set is now limited in effectiveness. Iron Head and Iron Tail can both effectively beat Fairy-types, but they have no use outside of that. A bulky Substitute + Dragon Dance set with Roost and Dragon Claw seems good on paper, but mono-Dragon coverage is no longer good due to the advent of Fairy-types. Dragonite has a huge special movepool with moves such as Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, and Draco Meteor, but Dragonite's mediocre base 100 Special Attack stat limits its effectiveness, and a specially offensive set is outclassed by Latios, Latias, and even Goodra. A parashuffler set can paralyze multiple foes, but Electric-types are now immune to paralysis, limiting its effectiveness. A mixed Life Orb set has a good surprise factor, and it can break down defensive cores more easily.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Almost any Fairy-type can easily take care of Dragonite. Azumarill and physically defensive Sylveon aren't threatened much by Dragon Dance and bulky Dragonite, though the former should be wary of Thunder Punch from the Choice Band set. Physically defensive Clefable is a great answer to any variant of Dragonite, bar ones with a Steel-type coverage move. Unaware variants of Clefable can also stop a boosted Dragonite with ease.

**Ice-type Attacks**: Despite Multiscale, Dragonite can not stand up to most Ice-type attacks. Life Greninja, Kyurem-B, and Mamoswine are all Pokemon that can easily OHKO Dragonite with their Ice-type STAB moves. Pokemon that carry Ice-type coverage, such as Manaphy, also pose a threat.

**Physical Walls**: Physically defensive Pokemon with reliable recovery, such as Hippowdown, Skarmory, Gliscor, and Quagsire, can all tank hits from Dragonite and stall it out, though Dragonite can cover Skarmory with either Thunder Punch or Fire Punch. Choice Band variants of Dragonite, however, aren't as threatened by these Pokemon due to the fact that it can severely dent all of these.

**Broken Multiscale**: One of Dragonite's key points is Multiscale, and without it, Dragonite isn't as shielded from attacks. Stealth Rock poses the biggest threat to Dragonite, as not only does it break Multiscale, it also chips a full quarter of Dragonite's health off. Sandstorm damage from Tyranitar or Hippowdon can also easily break Multiscale. Pokemon that negate Multiscale, such as Mega Gyarados and Kyurem-B, can easily OHKO Dragonite with Ice Fang and Ice Beam, respectively.

**Revenge Killing**: Priority and Choice Scarf users are both major problems for Dragonite. Ice Shard Mamoswine and Weavile, as well as Brave Bird Talonflame, can all pick off a weakened Dragonite. Revenge killers such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Terrakion can finish off Dragonite with their Rock-type coverage attacks. This forces Dragonite to use Extreme Speed, which will usually not OHKO them.

**Status**: Outside of sets that use Lum Berry, any form of status will easily cripple Dragonite. Burns from bulky walls such as Rotom-W can prevent Dragonite from doing major damage, while Thundurus can use Thunder Wave to cripple Dragonite from outspeeding common threats.
