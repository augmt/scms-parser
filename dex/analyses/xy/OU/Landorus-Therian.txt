Overview
########

Landorus-T's ability, Intimidate, alongside its outstanding base 145 Attack, allows it to act as a strong offensive pivot with U-turn to keep momentum. Access to useful coverage moves such as Stone Edge, Superpower, and Knock Off alongside its STAB Earthquake allows Landorus-T to hit almost the entire tier for super effective or neutral damage. An important quality of Landorus-T is its versatility, as it can use a few different sets, such as Choice Scarf and Defensive, and it even functions as a Double Dance late-game sweeper. The Choice Scarf set is a very effective revenge killer, able to take down common setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, Talonflame, and Terrakion. The defensive set is a very reliable setter of Stealth Rock, while still keeping offensive momentum.

However, Landorus-T does have multiple flaws. As a defensive Pokemon, it has no reliable recovery, which means that it will get worn down very quickly throughout the battle. Also, its Ground- / Flying-typing leaves it weak to Water- and Ice-type attacks, which are very common in OU. Due to the fact that it must invest in physical defense to make the best use of Intimidate, Landorus-T is overwhelmed by powerful special attackers such as Mega Gardevoir and Latios. Landorus-T's average Speed leaves it outsped by common threats such as Thundurus and Keldeo unless it is using a Choice Scarf. However, despite these flaws, Landorus-T is still a dominant threat in OU that can fit onto many teams.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Superpower / Knock Off / Explosion
move 4: Stone Edge
ability: Intimidate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 24 Def / 232 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Earthquake is Landorus-T's physical Ground-type STAB move, hitting Pokemon that are not immune or resistant to it very hard with maximum Attack investment. U-turn is important to scout early-game and to keep offensive momentum, while also hitting Psychic-types such as Latios for super effective damage. Superpower is important for hitting Mega Gyarados and Tyranitar, as well as Air Balloon Heatran and Excadrill. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to hit Gengar, Latias, and Latios, as well as opposing Landorus-T and Landorus. Explosion is an option if your team can handle the threats previously mentioned, and it massively dents anything that does not resist it, including Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Mega Venusaur, and Azumarill. Lastly, Stone Edge is very important to provide EdgeQuake coverage, nailing targets such as Thundurus, Talonflame, and Mega Pinsir.

Set Details
========

The Attack EVs maximize Landorus-T's offensive potential. A Jolly nature and 232 Speed EVs allow Choice Scarf Landorus-T to outspeed Adamant Mega Charizard X after a Dragon Dance. The last 24 EVs are put into Defense; while not entirely important, Landorus-T will generally be taking physical hits and not special ones.

Usage Tips
========

Landorus-T is best used as a scout early-game with U-turn, as it tends to force a lot of switches. Use the chosen coverage options when appropriate; for example, to hit the likes of Thundurus on the switch with Stone Edge, or nail an Air Balloon user with Superpower. It is important to know that a Landorus Choice-locked into Earthquake can easily be taken advantage of, so it should only be used when necessary.

Team Options
========

Volt Switch users such as Rotom-W and Mega Manectric can form a VoltTurn core with Landorus-T, and the latter creates a dual Intimidate combo to pressure physical attackers. Clefable has great synergy with Landorus-T, as it can take special attacks from the likes of Greninja and Latios as well as absorbing status ailments thanks to Magic Guard. In return, Landorus-T can hit grounded Poison-, Fire-, and Steel-types that are problematic for Clefable. Latios and Latias are good teammates to switch in on the likes of Rotom-W and Keldeo, but they compound an Ice-type weakness with Landorus-T.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Stone Edge / Rock Slide / Knock Off
ability: Intimidate
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 240 Def / 8 SpD / 8 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is essential on every team, and Landorus-T finds many opportunities to set it up thanks to Intimidate and its good offensive presence. Earthquake is Landorus-T's most powerful physical STAB move and hits fairly hard even uninvested. U-turn is important to keep up offensive momentum, capitalizes on the switches that Landorus-T forces, and is also a very helpful advantage over other bulky Ground-types such as Gliscor and Hippowdon. Stone Edge provides great coverage with Earthquake, hitting common threats such as Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, and Thundurus, and while its unreliable accuracy can be problematic, its power is important to OHKO Mega Pinsir. Rock Slide can be used as a more reliable Rock-type coverage move, but the power difference is very significant, especially against the aforementioned Mega Pinsir. Knock Off can be used instead in the last slot to hit Gengar, opposing Landorus, Latios, and Latias. It also removes Leftovers from defensive Pokemon like Rotom-W, Slowbro, and Ferrothorn, aiding greatly in wearing them down throughout the match.

Set Details
========

Full HP investment and 240 EVs in Defense are crucial for Landorus-T to handle the likes of Talonflame, Excadrill, and Mega Pinsir. 8 Speed EVs are enough to outspeed Modest Magnezone while still having a slow U-turn to take a hit and pivot out to another teammate. 8 Special Defense EVs are run to prevent Mega Manectric from OHKOing with Hidden Power Ice. If outspeeding Bisharp and Jolly Tyranitar is necessary for the team, then 104 Speed EVs can be run to outrun them. Leftovers is important to keep Landorus-T healthy throughout the battle.

Usage Tips
========

Landorus-T is best used as a pivot into physical attackers that don't have an attack that is super effective against it, such as Terrakion and Mega Charizard X. It is important to scout for mixed attackers, such as Terrakion with Hidden Power Ice. Keep status away from Landorus-T, as status will greatly cripple it, especially if Landorus-T is not paired with a cleric. Use the switches that Landorus-T forces to set up Stealth Rock, which is always very important.

Team Options
========

Volt Switch users such as Rotom-W are helpful to keep momentum alongside Landorus-T's U-turn and to bring it in safely. Rotom-W is also a great teammate because it handles the Water- and Ice-types that threaten out Landorus-T. Clefable can take some special attacks and absorb or heal off status ailments from Landorus-T with the use of Magic Guard and Aromatherapy. In return, Landorus-T checks grounded Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-types which resist Clefable's STAB moves.

Double Dance
########
name: Double Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Rock Polish
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Stone Edge
ability: Intimidate
item: Leftovers
evs: 56 HP / 220 Atk / 232 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Swords Dance boosts Landorus-T's Attack to massive levels, allowing it to punch massive holes in the opposing team. Rock Polish allows Landorus-T to boost its Speed significantly, greatly threatening offensively based teams. Earthquake is Landorus-T's most powerful physical STAB move, and hits very hard after a boost. Stone Edge provides great coverage alongside Earthquake, hitting Flying-types and Levitate users such as Thundurus, Talonflame, Gengar, and Latios. Knock Off is an option to hit Latios, Latias, and Gengar harder than Stone Edge. Rock Polish and three attacks can be used, but without a Swords Dance boost, the lack of power is very significant.

Set Details
========

232 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Adamant Excadrill in the sand after a Rock Polish Boost. 56 HP EVs are used to avoid the 2HKO from Adamant Life Orb Excadrill's Iron Head, giving Landorus-T a good opportunity to set up a Rock Polish or Swords Dance. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack with an Adamant nature to maximize Landorus-T's damage output. Leftovers are useful to give Landorus-T some longevity while setting up, as well as allowing it to take some physical attacks thanks to Intimidate. Alternately, Soft Sand with maximum Attack investment can be used for more power overall to allow Landorus-T to break through walls such as Quagsire and Slowbro, as well as achieving KOs on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn after a Swords Dance and some prior damage. Landorus-T can opt for a bulkier EV spread of 132 HP / 56 Atk / 216 Def / 104 Spe with an Adamant nature. This EV spread outspeeds Adamant Bisharp and Jolly Tyranitar before a Rock Polish, and hits a Leftovers number to maximize recovery during setup. Lastly, a Life Orb can be used for a significant boost in power to allow Landorus-T to KO Rotom-W after a Swords Dance boost and Stealth Rock damage.

Usage Tips
========

In most scenarios, Landrous-T will not have the opportunity to set up a Swords Dance and a Rock Polish. Against more defensively based teams, Swords Dance is the better option, while a Rock Polish boost is more useful against offensive teams. Landorus-T generally should not set up until its checks and counters have been weakened, as they will be able to cripple Landorus-T with status or KO it with a STAB move. However, it may be helpful to set up early- or mid-game in order to clear the way for another teammate.

Team Options
========

Stealth Rock support from the likes of Ferrothorn and Heatran is very important for this set, as it helps Landorus-T achieve some KOs after a boost and wears down its checks and counters. Keldeo is a good teammate that weakens Latios and Latias to put them in KO range of Stone Edge after a boost. Keldeo also handles bulky Ground-types such as Gliscor and Hippowdon that are problematic for Landorus-T. Mega Charizard X is also a great partner because it handles Rotom-W, while Landorus-T covers Tyranitar and Rhyperior for Charizard. Landorus-T and Charizard also have good offensive synergy because they share similar checks and counters, and one can wear them down for a possible sweep from the other. Other wallbreakers such as Mega Heracross and Mega Medicham are good partners because they share similar checks and counters and can punch holes in teams to help Landorus-T sweep. Volt Switch users such as Rotom-W and Mega Manectric are helpful to give Landorus-T a safe switch-in to set up a boost.

Other Options
########

Toxic can be used on the defensive set to cripple bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Alomomola on the switch. Hidden Power Flying, while very situational, can be used to hit Mega Heracross and Chesnaught. Landorus-T can make use of a Choice Band set, but having the utility of a powerful revenge killer when equipped with a Choice Scarf is generally more useful. Substitute can be used with Swords Dance to protect Landorus-T from status while boosting. Gravity can be used on the defensive set to allow Landorus-T to beat common Defog users such as Skarmory and Zapdos, as well as Pokemon with Levitate such as Rotom-W and Gengar. A lead Stealth Rock set with Focus Sash and Explosion can be used to surprise foes and put a dent in the opposing team right off the bat. If a team requires more offensive presence in Stealth Rock Landorus-T without running a suicidal set, a speedy Earth Plate variant of the listed set can be run.

Checks & Counters
########

**Physical Walls**: Pokemon such as Skarmory, Mega Venusaur, Gliscor, and Hippowdon can all take a hit from Landorus-T, heal off the damage, and retaliate back.

**Bulky Water-types**: Rotom-W, Alomomola, and Slowbro can all take repeated hits from Landorus-T and threaten it out with their super effective STAB moves.

**Ice-types**: Mamoswine, Weavile, Kyurem-B, and Protean Ice Beam from Greninja will easily OHKO Landorus-T, but most Ice-types are very frail and must be wary of Superpower and Stone Edge on the switch-in.

**Burn**: Will-O-Wisp or Scald from Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Alomomola, Slowbro, Starmie, and Sableye halve Landorus-T's attack, rendering it useless.

**Chesnaught**: While somewhat uncommon in OU, Chesnaught differentiates itself from other Grass-types as a check to Landorus-T because it resists the EdgeQuake combination and has very high Defense.

**Residual Damage**: Stealth Rock, Iron Barbs, and Rocky Helmet will quickly wear down Landorus-T, as it has no reliable recovery, greatly decreasing its effectiveness as a pivot.
