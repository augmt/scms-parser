Overview
########

One of the things that sets Breloom apart from other physical attackers in the tier is its Hidden Ability, Technician, and Breloom's movepool is seemingly designed to take advantage of it. Its Bullet Seed is one of the strongest attacks in the game, being able to reach up to 187.5 BP, and its priority Mach Punch is insanely powerful when you take into account its base 130 Attack, STAB, and a Technician boost. Breloom can also put an opposing Pokemon to sleep with Spore, effectively taking them out for what is usually most of the match.

However, despite the insane power that Breloom wields, it definitely has its drawbacks. It has common weaknesses to types such as Fire, Flying, and Ice, and its 60 / 80 / 60 defenses are mediocre at best. One of the moves that Breloom is known for, Spore, has been nerfed significantly, as Grass-types and Pokemon with Overcoat, such as Ferrothorn and Mandibuzz, respectively, can now switch in on it with impunity. The metagame around Breloom has also changed drastically, as new threats like Mega Venusaur and Talonflame resist its STAB attacks and threaten it with their own super effective STAB attacks. Finally, Breloom is extremely slow, and base 70 Speed is quite mediocre in the OU metagame. However, the pure power that Breloom possesses is not to be ignored, and if used in the right hands, it can definitely pack quite the punch for a Pokemon with such stubby arms.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Spore
move 2: Bullet Seed
move 3: Mach Punch
move 4: Rock Tomb
ability: Technician
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

This set aims to take advantage of Technician and utilize moves that will leave the opposing team extremely worn down. Spore is one of the moves that set Breloom apart from many other attackers, and it could potentially incapacitate a foe for most of the game. It can also be used on a predicted switch to ease prediction, unless a Grass-type or Pokemon with Overcoat are still alive. Bullet Seed is Breloom's most powerful STAB attack after Technician and is useful for breaking through Sturdy and Focus Sash. Mach Punch is a STAB priority move that is useful for hitting weakened or faster foes, and hits really hard after Technician as well. Finally, Rock Tomb is a very useful attack for slowing down anticipated switch-ins for Breloom to take down later; it can hit many common Breloom checks such as Talonflame and Dragonite really hard. Swords Dance can be used over Rock Tomb to allow Breloom to sweep through unprepared teams, as its Attack soars to sky-high levels after a +2 boost; however, its STAB coverage isn't that great and it can get walled by Pokemon like Talonflame, Charizard-Y, and Gengar with relative ease.

Breloom can also use Force Palm over Rock Tomb as a reliable and more powerful secondary STAB attack if it needs to hit harder than it would with Mach Punch, and is useful for getting past defensive threats like Ferrothorn. However, Rock Tomb's utility is something that Breloom typically won't want to give up.

Set Details
========

The EVs of this set are maxed out in Attack and Speed to capitalize on Breloom's offensive presence. Jolly is mandatory as the nature to avoid Speed ties with Bisharp, tie with opposing Breloom, and a slew of other threats including neutral-natured base 80s, slowerbase 100s, Adamant Gyarados, Gliscor, defensive Landorus-T, Adamant Mega Heracross, and Adamant Diggersby. Focus Sash is preferred for the item to ensure Breloom can take any one hit and attack or sleep the foe. This makes it much more of a threat to offensive teams, as it practically guarantees something will sleep and allows Breloom to check many threats in a pinch. Life Orb or an Adamant nature can be used to OHKO Excadrill. In general, Life Orb Breloom is significantly more powerful, blasting through the likes of Gliscor and Landorus-T, but isn't generally worth losing out on Focus Sash.

Usage Tips
========

This set is one that is mostly used either mid-game to check a specific threat or early-game to fire off a quick Spore and weaken things quickly. One thing that Breloom is very good at is punishing switches. When anticipating a switch, use Spore so that whatever is switching in is put to sleep and can't really do much. However, since Grass-types are immune to Spore, if you predict that one is going to switch in, try using Mach Punch or Rock Tomb. If something slightly faster than Breloom is switching in, it can use Rock Tomb to slow it down, hopefully to the point where Breloom can outspeed the opposing Pokemon and finish it off.

Team Options
========

A Fire-type or a teammate with a Fire-type move is very useful to have to get rid of opposing Grass-types that are immune to Spore. Heatran is an excellent example of a Fire-type teammate, as it resists Flying, as well as dual-resisting Ice and being immune to Poison. Because Mega Venusaur essentially counters Breloom, a counter to it, such as Latios, is recommended to get it out of the way. A Stealth Rock setter is also a great teammate to have, as it chips away at the opposing team's health and also weakens Fire- and Flying-types, especially the omnipresent Talonflame. Rock-types are also a great choice for directly damaging Fire- and Flying-types. Hippowdon is a bulky Ground-type that can easily take care of Talonflame. Finally, Excadrill is an alternate Ground-type that pairs up well with Breloom, as it is immune to Poison and resists all of Breloom's weaknesses bar Fire and Ice, as well as being a great Rapid Spin user.

Leech Seed
########
name: Leech Seed
move 1: Leech Seed
move 2: Drain Punch
move 3: Protect
move 4: Spore
ability: Poison Heal
item: Toxic Orb
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

This set takes a more defensive approach towards using Breloom with its excellent defensive movepool and abilities. Leech Seed is the move this set is based upon, and it is great for chipping away at an opposing Pokemon's HP while giving Breloom passive recovery each turn. Drain Punch is Breloom's primary STAB attack, and it provides additional recovery on top of Leech Seed. Protect is a useful scouting move, and it also allows Leech Seed damage to rack up on your opponent while Breloom heals. Finally, in the last moveslot, Spore is used to put a switch-in or opposing Pokemon to sleep. However, Grass-types and Pokemon with Overcoat are now immune to Spore, so that is something to watch out for.

Set Details
========

For this set, Toxic Orb is the item of choice to take advantage of Poison Heal. The EVs are mostly invested in special bulk to allow Breloom to serve as an effective Thundurus or Keldeo check.

Usage Tips
========

When anticipating a switch, it's usually safe to use Leech Seed, since Breloom will need all the recovery it can get. However, watch out especially for Grass-types, which are immune to Leech Seed and Spore and can switch in on those moves with impunity. Once Leech Seed is set up, Breloom can stall with Protect if it is not worried about about the opposing Pokemon setting up. Keep Leech Seed on your opponent as much as possible; the passive damage will wear them down over time.

Team Options
========

Because Grass-types are immune to Spore and Leech Seed, Fire-types like Heatran and Talonflame can be great teammates for taking them out. Also, Excadrill's typing lends itself to be an excellent teammate for Breloom as well, as it is immune to Poison and resists all of Breloom's weaknesses bar Fire. Finally, hazard setters like Skarmory or Landorus-T will force anything coming in to take a chunk of damage, and this is useful since Breloom will be forcing a lot of switches in order to shake off Leech Seed; Stealth Rock in particular is great for chipping away at Fire-types, especially the omnipresent Talonflame.

Other Options
########

First of all, Swords Dance or Bulk Up can be used to get Breloom to sweep, but it will either get walled easily if it runs Spore, or find it hard to set up without it. A SubPunch set with Toxic Orb and Poison Heal also finds itself walled very easily, with it only using a Grass STAB and a semi-reliable Fighting STAB. A Choice Band set can also be used for lots of power, but Breloom won't be able to access its amazing support movepool and will miss using Spore a lot. Breloom is also prone to being revenge killed due to being extremely slow. Finally, Thunder Punch is an option to allow Breloom to bypass threats like Gyarados and Skarmory.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Grass-types are threatening to both sets, as they resist Breloom's powerful Grass STAB attacks and are immune to Spore and Leech Seed. Mega Venusaur stands out as one of Breloom's best counters, as its Poison typing allows it to resist both of Breloom's STABs and hit it hard with Sludge Bomb.

**Fire-types**: Some Fire-types will also find themselves being able to check Breloom. Talonflame resists both of Breloom's STABs and fire off a 4x super effective priority Brave Bird, but it must watch out for Rock Tomb. Without Rock Tomb, Volcarona will also be able to set up Quiver Dance right in front of Breloom.

**Physically Defensive Pokemon**: Of course, since Breloom is mostly attacking using its excellent Attack stat, physically defensive Pokemon are able to wall Breloom. Examples include Skarmory and Mega Venusaur, with the latter also being immune to Spore.

**Dragon-types**: Dragon-types are notable for resisting Breloom's Grass STAB, and they also usually come with a second typing that resists its other STAB as well. Examples of this include Latias and Latios, whose Psychic typing help them resist Fighting. Dragon / Flying Pokemon like Dragonite and Salamence also resist Fighting, but they must watch out for Rock Tomb.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types are also good checks as they are being completely immune to Breloom's Fighting-type STAB, and some have an additional secondary typing that allows them to resist Grass-type attacks as well. Gengar in particular is very threatening as its Poison typing allows it to accomplish this.
