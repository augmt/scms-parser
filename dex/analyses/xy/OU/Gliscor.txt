Overview
########

Gliscor is a top defensive threat in today's metagame. Its specially defensive set is highly regarded as possibly the best Landorus counter in the tier, while being an effective stallbreaker with access to Taunt, Earthquake, Toxic, and Knock Off to dismantle many top defensive threats. It is also an excellent check to various OU attackers by virtue of an excellent typing that gives it a resistance to Fighting and immunities to Electric and Ground. It does have some flaws, including a weakness to the ubiquitous Water-type and quadruple weakness to Ice, as well as a bit less stellar physical bulk when it chooses to invest in Special Defense, in addition to certain Pokemon in the tier that just shut it down. Overall, though, Gliscor has a solid place in the OU tier.
Physically Defensive

move 4: Earthquake
ability: Poison Heal
item: Toxic Orb
evs: 252 HP / 56 Def / 200 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Roost helps Gliscor stay healthy so that it can continuously check Pokemon such as Mega Medicham lacking an Ice-type move, Terrakion, Landorus-T, Garchomp, Mega Heracross, and Talonflame. Roost also helps with Toxic stalling. Taunt prevents opposing Pokemon from using healing moves, setting entry hazards, and setting up. Toxic spreads status to wear down opposing Pokemon. It also discourages many special attackers from switching in. Fling is useful for poisoning opposing Pokemon and enabling Acrobatics to be full power. Half powered Acrobatics can be used to OHKO -1 Defense Mega Heracross and 2HKO Mega Medicham as well as helping to overcome slower specially defensive Gliscor that carry Knock Off. Acrobatics is used over Aerial Ace as Gliscor can be used as a Knock Off absorber for teams after being poisoned, and Gliscor's ability to counter Mega Heracross through Acrobatics is the main reason for using this set. Earthquake is Gliscor's primary STAB move. Knock Off can be used to cripple special attackers such as Gengar on the switch in. It is also useful for crippling setup sweepers that switch in like Calm Mind Magic Guard Clefable and Suicune, which this Gliscor set is complete setup bait for.

Gliscor can also use Stealth Rock if your team needs a setter. Ice Fang allows Gliscor to 2HKO Dragonite if Multiscale is broken, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. Protect is useful for additional Poison Heal healing and Toxic damage opposing Pokemon. Knock Off can be used to cripple foes by removing their item. U-turn helps gain momentum against common switch-ins and allows Gliscor to function as a pivot. However, it is usually better to use Landorus-T rather than Gliscor for this role. Gliscor's moves are flexible, so pick them based on your team.

Set Details
========

The 252 HP EVs increase Gliscor's overall bulk. The 200 Speed EVs are used to allow Gliscor to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Excadrill. The remaining 56 Defense EVs and the Impish nature make Gliscor as physically bulky as possible.

Usage Tips
========

Physically defensive Gliscor is best used on balanced and stall teams. Gliscor is a great sand offense check. It is important to note that Gliscor cannot check all physical attackers; examples of Pokemon it cannot check are Bulk Up + Taunt Talonflame, Scizor if Gliscor lacks Taunt, Mega Pinsir, Choice Band Staraptor, and Mamoswine. It is important to remember that Tyranitar occasionally runs an Ice-type move to lure and take out Gliscor. Try not to let Gliscor faint until it takes out the Pokemon that it only checks. Be wary of getting Gliscor's Toxic Orb Knocked Off before it is poisoned. After having Gliscor's Toxic Orb Knocked Off avoid using Aromatherapy or Heal Bell, unless Gliscor is no longer useful or can absorb a Toxic, by switching your designated absorber into status moves. If you expect a special attacker to switch in, use Toxic or Fling to cripple them, or use Taunt to limit its options. Fling can be risky at times if the opposing team has a Gliscor check that does not care about Fling, such as Skarmory. Do not use fling before Gliscor is poisoned.

Team Options
========

Bulky Water-types such as Alomomola, Keldeo, Rotom-W, Starmie, and Suicune are great partners because they cover Gliscor's Water- and Ice-type weaknesses. Rotom-W also has the added bonus of checking Mega Pinsir which Gliscor can only hurt through Toxic and Acrobatics. Bulky Grass-Types such as Amoonguss, Celebi, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur are good partners for their ability to check Thundurus, Suicune, and Clefable; Ferrothorn more so for its ability to check Latias and Latios. Gliscor appreciates checks to strong special attackers, such as Clefable and Heatran for Latias and Latios; Chansey, Latias, and Talonflame for Mega Charizard Y; Chansey and Latias for Landorus; and Jirachi for Mega Gardevoir and Greninja. Heatran also checks Gengar, which Gliscor gives opportunities to switch in. Jirachi has great synergy with Gliscor by checking Clefable, helping Toxic stall through paraflinching shenanigans, and taking Ice-type attacks while Gliscor handles most physical attackers that force Jirachi out. Gliscor also needs a teammate to absorb Scald, so prioritize having a Pokemon with Natural Cure, such as the previously mentioned Celebi, Chansey, and Starmie, on your team. Do not use Pokemon with the move Aromatherapy or Heal Bell your team with Gliscor because they have poor synergy with Gliscor.

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Roost
move 3: Toxic / Knock Off
move 4: Earthquake / Knock Off
ability: Poison Heal
item: Toxic Orb
evs: 244 HP / 192 SpD / 72 Spe
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Taunt allows Gliscor to prevent the use of recovery moves, setup moves, entry hazards, and opposing Taunts as well as various other non-damaging moves. Roost provides Gliscor with an insane amount of recovery alongside Poison Heal and turns it into an exceptional Toxic staller. Toxic, if chosen, is Gliscor's main method of dealing damage, and it works very well with Taunt. Earthquake is a very consistent Ground-type STAB move that complements Toxic nicely by hitting most Steel-types, which are immune to Toxic, super effectively. Knock Off is an option over either Toxic or Earthquake to hit Pokemon that Gliscor otherwise can't touch, such as Skarmory and Gengar, as well as to remove the items of opposing Pokemon. However, using Knock Off leaves Gliscor vulnerable to offensive Steel-types. Protect is an option over Roost to let Gliscor stall with Toxic more easily and to ensure that its Toxic Orb activates.

Set Details
========

Using 244 HP EVs makes Gliscor's HP stat divisible by 8, maximizing the efficiency of Poison Heal. 72 Speed EVs allow Gliscor to outspeed everything up to and including Jolly Tyranitar, while the rest of the EVs and a Careful nature make Gliscor as specially bulky as possible.

An EV spread that includes Defense investment with an Impish nature is also a possibility. This allows Gliscor to handle Mega Heracross effectively, although Toxic will need to be used in order to do so. A mixed spread also helps Gliscor defeat other powerful physical attackers, such as Swords Dance Excadrill.

Usage Tips
========

Gliscor can check or counter many of OU's top special attackers with this set, including Landorus and Gengar, by virtue of its typing and its ridiculous amount of recovery. It can also beat Draco Meteor users, namely Latios, Latias, and Mega Garchomp, one-on-one thanks to the aforementioned recovery it gets. Additionally, once it is poisoned, Gliscor can easily switch into Assault Vest Tornadus-T, a Pokemon that often plagues the defensive teams on which Gliscor is commonly used. While specially defensive Gliscor can still check physical attackers, it cannot do so as well as physically defensive variants. For example, +2 Adamant Life Orb Excadrill will OHKO it after Stealth Rock damage, and Life Orb Terrakion can 2HKO it after Stealth Rock damage.

The combination of Taunt and Toxic allows Gliscor to stallbreak, as Gliscor can defeat practically any defensive Pokemon without an immunity to Toxic that can't hit it super effectively. Gliscor can even defeat Pokemon that rely on a weak Scald to damage it, such as Quagsire and Slowbro, as well as defensive Rotom-W by stalling it out of Hydro Pump PP. Even if Gliscor lacks Toxic, it can still outlast many defensive Pokemon by using Knock Off to remove their Leftovers and then slowly whittle down their HP.

Remember that Gliscor needs to be in for a turn before its Toxic Orb activates; before it is poisoned, be wary of switching it into a potential Knock Off or status user such as Landorus, Gengar, or Breloom. This is especially important to remember if Gliscor is used on a team that includes a cleric. Once its Toxic Orb has activated, however, Gliscor can easily switch into Knock Off and status moves. It should be noted that against stall teams, Gliscor's PP is precious; avoid wasting PP if Gliscor is locked in a stalemate.

Team Options
========

This Gliscor variant fits well on stall teams, where the ability to both check Landorus and stallbreak is greatly appreciated. It also fits well on balanced teams. In general, Water-types are great teammates for Gliscor, as they can cover its Water- and Ice-type weaknesses. Slowbro and Azumarill are excellent examples, as they are able to check Greninja and Keldeo. Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur also handle Water- and Ice-types, and the former can set up entry hazards. Skarmory can handle the physical attackers that Gliscor struggles against, including Mamoswine, Diggersby, Excadrill, Terrakion, and Swords Dance Garchomp. Heatran is able to check or counter several specific threats to specially defensive Gliscor, such as Dragonite and Mega Charizard X that lack Earthquake.

SubToxic
########
name: SubToxic
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Toxic
move 3: Protect
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Poison Heal
item: Toxic Orb
evs: 244 HP / 28 Def / 236 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========

With its great typing and decent Speed, Gliscor can stall many threats. Substitute is the most important move on this set as it allows Gliscor to scout incoming attacks and stall against Pokemon that are inflicted with Toxic. Protect helps recover more HP from Poison Heal, letting Gliscor continue setting up Substitutes. It also helps stall out the opponents PP, a critical tactic for defeating Pokemon such as Rotom-W that rely on a low PP move, Hydro Pump, to take out Gliscor. Earthquake is an obligatory STAB move so Gliscor is able to hit Steel- and Poison-types that switch in on Toxic, preventing it from being setup bait. All of these moves are absolutely mandatory for this set to succeed; any other options would be inferior to the given moves listed as without either Protect or Substitute, stalling becomes inefficient, and without Earthquake Gliscor becomes setup bait for Pokemon immune to Toxic.

Set Details
========

The given HP EVs make Gliscor's HP a multiple of eight so it is able to gain back the maximum amount of health possible from Poison Heal. The Speed EVs allow Gliscor to outspeed maximum Speed Mamoswine and below so it stalls out as many slower threats as possible, while an Impish nature plus putting the remaining EVs in Defense augments Gliscor's good physical bulk. Toxic Orb is mandatory to automatically activate Poison Heal, as without recovering an eighth of Gliscor's HP every turn, it would not be very effective at stalling.

Usage Tips
========

As with most defensive Pokemon, Gliscor should switch in on Pokemon that it walls, set up a Substitute on the opponent's forced switch, and start stalling Pokemon with Toxic. After a Pokemon has been inflicted with Toxic, it's best to alternate between Substitute and Protect as there is no net HP loss in doing so while the opponent's Pokemon slowly faint from residual damage. Make sure to alternate between Protect and Substitute only when Gliscor is Toxic stalling a faster Pokemon. Earthquake should only be used when finishing off weakened slower targets or when up against a Steel-type. It is best to not start Toxic stalling until bulky Pokemon immune to Toxic are taken out. Watch out for Air Balloon users such as Heatran, as they shut down this set completely. If Gliscor is against a status user before Toxic Orb has activated, use Protect to block the opponent's attack. After Toxic Orb activates, Gliscor also makes a great Knock Off absorber. Lastly, when facing an opponent utilizing low accuracy or PP moves, it is best to wait for a miss and stall out the move's PP so Gliscor obtains a free Substitute.

Team Options
========

This set has a lot of trouble dealing with defensive Steel-types and Mega Venusaur due to its reliance on Toxic to deal damage. Because of this, Gliscor appreciates powerful Fire-types such as Heatran, Talonflame, and both Mega Charizard formes to take out problematic Steel-types. Latios easily 2HKOes Mega Venusaur with Life Orb Psyshock. Mega Venusaur also makes a great partner as it is able to take on powerful special attackers that threaten Gliscor such as Keldeo and Thundurus. Gliscor also appreciates both Latios and Latias removed, so Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Bisharp are great partners because they also have decent synergy with Gliscor. Finally, while not generally an amazing Pokemon, Choice Specs Gothitelle is an excellent partner for this set, successfully trapping and eliminating pesky bulky Steel- and Poison-types like Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss, as well as having enough bulk to tank a Choice Specs-boosted hit from Keldeo and kill it to reduce its troubles against

Other Options
########

Gliscor has some other offensive options at its disposal. Firstly, Knock Off is a very good support move that allows Gliscor to remove items while also enabling it to cripple Gengar on the switch. Ice Fang hits Pokemon 4x weak to Ice such as opposing Gliscor, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Facade is decently powerful after being inflicted with poison to hit Pokemon such as Rotom-W, but does not help against Steel-types and a STAB Earthquake generally deals more damage. Swords Dance and Acrobatics is another option to attempt a sweep, but the set walled by Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Thundurus, and Flying Gem is unavailable. Fling with a Toxic Orb can be used alongside Acrobatics, but Gliscor is better off using Toxic instead. A set consisting of Earthquake, Substitute, Baton Pass, and Taunt is another option for Gliscor for use on full Baton Pass teams, but it is somewhat outclassed on these teams in general. There is also an option for Gliscor to use a set consisting of Toxic, Taunt, Roost, and Earthquake to wear down stall teams with ease, but it does not fare so well against offensive teams. Finally, Gliscor can utilize a support set with Defog, Stealth Rock, Roost, and Earthquake, but there are better users of Defog and Gliscor has to forgo Poison Heal to use it.


Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Water-types**: Water-types that outspeed Gliscor can force it out, such as Greninja, Keldeo, and Manaphy. Furthermore, threats such as SubDD Gyarados and Azumarill can pose a significant threat to Gliscor. It should be noted that specially defensive and even physically defensive Gliscor can shrug off most Scalds from bulky Water-types and even stall out Rotom-W's Hydro Pumps, so not all Water-types are good answers to it.

**Strong Special Attackers**: Mega Charizard Y can OHKO Gliscor with a sun-boosted Fire Blast. Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice deals enormous damage to it, and Gardevoir can set up on it with Calm Mind in its unevolved form with Trace or use Taunt on it.

**Toxic-Immune Pokemon**: Air Balloon Heatran and Excadrill, especially Swords Dance Excadrill, completely shut down any non-Knock Off Gliscor. Mega Scizor with Roost easily sets up on SubToxic Gliscor, while it can barely do anything in return. Gengar shuts down non-Knock Off variants due to Levitate and its Poison typing, however it must watch out for Knock Off, though it is rare. Magic Guard Clefable is a perfect counter to the SubToxic set, too, as well as Ferrothorn and Skarmory. Lastly, Air Balloon users such as Heatran can temporarily check Gliscor if it is not behind a Substitute completely shuts down Gliscor. The most notable user is Prankster Thundurus, which is immune to Earthquake

**Ice-types**: Ice-types in general can be problematic for Gliscor. Mamoswine and Cloyster both have access to Icicle Spear to go through Gliscor's Substitute and KO it. Kyurem-B and Weavile outspeed and threaten with STAB Ice Beam and Ice Punch respectively while the former can also Substitute on a predicted Toxic. It should be noted that Hidden Power Ice from Mega Manectric and non-Choice Specs Raikou will not OHKO specially defensive Gliscor, so you should be wary of Volt Switching in front of it or even staying in to use Hidden Power Ice with the threat of Gliscor's STAB Earthquake.
