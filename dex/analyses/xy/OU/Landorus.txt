Overview
########

Landorus is one of the most powerful special attackers in the tier. The combination of Sheer Force and recoil-less Life Orb boosts all of its attacks with a secondary effect to monstrous levels. It is also one of the most difficult Pokemon for stall to handle due to Calm Mind and Knock Off allowing it to bypass some of its normal checks and counters. This is furthered by its ability to form fantastic cores around a Pursuit trapper and additional special attackers such as Mega Charizard Y and Keldeo to simply overwhelm their counters. It also sits at a decent Speed tier, putting it ahead of both Mega Charizard X and Y, as well as Manaphy and even Mega Medicham. However, Landorus is just slow enough to leave it susceptible to being revenge killed by Pokemon such as Latios, Keldeo, Greninja, and others. Landorus's 4x weakness to Ice is also problematic, making it difficult to pair it with Pokemon such as Garchomp and Dragonite. However, these faults are dwarfed compared to the many positives that Landorus boasts.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Earth Power
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Focus Blast
move 4: Knock Off / Stealth Rock
ability: Sheer Force
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Timid

Moves
========

Blessed with a fantastic movepool, Landorus has just about everything it needs to succeed. Earth Power is ridiculously strong after Sheer Force, Life Orb, and STAB boosts, and is incredibly difficult for even neutrally hit Pokemon to switch into without fearing a 2HKO. Psychic's main use is as a way to hit Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Conkeldurr for super effective damage, as well as hitting Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Gyarados. Focus Blast is great for OHKOing Tyranitar, as well as to prevent Landorus from being walled by Skarmory. It is also Landorus's most powerful move with which to hit Chansey. Because Landorus has such a good movepool, the last slot really depends on what the rest of the team needs. Knock Off secures a crucial OHKO on Latios after Stealth Rock damage, has a small chance to OHKO Latias after Stealth Rock damage, gets rid of Chansey's Eviolite so that Landorus can 2HKO it with Focus Blast, and has the general utility of removing items from switch-ins. Landorus can also be an effective user of Stealth Rock if no other setter is available on a team. It can typically find opportunities to set up Stealth Rock with the many switches it forces, and fares decently vs Excadrill and Skarmory, two of the tier's premier hazard removers. Sludge Wave is an option to allow Landorus to beat Calm Mind Clefable 1v1 and hits Azumarill a good bit harder, OHKOing non-Assault Vest variants. It is also a useful move to avoid having to predict against Gyarados that might Mega Evolve to avoid taking damage from Psychic, takes away nearly half of Latios's and Latias's HP, and is stronger than Psychic on neutral hits against Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Thundurus. As it hits similar targets, it can also be used over Psychic. Rock Slide is another decent option, as it can OHKO Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T on the switch. It also deals significant damage to Gyarados. Finally, Hidden Power Ice can be used to successfully lure and KO specially defensive Gliscor, one of the premier defensive counters to Landorus, in addition to OHKOing Landorus-T, opposing Landorus, and Dragonite.

Set Details
========

An EV spread of 48 HP / 252 SpA / 208 Spe with a Modest nature can be used in order to outspeed positive-natured Mega Gyarados and 216 Speed Kyurem-B while getting an extra boost in power, although usually this is irrelevant since Landorus already hits so hard. A Modest nature should only be used if the rest of the team can cover both of Charizard's Mega Evolutions, as well as other Pokemon with base 100 Speed such as Manaphy and Mega Medicham. If using a physical attack such as Knock Off or Rock Slide, it's important to use a Naive nature instead of Timid.

Usage Tips
========

Landorus is one of the best stallbreakers in the tier, being able to take down common stall cores such as the core of Mega Venusaur and Heatran, as well as having access to Knock Off to cripple Chansey. Knock Off is especially useful when used in tandem with other special attackers such as Charizard Y and Thundurus. Because of this, it can be used both early- and late-game. Either use it to break through special walls for another Pokemon to clean up late-game or vice versa. Double switching into Bisharp or other Pursuit trappers on a predicted switch into Latios, Latias, or Chansey is also helpful to eliminate Landorus's counters as early as possible.

Team Options
========

The best partners to Landorus are other special attackers. Mega Charizard Y, Thundurus, and Keldeo all work well with it, as they can all wear down their similar counters by repeated attacking. Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp and Tyranitar also make good partners, as they can trap Latios and Latias and can even deal enough damage to wear down Chansey with their STAB Pursuit. Because faster Pokemon such as Garchomp, Keldeo, and Greninja can be problematic, Azumarill also makes a great partner, being able to defeat all of them.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Earth Power
move 3: Psychic
move 4: Focus Blast
ability: Sheer Force
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

As if Landorus wasn't already powerful enough, Calm Mind can boost its Special Attack even further, making it an absolute terror for both stall and balanced teams to face. Calm Mind not only boosts Landorus's Special Attack, but also its Special Defense, allowing it to survive attacks such as Hidden Power Ice from Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Raikou. Earth Power is the most powerful neutral option; getting STAB, Sheer Force, Life Orb, and possibly Calm Mind boosts makes it an insanely powerful attack. Psychic is the best option for hitting Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Assault Vest Conkeldurr for super effective damage, as well as hitting opposing Landorus and Gliscor for 2HKOs before a boost and OHKOs at +1. Focus Blast rounds out the set's coverage, 2HKOing Chansey after one Calm Mind, obliterating Skarmory, and OHKOing Tyranitar.

Set Details
========

An EV spread of 48 HP / 252 SpA / 208 Spe with a Modest nature is usable if outspeeding Jolly Excadrill, Charizard, and Manaphy with a Speed boosting nature isn't as important to your team, and it gives Landorus even more of a punch, but usually the Speed is more appreciated. Landorus hits incredibly hard even without a Modest nature.

Usage Tips
========

This set should be used to demolish stall and balanced offense. It works best in the late-game as a cleaner, grabbing a boost and then breaking through Pokemon weakened by its teammates. Like Landorus's other sets, Calm Mind appreciates Pursuit trappers to lure in and trap Pokemon such as Latios and Latias, which can be troublesome for Landorus to beat, as they are faster and their Psyshocks hit its unboosted Defense. Landorus actually has surprising bulk, so don't be afraid to stay in on attacks such as Azumarill's Aqua Jet and Hidden Power Ice from the likes of Thundurus after a Calm Mind boost.

Team Options
========

Other special attackers are the best partners for Landorus, being able to overwhelm special walls for Landorus to clean up in late-game. Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, and Thundurus fit this role well. As previously stated, Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp and Tyranitar also provide a great way to eliminate Latios and Latias early-game, and can even wear down Chansey.

Other Options
########

Rock Polish is probably the best option outside of the listed sets. It has the ability to murder offensive teams that aren't prepared for it; however, Landorus finds it difficult to set up a boost, and it is nearly a wasted moveslot against defensive and balanced teams. Gravity is an interesting option, but considering the main Levitate Pokemon that trouble Landorus are faster than it anyways, using Gravity as they switch into it isn't very effective and can actually hurt the rest of the team. Choice Scarf is another interesting set, but it is utilized better by Landorus-T, which finds it easier to switch in as a pivot thanks to Intimidate and boasts higher Attack; the extra Speed is not usually needed. Swords Dance sets can also be used with Sand Force and sand support, but this role is usually performed better by Landorus-T, and it does poorly against offensive teams. The same can be said about Double Dance sets.

Rock Polish
########
name: Rock Polish
move 1: Rock Polish
move 2: Earth Power
move 3: Psychic / Sludge Wave
move 4: Knock Off / Focus Blast
ability: Sheer Force
item: Life Orb
evs: 8 Atk / 252 SpA / 248 Spe
nature: Rash / Modest

Moves
========

Rock Polish boosts Landorus's Speed to outrun faster offensive threats, such as Latios, Keldeo, and Thundurus, that are often relied upon to revenge kill it, and eliminate them. Earth Power is a powerful STAB move that hits almost every grounded Pokemon in the tier without a resistance to Ground for enormous damage. Psychic provides important coverage on many non-grounded Pokemon, such as Thundurus and opposing Landorus; Fighting-types, such as Conkeldurr, Keldeo, and Breloom; and Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur. Sludge Wave is preferred if Focus Blast is run to deal significant to Latias and Latios. Knock Off OHKOes Latios after Stealth Rock damage and Latias with Stealth Rock and Life Orb damage; otherwise, they would be enormous threats to a Rock Polish Landorus sweep. It also cripples incoming Chansey and Tornadus-T earlier in the game. Focus Blast is also an option, primarily to hit Air Balloon Excadrill, which in the sand can otherwise pose a threat to Landorus, at the least weakening it into the range for a priority attack to KO. It also prevents Landorus from being walled by Skarmory, hits Chansey for almost 40%, 2HKOes Mandibuzz after Stealth Rock damage, and OHKOes Tyranitar.

Set Details
========

The EV spread lets Landorus outrun neutral-natured maximum Speed base 100s before a boost and everything relevant after a boost whilst granting it an enormous amount of power, especially due to the Modest nature that Landorus can afford to run thanks to the Speed boost from Rock Polish. Timid is an option to retain appreciated Speed pre-boost, but the power-boosting nature is favored for things such as a good chance to OHKO Thundurus after Stealth Rock damage.

Usage Tips
========

This set is meant to be used as a win condition against weakened or unprepared offensive teams, nabbing a Rock Polish on forced switches against things such as Keldeo locked into Secret Sword and -2 Latios, switch-ins such as Thundurus and Latios attempting to take advantage of Earth Power, and sacs so that Landorus can be revenge killed by a Pokemon such as Keldeo or Greninja. Unlike most other boosting sweepers, it cannot be revenge killed by Prankster Thundurus, making it even more threatening. As Landorus is primarily seen as a wallbreaker and a nuke, Rock Polish serves as a surprise move that can put offensive teams in a tricky position. In the early-game, it can be played as a normal Landorus, punching large holes in the opposing team, though you should be cautious to keep it healthy so that it can't be revenge killed by priority attacks or whatever when it's time to sweep, if it can. It is important to weaken or KO Pokemon such as Gyarados, Mandibuzz, Dragonite, and Thundurus that could prevent a Landorus sweep, as well as eliminate priority users such as Bisharp, Azumarill, and Mamoswine that can bypass its Speed boost and end a sweep early.

Team Options
========

Mixed Thundurus is an excellent partner, as it can easily deal with threats to Landorus such as Gyarados, Mandibuzz, Gliscor, Chansey, Dragonite, Latios, Latias, and Azumarill. Talonflame beats most of the priority users that can threaten a Landorus sweep. Breloom beats Azumarill, Bisharp, and Adamant Mamoswine; it also forces Latios and Latias in so they can be weakened into Knock Off KO range. Pursuit support from Bisharp or Tyranitar is necessary to eliminate Latios and Latias if Landorus is running Focus Blast. Bisharp's Pursuit can also be useful to weaken Chansey and potentially KO it if Landorus managed to Knock Off its Eviolite. Lastly, Stealth Rock support is crucial to allow Landorus to OHKO Latios and Thundurus, and to break Dragonite's Multiscale. Garchomp and Terrakion make for particularly good partners, as they can put pressure on Landorus's common answers.

Checks & Counters
########

**Latios and Latias**: Both of these Pokemon are probably the most common offensive checks to Landorus. They can survive any of its attacks and retaliate with a Draco Meteor or Psyshock. They also have access to Roost to recover off any damage taken by switching in. Their only downside is being weak to Pursuit, which can make them easy to eliminate without careful play.

**Specially Bulky Pokemon**: Pokemon such as specially defensive Gliscor, Chansey, specially defensive Dragonite, specially defensive Mandibuzz, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T all make for decent switch-ins to Landorus. They can each switch into its moves relatively easily and retaliate by either hitting it with a Toxic or one of their own powerful attacks. They each, except Gliscor, face their own problems with specific Landorus sets. Chansey is crippled by Knock Off, Mandibuzz gets smashed by a +1 Focus Blast, and Tornadus-T can also come in on Knock Off and lose its Assault Vest. Dragonite also needs to be at close to full health to survive and hates losing its Leftovers to Knock Off.

**Faster Pokemon and Priority**: Landorus, while not slow, is not particularly fast either, and it has no form of priority to compensate for this. Pokemon such as Keldeo and Greninja can come in and revenge kill it with their STAB Water-type moves. Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Raikou can all KO Landorus with Hidden Power Ice after some prior damage. Choice Band Talonflame and Azumarill can pick off weakened Landorus with their powerful priority attacks. Finally, Mamoswine and Weavile both can OHKO Landorus with their STAB Ice Shard.
