Overview
########

With the new generation and multiple changes to our metagame, Starmie isn't as effective as it once used to be. Defog is often the more preferred method of removing hazards, and Excadrill is the prime OU offensive Rapid Spinner, leaving little room for Starmie to flourish. However, it still has great base 115 speed and  amazng Bolt Beam + Hydro Pump coverage, allowing Starmie to still be a threat, and it has access to two great abilities in Natural Cure and Analytic. However, Starmie's typing leaves it vulnerable to common attacks such as Pursuit, U-turn, and Volt Switch. Play to Starmie's good points however, and it can be a great asset.

Reflect Type
########
name: Reflect Type
move 1: Reflect Type
move 2: Scald
move 3: Rapid Spin
move 4: Recover
ability: Natural Cure
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 16 SpD / 244 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Reflect Type changes Starmie's typing to match its opponent's, which has fantastic utility when facing the likes of Tyranitar, Bisharp, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Scald is almost mandatory on defensive Water-types, making up for its lower Base Power with a high chance to inflict a burn. Starmie is one of the few Pokemon with access to Rapid Spin, which is an excellent tool for supporting teammates that do not appreciate entry hazards, while ensuring that hazards on the opposite side of the field remain intact. This supporting role is greatly aided by access to reliable recovery in Recover.

While this set has very little room for deviation, there are a few alternate options available. Ice Beam has awesome neutral coverage and allows Starmie to take on the likes of Latios, Thundurus, and Garchomp, as well as deal with Lum Berry Dragonite if Stealth Rock is on the field. Psyshock and Toxic are decent choices to target Keldeo and Mega Venusaur and bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, respectively, but mono-Psychic coverage is often undesirable, and Starmie's already lackluster damage output is heightened if Toxic is chosen.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread maximizes Starmie's bulk while also maintaining its very important Speed tier, with just enough EVs to outrun Choice Scarf Magnezone in order to reflect its typing. The 16 Special Defense EVs lower the chance of being OHKOed by Latias's Draco Meteor and Modest Landorus's Earth Power, as well as avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Keldeo's Hidden Power Electric. Natural Cure is the preferred ability, allowing Starmie to act as a status sponge for the team as well as heal itself of annoying status in general.

Usage Tips
========

Unlike other Starmie variants, this set can afford to stay in on its usual checks and counters and use Reflect Type and Scald to turn the tables on them. Good targets for this are Pursuit users such as Bisharp and Scizor. Ferrothorn is also a noteworthy target, as it will be hard-pressed to deal any damage to Starmie after its typing has been reflected. Starmie can also beat Mega Charizard Y, Amoonguss, and Breloom in this manner, while Rotom-W becomes much less of a threat due to Volt Switch only dealing neutral damage. It is important to avoid overly relying on the surprise factor, though, as Starmie is still vulnerable to strong attacks from some Pokemon even after changing type, such as Tyranitar's Stone Edge.

Clearing entry hazards is a major role for this set, so try to use Rapid Spin as soon as possible when necessary, keeping Starmie healthy as long as the opposing hazard user is. Often, however, it is better to try catching spinblockers with Scald and potentially burn them rather than losing momentum with a failed Rapid Spin. Keep in mind that due to Starmie's decent-at-best Special Attack and lack of significant investment, this set does not hit hard at all, so your best bet for damage is whittling away with Scald and fishing for burns.

Team Options
========

This set is best suited to defensive or balanced teams. Specially defensive Heatran is a decent partner, as it can handle Talonflame, Latios, and Magic Guard Clefable. Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Dragonite and Gyarados, appreciate Starmie's Rapid Spin support, as does Talonflame, which can also check Magic Guard Clefable. Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn are good teammates to switch into Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Starmie, especially from Pokemon that Starmie struggles to thwart with Reflect Type, such as Thundurus. In return, Starmie can defeat Heatran. Calm Mind Clefable is a great choice for a teammate, as it checks Thundurus and Greninja, while Starmie lures and cripples Mega Scizor and Bisharp, which could otherwise prevent Clefable from sweeping. Finally, Scizor is a nice partner to check Tyranitar and Latias lacking Hidden Power Fire.

Offensive Spinner
########
name: Offensive Spinner
move 1: Hydro Pump / Surf
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Psyshock / Thunderbolt
move 4: Rapid Spin
ability: Analytic
item: Life Orb
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Moves
========

This set plays to Starmie's natural offensive capabilities. Analytic is the ability of choice for its incredible power boost on the switch. Hydro Pump is STAB and hits stupidly hard on the switch, thanks to the boost Analytic provides and its awesome Base Power. Surf is an option, but Hydro Pump is favoured for its great power. Ice Beam provides nice coverage for Grass- and Dragon-types. Psyshock is the main option for Starmie as it's STAB and hits Mega Venusaur and Chansey for nice damage. Psyshock has a slim chance to OHKO Conkeldurr, which is a big threat in the metagame right now. Thunderbolt however offers more coverage, which allows Starmie to hit Water-types, and creates the awesome BoltBeam coverage. Finally, Rapid Spin is used as it supports the team by removing hazards.


Set Details
========

The EVs are used for maximum power and Speed. Surf can be used for more consistency, but overall Hydro Pump is generally better. You might think an all out attacking set could be useful, but Starmie is mainly used for its ability to Rapid Spin. Recover can also be an option, but Starmie really needs to coverage in order to be threatening.

Usage Tips
========

This set is more suited to offensive teams that rely on VoltTurn or a late-game sweeper that's weak to entry hazards (Talonflame, Volcarona, Dragonite, etc), so pairing it up with said Pokemon is a good idea. Starmie's main role of the game is to generally Rapid Spin, so make that your first priority over hitting something hard on the switch. If the removal of hazards isn't the number one priority, then generally spamming Hydro Pump is a good idea.

Team Options
========

As already stated, the best partners for Starmie are powerful sweepers that are weak to entry hazards, making Volcarona, Dragonite, and Talonflame your best options. Starmie is also pretty popular on VoltTurn teams, so good partners include Scizor. Scizor can beat all of Starmie's checks (Tyranitar, Blissey, etc), while Starmie can easily beat Scizor's checks (Heatran, Skarmory, etc).

Other Options
########

A full out attacker set can be considered, as it gives you incredible coverage, but the main reason to use Starmie it's for it's ability to Rapid Spin. Starmie can potentially run a Reflect type set, as it beats most of Starmie's checks, like Ferrothorn and Tyranitar, but it's kinda gimmicky, and Starmie doesn't have much room to run it. Hidden Power Fire is a coverage option that an be considered for it's ability to hit Ferrothorn and Scizor for solid damage, but outside of that there's little use for it.


Checks and Counters
########

Pursuit trappers can eliminate Starmie from the game. Tyranitar, Weavile, Bisharp, and Scizor all make for good Pursuit users. Blissey, Chansey, and other special walls can tank anything Starme throws at them, but they can't stop Starmie from Rapid Spinning. Ghost types stop Starmie from Spinning, so Gourgiest and Trevenent can be considered checks, and they also can hit Starmie for solid damage with their respective STAB attacks. Bulky Grass-types can usually take on Starmie easily. Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss can easily stand up to Starmie if it isn't running Psyshock, while Celebi and Ferrothorn counter it regardless.
