Overview
########

After lurking in the dark depth of lower tiers for generations upon generations, Glalie has finally found a niche for itself in OU thanks to its new Mega Evolution, which grants it base 120 Attack and Special Attack stats alongside a fair base 100 Speed. However, the fun doesn't end there, as Mega Glalie is also granted Refrigerate as its ability. This means it has a very powerful, spammable STAB move in Double-Edge as well as an extremely powerful nuke in Explosion, which can easily deal immense damage to almost every Pokemon in OU, usually at least half of their maximum HP. Glalie also has good coverage options in Freeze-Dry and Earthquake. However, while it gives Glalie very valuable coverage, Earthquake when boosted by neither STAB nor an item is rather weak coming off base 120 Attack. Also, while Glalie's base 100 Speed is decent, it leaves Glalie easily revenge killed by many threats. Overall, Glalie makes for a good wallbreaker that requires little prediction to use and has a strong kill button in Explosion.

Moves
========

Explosion is Glalie's most powerful move, dealing very heavy damage to many Pokemon in OU, if not OHKOing them outright. It is so powerful that it can OHKO standard Ferrothorn before Stealth Rock damage. It can also come in handy to prevent opponents from removing entry hazards, as even if the foe isn't KOed outright, Rapid Spin and Defog will fail to remove entry hazards without a target. Double-Edge is a powerful, reliable, and spammable STAB move and is usually preferred over Return because the extra power makes it harder to switch into, and it has a chance to 2HKO threats such as Keldeo, Skarmory, and Azumarill. It also reduces the need to predict and use Freeze-Dry as often. However, Return can be used if taking recoil damage is undesirable. Earthquake is important for the coverage it provides against Fire- and Steel-types such as Heatran, Magnezone, and Bisharp. Freeze-Dry is recommended in the last moveslot to nail Water-types such as Keldeo, Azumarill, Rotom-W, Alomomola, and Slowbro, but Ice Shard can be used to pick off weakened threats.

Set Details
========

The given EVs maximize Glalie's Attack and Speed stats to help it deal out heavy damage. A Naughty nature is recommended over a Naive nature to give Glalie a higher chance to OHKO and 2HKO threats such as Keldeo, Rotom-W, Skarmory, defensive Mega Venusaur, and Azumarill with Double-Edge, but a Naive nature can be used to Speed tie with positive-natured base 100s, such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Medicham. An Adamant or Jolly nature can be used if Ice Shard is used over Freeze-Dry.

Usage Tips
========

Glalie is best used as a wallbreaker during the early-game, when its immense power with Explosion and Double-Edge is valued to break holes for a late-game sweeper. Because Glalie forces a lot of switches, it is best to try to predict and use the appropriate coverage move, but when all else fails, spamming Double-Edge is not a poor option, as even resisted attacks can still deal some good damage. Finally, Glalie should only use Explosion when there isn't much left for it to do and it can heavily damage a foe, or when you need to prevent a slower Defog or Rapid Spin.

Team Options
========

Magnezone and Magneton make useful partners for Glalie, as they can pick off Steel- and Water-types that trouble it. Also, Dragon- and Grass-types such as Latias, Latios, Kyurem-B, and Celebi help with beating Water-types such as Rotom-W and Keldeo. Also, Pokemon that appreciate having Dragon-types such as Latios, Latias, and Dragonite removed, such as Keldeo and Landorus, are good teammates for Glalie. Finally, Ground- and Fire-types such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, Garchomp, Talonflame, Heatran, and Victini help with beating Steel-types; these Ground-types can beat Fire-types as well.

Other Options
########

Spikes can be used to wear down foes and is relatively easy to set up thanks to the relatively high number of switches that Glalie forces, but Glalie is already hard-pressed for moveslots. Taunt can be used for stallbreaking purposes and preventing foes from using status moves, but like Spikes, it is hard to fit onto a moveset. Super Fang is an option to immediately take half of the HP of otherwise good checks to Glalie, such as Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross, but other moves are generally more valuable to Glalie. Protect can be used so Glalie gets a free turn to Mega Evolve, but it doesn't do much otherwise. Finally, Body Slam can be used for its chance to paralyze the target, but the extra power granted by Return and Double-Edge is too great of an advantage.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Water-types**: Water-types such as Slowbro, Mega Slowbro, Suicune, and Alomomola make for good checks to Glalie if it opts not to run Freeze-Dry. Calm Mind variants of Mega Slowbro and Suicune can boost their Special Defense, allowing them to stomach Freeze-Dry more easily.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types can take anything from Glalie except a STAB Refrigerate-boosted Explosion. Mega Metagross has good bulk and can outspeed Glalie and KO it with Meteor Mash. Mega Scizor, especially a bulkier variant, can take on Glalie very well by itself thanks to its good bulk, resistance to Ice-type attacks, and STAB Technician-boosted Bullet Punch. Jirachi, Cobalion, and Doublade are also good checks to Glalie.

**Faster Opponents**: Pokemon that can take an attack from Glalie and KO it back are good checks to it. Keldeo stands out by being able to take any one of Glalie's attacks and OHKO it back with Secret Sword. That said, not many Pokemon enjoy switching into Double-Edge, so revenge killers in general are a way to beat Glalie.
