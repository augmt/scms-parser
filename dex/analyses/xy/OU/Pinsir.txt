Overview
########

Mega Pinsir's access to Aerilate and Return as well as a large base 155 Attack stat make it an extremely powerful threat. In combination with Close Combat, Aerilate-boosted Return is unresisted in OU bar Zapdos and Thundurus, which can be both worn down with Stealth Rock and another Flying-type teammate. Swords Dance is a great boosting option that turns Mega Pinsir into a great cleaner, with its good bulk helping it to set up. Aerilate Quick Attack also means that Mega Pinsir can beat faster Pokemon such as Keldeo without having to boost its Speed.

Unfortunately for Mega Pinsir, as such a powerful threat it is prepared for by most teams. Thundurus, Talonflame, Rotom-W, Landorus-T, Mega Manectric, Raikou, Zapdos, and Skarmory are seen on many teams, and each one of them can reliably check or counter Mega Pinsir. This makes pulling off a sweep difficult at times, and means proper team support is needed in order to remove these checks and counters. Mega Pinsir also has a 4x Stealth Rock weakness once Mega Evolved and a 2x one pre-Mega Evolution, giving it limited switch-in and setup opportunities.

Moves
========

Swords Dance makes Mega Pinsir's attacks extremely powerful, helping it clean late-game. Return is a powerful STAB option that Aerilate turns Flying-type. Close Combat hits the Steel- and Rock-types that resist Return for super effective damage while also hitting Pokemon such as Rotom-W for neutral damage. It is especially useful for Heatran, Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp. Earthquake is another option to retain coverage on Tyranitar and Bisharp while OHKO Heatran, with the added benefit of not lowering Mega Pinsir's defensive stats. Lastly, Quick Attack provides a priority attack that can OHKO faster Pokemon such as Keldeo when Mega Pinsir is at +2.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed investment is used for as much power and Speed as possible. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed threats such as Mega Medicham and Charizard after Pinsir Mega Evolves. An Adamant nature is an option for more power and is guaranteed to OHKO Pokemon such as Slowbro with Return. Hyper Cutter gives Pinsir an immunity to Intimidate as Landorus-T switches in, thus allowing Swords Dance to have its full effect. This is important because while a +2 Return will OHKO defensive Landorus-T, a +1 Return won't. Mold Breaker, however, can be used with Earthquake in order to hit Rotom-W before Pinsir Mega Evolves. Moxie is another ability option that can be used to grab a free +1 boost if Pinsir can pick off something before it Mega Evolves.

Usage Tips
========

Pinsir is best used late-game when all its checks and counters have been weakened or removed. Try to keep Stealth Rock off the field at all times, as it deals a large amount of damage to Mega Pinsir upon switching in. It may be wise to delay Mega Evolution; for example, if Pinsir does not Mega Evolve against a weakened Thundurus, it can live a non-Life Orb Thunderbolt and proceed to finish it off with Return. Other examples include surviving non-Life Orb Excadrill's Rock Slide and defensive Landorus-T's Stone Edge. If Mold Breaker is being used, it can be beneficial to delay Mega Evolution in order to hit Rotom-W with a super effective Earthquake. Be wary of the defense drops caused by Close Combat; for example, Life Orb Bisharp can OHKO Mega Pinsir after a single Defense drop.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard removal is necessary in order to keep Pinsir healthy throughout the match. Excadrill is probably the best partner for Pinsir, as it removes entry hazards via Rapid Spin and hard walls any Thundurus lacking Focus Blast, which is one of Pinsir's biggest counters. Latias can also make for a good partner due to its ability to use Healing Wish, which can heal Pinsir no matter how weakened it has become. Pinsir pairs well with other Flying-types, such as Talonflame and Staraptor, as they force Mega Pinsir's counters in and weaken them to the point where Mega Pinsir can KO them. Stealth Rock can be crucial to put Slowbro in KO range of +2 Return and Heatran of unboosted Close Combat. Terrakion, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Mamoswine are all good Stealth Rock users. Electric-types such as Raikou, Magnezone, and Thundurus not only help to check opposing Flying-types, but are also immune to Thundurus's Thunder Wave. Magnezone can also trap and remove Skarmory, making it even more helpful. Rotom-W and Landorus-T are solid partners to handle Talonflame and Sand Rush Excadrill, two enormous threats to a Mega Pinsir sweep.

Other Options
########

Feint can replace Quick Attack in order to OHKO Talonflame after Stealth Rock damage. However, it misses out on notable KOs, such as OHKOing Greninja when Mega Pinsir is at +2. Alternative STAB moves to replace Return include Double-Edge and Thrash. The former hits extremely hard, but causes a large amount of recoil, while the latter is also extremely powerful but locks Pinsir into the move. X-Scissor is another STAB option, but it doesn't hit anything that the moves on the set don't, providing largely redundant coverage, and is thus a mediocre option. Finally, Stone Edge can be used instead of Swords Dance as a fourth attack to nail Thundurus and Zapdos.

Checks & Counters
########

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Raikou, Choice Scarf Magnezone, and Mega Manectric can take a Quick Attack and OHKO Mega Pinsir with Thunderbolt. Zapdos gets a special mention for being able to live a +2 Return even after Stealth Rock while OHKOing Mega Pinsir back with Thunderbolt. Thundurus can OHKO Mega Pinsir with Thunderbolt or use Prankster Thunder Wave to let another teammate revenge kill Mega Pinsir. Mega Ampharos is also capable of taking a hit and OHKOing back with Thunderbolt. Finally, Rotom-W and Rotom-H can take an attack and use either Will-O-Wisp to cripple Pinsir or Volt Switch to finish it off, though they must be wary of Mold Breaker Earthquake, and can be finished off if a bit weakened with a +2 Close Combat.

**Rock-types**: Rhyperior can live a +2 Earthquake or Close Combat from Mega Pinsir and OHKO back with Stone Edge. Mega Aerodactyl resists Quick Attack and can OHKO Mega Pinsir with Stone Edge as well. Terrakion, though, not a switch-in, can survive a +2 attack and easily KO Mega Pinsir with its Rock-type STAB.

**Bulky Physical Walls**: Skarmory walls Mega Pinsir and can either Whirlwind it out or KO it with Counter. +2 Return has a good chance to 2HKO Skarmory after Stealth Rock, however, so it must be kept healthy if it wants to counter Mega Pinsir throughout the game. Landorus-T and Hippowdon can both live a +2 Return and OHKO with Stone Edge.

**Talonflame**: Talonflame can use its access to priority Brave Bird to OHKO Mega Pinsir.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Terrakion, Heatran, Excadrill, and Garchomp can all live a +2 Quick Attack at full health and OHKO Mega Pinsir with a Rock-type move.

**Status**: Burns from the likes of Will-O-Wisp and Scald can seriously decrease Pinsir's damage output, while paralysis can slow Pinsir down and make it much easier to revenge kill.

**Stealth Rock**: Stealth Rock limits the amount of times Mega Pinsir can switch in and gives it limited setup opportunities.
