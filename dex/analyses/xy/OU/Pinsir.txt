Overview
########

Mega Pinsir is a powerful offensive threat with a high Attack stat that can be furthered by Swords Dance as well as Aerilate, which powers up its Normal-type moves and turns them into secondary STAB moves. Mega Pinsir's access to an Aerilate-boosted Quick Attack means that it is capable of outright OHKOing certain faster attackers, and with new additions to the metagame such as Mega Lopunny, Mega Sceptile, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Gallade, things have only gotten better for Mega Pinsir. Additionally, Mega Pinsir's decent bulk means that it doesn't find setting up too difficult. However, Pinsir is weak to Stealth Rock, especially after Mega Evolving, and it is shut down by burns and paralysis. Finally, a multitude of common threats, such as Talonflame, Rotom-W, Thundurus, Skarmory, Landorus-T, and Zapdos, are highly problematic for it.

Moves
========

Swords Dance boosts Pinsir's Attack to frighteningly high levels, allowing it to tear through foes and do some late-game cleaning once its checks and counters are out of the way. Return becomes a mighty 199 Base Power Flying-type attack after Aerilate and STAB. Close Combat has great neutral coverage with Return, hitting Pokemon such as Heatran, Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Magnezone for super effective damage, and it inflicts neutral damage on targets such as Rotom-W. Earthquake is an alternative choice for the third moveslot with very similar coverage to Close Combat. Its advantages over the latter are the ability to OHKO Heatran without a boost, plus coverage against Mega Diancie and the ability to 2HKO Mega Metagross without a boost and OHKO it after a Swords Dance. Additionally, it does not come with any detrimental side effects, unlike Close Combat. Quick Attack is an Aerilate-boosted priority attack that is suprisingly powerful; at +2, it OHKOes faster attackers such as Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, Mega Sceptile, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Gallade.

Set Details
========

Pinsirite enables Pinsir to Mega Evolve, allowing it to function as a fearsome late-game cleaner. Attack and Speed are maximized to give Pinsir the greatest possible chance of outspeeding and KOing its foes, and with a Jolly nature, Mega Pinsir outspeeds base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Charizard, Mega Gardevoir, and Mew. One can opt for an Adamant nature should they desire a greater damage output, though Pinsir is generally better off making the most of its Speed tier. Landorus-T, a common switch-in to Pinsir, has its Intimidate negated by Pinsir's Hyper Cutter. Pinsir also needs to keep its Attack from being lowered in order to OHKO defensive Landorus-T variants after a Swords Dance. Hyper Cutter in combination with Earthquake can also allow Pinsir to OHKO Mega Manectric if it tries to switch in the turn Pinsir Mega Evolves. Mold Breaker can be chosen as Pinsir's ability if you run Earthquake, as it allows Pinsir to strike Rotom-W for super effective damage on the switch in. Moxie is a possibility, as it enables Pinsir to nab an Attack boost should it pick off a weakened foe without Mega Evolving, though it isn't generally worth leaving Pinsir open to revenge killing with a middling base 85 Speed, and Pinsir should be doing its boosting via Swords Dance.

Usage Tips
========

Pinsir should be sent out to clean up late-game once its teammates have sufficiently removed or weakened Pokemon that could prove to be threatening. Ideally, a teammate should have removed Stealth Rock from your side of the field before you bring Pinsir in. Mega Evolution can be delayed to take advantage of Pinsir's ability; for example, Hyper Cutter variants should delay Mega Evolving and use Swords Dance if you predict defensive Landorus-T to switch in, Mold Breaker variants should delay Mega Evolving and use Earthquake if you predict that Rotom-W will switch in, and Moxie variants should attempt to revenge kill a weakened foe to net an Attack boost in the process. Similarly, Pinsir's typing prior to Mega Evolution can come in handy. For example, Pinsir can survive a Stone Edge or Rock Slide from checks such as defensive Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Excadrill, respectively, which its Mega Evolution cannot do.

Team Options
========

Stealth Rock eats a chunk out of Pinsir's HP when it switches in, and this amount of damage is even higher if switches in after having Mega Evolved. Therefore, Rapid Spin or Defog support is mandatory. Excadrill can spin away entry hazards and handle any Thundurus that is not running Focus Blast. Latias also makes for a good partner, as it can provide Defog support as well as give a weakened Mega Pinsir about to fall prey to Stealth Rock a second chance with Healing Wish. Other Flying-type attackers such as Staraptor and Talonflame can lure in Pinsir's checks and wear them down so that the latter can clean up and finish the job. Rotom-W and Landorus-T are good answers to the omnipresent Talonflame, which would otherwise ruin Mega Pinsir's cleaning spree. As Skarmory is such a menace for Mega Pinsir, it is only natural that one should pair the latter with Magnezone in order to trap and eliminate it. Like any offensive Pokemon, Pinsir appreciates entry hazard support in order to net KOs with greater ease. For example, after Stealth Rock, Heatran is OHKOed by an unboosted Close Combat, and Slowbro is very likely to be OHKOed by a +2 Return. Landorus-T, Mamoswine, and Heatran are examples of Stealth Rock setters.

Other Options
########

A +2 Feint outspeeds and OHKOes Talonflame after Stealth Rock, though the loss of power often means that Mega Pinsir finds itself missing out on KOs that would be achieved by Quick Attack. Double-Edge and Thrash can be chosen over Return by virtue of their higher Base Power, though their side effects (recoil damage and locking the user into the attack, respectively) are unappealing. Additionally, Double-Edge is illegal with both Quick Attack and Feint, and Mega Pinsir certainly does not wish to forgo priority. Stone Edge nails Zapdos, which can take any other moves from Pinsir and KO it with Thunderbolt. However, its coverage doesn't have any real uses outside of this. Substitute blocks status and protects Pinsir from being revenge killed, potentially stopping foes such as Rotom-W and Talonflame from halting a sweep. Pinsir can attempt a Flail + Substitute strategy in a set, and should it reach 1 HP via use of Substitute, Mega Pinsir will have an impressive 200 Base Power Flying-type STAB move that is further boosted by Aerilate at its disposal. If Pinsir is partnered with Magnezone, Knock Off is an option, as it removes Shed Shells from Skarmory and Ferrothorn to allow Magnezone to trap them. Bulk Up is an alternative means of boosting, but Swords Dance is better, as Pinsir prefers the extra power to a Defense boost.

Checks and Counters
########
**Electric-types**: Electric-types resist Mega Pinsir's STAB moves, and faster ones, such as Thundurus, Mega Manectric, and Choice Scarf Magnezone, outspeed Mega Pinsir, can take a Quick Attack, and can OHKO it with a STAB attack. Thundurus resists Close Combat, is immune to Earthquake, and can directly KO Mega Pinsir with Thunderbolt or use Thunder Wave, which has priority thanks to Prankster, making it Pinsir vulnerable to being revenge killed. A boosted Close Combat only gets a 2HKO on Rotom-W, which can either burn Pinsir with Will-O-Wisp or hit it with Volt Switch in return, though Rotom-W should be cautious about switching in on Mold Breaker Pinsir. Finally, Zapdos's bulk and typing make it an excellent answer to Mega Pinsir; even after a Swords Dance, Return is only a 2HKO.

**Faster Attackers that are not KOed by Quick Attack**: Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Terrakion, and Choice Scarf Tyranitar can safely survive a Quick Attack and proceed to OHKO Mega Pinsir with Stone Edge. Mega Metagross also fits this category; after taking a Quick Attack, it can OHKO Mega Pinsir with Meteor Mash or Ice Punch after Stealth Rock damage. Weather sweepers such as Excadrill and Kabutops deter Pinsir from setting up, as both outspeed Pinsir under the effects of sand and rain, respectively, and can potentially OHKO it. Finally, Mega Diancie fears nothing except Earthquake and can OHKO Mega Pinsir with Diamond Storm.

**Priority Attackers**: OU is chock-full of powerful priority attackers that can pick off Mega Pinsir. Talonflame's Brave Bird will always outprioritize Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack thanks to Gale Wings, and it OHKOes Mega Pinsir at full health. Other Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Azumarill, and Bisharp can survive a Quick Attack from Pinsir and KO it when it is weakened with their respective priority attacks. However, Bisharp must be wary of its Sucker Punch failing should Mega Pinsir use Swords Dance or Quick Attack.

**Physically Defensive Pokemon**: Skarmory can phaze Mega Pinsir with Whirlwind after taking a boosted hit, making Mega Pinsir lose its boosts. Alternatively, if Mega Pinsir is sufficiently weakened, then Skarmory can KO it with Brave Bird. In a similar vein, Hippowdon can tank a hit and phaze Mega Pinsir with Whirlwind. Landorus-T has Intimidate to neuter Mega Pinsir and can OHKO it with Stone Edge after taking a hit, though Pinsir has Hyper Cutter on the turn it Mega Evolves, nullifying Intimidate and allowing it to boost to +2 Attack instead of +1, guaranteeing a clean OHKO.

**Status**: Pinsir despises being inflicted with a burn or paralysis from moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, respectively. When burned, Pinsir's damage output is cut, and when paralyzed, it is forced to rely on Quick Attack lest it be revenge killed. Thundurus and Sableye have +1 priority status-inducing moves at their disposal thanks to Prankster, making them threats to Mega Pinsir.

**Stealth Rock**: The presence of Stealth Rock makes it difficult for Pinsir to set up and switch in and out of battle, especially after Mega Evolving.
