Overview
######## 

Omastar is one of the most solid Pokemon to use on rain teams because it can aid other sweepers, such as Kingdra and Kabutops. On top of that, its immediate power causes it to force the opposition either to sack a Pokemon or to have one of their walls take massive damage, and in most scenarios, Hydro Pump will easily 2HKO whatever Omastar is facing. Omastar also checks Talonflame and Mega Pinsir, giving it a niche unique to only itself and Kabutops. However, Omastar is outpaced by common Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Keldeo and is very reliant on rain to do its job. It also compounds rain teams' Thundurus weakness, meaning it has to be played carefully. Omastar also faces competition from Kabutops because of their similar typings, so having both on the same team is unfavorable in most scenarios.

Moves
======== 

Hydro Pump is Omastar's main STAB move when bulky walls such as Mega Venusaur are still in play, as it can 2HKO them after Stealth Rock damage. However, Scald remains Omastar's main choice against more offensive teams because it hits more than hard enough and can spread burns. Ice Beam is an obligatory coverage move, handy for hitting Grass-types. Knock Off hits the most common switch-in to Omastar, Chansey, for good damage and removes its Eviolite so that Omastar can 2HKO it later. 

Set Details
========

A Modest nature, Choice Specs, and maximum Special Attack investment are required to let Omastar wallbreak and clean effectively. A Life Orb can be used to switch moves, but recoil damage makes Omastar lose a lot of power as well as its ability to check Talonflame well.

Usage Tips 
========

Omastar should be played recklessly by spamming Hydro Pump against stall teams and using Knock Off to remove Chansey's Eviolite and Azumarill's Assault Vest on the switch. Scald should be used to clean up weakened teams if Omastar is still alive late-game.

Team Options
========

Politoed is obviously a mandatory teammate to set up rain. Kingdra is an excellent partner for Omastar because they share checks and counters, most notably Ferrothorn, and can slowly break past them with their powerful Hydro Pumps, allowing one to sweep the remainder of the opposition. Defog Latios and Latias are great for removing entry hazards because Omastar will switch out a lot. Pokemon that can check Thundurus, such as Mega Manectric, Magnezone, and Raikou, are valuable teammates for Omastar. They can also safely use Thunder thanks to Politoed's rain. Mega Heracross can break past Omastar's soft counters, such as Mega Venusaur, Assault Vest Azumarill, Empoleon, and Amoonguss, making it a very good team option. Solid pivots such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W are also useful to allow Omastar to get onto the field safely. Healing Wish Jirachi and Latias are also excellent teammates because they allow Omastar a second chance to sweep.

Other Options
########

Omastar does not have many other options. Hidden Power Grass can be used to beat Gastrodon, but losing Knock Off is huge. A Shell Smash set is possible, but priority users being able to pick it off and such a set's continued trouble with Ferrothorn and Thundurus makes it hard to consider. However, it completely destroys stall teams with some of its checks weakened. For instance, Chansey is 2HKOed after a boost while unable to do anything back except Toxic or Seismic Toss.

Checks & Counters
########

**Choice Scarf Users**: Omastar is quite slow, so faster Choice Scarf users, such as Garchomp, can outspeed it even under rain and KO it with a powerful attack.

**Special Walls**: Special walls such as Chansey and Blissey, as well as tanks such as Assault Vest Goodra, can take Omastar's hits with relative ease and can either cripple or outright KO it, but they all must watch out for Knock Off.

**Priority Users**: Omastar is weak to a few common priority attacks; Mach Punch from Conkeldurr or Technician Breloom will easily take it out.

**Grass-types**: Although Omastar has Ice Beam to handle most Grass-types, there are a few that it just can't deal with. Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn both take neutral damage from Ice-type attacks thanks to Thick Fat and its Steel typing, respectively. Both Pokemon also have 4x super effective STAB Grass-type moves to take Omastar down with ease; however, Ferrothorn can be worn down easily, and Mega Venusaur is 2HKOed by Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock, so be cautious. Though it is weak to Ice Beam, Amoonguss is also a good check to Omastar because of Giga Drain.

**Water-types**: Omastar has a hard time dealing with opposing Water-types. Gyarados takes neutral damage from Ice Beam and Hidden Power Grass, and bulky variants of it essentially counter Omastar, especially those with Earthquake. Rotom-W is also a bulky Water-type that can take down Omastar with its STAB Electric-type moves. Empoleon and Assault Vest Azumarill are other good options, but all of these are soft counters because they can be worn down very easily and still take massive damage from Hydro Pump.
