Overview
########

With the gift of just one move, Boomburst, Exploud became a powerful wallbreaker. Boomburst is responsible for any shred of viability Exploud could ever have in OU, simply because it hits like a wrecking ball when Exploud is equipped with Choice Specs. With Scrappy, Exploud can hit Ghost-types with Boomburst and Focus Blast. Exploud also has the perfect two coverage moves to deal with things that resist Boomburst; Overheat and Focus Blast cover virtually all Steel- and Rock-types. However, Exploud's relatively poor bulk&mdash;even with a good base 104 HP&mdash;limits its wallbreaking potential. It also has a low Speed stat, which makes Exploud incredibly easy to revenge kill with faster attackers. Nevertheless, it still hits tremendously hard with Boomburst, its one essential niche.

Moves
========

Boomburst is the move Exploud will be using the majority of the time, as it is incredibly powerful and can even hit Ghost-types thanks to Scrappy, as well as hit through Substitutes, which means Pokemon that would normally be safe from being revenge killed are no trouble for Exploud. Even some Steel-types are 2HKOed by Boomburst, including Excadrill and Scizor. However, for a more effective way of getting rid of these Pokemon, Overheat is useful.Meanwhile, Focus Blast hits Rock-types, most notably Tyranitar, as well as Heatran, which is immune to Overheat. Exploud covers so much in just these three moves that the move in the fourth slot is basically just down to personal preference. Unlike Overheat, Flamethrower hits Steel-types without forcing Exploud out, while Surf is a more reliable method of dealing with Heatran and Tyranitar if the accuracy of Focus Blast is unreliable in any given situation.

Set Details
========

The item choice is rather obvious, as Choice Specs just makes Exploud so powerful. A Modest nature adds to this, and Exploud doesn't need to run a Speed boosting nature as it sits at an awkward Speed tier. However, this doesn't stop Speed investment from being useful to benefit from Sticky Web and outspeed defensive Pokemon that don't invest in their Speed stat, such as Rotom-W. The Special Attack investment is obviously in order to increase Exploud's power, while Scrappy is chosen for the ability over Soundproof as it enables Exploud to hit Ghost-types with both Boomburst and Focus Blast. Note that if you are using Exploud to receive Speed boosts from a Baton Pass user, Life Orb is a fine item choice as Exploud will have much better sweeping potential overall with the freedom to change moves.

Usage Tips
========

Exploud should not be used as a sweeper as it is simply too slow to sweep. Instead, Exploud is most comfortable in the role of a wallbreaker, which it pulls off effectively with the great power of Boomburst. In regard to Boomburst, even Pokemon that resist it take a hefty chunk from it, so it is a safe move to use in most situations and is definitely the move that should be used the most. Note that two consecutive Overheats are more powerful than two consecutive Flamethrowers, so it is generally better to use against Steel-types. Finally, it is incredibly important to understand that Exploud isn't that bulky, so it shouldn't try to frequently switch into attacks. Try using teammates with Volt Switch or U-turn to guarantee that it gets in safely.

Team Options
========

Partners that have some way of remedying Exploud's major flaw&mdash;its poor Speed&mdash;are really helpful. There are a variety of ways to do this; Sticky Web is one of the best as it easy to set up and affects the majority of Exploud's common switch-ins. Common users of the move are Smeargle and Galvantula. If the opponent has Sticky Web on their side of the field, then Exploud is able to outspeed Pokemon such as Jolly Terrakion and Timid Keldeo. If using Sticky Web, a teammate capable of defeating Bisharp, such as Keldeo or Conkeldurr, is recommended. If Sticky Web isn't your cup of tea, then another way to boost Exploud's Speed is by using it as the receiver of Speed boosts from a Pokemon with Baton Pass, Scolipede being the best example for this.

U-turn and Volt Switch users can get Exploud into battle safely while retaining momentum. Landorus-T can check the physical Fighting-types that trouble Exploud, but Rotom-W and Scizor are also good choices. A physical wallbreaker is a great partner to break through the special walls that trouble Exploud. Terrakion, Mega Pinsir, and Kyurem-B are all great in this regard. In general, any team with Exploud needs a way of beating Chansey and Blissey. Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp and Tyranitar are pretty good choices for beating Chansey and Blissey. Strong Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion can do the trick, as can Landorus or Landorus-T with Knock Off, which cripples Chansey severely and does a hefty amount to Blissey. Another perk of using Landorus and Landorus-T is that they resist Fighting-type moves. Additionally, if Chansey has its Eviolite knocked off, this gives Exploud a chance to 2HKO it with either Boombust or Focus Blast, depending on Chansey's EVs and nature.

Other Options
########

A Silk Scarf is a good choice as an alternate item as it gives Exploud the freedom to switch moves. It is better used on sets that receive Speed boosts, as otherwise you give up a lot of wallbreaking potential.

Checks & Counters
########

**Chansey and Blissey**: Chansey and Blissey completely wall Exploud, and they can reliably stall it out with Toxic while recovering off the damage that they take with either Soft-Boiled or Wish + Protect. This makes these two Pokemon arguably the best switch-ins to Exploud in the game. However, Chansey has a fair chance of getting 2HKOed by Focus Blast or Boomburst if its Eviolite has been knocked off or stolen.

**Sylveon**: Specially defensive Sylveon only has a 0.4% chance to be 2HKOed by Exploud's Boomburst after Leftovers recovery, so it is safe to say that it is a decent check to it, as it can wear Exploud down with Hyper Voice while recovering off the damage it takes with Wish + Protect. However, for it to be a reliable switch-in, Stealth Rock must be off the field. Any other Sylveon variant, such as physically defensive or Choice Specs, is 2HKOed by Boomburst with no questions asked.

**Conkeldurr**: Assault Vest Conkeldurr differs from other, faster Fighting-types in its method of KOing Exploud. While it can't switch in on it without risking being 2HKOed, it can simply come on after Exploud has attained a KO, tank a Boomburst, and then OHKO Exploud with Drain Punch, recovering some of the HP lost in the process. If Exploud is at around 64% HP, Conkeldurr can safely KO it with Mach Punch.

**Faster, strong attackers**: Talonflame can safely OHKO Exploud after Stealth Rock with its own priority Brave Bird, even though it can not switch directly into Boomburst or Surf. Other priority users may suffice, although aside from Mach Punch users, none can OHKO Exploud like Talonflame can. Landorus can OHKO it after Stealth Rock with Earth Power or Focus Blast, while Thundurus-T can also use Focus Blast or Thunderbolt to end its reign of terror. Mega Charizard Y can destroy it with sun-boosted Fire Blasts, while Gengar's Focus Blast obliterates it as well. Most importantly of all, powerful and fast Fighting-types such as Terrakion, Keldeo, Lucario, and Mega Medicham can revenge kill Exploud with incredible ease, as they are all faster than it and possess a STAB Fighting-type move to swiftly OHKO Exploud. If Exploud is only slightly weakened, almost any faster Pokemon can revenge kill it.
