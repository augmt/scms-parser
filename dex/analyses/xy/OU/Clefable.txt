Overview
########

Generation after generation, Clefable has languished in the shadows of its many contemporaries, but no more is this the case, as Clefable's astronomical rise to OU super-stardom is attributed to its brand-spanking new Fairy typing. Two phenomenal abilities in Magic Guard and Unaware allow Clefable to take on a multitude of roles including a Magic Guard + Calm Mind user, an Unaware physical wall, an effective Stealth Rock setter, and an offensive tank. With Unaware, Clefable is able to effortlessly halt a significant quantity of boosting sweepers, whereas Magic Guard works fantastically in negating every form of residual damage, making Clefable an incredibly dangerous Pokemon for stall-based teams and nearly impossible to wear down. Furthermore, Clefable's amazing movepool—both supportive and offensive—along with its outstanding abilities allows it to perform all of its given roles incredibly well, and showcases its potential to adapt in a constantly changing metagame, all the while making it the perfect glue to many teams, easily stitching the holes in teams that struggle with top-tier threats such as Azumarill, Thundurus, and the various Fighting- and Dragon-types inhabiting the OU tier. In stark contrast to how vast Clefable's movepool is, its stats pale in comparison. With not a single base stat over 100, it is quite apparent that Clefable must often specialize in only two stats in order to achieve the most success for any of its sets. While Clefable's typing is unquestionably good, its mediocre defenses can only take it so far. This flaw is all the more evident when Clefable is compared to sturdier supporters such as Chansey, which, unlike Clefable, has the raw bulk to take on the likes of Mega Charizard Y. However, it is Clefable's sheer versatility that always puts its user one step ahead of the opponent, and ultimately makes it the wild card of the match.

Magic Guard + Calm Mind
########
name: Magic Guard + Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Moonblast
move 3: Soft-Boiled
move 4: Flamethrower
ability: Magic Guard
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
evs: 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Calm Mind bolsters Clefable's special stats, allowing it to both withstand special attacks with greater ease as well as dish out moderately strong attacks of its own after a few boosts. Moonblast is a must with any Clefable, as it is its most reliable STAB move. Some key benchmarks to keep note of is that Clefable must have two boosts to OHKO Latias, Assault Vest Conkeldurr, and Mandibuzz. Soft-Boiled is essential for reliably replenishing Clefable's health. Flamethrower does well in damaging most Steel-types; for instance, after a single boost, it OHKOes Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. It also threatens switch-ins of Pokemon such as Excadrill, Bisharp, and Magnezone. If desired, Stored Power can be run in the last slot to slaughter Chansey, Mega Venusaur, and Heatran at +6. However, it is generally not recommended, as Chansey can be beaten with a Flamethrower burn or at worst stalled out if it is not carrying a status move, Mega Venusaur is already beaten thanks to the given EV spread, and the only type of Heatran that is threatening to Clefable&mdash;defensive&mdash;typically runs Taunt. Plus, the lack of Flamethrower's coverage is heavily debilitating.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread allows Clefable to avoid 2HKOs from Life Orb Greninja's Hydro Pump, Life Orb Thundurus's Thunderbolt, Life Orb Latios's Psyshock, and Life Orb Kyurem-B's Ice Beam without any boosts, enabling Clefable to serve as an effective check to these Pokemon. It also prevents Mega Venusaur from 2HKOing with Sludge Bomb if Clefable uses Calm Mind on the switch-in, then a second Calm Mind as Mega Venusaur attacks with Sludge Bomb. While not to be relied on, the special bulk also allows Clefable to survive two Life Orb-boosted Earth Powers from Landorus approximately 90% of the time if it uses Calm Mind after the first Earth Power, as well as two Psychics from Modest Mega Alakazam 94.1% of the time.

If Life Orb is chosen for the item, it is impossible for Clefable to reach similar Special Defense benchmarks to the given spread without significant cost to physical bulk. With Life Orb, a spread of 252 HP / 176 Def / 80 SpA and a Bold nature is recommended, allowing Clefable to 2HKO Chansey 100% of the time with +6 Moonblast and thus make it a more effective stallbreaker. If Chansey attempts to stall out its Moonblast PP, Clefable can fish for a burn with Flamethrower if needed. A fully defensive spread is also an opion with Leftovers, allowing Clefable to serve as a somewhat reliable answer to Mega Heracross, though it can be broken through with a lucky crit on one of the Rock Blast hits, which is actually not all that unlikely, as it has a 27.6% chance to crit at least once.

The key to this set's success is Magic Guard. With this ability, Clefable is completely uninhibited by status moves, allowing it to boost in the face of weak walls such as Chansey and Quagsire. In light of other possibilities, Clefable is able to use Magic Guard in tandem with Soft-Boiled, thus lessening the need for more convoluted healing methods, such as Wish + Protect. Moreover, Magic Guard's utility opens the floodgate of options by allowing Clefable to utilize items such as Life Orb without being subjugated to nasty recoil.

Leftovers is generally preferred as the item option, preventing Clefable from being worn down quite as easily and allowing it to reach the Special Defense benchmarks provided with the given EV spread. However, though it might seem like a strange choice, Life Orb is also an option due to the fact that Clefable is impervious to passive damage via Magic Guard along with its access to reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled lessens the need for Leftovers. When its attacks are boosted by a Life Orb, Clefable is able to achieve KOs it wouldn't have otherwise, such as on Latias and Conkeldurr at +1 with Moonblast. With a Life Orb, Clefable also has a better chance to come out on top versus Chansey, making it a very effective stallbreaker.

Usage Tips
========

This set is fairly straightforward and easy to use: have Clefable come in on a weak wall such as Rotom-W, Mandibuzz, or Chansey, and from there, it can set up Calm Mind against these threats with no concern. It's good, however, to dispose of Whirlwind and/or Roar users and remove Heatran before attempting to do this, as all these threats keep Clefable in line so long as they're healthy. As far as teams to use this Clefable on, it best fits on almost any team in need of a stallbreaker or a generally good sweeper. Do keep in mind that one of this Clefable's primary purposes is to take out stall, so it's best not to force it to assume the role of a wall itself; be cautious if you attempt to switch it into more powerful physical attackers such as Garchomp and Terrakion.

Forcing a switch on the likes of Dragonite or doing the above is usually the best way to get off a Calm Mind boost or two. Keep this in mind: don't get too greedy with boosts. Having Clefable accumulate too many boosts increases the odds of a critical hit occurring, which ends up only wasting turns and time, and ultimately puts you in a bad position if Clefable is taken out this way. Teams often carry multiple checks to Clefable, most of them being Fire-weak Steel-types. To take advantage of that, it's good to go for Flamethrower once Clefable forces a switch as opposed to Calm Mind; this way, it can take out at least one of its checks, thus making it easier to pull off a sweep later on in the match.

Team Options
========

Magic Guard Clefable is very self-sufficient and fits on almost any team, but it appreciates Pokemon that deal with Heatran, and to a lesser extent, Bisharp. Keldeo and Quagsire are perfect partners, given their ability to easily plow through or wall both of these Pokemon respectively and work as solid switch-ins. As Heatran and Bisharp are unlikely to stay in on Keldeo and Quagsire, Clefable would benefit even more when paired with a Pokemon that lures out both of these threats and nails them on the switch. One such notable example is Earthquake Latios, which does a colossal amount of damage to the two Steel-types should they be foolish enough to directly come in.

Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Moonblast
move 2: Wish
move 3: Protect
move 4: Heal Bell / Thunder Wave
ability: Unaware
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
=======

Moonblast is Clefable's compulsory STAB move, as its great neutral coverage and solid Base Power does well in wearing down bulky targets such as Rotom-W. With Wish + Protect, Clefable works as a solid Wish passer for balanced and stall-based teams. Protect also does well in gathering Leftovers recovery, allowing a worn-out Clefable to avoid a potential 2HKO. Heal Bell allows Clefable to act as a reliable cleric; therefore, it permits Clefable's offensive teammates to play a bit more aggressively, as the threat of status is watered down to a significant degree. On the other hand, Thunder Wave is fantastic on Clefable for crippling setup sweepers it has difficulty KOing such as Mega Tyranitar and Mega Gyarados, and immobilizing common switch-ins such as Mega Charizard Y and Gengar, thus creating an advantageous situation for its teammates.

Should your team lack a dedicated Stealth Rock user, then Clefable can perform this role exceptionally well, given its ability to force switches and discourage several common Defog users such as Latios and Mandibuzz from coming in and removing the entry hazard. Toxic may be used in the last slot to cripple Hippowdon, Zapdos, Volcarona, Talonflame, and bulky Mega Charizard X. Just be wary that many of Clefable's common switch-ins are completely unfazed by Toxic, as they are either Poison- or Steel-types. Moonlight is an option over Wish + Protect so that Clefable acquires an extra moveslot to support its teammates, although the low PP and dilution under sandstorm makes this move a rather high opportunity cost, especially when taking into account that this Clefable needs all the PP it can get when it's up against opposing stall teams. Lastly, Calm Mind is also viable as it gives Clefable the capability to overpower bulky setup sweepers such as Manaphy and opposing Calm Mind Clefable.

Set Details
========

The set is geared more towards physical defense, as it allows Clefable to better deal with the likes of Garchomp and Terrakion. Should your team have a proper way of dealing with boosting sweepers, Clefable may forgo Unaware in exchange for Magic Guard. Due to its immunity to all forms of passive damage, Magic Guard Clefable makes for a much more efficient Wish passer. Magic Guard also gives Clefable more flexibility in its moveslots, as it can now run Soft-Boiled for recovery, giving it an extra moveslot to support its teammates with or utilize a coverage move such as Flamethrower. Do note, however, that the entire allure towards using defensive Clefable is to remove the threat of setup sweepers; you'll find that by forgoing Unaware, not only does Clefable lose the ability to counter Pokemon it's supposed to, but its sheer passiveness allows a multitude of bulky threats to set up on it.

A specially defensive spread is a viable alternative, as it allows Clefable to hard counter Greninja, all variants of Nasty Plot Thundurus, and Tail Glow Manaphy while still having enough bulk to comfortably wall the likes of Conkeldurr and better deal with Keldeo and Sludge Wave-less Landorus. The only issue with such a spread is that Clefable struggles to tank physical attacks, thus reducing the overall pool of Pokemon it normally beats. In particular, Garchomp's Earthquake and Latios's Psyshock will do a sizable chunk, so much so that Clefable should only switch in with the utmost prudence.

Usage Tips
========

Defensive Clefable best fits on balanced or stall teams in need of cleric and/or Wish support. Clefable's ability to check or counter the likes of Garchomp, Manaphy, Thundurus, Swords Dance Talonflame, Mega Tyranitar, Azumarill, Kyurem-B, Dragonite, Latios, Conkeldurr, Terrakion, Suicune, and Breloom, as well as soft check many other setup sweepers courtesy of its defensive typing and Unaware, makes it invaluable on these sorts of teams. Clefable is best brought out to check the above threats, and may be done so at nearly any moment of the match.

When up against offensive teams, Clefable is able to force many switches; as such, this is the best time to fire off a Thunder Wave to cripple the opposing switch-in or lay Stealth Rock on the field. Keep in mind that if Clefable's health is around 50% upon switching into a certain threat, then it's better to simply recover at that moment so that Clefable can continue to check the Pokemon in question. Also, due to its low PP, Heal Bell is to be used sparingly, especially when up against opposing stall teams where the cleric's role is invaluable in winning the status war. It's good to keep in mind, however, that unlike Heal Bell, it's advisable for Clefable to use Protect to scout for certain coverage options such as Iron Head from Kyurem-B, or accumulate Leftovers recovery in order to avoid a possible 2HKO from Terrakion's Life Orb-boosted Stone Edge, among other attacks.

Team Options
========

In terms of defensive partners, Clefable works quite well with the following: Mega Venusaur, Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Landorus-T. Clefable provides Heal Bell support to all four, which is much appreciated given that the above Pokemon detest burns; in return, Quagsire, Landorus-T, and Hippodown help check Steel-types such as Heatran, Excadrill, Mega Scizor, and Bisharp, whereas Mega Venusaur easily deals with Keldeo and some of the previously mentioned Steel-types.

More offensively inclined partners include Mega Medicham, Mega Gyarados, and Conkeldurr. Due to Clefable's vulnerability to Steel-types, and to a lesser extent, Poison-types, the above Pokemon are useful in more ways than one. Mega Medicham easily destroys any Steel-type with its STAB-boosted High Jump Kick and slaughters Mega Venusaur with Zen Headbutt. Just like Mega Medicham, Conkeldurr also helps deal with Steel-types, but it also takes down Gengar thanks to its meaty defenses and Guts ability, which allow it to easily tank a Shadow Ball and take advantage of Will-O-Wisp. Lastly, Mega Gyarados forces out many of Clefable's checks and proceeds to set up afterwards. It goes without saying that Clefable can also aid the Pokemon in question; for instance, Clefable provides cleric support for the former two and Wish support to all three, all the while keeping Latios in line for Conkeldurr and Mega Medicham as well as Thundurus for Mega Gyarados.

Stealth Rock
########
name: Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Moonblast
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Soft-Boiled
ability: Magic Guard
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is a great move on Clefable, as it can get rid of most Defoggers and Rapid Spin users with the combination of Moonblast and Fire Blast; Clefable also has naturally good bulk and a great defensive typing, allowing it to switch into most entry hazard removers, force them out, and set up Stealth Rock again. Moonblast is a STAB move that deals decent amounts of damage. Fire Blast provides necessary coverage for Clefable, as it can OHKO Mega Scizor after Stealth Rock; it also 2HKOes Ferrothorn. Skarmory is also 2HKOed by Fire Blast and is thus prevented from being able to Defog against Clefable, which is very important, and can nail Excadrill switch-ins attempting to spin away Stealth Rock. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast due to its higher accuracy and PP, but the loss in power is very noticeable, and it won't be able to achieve the KOs noted above. Soft-Boiled provides reliable recovery, which is great for Clefable as it can't be worn down by status and can tank most hits. Thunder Wave is also an option over Fire Blast to cripple faster threats such as Choice Scarf users, but it is not usually worth the slot, as Fire Blast is simply too important.

Set Details
========

With a Calm nature and the given EVs, Clefable can avoid the 2HKO from Greninja's Hydro Pump, Thundurus's Life Orb-boosted Thunderbolt, and Latios's Psyshock (most of the time). The Defense EVs also help Clefable avoid the 2HKO from Mega Gyarados's Waterfall after Leftovers recovery. This is why Leftovers is important, as with it, Clefable can survive attacks that would otherwise 2HKO it and heal with Soft-Boiled after being hit twice.

Magic Guard is the chosen ability for two main reasons. Firstly, it allows Clefable to switch in many times and avoid taking damage from entry hazards. Secondly, it prevents Clefable from being worn down by status, which forces opponents to rely on using direct attacks to damage Clefable; a difficult task due to Clefable's high defenses.

Usage Tips
========

Clefable doesn't necessarily have to be used as a lead. Clefable has the bulk, ability, and defensive typing to pivot in whenever possible and set up Stealth Rock, granted that it isn't on a super effective hit. As Clefable also beats every entry hazard remover other than Excadrill one-on-one, it can force them to switch out, giving itself a turn to set up Stealth Rock. Clefable doesn't only force switches against hazard removers, however. Clefable can force switches against Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Choice-locked Dragon-types as well, and then set up Stealth Rock on the switch. If Stealth Rock is already up, Clefable can still take advantage of a predicted switch and heal up with Soft-Boiled. Because of Magic Guard, Clefable can also switch into Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, Lava Plume, and Scald, as it will not take poison or burn damage and would rather not be paralyzed or put to sleep.

Team Options
========

Clefable fits well on most teams due to its good defensive typing and good bulk. However, most teams weak to Fighting- and Dragon-type Pokemon that don't already have a Stealth Rock setter especially appreciate Clefable as a team member. Slower Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Kyurem-B appreciate Clefable as a teammate as it can pivot into Dragon-type moves. Skarmory is a great partner as it beats Excadrill, the only entry hazard remover Clefable can't beat, as well as Pinsir and Azumarill, which would otherwise take Clefable down offensively. Rotom-W gets rid of Talonflame, which 2HKOes Clefable with Brave Bird. Tyranitar, Choice Scarf Terrakion, Choice Scarf Garchomp, Quagsire, and Slowbro are all great partners as they get rid of Mega Charizard X, which uses Clefable as setup fodder. Specially defensive Gliscor can come in on Heatran, which walls Clefable, and OHKO it with Earthquake. Lastly, Mega Gyarados is also a good partner, as Clefable can lure out Ferrothorn and smack it with a Fire Blast.

Other Options
########

Clefable has a slew of other supportive and disruptive tactics, including Encore, Healing Wish, Trick + Flame Orb, Magic Coat, Counter, and Cosmic Power. Encore works effectively with Magic Guard variants by halting boosting sweepers, and it is also useful for locking slower entry hazard setters into one move. However, Clefable should best stick to Unaware if it wants to combat boosting sweepers, and outside of the previously mentioned applications, Encore has limited use. Healing Wish can be a game-changing move on more offensively based teams by restoring the health of an injured sweeper, although sacrificing Clefable is generally imprudent given its vital role as a team player. Trick + Flame Orb in tandem with Magic Guard is a great way to cripple many of Clefable's common switch-ins such as Bisharp, Excadrill, and Scizor, among others. Another way Clefable can become even more of an annoyance is with Magic Coat, as it deflects entry hazards and gives faster Taunt users a taste of their own medicine. Counter also finds use by getting a surprise KO on physical attackers that want to try their luck with Clefable, but this option is an immediate giveaway and subsequent waste if used carelessly. Cosmic Power may be used on the Calm Mind sets to ease set up, but lacks any other use outside of that. Keep in mind that sets geared towards accumulating multiple Cosmic Power boosts in tandem with Stored Power are a complete waste of Clefable's potential.

In regard to more offensive options, Clefable's vast offensive movepool includes Focus Blast, Charge Beam, Ice Beam, Seismic Toss, and Knock Off. Focus Blast may be used over Flamethrower on the Calm Mind sets to break past Heatran, but its low PP and unappealing accuracy might be a turnoff. Charge Beam may also be used to simultaneously attack and potentially bestow Clefable with a Special Attack boost, but it is laughably weak. Ice Beam works effectively by destroying Gliscor, Zapdos, and Landorus-T, but it has limited use outside of that. Seismic Toss is an option on the defensive sets for a consistent damaging move. Lastly, Knock Off's disruptive shenanigans work well in crippling many of Clefable's opponents, but again, it is quite weak.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Taunt Users**: In order to take Clefable down, Taunt users that naturally outspeed it are necessary to both keep Clefable from supporting its teammates and grabbing multiple Calm Mind boosts. Heatran, Mew, and specially defensive Talonflame easily come in on just about every one of Clefable's attacks; prevent it from boosting, spreading status, or recovering via Taunt, recover off any damage they might have attained upon switching in, then slowly but surely wear Clefable down with their own attacks. However, the latter three are instantaneously crippled by an incoming Toxic on the switch, though the only thing that stops Taunt Heatran from countering Clefable is a surprise coverage move specifically aimed to beat it.

**Poison-types**: Clefable's most notable check is Mega Venusaur, as it easily switches in on all of Clefable's standard attacks and 2HKOes it with Sludge Bomb; however, Clefable can muscle through it with the Calm Mind set. Other checks are Amoonguss, Gengar, and Scolipede. Amoonguss only has to watch out for a Life Orb-boosted Fire Blast; otherwise, it's a solid check to Clefable for reasons similar to Mega Venusaur, but in contrast, it does not lose to the Calm Mind sets because of Clear Smog. In the case of Gengar and Scolipede, neither of them enjoy switching in on a Fire-type move, but should they get in safely, they can easily destroy Clefable with their STAB-boosted Poison-type attacks.

**Steel-types**: Just about every offensive Steel-type checks Clefable fairly well by virtue of their natural type advantage and brute strength. These Pokemon include Bisharp, Mega Scizor, and Excadrill. However, it is precautionary that all these avoid directly switching in on Clefable, as it frequently carries a Fire-type move that 3HKOes them at the very least or, as in a few cases, OHKOes them at a moment's notice.
