Overview
########
- New Fairy typing allows it to switch into Dragon-types easily as they Outrage or Draco Meteor, or even on attacks such as Earthquake from the likes of Garchomp or Dragonite.
- It has the amazing ability Prankster.
- It uses this to its advantage with its great supportive movepool, containing gems such as Memento, Encore, Switcheroo, and Taunt.
- This makes it an incredible supportive teammate on offensive teams.
- Low Attack and Special Attack relegate it to a supportive role.
- 4x weakness to the Poison-typing, as well as weaknesses to the common Steel-, Ice-, and Fire-types.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Encore
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Memento
move 4: Switcheroo / Stun Spore / Taunt
ability: Prankster
item: Lagging Tail / Leftovers
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

Moves
========
- Encore cripples a foe by locking it into the move it previously used.
- U-turn in conjunction with Lagging Tail allows Whimsicott to guarantee a free switch-in to a teammate.
- Memento is excellent as it forces an opposing setup sweeper out, giving an opportunity for a teammate to sweep.
- Switcheroo will cripple a Pokemon for the rest of the game by forcing it to move last.
- Stun Spore is similar in the fact that it will slow an opposing Pokemon down, and it can be used more than once.
- Taunt is great to use against hazard setters, as well as supportive Pokemon in general.
- Tailwind can be used as a last ditch attempt to allow slower teammates to sweep.

Set Details
========
- The given EVs maximize Whimisicott's physically defensive capabilities, so it can switch in on the likes of Garchomp and Dragonite easier.
- An Impish nature adds to Whimsicott's physical bulk even more.
- While Lagging Tail seems like an odd choice, because of Prankster, all of Whimsicott's supportive moves will go first anyway, and only U-turn will go last, which is supposed to anyway. It also means that Whimsicott can use Switcheroo to cripple an opposing sweeper with the Lagging Tail.
- Leftovers is of course an option to for passive recovery.

Usage Tips
========
- Because of the large amount of options in Whimsicott's supportive movepool, it can be hard to decide which move to use in certain situations.
- Encore should be used if the opponent has previously used a move that a teammate doesn't mind switching in on.
- Stun Spore should be used when you expect the opponent to switch out, unless you think that they will switch into an Electric- or Grass-type Pokemon.
- Memento should be used as a last-ditch attempt to almost guarantee a teammate being able to set up.
 
Team Options
========
- Setup sweepers! Whimsicott is one of the best partners for setup sweepers on offensive teams. This includes but is not limited to: Swords Dance Lucario, Nasty Plot Thundurus, Belly Drum Azumarill, Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar, Swords Dance Scizor, and Tail Glow Manaphy.
- Heatran has good defensive synergy with Whimsicott; they form a good core for a balanced team.
- Gothitelle can trap and likely KO Pokemon that have Whimsicott U-turns out of, especially if they are paralyzed, so Gothitelle can likely outspeed them.
 
Other Options
########
- Cotton Guard allows Whimsicott to boost its Defense to crazy levels.
- Sunny Day works with sun sweepers such as Chlorophyll Venusaur and Victreebel, but is generally an inferior set as sun has many problems preventing it from being utilized effectively, and it also makes the team incredibly weak to Fire-types.
- Substitute is an option to ease prediction, and can be used with Leech Seed to recover health and stall out the opponent, but it is a seriously mediocre strategy in OU due to a variety of checks.

Checks & Counters
########
- Heatran can phaze Whimsicott out or hit it with Lava Plume.
- Scizor can hit it hard with a Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch.
- Mega Absol, Espeon, and Xatu bounce back all of Whimsicott's support moves thanks to their ability Magic Bounce; Mega Absol can hit it back with Fire Blast.
- Mega Venusaur doesn't mind much from Whimsicott and can obliterate it with Sludge Bomb.
