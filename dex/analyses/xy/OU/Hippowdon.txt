Overview
########

Hippowdon is one of the best mixed walls in the game, checking some of the metagame's most prominent threats, such as Terrakion, Talonflame, and Garchomp. It has everything a wall could want: a good typing, great bulk, and reliable recovery. It also has good support options in Stealth Rock and Whirlwind, and is useful on sand teams due to its ability, Sand Stream. Its attacks also pack quite a punch for a defensive Pokemon. However, Hippowdon is painfully slow and has weaknesses to common attacking types, such as Water and Ice. Hippowdon also has to rely on Whirlwind to stop setup sweepers, making it somewhat easy to wear down.

Moves
========

Earthquake is a strong STAB attack that deters frail sweepers from setting up on Hippowdon. Stealth Rock is a great support move, and Hippowdon is very good at setting it up due to its great bulk. Slack Off provides reliable recovery, making it more difficult to wear Hippowdon down. The last moveslot depends on what your team needs, as all of the options can benefit you depending on your build. Stone Edge is preferred in the last moveslot to heavily damage Thundurus, Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard Y, and other Flying-types. Toxic is a great move on Hippowdon that cripples opposing walls and Defog users that want to switch in, such as Mandibuzz, Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Latios, while also making it easier for teammates to sweep. Whirlwind is a phazing move, removing your opponent's stat boosts while racking up entry hazard damage, and it is Hippowdon's best chance against bulkier setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor. Rock Slide can be used in place of Stone Edge for reliable chip damage as it breaks Air Balloon and also OHKOes Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y; however, it cannot OHKO Mega Pinsir at full health.

Set Details
========

The EV spread avoids the 2HKO from Life Orb Thundurus's and Mega Manectric's Hidden Power Ice, as well as the OHKO from +2 Life Orb Terrakion's Close Combat. Leftovers is used to provide passive recovery that could mean the difference between getting OHKOed and getting 2HKOed. Sand Stream is the preferred ability as it lets Hippowdon replace opposing weather and double Excadrill's Speed, although Sand Force can be used if Sand Stream is detrimental to the rest of your team. Smooth Rock can be used to extend the duration of Sand Stream, which can provide a sweeping opportunity for Sand Rush Excadrill, which absolutely loves the sand Hippowdon provides, or to give a boost to Mega Garchomp's Earthquake and Stone Edge.

A spread of 252 HP / 252 Def gives Hippowdon the bulk to take on Mega Pinsir and Mega Charizard X, while also walling physical attackers such as Garchomp, Excadrill, and Terrakion. Such a set is better suited for stall teams that already have a check or counter to Thundurus and other Electric-types, while being a better answer to physical attackers, such as Garchomp and Excadrill.

Usage Tips
========

Hippowdon can function as a catch-all check for both physical and special attackers, such as Talonflame, Garchomp, non-Choice Band Dragonite, Bisharp, and Gengar. Hippowdon can switch into Mega Charizard Y to disrupt Solar Beam, but does not avoid the 2HKO from Fire Blast in or out of sun. Try to keep Hippowdon as healthy as possible if there is a Pokemon on the opposing team that Hippowdon can check, as its low Speed often forces it to take two hits before it can fire off an attack. Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock several times throughout the match, so you don't have to worry too much about Defog or Rapid Spin. Thanks to its naturally high Defense stat, it can take weaker physical attacks easily. If you see a Pokemon that is badly affected by sandstorm on the opposing team, such as Chansey or Mega Venusaur, always try to take advantage of it.

Team Options
========

Hippowdon appreciates teammates that can take on special attackers easily, such as Chansey and Latias, as Hippowdon primarily checks physical attackers. The former can also rid Hippowdon of any status effect that it might have been inflicted with, while the latter can use Defog to support the team. A form of entry hazard removal, such as Defog and Rapid Spin, is appreciated, as Hippowdon can potentially be 2HKOed after taking entry hazard damage where it would otherwise be OHKOed. Latias and Starmie are good candidates, having solid synergy with Hippowdon. Hippowdon also appreciates teammates that can switch into Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks, such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur. In return, Hippowdon can check Talonflame and Mega Pinsir, which threaten Mega Venusaur. If you are using Mega Venusaur, be sure to use Sand Force as Hippowdon's ability because Sand Stream reduces Synthesis's recovery. Ferrothorn can also lay Spikes, which can quickly wear down the opponent in conjunction with Stealth Rock, sand, and Whirlwind. Rotom-W also makes for a great defensive teammate, as it can take Water- and Ice-type attacks for Hippowdon. Mega Aerodactyl is a good partner as sand bolsters its Special Defense, allowing it to either sweep more effectively or become bulky both physically and specially with its bulky build. Mega Garchomp also appreciates sand as its Earthquakes and Stone Edges become even stronger.

Other Options
########

A spread with full investment in HP and Special Defense with a Careful nature can be used to handle threats such as Life Orb Gengar, Magnezone, and Mega Charizard Y more effectively, as this spread allows Hippowdon to take two Fire Blasts from full health in sand, or disrupt a predicted Solar Beam with Sand Stream, which is the only ability that should be used with this spread. It can also handle Latios, Latias, and Thundurus. Ice Fang can be used on either set to hit Garchomp and other Pokemon weak to Ice for heavy damage, but it is very weak otherwise, and it is generally better to use Toxic or Whirlwind. An offensive set can be used due to Hippowdon's good offensive movepool but compromising its bulk is not optimal.

Checks & Counters
########

**Water-types**: Almost all common Water-types, such as Azumarill, Gyarados, Mega Gyarados, Keldeo, and Rotom-W, force Hippowdon out with their respective STAB moves, and Hippowdon can't do much to them in return. However, all of these must be wary of Toxic.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Breloom, Mega Venusaur, and Ferrothorn can easily switch into Hippowdon and hit back hard with their respective STAB moves. Breloom can use Spore and proceed to set up with Swords Dance, Mega Venusaur can use Leech Seed or deal heavy damage with Giga Drain, and Ferrothorn can set up entry hazards.

**Powerful Special Attackers**: Strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y can break through Hippowdon with strong special attacks.

**Ice-types**: Common Ice-types, such as Kyurem-B, can easily KO Hippowdon with their STAB moves, although most of them have to be wary of switching into Stone Edge.

**Opposing Entry Hazard Setters** Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Clefable can set up entry hazards, while Hippowdon can't do much to them in return besides phazing them out.

**Status and Taunt**: Toxic and Will-O-Wisp are very detrimental to Hippowdon, slowly wearing it down so that a strong attacker can overwhelm it. Because most Taunt users, such as Prankster Thundurus and Mandibuzz, are faster than Hippowdon, they can stop it from setting up Stealth Rock, healing, or spreading status.

**Trick and Switcheroo**: Trick and Switcheroo users can cripple Hippowdon for the rest of the match by giving it a Choice item as it can't wall opposing threats if it is locked into one move.
