Overview
#######

Chansey is a staple on stall, and it's not hard to see why. Thanks to Eviolite, Chansey's special bulk is extremely high, even surpassing that of her evolution, Blissey. Not only that, but Eviolite also boosts Chansey's pitiful Defense stat into something more usable, allowing her to take some physical hits. Chansey's movepool complements her great bulk extremely well; access to moves such as Soft-Boiled, Wish, Heal Bell, Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Stealth Rock help Chansey easily support both herself and her team with ease. She even has access to Seismic Toss, allowing her to actually do reliable damage to the opponent. However, Chansey is quite reliant on Eviolite, meaning she can't use Leftovers as her item. This leaves her vulnerable to passive damage, and she must be kept healthy at all times during the match. Chansey can also be somewhat easy to set up on, especially if her status move of choice has been revealed. Overall, however, Chansey is a great special wall who is recommended for any and all forms of stall.

nature: Bold

Moves
======

Due to Chansey's large support movepool, Chansey has many different options at her disposal. Soft-Boiled gives Chansey a reliable means of recovery, allowing her to stay healthy throughout the match. Heal Bell is the move of choice for the second slot, as it allows Chansey to heal crippling status effects on her teammates. Stealth Rock is another option that Chansey can use if none of her other teammates are able to use the move. However, it is worth noting that losing the ability to use Heal Bell means that Chansey can no longer heal status effects for her teammates. Toxic is chosen for the third slot due to its ability to put both setup sweepers and walls on a timer. Thunder Wave is another option that Chansey has access to. Though it immediately shuts down faster boosting sweepers, it also leaves Chansey unable to gets past other, bulkier Pokemon. Stealth Rock is once again an option in the third slot, but it must be noted that Chansey is especially vulnerable to setup sweepers if it decides to go without a status move, especially those with recovery. Finally, Seismic Toss is the move of choice in the last spot due to its ability to deal reliable damage to the opponent.

Set Details
=========

Eviolite is the most important part of this set, as it changes Chansey from an outclassed NFE to the special wall that she is. Due to her large HP stat, Chansey doesn't need to invest in HP. This makes a spread of maximum Defense and Special Defense the most optimal, as it boosts both her defensive stats to great levels. A Bold nature further boosts Chansey's physical bulk, allowing her to take physical hits surprisingly well. Finally, Natural Cure benefits Chansey by allowing her to recover from status moves as she switches out, making her almost impossible to wear down with Toxic.

Usage Tips
=========

Due to her good bulk, Chansey can be used to check and/or counter the following Pokemon: Goodra, Greninja, Heatran, Kingdra, Latias, (Mega) Alakazam, (Mega) Gardevoir, Mega Manetric, (Mega) Venusaur, non-Knock Off Landorus, non-Knock Off Thundurus, non-Trick Rotom-W, Politoed, Raikou, special Mega Charizard Y, Starmie, Substitute Kyurem-B, Togekiss, Unaware Clefable, Volcarona, Zapdos, and plenty more. One of the most important things to note when using Chansey is to keep her healthy at all times; without Leftovers, she can have a really easy time getting worn down. Some users of setup moves can have a really easy time boosting against Chansey, so make sure to switch out, use status, or hit them with Seismic Toss if you expect a boosting move. Scouting for Knock Off and Trick against more uncommon users of the move such as Landorus, Thundurus, and Rotom-W is very important in order to keep Chansey's Eviolite. Heal Bell, while useful, can also cause your team to lose momentum. As such, only use it when one of Chansey's teammates absolutely needs its status ailments cured.

Team Options
============

Chansey has many different Pokemon that can pair with it effectively. Unaware users, such as Quagsire and Clefable, are the most helpful partners, as they can stop Pokemon that commonly like to set up against Chansey. Physical walls, such as Hippowdon and physically defensive Mega Venusaur, can help absorb physical moves for Chansey. Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Mandibuzz are other physical walls with access to Defog, which can help remove the entry hazards that can easily wear Chansey down. Pokemon that dislike status, such as Landorus-T, Tyranitar, Slowbro , Garchomp, and Mega Pinsir, all appreciate Chansey's ability to act as a cleric. Finally, Mega Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Mega Scizor, and Mega Aggron can help Chansey by easily absorbing Knock Off for her.


Wish Support
##########
name: Wish Support
move 1: Wish
move 2: Soft-Boiled
move 3: Seismic Toss
move 4: Toxic
ability: Natural Cure
item: Eviolite
evs: 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
=======

Wish is the main move on this set, as it allows Chansey to heal not only herself, but her teammates as well. Soft-Boiled is the next move, as it gives Chansey a way of instantly healing herself, something that she needs in order to avoid being worn down. Seismic Toss is the third move on the set, as it's Chansey's only way to deal direct damage to the opponent. Finally, Toxic is used in the last slot in order to put both setup sweepers and walls on a timer. Stealth Rock can be used instead of Toxic, but without Toxic, Chansey doesn't really have any way to cripple the opponent, and Stealth Rock is usually better set by teammates anyways. If necessary, Stealth Rock should be substituted for Toxic and only Toxic, as Seismic Toss is necessary to do any direct damage to the opponent. Finally, Protect can be used in tandem with Wish for guaranteed healing, but Protect gives the opponent a free turn to do whatever they want. It also doesn't give Chansey the instant recovery of Soft-Boiled, which is very helpful to prevent her from being worn down.

Set Details
==========

Eviolite is the most important part of this set, as it's what makes Chansey a superior option to her evolution, Blissey. Due to her large HP stat, Chansey doesn't need to invest in HP. This makes a spread of maximum Defense and max Special Defense the best option, as it boosts both of Chansey's defenses to great levels. Bold is the nature of choice for Chansey, as it allows her to better tank physical hits. Finally, Natural Cure allows Chansey to shed status on the switch, making her almost impossible to wear down with Toxic.

Usage Tips
==========

Chansey can be used to check and/or counter the following Pokemon: Goodra, Greninja, Heatran, Kingdra, Latias, (Mega) Alakazam, (Mega) Gardevoir, Mega Manetric, (Mega) Venusaur, non-Knock Off Landorus, non-Knock Off Thundurus, non-Trick Rotom-W, Politoed, Raikou, special Mega Charizard Y, Starmie, Substitute Kyurem-B, Togekiss, Unaware Clefable, Volcarona, Zapdos, and plenty more. Without Leftovers, Chansey can find herself getting worn down quite easily, so it's important to keep her healthy at all times. Some setup sweepers can have an easy time setting up on Chansey, so make sure to switch out, use status, or hit them with Seismic Toss if you predict a boosting move. Finally, makes sure to scout for Knock Off and Trick against the uncommon users of the move, such as Landorus, Thundurus, and Rotom-W.

Team Options
============

There are many different Pokemon that can pair well with Chansey. Unaware users, such as Quagsire and Clefable, make some of the best partners, as they can easily stop some of the boosting sweepers that like to set up on Chansey. Physical walls such as Hippowdon and physically defensive Mega Venusaur can also stop powerful physical attacks aimed at Chansey. Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Mandibuzz are some other physical walls that can use Defog, which can help stop Chansey from getting easily worn down. Pokemon that can't reliably heal themselves, such as Heatran and Landorus-T, also make great partners, as they really appreciate Chansey's ability to WishPass. Finally, Mega Pokemon, such as Mega Venusaur, Mega Scizor, and Mega Aggron, can all help absorb Knock Off, a move Chansey hates.


Other Options
############

There isn't much else Chansey can do that isn't already listed. One of the more notable options is Counter. With it, Chansey can net some surprise KOs against Pokemon such as Garchomp. Unfortunately, Chansey is forced out by a lot of physical attackers, and Chansey doesn't really have room for it on either of her sets, anyway.

Checks & Counters
#################

**Physical Fighting-types**: Physical Fighting-types, such as Terrakion, Conkeldurr, Mega Medicham, and Breloom, can all switch in on most of Chansey's moves and KO her with a super effective STAB Fighting-type attack. However, faster Fighting-types must be careful of Thunder Wave.

**Knock Off/Trick users**: Knock Off users, such as Bisharp, Mega Scizor, Thundurus, and Landorus, can all remove Chansey's Eviolite, making her much less useful. Trick users, such as Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Latios, can also remove her Eviolite while also forcing her to use an item such as a Choice Scarf, severely crippling her for the rest of the match.

**Trappers**: Trappers, such as Gothitelle and Wobbuffet, can trap Chansey with their abilities. Gothitelle can Trick her Choice Specs or hit her hard with Psyshock, while Wobbuffet can Encore her into a certain move, making her setup fodder for another Pokemon.

**Setup Sweepers**: Setup sweepers that don't mind Toxic or Thunder Wave, such as Mega Scizor, can easily use Chansey as setup bait for a sweep.

**Psyshock/Secret Sword**: Both Psyshock and Secret Sword hit Chansey's weaker Defense stat, allowing Pokemon such as Keldeo and Calm Mind Mega Gardevoir to beat Chansey.

**Taunt**: Taunt users, such as Gengar and Mega Gardevoir, have an easy time shutting Chansey down. Gengar is the most notable user of this move, as it's immune to Seismic Toss and can easily set a Substitute up on Chansey. However, Taunt users that lack reliable recovery must be aware of being worn down by Seismic Toss.

**Powerful Physical Attackers**: In general, powerful physical attackers, such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Tyranitar, and Diggersby, can easily overpower Chansey through her weaker Defense stat.
