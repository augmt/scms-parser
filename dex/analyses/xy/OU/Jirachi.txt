Overview
########

Jirachi has a solid niche in the OU metagame with the typing and bulk to handle a slew of top threats, including Mega Gardevoir, Clefable, Latias, Latios, non-Earthquake Mega Altaria, Mega Sceptile, Mega Metagross, Mega Diancie, Kyurem-B, and offensive Mega Venusaur. It boasts unparalleled versatility with all kinds of support options for offensive and defensive teams alike; it has access to Wish, Healing Wish, Stealth Rock, paralysis-inducing moves, U-turn, and various attacking options that allow it to lure or check a multitude of common Pokemon. Jirachi is not without its flaws, however; indeed, quite a few common OU Pokemon can take advantage of it. Heatran is the most notable, but Pokemon like Landorus-T, Talonflame, Hippowdon, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Keldeo, Charizard, Bisharp, and Azumarill can all come in pretty easily on Jirachi bar the threat of paralysis and do as they please. However, Jirachi is still a fantastic Pokemon in the OU tier that can find a place on many teams.

Pivot
########
name: Pivot
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Body Slam / Fire Punch
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 176 SpD / 80 Spe
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is an excellent option on Jirachi, as it can come in on quite a few common threats and set up the vital hazard; Jirachi even beats the predominant Defoggers, Latios and Latias. Iron Head is an important STAB move with a 60% chance to flinch the foe. Although this flinch chance should not be relied upon, it can definitely come in handy to get free damage and allow Jirachi to take on foes that it could not otherwise; it is also crucial to defeat Calm Mind Clefable. U-turn is used to gain momentum on switches, which can rack up damage from Stealth Rock. The switch-in is forced out and another Pokemon will be forced to take Stealth Rock damage.

The last slot is a toss-up; the best two overall options are listed. Body Slam has a 60% chance to paralyze with Serene Grace, forming a lethal paraflinch combination with Iron Head and punishing Pokemon like Landorus-T, Charizard, and Keldeo that like to switch into Jirachi. Fire Punch, on the other hand, hits Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor that love to come in and take advantage of Jirachi. Healing Wish is a solid option in the last slot to support Jirachi's teammates, particularly if they are more offensive. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Water- and Ground-types like Slowbro and Landorus-T. Thunder Wave can be used to guarantee paralysis so that Jirachi doesn't have to rely on a 60% chance to paralyze incoming foes; however, this comes at the cost of not affecting Ground-types.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread allows Jirachi to outspeed Adamant Diggersby, Adamant Bisharp, and Jolly Tyranitar. With heavy Special Defense investment, it is optimized to tank hits from the likes of Latios, Latias, and Mega Gardevoir rather well.

Usage Tips
========

The first move with this set will typically be to set up Stealth Rock. Pivot it into Pokemon it checks, naturally, such as Latios, Clefable, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Venusaur, and various defensive Pokemon to achieve this. After Stealth Rock has been set up, the best move is typically spamming Body Slam on the predicted switch to try to paralyze something. If your opponent's switch-in is already paralyzed or you are not running Body Slam, going for U-turn for the free momentum is the best choice. This also applies if you want to get in a frail Pokemon such as Mega Lopunny in immediately or wear down the foe with Stealth Rock damage. Note that this Jirachi can be worn down rather quickly if you don't play carefully, so make sure to conserve its health and don't play recklessly if you still need it to handle a threat on the opposing team.

Team Options
========

Bulky Water-types are an excellent form of support for Jirachi to handle some of the threats that it struggles with. Slowbro is an excellent partner to handle Landorus-T, Mega Charizard X, and Keldeo, all of which are major threats to Jirachi. Defensive Gyarados handles Landorus, Keldeo, and Mega Charizard Y. Bulky Ground-types, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon, can handle the likes of Talonflame, opposing Landorus-T, and Mega Charizard X. Though Gliscor is less solid at handling Mega Charizard X, it can deal with Mew, which is a huge problem for Jirachi as well. Both Mega Charizard formes, particularly Mega Charizard X, handle Mew well, too. Mega Venusaur handles threatening Water-types, including Slowbro, Keldeo, and Azumarill. Chansey and mixed defensive Clefable handles Thundurus, Raikou, and Mega Manectric; Chansey can even provide Wish support to keep Jirachi healthy and/or cleric support to get rid of burns from Mega Gardevoir's Will-O-Wisp. Finally, Mega Sableye appreciates Jirachi as a teammate for its ability to deal with Fairies.

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Iron Head
move 2: Toxic / Body Slam
move 3: Wish
move 4: Protect
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 224 SpD / 32 Spe
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Iron Head is a basic STAB move that covers Pokemon such as Kyurem-B and Clefable, in addition to helping rack up Toxic damage with flinches. Toxic and Body Slam both work well with Iron Head in wearing down the foe. Toxic is useful to hit Ground-, Electric-, and Water-type switch-ins, enabling Jirachi to serve as an effective Mega Manectric and Thundurus check. It can be crucial to help wear down both offensive and defensive foes over the course of the match. Body Slam is a very viable alternative to punish switch-ins with paralysis and combines with Iron Head for a devastating paraflinch combination. Wish + Protect rounds out the set as a necessity to heal Jirachi reliably. Wish also lets Jirachi support its teammates, and Protect allows it to gain extra Leftovers recovery and scout. Stealth Rock, Healing Wish, Fire Punch, or U-turn can be used over Protect to provide additional team support, but the lack of reliable healing will hurt. Any of them can also be used in the second slot, though the lack of a status move will definitely be annoying. Thunder Wave can be used if a more reliable paralysis option is desired and hitting Ground-types is not a huge priority.

Set Details
========

The EV spread maximizes Jirachi's special bulk while allowing it to outspeed Jolly Tyranitar and Adamant Bisharp.

Usage Tips
========

This set is used in a similar manner to the pivot set as a switch-in to the likes of Latios, Latias, Mega Gardevoir, and Clefable, but with the addition of Wish + Protect recovery to keep itself and its teammates healthy. Therefore, it is a much more reliable defensive anchor that more defensive teams can rely on. Generally, when you get it in, fire off a status move to cripple an incoming foe. If healing is required for either Jirachi or a teammate, or you want a teammate to come into a hit and regain its health, go for a Wish as the foe switches out.

Team Options
========

Landorus-T and Chesnaught are good partners to take on Ground-types such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Pokemon to take on the likes of Mega Gyarados and Mega Charizard X such as Azumarill, Quagsire, Ferrothorn, Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Slowbro, and Chesnaught are also helpful. Pokemon to pivot into and take advantage of Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory, such as Heatran and Mega Charizard X, are great partners, too. Pokemon that can effectively deal with Keldeo, such as Mega Venusaur and Slowbro, as well as bulky Water-types, such as Magic Guard Clefable, are also crucial. Finally, Heal Bell support from the likes of Chansey or Clefable to get rid of burns inflicted by Mega Gardevoir is heavily appreciated.

Substitute
########
name: Substitute
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Toxic / Body Slam
move 3: Iron Head
move 4: Fire Punch
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 96 Atk / 160 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Substitute provides a shield for Jirachi to attempt flinches and spread status more effectively. With that, Toxic or Body Slam should be used to spread status. Toxic hits many bulky Pokemon that like to switch into Jirachi, including Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon. However, Body Slam creates a devastating paraflinch combo with Iron Head and is more effective against heavily offensive teams, where the residual damage from Toxic might not come so much into play. Iron Head is Jirachi's typical STAB move, pairing well with the status moves to flinch and stall out foes thanks to Serene Grace. Fire Punch is crucial to hit Steel-types, mainly Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Bisharp, Skarmory (to some extent), and Mega Scizor. It also has a rather handy 20% burn chance with Serene Grace that can come into play.

Set Details
========

The EVs provide Jirachi with enough Speed to outrun Adamant Excadrill and Mega Heracross, while giving it the bulk to check threats like Latios and Latias and create 101 HP Substitutes. The Attack investment allows it to wear down foes more effectively.

Usage Tips
========

Typically, the best option is to come in and spam Toxic or Body Slam to start crippling foes. Getting behind a Substitute can also be very helpful to ease prediction and provide a buffer behind which Jirachi can spread status and attempt flinches with Iron Head. Slower foes will have to avoid being flinched not just once, but twice in order to get to Jirachi. It should be noted that due to its lack of Wish and lessened special bulk, this Jirachi is not as effective at taking hits as either of the previous two sets and therefore cannot serve as a repeated switch-in to some threats.

Team Options
========

Landorus-T and Chesnaught are good partners to take on foes such as Excadrill, opposing Landorus-T, and Garchomp that aim Ground-type attacks at Jirachi. Landorus can be handled by the likes of Latios, Latias, specially defensive Gliscor, and specially defensive Zapdos. Azumarill, Quagsire, Ferrothorn, Hippowdon, and the aforementioned Landorus-T and Chesnaught are very useful partners to tackle Mega Gyarados and Mega Charizard X. Pokemon to switch into Keldeo, such as Mega Venusaur and Slowbro, are crucial as well. Mega Venusaur and Magic Guard Calm Mind Clefable can switch into threatening bulky Water-types, such as Slowbro and Alomomola.

Mixed Attacker
########
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Iron Head
move 2: Icy Wind
move 3: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Thunderbolt / Stealth Rock / Healing Wish
item: Expert Belt
evs: 132 Atk / 160 SpA / 216 Spe
nature: Mild

Moves
========

Iron Head is the main STAB move, providing coverage on Clefable and having a nifty 60% chance to flinch foes. Icy Wind lures and KOes Ground-types, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Landorus, as well as other common switch-ins to Jirachi such as Thundurus and Garchomp. It also prevents Dragon Dance sweepers from gaining any Speed boosts in a last-ditch situation and KOes Dragonite after Stealth Rock damage. The next slot is heavily dependent on teammates. If removing Heatran is important, then Hidden Power Ground should be used. If removing Ferrothorn and Scizor is important, then Hidden Power Fire should be used. Thunderbolt completes Jirachi's coverage by hitting Skarmory, Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Water-types, such as Keldeo, Azumarill, Gyarados, Slowbro, and Alomomola, for super effective damage. Stealth Rock should be run if another teammate does not carry it. Finally, Healing Wish is an awesome support option to heal up crippled and/or weakened teammates if neither Thunderbolt's coverage nor Stealth Rock's support is necessary. Like Thunderbolt, Energy Ball is an option to hit Water-types, forfeiting coverage on Gyarados in exchange for smacking Rotom-W, which is not hit super effectively by Thunderbolt. Psychic can also be run to toss around Mega Venusaur and Fighting-types such as Keldeo; it also is a generally useful move to throw out and does significant amounts of damage to Pokemon like Rotom-W and Landorus-T. Finally, U-turn can be run to pivot out to teammates, but the loss of coverage typically isn't worth it.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread guarantees a 2HKO on Clefable with Iron Head while maximizing the power of Jirachi's special coverage moves and outspeeding everything up to Kyurem-B. If outspeeding or at least tying with opposing base 100s is desired, then an EV spread of 132 Atk / 124 SpA / 252 Spe with a Hasty nature can be run. Expert Belt is preferred to take advantage of this Jirachi's excellent super effective coverage, though Shuca Berry can be run to beat the likes of Gachomp, Landorus-T, and Landorus in 1v1 scenarios.

Usage Tips
========

This set should be used to lure in various threats with its wide array of coverage moves and the surprise factor of Expert Belt. It should be played early- to mid-game to harass teams with its coverage and weaken threats for teammates that wish to sweep, such as Heatran for Clefable or Hidden Power Fire for Ferrothorn. As with any lure, it is vital to keep its coverage moves concealed until the proper time to use them comes, as otherwise the crucial surprise factor is gone. With Stealth Rock, Jirachi can also become a good lead option, especially with Shuca Berry for a layer of safety against Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T leads.

Team Options
========

This set functions as an offensive support Pokemon; it can lure threats with which teammates might have trouble. As such, good teammates are ones that appreciate Pokemon gone that this Jirachi can remove or weaken. Calm Mind Clefable and Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, for instance, can sweep more easily with Heatran removed by Hidden Power Ground. Gyarados appreciates Ferrothorn being eliminated by Hidden Power Fire. Diggersby likes having Landorus-T gone from Icy Wind. As support for itself, Jirachi wants Pokemon like Rotom-W and Landorus-T that can switch into threatening Ground-type attackers. Latios and Latias are also useful partners to pivot into Landorus, Rotom-W, and Keldeo.

Other Options
#######

With its versatile stats and movepool, Jirachi has a few other decent options. A Choice Scarf set with U-turn to maintain momentum, Iron Head for a STAB move and flinches, Trick or Healing Wish for team support, and a move like Zen Headbutt or Ice Punch for additional coverage can be especially effective. Against many teams, though, it won't actually get much done with its rather meager power, which causes it to be reliant on Iron Head flinches far too often. A Calm Mind set has the potential to sweep certain teams, as Jirachi has a variety of coverage options and the bulk to set up Calm Mind, turning it into a serious threat. Doom Desire can be run paired with partners such as Latios and Mega Lopunny to force certain Pokemon (in the case of these two, Fairy-types) into a checkmate situation: does the opponent switch in their Clefable to check that Pokemon and proceed to take a Doom Desire, or do they bite the bullet and make a risky play or sacrifice a Pokemon? Thunder Wave is an option over Body Slam on any of the sets as a more reliable form of paralysis, but it is generally not preferred because it doesn't do damage and fails to affect Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, some of the most common switch-ins to Jirachi.

Checks and Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Heatran are all rather safe switch-ins into Jirachi and can tear it apart or set up on it, though all of them except defensive variants of Heatran have to be wary of switching into a Body Slam and becoming paralyzed.

**Bulky Steel-types**: Skarmory and Ferrothorn are generally safe switch-ins to Jirachi and can proceed to set up entry hazards on it or do whatever they please. Ferrothorn must be wary of Fire Punch, however.

**Ground-types**: Garchomp, Landorus-T, Landorus, Hippowdon, and Excadrill are some examples of Ground-type Pokemon that can come into Jirachi and take advantage of it or hit it super effectively with their respective STAB moves.

**Water-types**: Keldeo, Slowbro, Alomomola, Substitute Gyarados, Mega Gyarados, Manaphy, and Suicune can wall Jirachi by virtue of their resistance to Iron Head or sheer bulk, and, depending on the Pokemon, proceed to fire off their high-powered attacks, set up on it, or fire off a free Scald. All of them except for Suicune and Rain Dance Manaphy have to be wary of Toxic, though.

**Offensive Steel-types**: Bisharp and Mega Scizor can come in on any Jirachi that does not carry Fire Punch, especially in Mega Scizor's case, and proceed to set up on it or Pursuit trap it. Mega Metagross can deal with non-Wish variants of Jirachi effectively by virtue of its typing and powerful Tough Claws-boosted Hammer Arm; if it runs Earthquake, it can even beat Wish variants.
