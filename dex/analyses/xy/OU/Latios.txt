Overview
########

Latios's great movepool, offensive stats, and unique Dragon / Psychic typing make it a fearsome special attacker that is capable of breaking through most teams. Its wide array of coverage moves also lets Latios eliminate some of its common switch-ins. Latios's typing allows it to act as a great offensive check to top-tier threats such as Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, and Landorus. It also has access to Defog, which was buffed with the introduction of XY, allowing Latios to play as a supportive Pokemon in addition to an offensive one. However, the introduction of Fairy-types has diminished Latios's capabilities as a sweeper. Due to its typing, Latios is also very vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped by common Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Bisharp.

move 3: Hidden Power Fire / Surf / Earthquake
move 4: Roost / Defog
ability: Levitate
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

nature: Timid / Hasty

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is Latios's main STAB attack and is capable of OHKOing many offensively oriented Pokemon, including Landorus, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Medicham. Due to its high Base Power, it also gives Latios the ability to act as a wallbreaker, dealing significant damage to quite a few defensively oriented Pokemon, such as Landorus-T, Alomomola, Slowbro, and specially defensive Gliscor. Psyshock gives Latios the ability to hit Fighting- and Poison-types such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Breloom, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss for super effective damage. Psyshock is also Latios's main attack against Fairy-types such as Clefable and Azumarill, as they are immune to Dragon-type attacks. Because Psyshock targets the foe's Defense rather than its Special Defense, it allows Latios to deal a decent amount of damage to Chansey and Blissey, both of which wall Latios otherwise. Latios's coverage move decides which of its switch-ins it is capable of beating. Hidden Power Fire lets it hit Steel-, Bug-, and Grass-types, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Jirachi, Bisharp, Scizor, and Celebi, for super effective damage. Surf gives Latios the ability to 2HKO Heatran, specially defensive Gliscor, and most Tyranitar. It also scores an OHKO on Landorus and Excadrill, allowing Latios to OHKO the former and avoid the drop in Special Attack from Draco Meteor. Earthquake is another option for the third moveslot, as it allows Latios to OHKO Heatran, 2HKO most Tyranitar and Bisharp, and deal a decent amount of damage to Jirachi.

Roost increases Latios's longevity drastically, making it a more reliable switch-in to the Pokemon it's supposed to check, such as Keldeo and Landorus. By running Roost, Latios also becomes a good win condition against stall, because it's able to recover the health lost from Life Orb recoil and entry hazards damage. Defog is a viable option over Roost if having a way of clearing entry hazards is important to your team. However, it should be noted that without Roost, Latios is easily worn down. Running both Roost and Defog on the same set is also an option if your team really needs a reliable way of getting rid of entry hazards. Without a coverage move, though, the number of Pokemon capable of switching into Latios increases by quite a lot.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread with a Timid nature is used to make the most of Latios's great Speed tier, which allows it to outspeed fast Pokemon such as Keldeo and Terrakion, as well as maximize Latios's damage output. Life Orb is Latios's item of choice, as it increases Latios's damage output even further without locking itself into one move. If running Earthquake, 24 EVs in Attack should be used to ensure that specially defensive Heatran is always OHKOed by Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage. To minimize the recoil damage taken from Life Orb, 29 IVs in HP are used.

Usage Tips
========

Using Latios as a hit-and-run attacker is advised because the drop in Special Attack from Draco Meteor drastically decreases its damage output. If your opponent has a way of taking advantage of Latios's lowered Special Attack, playing carefully with Draco Meteor is advised. Scouting for Knock Off Landorus and Icy Wind Keldeo before sending Latios in is smart, as both of the moves remove a significant portion of its health. If your opponent has a potential Pursuit user, such as Bisharp or Tyranitar, it's advised to play carefully with Latios.

Team Options
========

Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Terrakion make for good teammates, as they are capable of taking on common Pursuit users, such as Bisharp and Tyranitar, as well a lot of common Latios switch-ins, such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Chansey. Pokemon that are capable of taking on Clefable and Sylveon, such as Heatran and Excadrill, make for great partners. Lastly, Keldeo is an exceptional teammate, as it is capable of taking on Bisharp and Mega Scizor, both of which can easily set up on Latios if it's lacking Hidden Power Fire.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Hidden Power Fire / Tailwind / Defog
move 4: Trick
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Choice Scarf transforms Latios into an amazing revenge killer, letting it outspeed nearly every setup sweeper in the metagame even when they are at +1 Speed. Even without a boosting item, Draco Meteor is incredibly strong and is Latios's main move for revenge killing. Psyshock has great neutral coverage alongside Draco Meteor and takes care of top-tier threats such as Keldeo, Gengar, and Mega Venusaur. The choice of move in the third moveslot depends whether you want more coverage or the ability to support your team in a pinch. Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-, Bug-, and Grass-types, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Jirachi, Bisharp, Scizor, and Celebi, for super effective damage. Tailwind is a great last-ditch team support move in a pinch. Defog is a similar way of supporting Latios's team and can be used if Latios's team is desperately in need of a Defog user. Trick gives Latios the ability to cripple defensively oriented Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Chansey, Sylveon, Clefable, and Suicune.

Set Details
========

As this Latios set is a potent revenge killer, the EVs and nature focus on maximizing both Latios's Speed and Special Attack so that it can be as fast and powerful as possible.

Usage Tips
========

As Choice Scarf Latios lacks any kind of recovery, its longevity is cut short, so bringing it out sparingly is advised. While Draco Meteor is Latios's strongest attack, you should refrain from overusing the move because it might give your opponent an opportunity to set up against Latios. If Latios's Choice Scarf lets it revenge kill a potentially threatening setup sweeper on the opposing team, you should be conservative about using Trick, even if you have the opportunity to cripple a defensively oriented Pokemon.

Team Options
========

Because many of the common switch-ins to Latios, such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Chansey, are weak to Fighting-type attacks, most Fighting-types make for good teammates. Keldeo is perhaps Latios's best partner, as it is a surefire switch-in to Pursuit users such as Bisharp and Tyranitar. Steel-types such as Excadrill and Heatran are great teammates, as they are capable of taking on Fairy-types such as Clefable and Sylveon, both of which counter Latios. Choice Scarf Latios really appreciates having slow Volt Switch or U-turn users as partners, as they give Latios a free and safe switch in. Good examples of Volt Switch and U-turn users include Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Mega Scizor.

Dual Screen Support
########
name: Dual Screen Support
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Memento
move 4: Draco Meteor / Psychic / Hidden Power Fighting
ability: Levitate
item: Light Clay
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

The combination of Light Screen and Reflect significantly decreases the damage dealt by foes, which gives Latios's fellow offensive teammates more opportunities to switch in and potentially set up and sweep. Memento is an equally important component of the set; in exchange for Latios, it lowers the opposing Pokemon's offenses even further, which forces it to either switch out or deal pathetic damage to your chosen sweeper as it sets up. Memento can also be used as a last-ditch effort to cripple offensive foes if Latios becomes disposable in battle or doesn't have time to set up both screens.

The last slot is dedicated to a single attack. Even without any Special Attack investment, Draco Meteor still deals large amounts of damage to frail Pokemon. Draco Meteor also allows Latios to fake an offensive set, which can potentially give Latios more opportunities to set up screens or pull off Memento in the face of greedy foes. Psychic is a more consistent option that checks a fair amount of OU threats such as Mega Venusaur, Terrakion, and Keldeo. While it may seem tempting to use Psyshock to hit special walls such as Sylveon and Blissey, it will not deal significant damage to them without investment, Life Orb, or Choice Specs; Psychic will usually deal more damage against Psyshock's usual targets anyway. Hidden Power Fighting is an extremely specific option that gives Latios a chance to OHKO Bisharp, a threat that is otherwise problematic thanks to Pursuit as well its ability, Defiant, nullifying Memento's Attack drops. It should be noted that combined with Reflect, Hidden Power Fighting makes one of the few Latios sets that can actually beat Bisharp somewhat comfortably. Outside of this, however, it provides horrible coverage and power for a single moveslot.

Set Details
========

252 HP and Speed EVs with a Timid nature make Latios as bulky and fast as possible. The Speed is required so that Latios can set up screens without taking a lot of damage from slower attacks. However, some investment in bulk can be run in order to set up screens more reliably. Notably, maximum HP investment guarantees that Latios can survive Greninja's Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam and have a chance to check it. Light Clay is used to increase the amount of time Reflect and Light Screen stay on the field.

Usage Tips
========

When creating your team, keep in mind the pros and cons of using Latios as your dual screens user. In a nutshell, Latios has access to Memento, decent defensive typing, and relatively higher offense than Azelf. Additionally, Latios's notoriety for being a huge offensive threat can scare off threats and force switches, which definitely comes in handy when setting up screens. On the other hand, Latias has greater bulk and has massive supportive utility with Healing Wish, Klefki has arguably better bulk and typing and can also check threats with its priority Thunder Wave in a pinch, while Azelf has access to Stealth Rock and Taunt, which are enormous positives that Latios does not have.

This set should typically be used early-game to allow Latios's teammates to set up as soon as possible. It can even be used as a lead, though in most cases you should definitely not use Memento right away, as Latios can always come in again and set up screens and/or use Memento. You should also typically use Memento on Defog users to prevent them from removing the screens right away. Exercise caution when using it against teams with Defiant Bisharp and try not to waste it in vain on weak walls such as Chansey and Skarmory.

Team Options
========

This set is designed to be used on hyper offensive teams with multiple setup sweepers, so it doesn't require that much support. However, it has a bad matchup against threats such as Bisharp and Tyranitar, so it should ideally be paired up with offensive Pokemon that can comfortably set up against them. Mega Tyranitar, Mega Pinsir, Landorus, Keldeo, (Mega) Gyarados, and (Mega) Scizor are all Pokemon capable of doing this, as long as your chosen sweeper can avoid being fatally injured by a surprise Ice Beam, Fire Blast, or Rock-type attack from opposing Tyranitar.

Latios may struggle against threats that boost their Speed while it sets up, as this set can't do significant damage against the likes of Volcarona, (Mega) Gyarados, and Dragonite. Talonflame, especially the Swords Dance variant, can check Volcarona in a pinch, and while Dragonite, Gyarados, and Mega Gyarados are a little difficult to manage, either Reflect or Memento can hinder their incoming physical attacks. Simply adding physically defensive Clefable, Mamoswine, or Choice Scarf users to your team should enable you to take care of them. Other than the sweepers mentioned above, you can pretty much use anything else, as long as you do not make your team defensively vulnerable to a single threat or type of attack.

Although this set doesn't benefit much from Stealth Rock support by itself, providing it is still very helpful as its typical offensive teammates appreciate the extra pressure, and Latios unfortunately lacks it. It is advised to set them up in advance instead of wasting turns after the screens are set up. Fast and offensive users of this move, such as Garchomp and Focus Sash Terrakion, ensure that Stealth Rock is set up quickly without compromising momentum. Both of the aforementioned Pokemon also have access to Swords Dance, so it is entirely possible to switch them in later and attempt a sweep with screens set up.

Other Options
########

Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Fighting can be used to lure in and take on certain threats. Thunderbolt lets Latios take on specially defensive Mandibuzz while also hitting bulky Water- and Flying-types for super effective damage, whereas Hidden Power Fighting OHKOes Bisharp and 2HKOes most Tyranitar. Psychic is also an option, as it is capable of 2HKOing physically defensive Clefable. To achieve an incredibly high damage output, Choice Specs can be run. It allows Latios to 2HKO Clefable and Chansey with Psyshock, which is a good surprise element. A Calm Mind set is also usable for the same reason as the Choice Specs set: while it does use a turn to set up, it gives Latios the ability to do insane amounts of damage.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Physically defensive Clefable and Sylveon can take Latios's Psyshock and are immune to Draco Meteor. In return, they can do significant amounts of damage with their STAB moves, with Sylveon even scoring an OHKO with Hyper Voice. However, both have to be wary of Psychic, which is capable of 2HKOing them. Mega Gardevoir can switch into Psyshock once and threaten Latios out.

**Pursuit Trappers**: Tyranitar and Bisharp can both survive any of Latios's STAB moves and proceed to trap and OHKO Latios with Pursuit. Bisharp has to be wary of Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Fighting, however, while Tyranitar has to be wary of Hidden Power Fighting and Surf.

**Steel-types**: If Latios lacks Hidden Power Fire, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Jirachi fear almost nothing from it and can heal off the damage taken from Draco Meteor with their respective recovery moves. Mega Scizor can threaten to set up with Swords Dance, while Jirachi and Ferrothorn can set up entry hazards.

**Heatran**: As Heatran resists Latios's STAB moves, it takes minor damage on the switch. Between Toxic, Taunt, and Lava Plume, Latios will be easily worn down, while Heatran can also set Stealth Rock to pressure Latios and its teammates. However, if Latios is running Surf or Earthquake, Heatran can't take it on.

**Chansey and Blissey**: If Latios lacks Trick, it has no means of 2HKOing Chansey and Blissey, which can retalitate with status inflictions and Seismic Toss. Choice Specs variants of Latios are capable of 2HKOing both after Stealth Rock damage, but otherwise, it can't take them down.

**Offensive Checks**: Pokemon such as Greninja, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Weavile are capable of switching into one Psyshock, outspeeding and OHKOing Latios in return. Azumarill can come in on any attack barring Psyshock and Thunderbolt and is also capable of OHKOing Latios.
