Overview
########

Thundurus-T's Special Attack stat is one of the highest in OU, this is backed up by Thundurus-T's nice Speed tier of 101, allowing it to outspeed the many Pokemon with base 100 Speed. With two great boosting moves in Agility and Nasty Plot, Thundurus-T is certainly a force to contend with. At +2 Special Attack, Thundurus-T has no safe switch-ins; even Chansey is 2HKOed by it. Thundurus-T's typing provides it with resistances or neutrality to almost all forms of priority, including Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, Bullet Punch, Extreme Speed, and Sucker Punch. Volt Absorb isn't as useful as Prankster, but does provide Thundurus-T with a source of recovery and an immunity; it also enables Thundurus-T to check opposing Electric-types such as Magnezone and Thundurus. However, Thundurus-T suffers huge competition from its other forme, which has a better Speed stat and two much better and less situational abilities. Thundurus-T still suffers from a lack of bulk, which is especially noticeable with its Stealth Rock weakness. Thundurus-T has an extremely large case of four-moveslot syndrome, not being able to fit all the coverage or boosting options it would like to. Its coverage moves are also quite lacking, with the only two being Hidden Power and the unreliable Focus Blast.

Moves
========

Nasty Plot boosts Thundurus-T's already high Special Attack and transforms it into a huge threat for stall teams because of its ability to 2HKO pretty much all Pokemon commonly used on stall teams, such as Chansey. Thunderbolt is an extremely powerful STAB move with a nifty chance to paralyze, hitting many Pokemon extremely hard at +2. Hidden Power Flying is nice for hitting Pokemon that are resistant to Electric-type attacks, particularly Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ice is a usable option to form a pseudo-BoltBeam combination with Thunderbolt, but is not very useful because Hidden Power Flying hits everything relevant harder, such as Mega Venusaur and Quagsire. Focus Blast rounds off Thundurus-T's coverage by hitting Kyurem-B and Excadrill, as well as nearly everything in OU, hard. Grass Knot is a usable option to nail Hippowdon, but +2 Focus Blast will give it trouble anyway.

Set Details
========

252 Special Attack EVs allow Thundurus-T to make full use of its high Special Attack, while maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature enable it to outspeed the crowded base 100 Speed tier. A Modest nature could be used for a boost in power, although it's imprudent to do so because no notable KOs are achieved by doing so. The IVs listed are to keep Thundurus-T's stats high in general while still having Hidden Power Flying. Running 30 in four stats may appear unappealing; however, the only other way to get to Hidden Power Flying is with 30 Speed IVs, and having maximum Speed is far too important to pass up. Leftovers enable Thundurus-T to slowly recover health and possibly gain more chances to set up. A Lum Berry is also usable to give Thundurus-T a one-time save from being hit by Toxic. Life Orb is not a recommended item because it wears down Thundurus-T, which is already worn down very rapidly, too quickly.

Usage Tips
========

Using Thundurus-T as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker is advised, as it can wear down defensive cores for teammates to have an easier time sweeping late-game. Thundurus-T especially excels against stall thanks to its ability to severely damage almost every Pokemon usually found in stall teams; however, this is not the case for offensive teams. Offensive teams are often too fast-paced for Thundurus-T, and it will often struggle to do much versus them. Bringing in Thundurus-T via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is greatly appreciated because it lacks switch-in opportunities. Prediction plays a large part in how Thundurus-T is used. Usually, just attacking offensive checks is best because it can wear them down for a later time. One key example of this is when to use Nasty Plot; using the move while an offensive check is still in the match is not advised; Thundurus-T is better switching out or attacking on the switch. Focus Blast's unreliability can be a bit of a disappointment at times, as an untimely miss can cause Thundurus-T to be KOed, so always be wary when using it.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support is very useful. For example, with just one layer of Spikes, Thundurus-T secures the 2HKO on Chansey. Azumarill stands out as an offensive partner because it shares great synergy with Thundurus-T. Similarly, Keldeo can break down Chansey and Tyranitar with ease and also enjoys Thundurus-T's ability to take on Mega Venusaur. Pursuit support from the likes of Bisharp and Tyranitar is beneficial because it can remove Latias and Latios, which otherwise can revenge kill Thundurus-T. Lucario forms a powerful offensive core because of the two's synergy and ability to wear down each other's checks for one or the other to sweep late-game. Finally, Mega Scizor can pivot Thundurus-T in with U-turn and can also use Defog to remove the hazards Thundurus-T is not fond of.

Other Options
########

Choice Scarf is the primary option when not running the set, as thanks to its base 101 Speed, Thundurus-T can outspeed all base 100 Speed Choice Scarf users. Agility can be used in a similar vein and works well because it allows Thundurus-T. A set using both Agility and Nasty Plot can be used, but hyper offense teams apply too much pressure and Thundurus-T will almost never be able to boost both of its stats. Knock Off could see use for removing Chansey's Eviolite and Hippowdon's Leftovers to make these threats easier for it to break through; Knock Off also has the added benefit of hitting both Latios and Latias super effectively. U-turn keeps up momentum and is preferred over Volt Switch because it can be used on potential Ground-type switch-ins. Substitute is an intriguing option as a shield against Toxic, but four-moveslot syndrome makes it hard for Thundurus-T to give up coverage. Taunt could be used as a larger annoyance to stall teams by preventing recovery or entry hazard setup.

Checks & Counters
########

**Revenge Killing**: Like other setup sweepers, Thundurus-T is very vulnerable to revenge killing. For example, Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Tyranitar can outspeed and KO it with Stone Edge. Similarly, Latias and Latios revenge kill Thundurus-T with Draco Meteor; however, they cannot switch directly into Thundurus-T. Some other examples include Choice Scarf Keldeo, Choice Scarf Latios, and Choice Scarf Terrakion. It should be noted that priority falls under the 'revenge killing' category when Thundurus-T is a bit weakened; such examples include Azumarill's Aqua Jet and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. 

**Bulkier Special Walls**: Pokemon like Hippowdon and Chansey can wall Thundurus-T quite easily because it just lacks the raw power to break through them immediately, and they can respond with a Toxic or, in Hippowdon's case, Stone Edge. Hippowdon can also wall it in general because Thundurus-T will have to rely on the unreliable Focus Blast in hopes to break through it. Clefable and Mew both shrug off unboosted Thunderbolt and have the ability to stomach a boosted hit as well.

**Offensive Pressure**: By leaving Thundurus-T with little room to set up, it cannot boost and so is left weak. This is especially noticeable against hyper offense teams, which Thundurus-T struggles with. Generally Pokemon that either threaten to KO it or outspeed it with super effective moves are enough to apply pressure; this includes Mega Charizard X and Terrakion. All of these Pokemon have strong moves that can overpower Thundurus-T and force it to switch, therefore preventing it from boosting.
