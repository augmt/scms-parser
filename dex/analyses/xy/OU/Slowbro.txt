Overview
########

Slowbro's good Water / Psychic typing and 95 / 110 / 80 defensive stats allow it to wall a large portion of the metagame, including numerous key threats such as Terrakion and Gyarados. Its fantastic recovery options, Regenerator and Slack Off, make its role as a wall even easier while also allowing it to act as an unpredictable pivot. Speaking of unpredictability, Slowbro's excellent offensive movepool and solid base 100 Special Attack give it the ability to threaten almost all of its common switch-ins with the correct move. Slowbro does have a few notable flaws that detract from its appeal as a defensive Pokemon, such as a weakness to Pursuit and a vulnerability to status moves, but it is one of the best bulky Water-types available.

Physical Wall
########
name: Physical Wall
move 1: Scald
move 2: Fire Blast / Ice Beam / Psyshock
move 3: Toxic / Thunder Wave
move 4: Slack Off
ability: Regenerator
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 232 Def / 24 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Scald is the move Slowbro will be using most of the time. Due to its 30% burn rate, it often provides extra insurance against physical attackers, as well as chip damage against other threats. In the next two slots, any combination of the listed moves can work. Fire Blast is mainly for Ferrothorn and Scizor, 2HKOing the former and OHKOing offensive variants of the latter. Ice Beam hits Dragon-types and a few Grass-types super effectively, and it also allows Slowbro to defeat specially defensive Gliscor lacking Toxic. Psyshock is a secondary STAB move that hits Fighting- and Poison-types such as Keldeo, Conkeldurr, Gengar, and Amoonguss super effectively, though Psychic is also an option to hit physically bulky foes such as defensive Mega Venusaur harder. Both of these moves will break Gyarados's Substitute in one hit, but only Psychic will consistently break Kyurem-B's Substitute. Toxic gives Slowbro the ability to put a timer on its opponents and potentially stall them out with Slack Off, which is key against Mega Charizard X in particular. Thunder Wave, on the other hand, incapacitates Pokemon that rely on their Speed, although anything with at least 385 Speed will still outspeed Slowbro when paralyzed. Slack Off rounds out the set by giving Slowbro a form of reliable recovery that does not force it to switch out. Grass Knot is another option to break normal and Mega Gyarados's Substitutes.

Set Details
========

An EV investment of 252 HP and 24 Special Defense ensures that Slowbro will survive two Hydro Pumps from Choice Specs Keldeo after Stealth Rock damage, factoring in Leftovers recovery. The rest of the EVs are placed in Defense and backed by a Bold nature to help Slowbro wall physical attackers. Regenerator restores a sizable portion of Slowbro's health when it switches out. Leftovers is the preferred item, but Rocky Helmet is an option to punish physical attackers that use contact moves against Slowbro, especially weaker users of U-turn.

Usage Tips
========

As is the norm with many defensive Pokemon, Slowbro should be switched into something it can check or counter, such as Mega Medicham or Keldeo, and proceed to spread status with Scald, Toxic, or Thunder Wave. While Slowbro is more than capable of walling physical attackers, it also functions as a pivot thanks to Regenerator; it can switch in to absorb an attack and then immediately switch out afterwards without suffering much, if any, net HP loss. Switching often is actually beneficial to Slowbro because of Regenerator, but Slack Off can allow Slowbro to be unpredictable in terms of switching, as having the option to use Slack Off means that Slowbro is not forced to switch in order to heal. Slack Off can also be used to scout for what the opponent will do, though this is can be risky against setup sweepers that are not poisoned or burned.

Team Options
========

Slowbro performs well under many defensively oriented playstyles, but it works best on full stall teams. Defensive Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Celebi are great teammates for Slowbro, as they can handle Electric-types. Amoonguss is especially noteworthy, as it forms a potent Regenerator core with Slowbro. Tornadus-T is another Regenerator user that has remarkable synergy with Slowbro and Amoonguss. Defensive Fire-types such as Heatran and Mega Charizard X also pair well with Slowbro, as they can deal with Electric-types, and Mega Charizard X can outspeed and OHKO Mega Heracross. Hippowdon also deals with most Electric-types effectively. Gliscor is a fantastic teammate for Slowbro; depending on its set, Gliscor can handle some combination of Bug-types, Dark-types, Gengar, and defensive Pokemon in general. Slowbro also resists both of the types that Gliscor is weak to. Other physically sturdy walls that cover Slowbro's weaknesses, including Skarmory, Zapdos, and Mandibuzz, can work as well. Lastly, clerics and Unaware users compensate for many of Slowbro's issues, which makes Chansey, Clefable, and Quagsire excellent partners for Slowbro.

Other Options
########

A Calm Mind set is viable. Because of Psyshock, Calm Mind Slowbro can defeat CroCune and Magic Guard + Calm Mind Clefable, both of which are huge threats to stall teams. Aside from this, Slowbro's movepool includes several other support options, such as Trick Room, Magic Coat, and Yawn. Trick Room can be used to support Trick Room teams. Magic Coat bounces back Taunt, hazards, and attempted status. Yawn can force switches to help spread status and in general wear down foes. Slowbro also has access to many other offensive moves, such as Foul Play, Focus Blast, and Future Sight. Foul Play is mostly redundant with a status in punishing setup users, but can be used to be more proactive against foes like Mega Charizard X. Focus Blast OHKOes Tyranitar and Bisharp attempting to Pursuit trap, and breaks Mega Gyarados's Substitutes. Future Sight works paired with teammates that force certain Pokemon that don't like to take a Future Sight in, though Slowking's extra power with Choice Specs is preferred for this. Assault Vest is a usable item, though an Assault Vest set is done better by Slowking. 

Checks & Counters
########

**Electric-types**: Thundurus, Zapdos, Rotom-W, Raikou, Magnezone, Mega Manectric, and Mega Ampharos deal heavy damage to Slowbro with their STAB moves. In addition, most of these Pokemon take little from Scald and all of them are immune to Thunder Wave.

**Grass-types**: Mega Venusaur and Celebi can take any attack from Slowbro and retaliate with a STAB Giga Drain, and neither is terribly bothered by Toxic or Thunder Wave. Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Breloom can all deal with Slowbro as well, though they are 2HKOed if it has the correct coverage move.

**Bug-, Dark-, and Ghost-type Moves**: Mega Heracross OHKOes Slowbro with Pin Missile, while Scolipede and Scizor leave a serious dent in it with their Bug-type STAB moves. Bisharp and other offensive Dark-types are also significant threats to Slowbro, as are Shadow Ball users such as Gengar. None of these Pokemon can easily switch into Slowbro, however.

**Bulky Status Absorbers**: Chansey, Suicune, and Magic Guard Clefable take next to nothing from all of Slowbro's attacks. The latter two can also set up with Calm Mind against Slowbro, though they will lose to Slowbro if it too has Calm Mind.

**Powerful Special Attackers**: Special attackers such as Latios and Mega Charizard Y can take advantage of Slowbro's average Special Defense and threaten it greatly.

**Poison and Burns**: Poisoning or burning Slowbro will considerably reduce its walling and pivoting capabilities.
