Overview
########

With access to every single TM, HM, and tutor move in the game, Mew is a top contender for the title of the most versatile Pokemon. The Defog buff gave it the niche of being one of the few users of the move that isn't weak to Stealth Rock. Mew is also the only relevant Defog user with access to Will-O-Wisp, which allows it to negate the Attack boost provided to several Defiant users by Defog.

However, none of Mew's stats are particularly good by OU standards; its offensive stats are only above average without a boost and its Speed leaves it outsped by many threats. Its average defensive typing leaves it weak to common attacking types, such as Bug, Dark, and Ghost, with little neutralities to boast for itself. Because of these problems, and despite Mew's monumental menu of moves, it can only run a couple of viable sets without being outclassed. When Mew does its few jobs, however, it does them exceptionally well, and opponents would be foolish to let their guard down against it.

Stallbreaker
########
name: Stallbreaker
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Soft-Boiled
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Synchronize
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 104 Def / 152 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========
This set makes Mew one of the best stallbreakers in the game. Taunt and Will-O-Wisp allow Mew to dismantle many stall cores, especially those involving Mega Venusaur, Skarmory, Blissey, and Chansey. Soft-Boiled provides Mew with reliable recovery. Knock Off is another great stallbreaking tool and rids opposing walls of their precious Leftovers or Eviolite. Night Shade is an okay option that allows Mew to deal consistent damage to any Pokemon that isn't Normal-type. Other coverage moves can be considered to hit Mew's typical checks and counters. For example, Ice Beam can be used if your team has problems with Landorus, as Mew can take a hit and OHKO 87.5% of the time; it also hits Gliscor, Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Thundurus hard. Earth Power and Aura Sphere also allow Mew to better handle Steel- and Fire-types, such as Heatran, though without investment, the aforementioned moves aren't particularly powerful. 

Set Details
========
The Speed EVs allow Mew to outspeed Jolly Mega Heracross and everything slower. The rest of the EVs are invested in HP and Defense to maximize Mew's bulk and allow it to counter Mega Medicham. The nature further boosts Mew's Defense. A specially defensive spread can be run to handle Pokemon such as Landorus better, but countering Mega Medicham is so important for a bulky Psychic-type that it usually isn't recommended. Leftovers provides passive recovery.

Usage Tips
========
This set single-handedly dismantles many stall cores, such as the famous SkarmBliss. Use it if your team needs a utility Pokemon that can also threaten stall. Don't use it as a wall, as its bulk is nothing to write home about, even after investment. Always try to keep Mew as healthy as possible, as it may have to frequently switch in and out. Never try to keep Mew on a Pokemon that might potentially carry a status move unless you have a cleric in your team. Be wary of using Will-O-Wisp if your opponent has a Fire-type, as it may give them a free switch-in. If your opponent sends in a cleric, Taunt it as soon as possible. If you are using Knock Off, spam it as often as you can. Against offensive teams, Mew can spread burns easily and can give one of your sweepers easy setup opportunities.

Team Options
========
Mew can wear down common stall Pokemon so that your sweepers can break past them. It can spread burns quite well, thus crippling many physical attackers. A burned Pokemon also makes for good setup fodder for your own sweepers. Mew hates status, so a cleric or a status absorber makes for a very good teammate. Clefable, specially defensive Gliscor, and Chansey can absorb status; Clefable and Chansey can even heal status from Mew. RestTalk Gyarados is a good status absorber and also checks both formes of Mega Charizard, which can switch into Mew quite easily. Something that can switch into Heatran, such as Rotom-W or Conkeldurr, is also appreciated.

Entry Hazard Control
########
name: Entry Hazard Control
move 1: Defog
move 2: Soft-Boiled
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Synchronize
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 104 Def / 152 Spe
nature: Impish

Moves
========
Defog is the main move on this set, removing entry hazards on both sides of the field. Soft-Boiled provides recovery, allowing Mew to clear entry hazards throughout the game. Will-O-Wisp can burn the opposing Pokemon, slowly wearing them out and and crippling most physical attackers. Will-O-Wisp nullifies the Attack boost that Defiant users like Bisharp might get from switching into Defog. Knock Off is crucial in the last to reduce Mew's passivity and remove items from Pokemon such as Heatran and Landorus. Taunt is also an option to prevent setup and slower Stealth Rock users from continuing to set up the hazard. It is also very useful against opposing support Pokemon, as Mew is generally faster than most of them. However, the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off is usually enough to deter the things Taunt prevents, and losing either is severely detrimental. Stealth Rock can be used if your team lacks a setter. Mew can use Stealth Rock after Defog, ensuring that Stealth Rock is only up on the opponent's side of the field.

Set Details
========
The Speed EVs allow Mew to outspeed max Speed Jolly Mega Heracross so Mew can burn it before it attacks Mew. The rest is invested in HP and Defense so that Mew can counter Mega Medicham. A slower spread of 252 HP / 224 SpD / 32 Spe with a Careful nature, utilizing enough Speed investment to outspeed and burn Bisharp and max Speed Jolly Tyranitar before they can attack, and Special Defense investment that lets it tackle Stealth Rock Landorus. Leftovers is the item of choice and provides passive recovery.

Usage Tips
========
This set works best on bulky offense and balanced teams. Mew can switch in on many defensive Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Chansey, Taunt them, and then use Defog. If the opponent has a Defiant user, it is generally better to not use Defog immediately. Will-O-Wisp is the better option in this case. Try to keep Mew at high health if the opponent's entry hazard setters have not been KOed yet. Don't use Mew as a wall; just use it as an utility Pokemon who can use Defog and stallbreak for your team. Don't bring it in on strong unresisted STAB moves, as its bulk is not spectacular and it will get worn down fast.

Team Options
========
Pokemon which appreciate the removal of entry hazards from their side of field, such as Charizard, Talonflame, Dragonite, Pinsir, and Kyurem-B, are good teammates. Mew appreciates teammates that can deal with strong Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Bisharp. Hippowdon and Scizor can easily handle the aforementioned Pursuit trappers. Unaware Quagsire is a good teammate as it counters Defiant users. A Pokemon to take on Mega Charizard is needed as Mew can't do anything against either forme. Heatran is a good option as is RestTalk Gyarados. Mew appreciates cleric support as poison and burn ruin its bulk and force it to frequently waste turns by using Soft-Boiled. If you can't pack a cleric, a status absorber can work too. Again, RestTalk Gyarados is a good candidate.

Other Options
########

Due to its huge movepool, Mew has no lack of options. It can use both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot to good effect; however, it is let down by its mediocre Speed and four moveslot syndrome. Mew can also use a Choice set to grab surprise revenge kills, but its main selling point is its versatility, and it isn't an exceptionally good user as it lacks powerful and spammable STAB. Mew is one of the only Pokemon that can use Transform somewhat reliably due to its above-average bulk. A lead set with Taunt, Stealth Rock, Tailwind, and Explosion can also work quite well, but is generally not worth it over Azelf or an offensive setter such as Terrakion, Landorus, or Mamoswine that simply brings more to the table. Mew can also run a Baton Pass set with either Nasty Plot or Swords Dance and Rock Polish, which can be devastating to unprepared teams. Baton Pass can be used on any set to bypass Pursuit, provided that Mew is faster, although Pursuit is typically not a problem because of Will-O-Wisp.

Checks & Counters
########

**Heatran**: Heatran sponges anything that the support sets can throw at it, although if Mew is running an offensive set with super effective coverage moves, the latter can win in an one-on-one situation.

**Prankster and Faster Taunt Users**: Prankster Taunt users such as Sableye and Thundurus can shut down the support sets easily.

**Charizard**: Mega Charizard X can Dragon Dance on Mew and proceed to sweep its team, while Mega Charizard Y switches into Mew easily and can fire off sun-boosted Fire Blasts.

**Status**: Burn and poison ruin Mew's bulk by whittling down its HP and slowly wearing it out. Gliscor, especially if it is EV'd to outrun Mew, is a particular issue.

**Strong Special Attackers**: Strong special attackers, such as Mega Charizard Y and Choice Specs Keldeo, can easily 2HKO Mew and don't fear Will-O-Wisp.
