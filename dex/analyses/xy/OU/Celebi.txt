Offensive
########
Name: Offensive
Move 1: Leaf Storm / Giga Drain
Move 2: Earth Power / Psychic
Move 3: Ancient Power / Hidden Power Fire
Move 4: Recover
Ability: Natural Cure
Item: Life Orb
Nature: Timid / Modest
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

Moves
======
- Leaf Storm is Celebi's main STAB, which allows her to do massive damage to many Pokemon.
- The combination of Earth Power and Ancient Power offers Celebi very effective coverage, while also being a great lure for Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y. It does, however, get walled by Pokemon such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory.
- The combination of Psychic and Hidden Power Fire also gets great coverage, and it can actually hit Pokemon such as Szicor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. It's unable to hit the extremely common Heatran, however, and it can't lure out Charizard Y and Talonflame.
- Giga Drain can be used as an option over Lead Storm, as it doesn't lower Celebi's Special Attack and it can recover HP. It's a lot weaker, however.

Set Details
=========
- Life Orb allows Celebi to hit as hard as possible.
- A Timid nature allows Celebi to Speed tie with Pokemon such as Charizard-Y, Manaphy, Staraptor, and Salamence.
- If using the spread of Leaf Storm/Psychic/Hidden Power Fire, however, you aren't able to win these speed ties due to Hidden Power's lowered Speed IV. This then makes Modest the best nature, as it can hit hard while still outspeeding most under 100 Speed threats.
- 252 SpA EVs allows Celebi to hit hard, while 252 Spe EVs allow Celebi to be as fast as possible.

Usage Tips
=========
- Make sure to only use the combination of Grass move/Earth Power/Hidden Power Rock or Grass move/Psychic/Hidden Power Fire, as they offer the best coverage.
- Use Celebi as a way to deal with Pokemon such as Rotom-W, as it's one of its best counters.
- If you see a Heatran on the opposing team, try to keep Earth Power hidden, as it's usually unexpected and has a good chance to OHKO after Stealth Rocks.
- Try to use Leaf Storm only when needed, as the Special Attack drop forces Celebi to switch out a lot of them time.
- Natural Cure makes Celebi a good switch-in to status Pokemon, such as Thundurus.

Team Options
===========
- Pokemon who don't like Rotom-W, such as Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, and (Mega) Scizor all appreciate Celebi's support.
- Pokemon who can absorb U-turn, such as Landorus-T and Heatran work well with Celebi.
- Rock-type Pokemon cover a lot of Celebi's weaknesses, making (Mega) Tyranitar a good partner.
- Pokemon such as Manaphy and Azumaril can wear down Celebi's counters. They also appreciate Celebi's ability to absorb Electric- and Grass-type attacks.
- Fire-types, such as Heatran, Charizard, and Talonflame can take Fire- and Bug-type attacks for Celebi, while appreciating Celebi's ability to absorb Water-type attacks.

Defensive
########
Name: Defensive
Move 1: Recover
Move 2: Giga Drain / Psychic
Move 3: Baton Pass / U-turn
Move 4: Perish Song / Thunder Wave / Heal Bell
Ability: Natural Cure
Item: Leftovers
Nature: Calm
EVs: 248 HP / 252 SpD / 8 Spe

Moves
======
- Recover keep Celebi healthy throughout the match, and allows her to continue walling without getting worn down.
- Giga Drain can hit the Pokemon Celebi is walling, and makes sure it isn't complete Taunt bait.
- Baton Pass allows Celebi to escape Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar and Bisharp.
- Perish Song stops set-up sweepers from sweeping, and can also be a guaranteed win condition for when your opponent only has one Pokemon left.
- Psychic is an option to hit Flying-, Poison-, Grass-, Dragon-, and Fighting-types harder, but it doesn't do as much to Water-, Ground-, Dark, and Psychic-type Pokemon, and doesn't recover HP.
- U-turn can help gain momentum, but it means Celebi can still be Pursuit trapped.
- Thunder Wave can also cripple set-up sweepers as well as fast attackers, but isn't a guaranteed win condition.
- Heal Bell can be used to remove status from your teammates, though it doesn't help against offensive threats.

Set Details
=========
- EVs allow Celebi to best tank special hits from the likes of Thundurus, Keldeo, Rotom-W, and more.
- Calm nature further assists Celebi's special bulk.
- Leftovers helps keep Celebi healthy throughout the match.

Usage Tips
========
- Celebi is a great switch into special attackers like non-Nasty Plot Thundurus, Keldeo, Rotom-W, the Lati twins, Zapdos, and Politoad.
- Make sure to use Recover often, you don't want Celebi to be weak when switching in.
- If running U-turn, make sure to use it on predicted Pursuit-user switch-ins to avoid getting Pursuit trapped.
- If running Perish Song, it can be a good idea to keep Celebi alive the entire match in order to guarantee a win.

Team Options
===========
- Pokemon that dislike special Electric-, Water-, and Grass-type Pokemon, such as Skarmory, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and most Water-types pair well with Celebi.
- Heatran forms the famous "CeleTran" combination.
- Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Heatran can absorb U-turn for Celebi.
- Pokemon who can absorb Dark- and Ghost-type moves, such as Tyranitar and Mandibuzz, also pair well with Celebi.

Other Options
##########

- Calm Mind on the Baton Pass set.
- Choice Scarf.

Checks & Counters
#############

- Fire-types, such as Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Air Balloon Heatran avoid Earth Power, resist Grass-type moves, and scare Celebi out.
- Flying-types, such as Mega Pinsir, Mandibuzz, Staraptor, and Tornadus all hit Celebi for good damage.
- Bisharp and Gengar hit Celebi super-effectively, but must watch out for Earth Power and Psychic, respectively.
- Bulky Dragons, such as the Lati twins and Goodra also deal with Celebi well. Defensive Celebi, can, however, stall out the Lati twins.
