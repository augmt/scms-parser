Overview
########

Mega Aggron is one of the greatest physical tanks ever, capable of checking and countering many top-tier threats. Its Steel typing combined with Filter allows it to check many prominent threats in the metagame, such as Mega Metagross and Mega Altaria lacking Fire Blast. Aggron also has access to great support moves such as Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave. Unfortunately, Aggron lacks reliable recovery outside of Rest, has a poor defensive typing prior to Mega Evolving, and has a large opportunity cost — by using Mega Aggron, you cannot use other, arguably better, Mega Pokemon.

Moves
========

Mega Aggron's bulk makes it a great user of Stealth Rock. Heavy Slam is Aggron's STAB move and packs quite a punch even without any Attack investment, thanks to how heavy Aggron is. Avalanche deals lots of damage to Pokemon that would otherwise wall this set, such as Landorus-T and Gliscor, and is used over Ice Punch because Aggron is slower than its targets anyways. Thunder Wave is one of Aggron's best support options; it slows down faster Pokemon, making them easier to check. Fire Punch allows Mega Aggron to counter Mega Scizor while also hitting Ferrothorn, but Earthquake can be used instead to hit Heatran and Excadrill. Rock Slide can be used to hit Flying-types such as Talonflame and Mega Pinsir. Dragon Tail is another option to phaze Pokemon that try to set up on Aggron, while also racking up residual damage if entry hazards are in play.

Set Details
========

252 HP EVs and an Impish nature take advantage of Aggron's stellar Defense, while 240 Special Defense EVs are used to patch up its weaker Special Defense. The rest of the EVs are placed into Defense to reach a jump point. Investing more into Defense is also an option to better check physical attackers, but Aggron is already incredibly physically bulky. Investing some EVs into Attack can be done to hit harder, but Aggron's main purpose is to serve as a tank.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Evolving Aggron as soon as possible is crucial, as it is quite useless before that. This can be accomplished through a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, or by sending Aggron in after a teammate faints. Aggron is a great defensive tank, so use it to check dangerous physical attackers such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Metagross, and Mega Altaria. Aggron lacks reliable recovery, so try not to let it get worn down too much. Removing Mega Sableye is also helpful, as it is a huge problem for this set.

Team Options
========

Sylveon can take on Mega Sableye, pass Wishes, and check special attackers that Mgea Aggron has trouble with. In return, Mega Aggron can check Poison- and Steel-type physical attackers that trouble Sylveon. Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Garchomp make for good partners, as they appreciate Mega Aggron's ability to handle most Fairy- and Dragon-types. Mega Aggron is effective at luring out and dealing with Gliscor and Landorus-T; Pokemon that appreciate these foes gone such as Terrakion are also good teammates. In general, Pokemon that can take on strong special attackers make for solid partners. Chansey is an excellent partner, being able to pass Wishes to keep Aggron healthy, ward off powerful special attackers, and cure status, which neuters Aggron.

Other Options
########

Metal Burst can deal back lots of damage to Pokemon that can't OHKO Aggron; however, it uses up a valuable moveslot and is quite unreliable. A Rock Polish sweeping set is also an option, although Aggron lacks wallbreaking power, making it a subpar setup sweeper at best.

Checks & Counters
########

**Physical Walls**: Defensive Pokemon that don't particularly care about Mega Aggron's attacks are good counters. Hippowdon can effortlessly switch into Mega Aggron, wall it, and beat it with repeated uses of Earthquake. Skarmory and Ferrothorn can shrug off all of Mega Aggron's moves and freely set up entry hazards on it; however, Ferrothorn must watch out for Fire Punch.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Mega Slowbro, and Manaphy can sponge just about anything Aggron throws at them and fish for a Scald burn or just slowly wear it down.

**Special Attackers**: Pokemon that carry super effective moves, such as Mega Charizard Y with Fire Blast and Thundurus with Focus Blast, can easily take out Mega Aggron. Keldeo can boost with Calm Mind, and eventually break through it.
