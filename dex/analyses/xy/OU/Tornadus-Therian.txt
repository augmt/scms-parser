Overview
########

With access to an amazing offensive ability in Regenerator, Tornadus-T returns to OU as a fantastic offensive pivot. Regenerator offsets both Life Orb and Stealth Rock damage, reducing the overall damaging effect of entry hazards, and works fantastically with U-turn. With its blazing Speed stat and good movepool, Tornadus-T is able to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame and hit hard with its good Special Attack stat. The main downside to using Tornadus-T is its over-reliance on rain if it wants to use its most powerful STAB, Hurricane. Also, while Flying may be a fantastic offensive typing, it is fairly lackluster defensively, limiting the amount of Pokemon Tornadus-T can switch into. While Tornadus-T can do a lot of damage once its on the field, it requires proper team support and planning to get in, limiting its overall use in the metagame.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Hurricane
move 2: Superpower
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Taunt
ability: Regenerator
item: Life Orb
evs: 76 Atk / 216 SpA / 216 Spe
nature: Naive

Moves
========

Hurricane is Tornadus-T's best and most powerful STAB option and has perfect accuracy in the rain. Superpower is used to provide good coverage against Steel- and Rock-types, such as Excadrill and Tyranitar, as well as popular special walls such as Chansey. U-turn is a very valuable move, as it provides momentum for teams by allowing you to scout your opponent's move. Additionally, U-turn works especially well with Regenerator, since Tornadus-T regains health every time it switches out. Taunt is used to prevent walls from stopping Tornadus-T with status as well as to render Pokemon such as Gliscor, Chansey, and Ferrothorn nearly useless. Knock Off can be used instead of Taunt, but it generally does not work as well with breaking more stall-based teams. Heat Wave can be used, but it is weak in the rain and provides similar coverage to Hurricane. Focus Blast can be used over Superpower, but its mediocre accuracy isn't as reliable.

Set Details
========

76 EVs go into Attack to allow Tornadus-T to specifically OHKO Tyranitar and Excadrill with Superpower and to be able to deal some damage with its other physical move, U-turn. 216 Speed investment with a Naive nature is all it needs to outspeed Pokemon that are base 115 Speed and under, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar. The rest is dumped into Special Attack so that Hurricane can hit as hard as possible. Finally, Life Orb is the item of choice, as it bolsters attacking power, and the recoil isn't much of a problem due to Regenerator.

Usage Tips
========

Tornadus-T works well on rain teams, as it has a perfectly accurate high Base Power STAB move, and provides great momentum for wallbreakers such as Kingdra. Try not to switch Tornadus-T into too many attacks, as it's bulk and defensive typing aren't very good for taking hits. When in doubt, always U-turn, as it allows you to scout your opponent and gain an advantage. Switches need to be predicted. Good predicts, like using Superpower on an incoming Tyranitar, are really valuable and can help boost your chances of victory in the long run.

Team Options
========

Politoed is an amazing teammate, as its Drizzle ability gives Tornadus-T's best attack, Hurricane, perfect accuracy. Even though it has Regenerator, Tornadus-T still appreciates Defog and Rapid Spin support. This makes Latios a very good partner, and it also resists Tornadus-T's Electric-type weakness. Kabutops is very common on rain teams and is a good partner because it can spin hazards away. Tornadus-T pairs well with other momentum move users, such as Mega Scizor, as they give it ample opportunities to switch in. Both Latias and Latios make good teammates, as they can take care of Rotom-W, which is a huge threat to Tornadus-T. Assault Vest Azumarill makes an exceptional teammate, as it appreciates Tornadus-T's ability to take on Mega Venusaur. Lastly, because of how many switches Tornadus-T causes, it pairs well with Stealth Rock users, such as Garchomp and Excadrill, who both resist and are immune to its Rock- and Electric-type weaknesses. Additionally, Excadrill can spin away hazards for Tornadus-T if needed.

Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Hurricane
move 2: Focus Blast
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: U-turn
item: Assault Vest
evs: 132 HP / 160 SpA / 216 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Hurricane is Tornadus-T's STAB attack and largest source of damage; the accuracy is a necessary evil because the only alternative is Air Slash, which can't even KO Keldeo. Focus Blast provides important coverage on Pokemon that resist Flying, such as Tyranitar and Heatran, and 2HKOes Ferrothorn. Knock Off is a major detriment to most defensive switch-ins to Tornadus-T, and Mega Venusaur can't switch in to sponge the same either as it takes heavy damage from Hurricane; for instance, by getting rid of Heatran's Leftovers or Chansey's Eviolite, Knock Off can allow Tornadus-T and its teammates to break through them more easily. It also lets Tornadus-T function as a more effective Landorus check, getting rid of its Life Orb, which is a huge source of power for it. U-turn rounds out the set perfectly, as it is simply a great move, working well in tandem with Regenerator to let Tornadus-T pivot out of threatening Pokemon and keep the momentum in its team's favor whilst it is healed.

Heat Wave particularly annihilates Ferrothorn and Skarmory, but Focus Blast already 2HKOes both, and the loss of coverage on Heatran and Tyranitar is significant. Superpower is a potential option over Focus Blast for a 100% accurate Fighting-type coverage move that does more damage to Tyranitar and Heatran; however, it does barely anything to Ferrothorn and moreover forces Tornadus-T to run a Hasty nature for it to have a decent damage output, which unnecessarily compromises its physical bulk.

Set Details
========

The EVs give Tornadus-T a guaranteed OHKO on Keldeo with Hurricane whilst allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf Tyranitar and still having some bulk to take on the likes of Landorus and Choice Specs Keldeo better. The choice of a Timid nature over Hasty might seem odd, as this set has two physical moves; the reasoning is that neither is used for its power or coverage, but for pure utility, meaning the decrease in physical bulk is not worth a slightly increased damage output.

Usage Tips
========

The function of this Tornadus-T is to pivot into special attackers, most notably handling Landorus admirably and checking Keldeo: it takes about 65% from Choice Specs Hydro Pump and is able to threaten an OHKO in return with Hurricane. As the opponent switches out to some sort of defensive answer, Knock Off is usually the best option to cripple it, and then Tornadus-T should U-turn out to get Regenerator recovery. If Tornadus-T has already gotten rid of the threat's item, or you don't want something like Mega Charizard X to pick up the momentum, then a flat U-turn is the best option. If you see that the opponent doesn't really have any good switch-ins, then firing off a Hurricane is a good option. Most of the time, however, Tornadus-T's best move is U-turn, as it has literally zero downsides, giving its team momentum and Tornadus-T back a good chunk of its health.

Team Options
========

One of this Tornadus-T's primary roles is as a Landorus check for stall, which tends to have enormous issues with it. Defog support from the likes of Skarmory or Mandibuzz is very much appreciated, as even with Regenerator, Stealth Rock is simply too much of a detriment to Tornadus-T's hit-taking ability and longevity. Skarmory pairs especially well because it can deal with Tyranitar, which isn't OHKOed by Focus Blast and can tank Tornadus-T's other moves with ease. Furthermore, it can deal with Gyarados and Dragonite, which can take advantage of Tornadus-T to set up. Although irrelevant to Defog, Ferrothorn also fits well because it can handle these threats. Mandibuzz in conjunction with Tornadus-T ensures that you are mostly safe against Landorus, although it is slightly redundant. Bulky Will-O-Wisp Mega Charizard X, as well as Heatran to some extent, are good partners too, as they are able to put pressure on the Steel-types that stand in Tornadus-T's way. A good Mega Charizard X check of your own is imperative with Tornadus-T, which is complete setup fodder for the former barring confusion from Hurricane. Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Slowbro are good examples of such. Amoonguss can handle the Electric-types that threaten Tornadus-T and serves as a more reliable answer to Keldeo, forming a Regenerator core with Tornadus-T that can pivot around threats and generally stay healthy without giving up free turns to heal. Slowbro can be added to this core in order to take on Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, and other attackers that threaten it.

From a balanced and bulky offensive point of view, Tornadus-T pairs well with Mega Manectric and Raikou; the Electric-types cover Thundurus especially, while Tornadus-T deals with defensive Grass-types, most notably Mega Venusaur, and can check the Ground-type Choice Scarf users that threaten them. It can also fit well onto certain rain teams that want its defensive services, greatly appreciating perfect accuracy on Hurricane, but it is simply too weak as compared to Life Orb variants, which are much more difficult to deal with and typically the better option for an offensive rain team.

Other Options
########

A Bulk Up + Acrobatics set can be used, with its main allure being that it is not rain dependent; however, without Flying Gem it is quite difficult to use. The lack of Life Orb power also greatly reduces Tornadus-T's wallbreaking capabilities. Alternatively, a Choice Specs set can be used, but this is generally inferior due to the inability to switch attacks and lack of Knock Off. Grass Knot can instead be used to hit specially defensive Hippowdon, while Hidden Power Ice can be used to target Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Dragonite.

Checks & Counters
########

- **Specially Defensive Walls**: Perhaps the best answer to Tornadus-T is Mega Ampharos, which resists Tornadus-T's STAB while also being immune to Knock Off. Specially defensive walls such as Skarmory, Bronzong, and Zapdos also make for good checks to Tornadus-T, being able to reliably take every attack. Heatran also makes for a decent check, being able to take an attack and threaten back with Toxic or a STAB Fire-type attack. Specially defensive pivots such as Rotom-W and Rotom-H make for good checks as well, resisting Tornadus-T's STAB attack and threatening back with STAB Electric-type attacks.

- **Steel-types**: Resisting Tornadus-T's STAB moves, Steel-types such as Jirachi and Assault Vest Escavalier are good checks if it lacks Knock Off. Specially defensive Mega Scizor also works quite well, only fearing a possible Heat Wave.

- **Offensive Checks**: Due to its heavy reliance on its Speed stat, Tornadus-T does not invest in its bulk very much, making faster threats such as Aerodactyl and Jolteon reliable checks. Tornadus-T can also be checked by priority users such as Ice Shard Mamoswine and Bullet Punch Scizor.
