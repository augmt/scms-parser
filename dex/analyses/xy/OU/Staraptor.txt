Overview
########

Staraptor is one of the strongest wallbreakers in the OU metagame, boasting a solid base 120 Attack and a decent base 100 Speed backed up by a great ability in Reckless and a movepool that contains all the tools it needs to dismantle defensive cores. In addition to this, it can run Choice items effectively to either function as a powerful wallbreaker or a great revenge killer. However, Staraptor's dependency on recoil moves wears it down quickly, and its below-average defenses mean that it cannot take many hits before going down. Staraptor's common weaknesses and the ubiquity of Stealth Rock mean that it also has limited switch-in opportunities.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Double-Edge
move 3: Final Gambit / Close Combat / Quick Attack
move 4: U-turn
ability: Reckless
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Brave Bird and Double-Edge are Staraptor's strongest STAB attacks, dealing large chunks of damage to even Pokemon that resist them. The third moveslot contains the surprise factor of this set. Final Gambit is usually the best option, allowing Staraptor to sacrifice itself to deal heavy damage to would-be counters such as Skarmory and let a teammate clean up afterwards. Close Combat allows Staraptor to handle Tyranitar as well as other Rock- and Steel-types, whereas Quick Attack lets it pick off a weakened enemy. U-turn is used in the final slot to gain momentum and capitalize on the switches that Staraptor forces.

Set Details
========

This set makes the most of Staraptor's offensive capabilities, using maximum investment in Attack and Speed to hit hard and fast. A Choice Band dramatically increases Staraptor's damage output, allowing it to break past some otherwise good checks such as Heatran. Reckless is used to boost the power of Staraptor's STAB moves. An Adamant nature is recommended for the chance to OHKO Rotom-W and the extra power in general, but a Jolly nature can be used to Speed tie with other base 100s such as Mega Gardevoir and Mega Medicham.

Usage Tips
========

Staraptor works best when brought in unscathed, allowing it to deal damage to whatever comes in. Close Combat, if used, should only be used when absolutely necessary, as it allows common sweepers, such as Mega Pinsir and Gyarados, to set up for free. Staraptor should also be used early-game to punch holes in the opponent's team and pave the way for a mid- or late-game sweep by teammates.

Team Options
========

Mega Pinsir and Talonflame form a great offensive "bird spam" core with Staraptor, weakening each other's checks and counters. Any Pokemon that appreciates walls removed works well with Staraptor, as it performs its wallbreaking duties very well. Entry hazard setters, such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn, as well as hazard removers, such as Latios and Starmie, also pair well with Staraptor, allowing it to wallbreak and switch in more easily, respectively. Magnezone also pairs well with Staraptor, trapping Skarmory and offensive checks such as Mega Scizor.


Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Double-Edge
move 3: Close Combat / Final Gambit
move 4: U-turn
ability: Reckless
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

This set uses Staraptor's Reckless-boosted STAB combination to revenge kill a multitude of threats. Close Combat is used to revenge kill Mega Tyranitar and Mega Gyarados, but Final Gambit can be used to quickly dent a wall. U-turn is used to gain momentum on forced switches.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment in Attack and Speed allow Staraptor to revenge kill very effectively. A Jolly nature is recommended to outspeed as many threats as possible, although an Adamant nature can be used for more power; Adamant Staraptor notably has the chance to OHKO Terrakion and 2HKO Choice Scarf Landorus-T. A Choice Scarf is used to boost Staraptor's Speed and allow it to revenge kill faster threats. Reckless is used to boost the power of Staraptor's STAB moves.

Usage Tips
========

U-turn is great to use early-game to get advantageous matchups and chip damage on some foes. Staraptor is a good revenge killer thanks to its high-powered Reckless-boosted moves, which allow it to take out many threats with minimal prior damage. This set is primarily used as a revenge killer, but it can also act as a late-game cleaner or a lead to punch holes early-game, especially against defensive teams.

Team Options
========

Staraptor works well with Talonflame and Mega Pinsir in a "bird spam" offensive core to break down each other's checks. Entry hazard removers, such as Latios and Starmie, are crucial to allow Staraptor to switch in more often to revenge kill opposing Pokemon. Rotom-W, Celebi, and Keldeo are great partners to handle Staraptor's checks, such as Rhyperior, Mega Aerodactyl, and Skarmory.


Other Options
########

A SubRoost + Life Orb set can be used to take advantage of the switches Staraptor forces, mitigating recoil damage and the HP lost from Substitute. Tailwind is also a feasible option to use on this set.


Checks & Counters
########

**Skarmory**: Skarmory avoids the 2HKO from all of Staraptor's moves, although switching Skarmory in with Stealth Rock on the field is somewhat risky. Skarmory must also be wary of Final Gambit.

**Faster Pokemon**: If Staraptor is not running Choice Scarf, anything faster can usually dent or outright KO it due to its general frailty.

**Residual Damage**: Staraptor's heavy use of recoil moves means that it's worn down extremely quickly, and if combined with damage from Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs and Garchomp's Rough Skin, it can cause Staraptor to faint prematurely.

**Physical Walls**: Pokemon such as Doublade, Rhyperior, Jirachi, and Magnezone can wall Staraptor most of the time, although all of them except for Doublade must be wary of Final Gambit. Depending on what move Staraptor is Choice-locked into, certain Pokemon, such as Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Landorus-T, can also switch in relatively easily.
