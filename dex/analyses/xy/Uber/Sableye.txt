Overview
########

Sableye has a great ability before Mega Evolution as well as after it; Magic Bounce is extremely useful and Sableye is the only non-offensive user of it, which sets it apart from other Pokemon with the ability. Furthermore, it has a good typing, which leaves it with only a weakness to Fairy-type attacks. It also has a good supportive movepool that provides reliable recovery among other things. Mega Sableye has great defenses that allow it to completely stop several threatening attackers, such as Mega Kangaskhan. However, Sableye is extremely slow once it has Mega Evolved, and its mediocre HP stat undermines its good defenses. Additionally, Sableye has quite low offensive stats, and despite its good bulk, Sableye is still unable to check several physical attackers, such as offensive Groudon and Mega Salamence.

move 4: Taunt
ability: Prankster
item: Sablenite / Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 124 Def / 136 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Foul Play hits physically offensive attackers such as Deoxys-A and Mega Salamence very hard. Knock Off can be used over Foul Play, as it cripples Pokemon that are item-reliant, as well as doing quite a lot of damage to those weak to it and being a generally safe move to use if you're unsure what the opponent is about do. Will-O-Wisp cripples all physical attackers bar those immune to it, leaving their attacks half as powerful. Recover allows Sableye to recover from damage done by foes. Taunt is a good support move that prevents the target from setting up. Protect is another option that helps Sableye Mega Evolve safely without needing to take a hit, but it does not deal damage, unlike Fake Out. Fake Out is an alternative to Protect and can be used instead, as it helps Sableye Mega Evolve without taking a hit and deals damage too, but it doesn't affect Ghost-types and deals minimal damage.

Set Details
========

The investment in HP gives a boost to Sableye's bulk, and the Special Defense investment ensures that Sableye is only 3HKOed by Fire Blast from Mega Mewtwo-Y, which it can proceed to beat with a STAB attack. The rest of the EVs go into Defense to help Sableye beat physical attackers. Leftovers can be used over Sablenite to give Sableye passive recovery and let it continue to utilize Prankster, unlike its Mega Evolution.

Usage Tips
========

Sableye is a good switch-in to a handful of physical attackers, such as Mega Mewtwo X, anti-lead Deoxys formes, and Arceus, as it can burn them after and eventually Recover if needed. However, be careful with directly switching it in; because of its unreliable bulk when not Mega-Evolved, it is recommended that you switch Sableye in after a teammate has been beaten by a physical attacker. Make sure to use Knock Off whenever you're not sure what the opponent is going to do, as it is a safe move in general. Using Knock Off against Pokemon that rely on their item, such as Latios and Latias, is also good. Once Sableye has Mega Evolved, it's handy to switch it into a predicted status move, as it will bounce it back. Also, don't always Mega Evolve Sableye immediately; if there are several physical attackers on the opposing team that can be crippled with a burn, make sure to keep Sableye from Mega Evolving, as it will be able to pull off a priority Will-O-Wisp against all of them. Use Taunt when a defensive Pokemon is on the field, as it'll prevent it from using any status attack.

Team Options
========

Pokemon such as Mega Gengar, Primal Groudon, and specially defensive Dialga are good teammates, as they can beat Fairy-types. Physical tanks that beat the physical attackers that trouble Sableye, such as Giratina, also make excellent partners. Partners that appreciate Mega Sableye bouncing back hazards, such as Lugia and Ho-Oh, make good teammates too. Also, relatively slow Volt Switch or U-turn users, such as Scizor, make good partners, as they grant Sableye a safe switch into physical attackers. Last but not least, specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey can take on the offensive Pokemon that threaten Sableye.

Other Options
########

Toxic is a good support move that hits walls, wearing them down, as well as hitting Pokemon immune to burns, but Taunt is generally better to assist with wearing these sorts of Pokemon down. Counter is an option to beat physically offensive Pokemon with greater ease, but it has no use against special attackers and doesn't do a lot of damage anyway because of Sableye's low HP stat. Trick along with a Choice item can be used to stop defensive Pokemon, but is only useful against one Pokemon throughout the match and is generally done better by other users of the move, such as Gothitelle.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Xerneas, and Mega Mawile can beat Sableye easily with one of their STAB moves, but Mega Mawile has to be wary of Will-O-Wisp.

**Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Blaziken are immune to Will-O-Wisp and can proceed to beat Sableye with their STAB attacks.
