Overview
########

In Ubers, Blissey is preferred over her younger sister, Chansey, for her ability to hold Shed Shell to prevent herself from being trapped by Shadow Tag users. Her smaller weakness to Knock Off and ability to be slightly less predictable than Chansey are also reasons why she is the premier special wall in Ubers. In addition, she has the single highest HP stat of any Pokemon to date, at a whopping base 255, coupled with a great base 135 Special Defense, giving her the best special bulk in the tier. An example of this is her ability to survive an unresisted 150 Base Power Choice Specs Kyogre Water Spout, a feat that no other viable Pokemon can achieve. Blissey manages to find a niche with this bulk by learning two of the rarest and most useful support moves in the game: Heal Bell and Wish. Natural Cure is also quite a useful ability, allowing her to sponge status without having to waste a turn and PP to heal herself. Blissey’s typing is a double-edged sword, giving her a single weakness and a handy immunity to Ghost at the cost of not having any resistances, something that many other walls in Ubers rely on to mitigate damage. Her physical bulk is also pathetic, making it so that she can't wall powerful physical threats. Her over-reliance on support moves and inability to hit strongly with offensive moves make her even more prone to Taunt than many other walls, while in certain team matchups, she can be useless. However, don’t let these shortcomings discourage you from using Blissey, as she can provide invaluable support for certain team builds and wall many special nukes effectively.

Moves
========

Toxic is mandatory for this set, as it is Blissey’s only way to bring down foes with reliable recovery. In addition, this punishes setup sweepers and foes that switch into Blissey to smack her with a hard physical hit. Blissey has two options when it comes to an offensive move. Seismic Toss deals reliable damage to most threats excluding Ghost-types, while Flamethrower is excellent for a surprise hit on Scizor, Genesect, and Ferrothorn on the switch; Flamethrower also gives Blissey a way to hit Gengar. If Leftovers are run, so must Flamethrower, as Gengar leaves Blissey unable to escape due to Shadow Tag, and with Flamethrower, the standard Mega Gengar is forced to trade one-for-one. Blissey also has two options for recovery in Wish and Soft-Boiled. Wish has the advantage of being able to pass 325 HP to teammates, which, even in Ubers, is basically a full recovery to most Pokemon. The disadvantage of using Wish, however, is that it is not instant recovery, and so Wish Blissey is usually required to run Protect. Soft-Boiled is the more reliable recovery option for Blissey, but offers no support to teammates.

The final moveslot is usually decided by what was run in slot three. Opting for Soft-Boiled leaves Blissey free to run cleric support in the form of Heal Bell rather than Wish support, which is highly coveted as status is very prevalent in the metagame. As previously mentioned, Protect should usually be run with Wish so that Blissey doesn’t have to take two hits before recovering health. In addition, Protect has other utility, mainly stalling for Toxic damage and locking Choice users. It should be noted that Blissey can run both Wish and Soft-Boiled on the same set because it allows Blissey to heal reliably without being Roared out during its Protect turn, while also providing support for teammates. Although it is not slashed, Ice Beam is also an option on the Leftovers set as it gives Blissey a way to damage Mega Gengar while trading coverage to punish Landorus-T and Gliscor.

Set Details
========

With Blissey’s incredible base HP, no investment is needed in that stat, as she rather appreciates max investment in both defenses. The Defense investment allows Blissey to take some physical attacks, and maximum investment in Special Defense is used to abuse Blissey’s excellent special bulk. Shed Shell is the preferred item in most situations as it leaves Blissey free to run Seismic Toss, but this item has no utility beyond escaping Shadow Tag, unfortunately. Leftovers can be run, and the recovery is very handy when walling special nukes; however, this forces Blissey to run Flamethrower. With Leftovers, a spread of 20 HP / 232 Def / 252 SpD should be run as this HP investment increases Leftovers recovery by 1 HP. An alternate spread of 248 HP / 252 SpD / 8 Def can be run on certain teams to maximize her ability to sponge special attacks, though this leaves Blissey completely incapable of taking even weak physical attacks.

Usage Tips
========

Blissey is relatively straightforward to use. She is mainly a punching bag for the special nukes that roam Ubers. However, despite her incredible special bulk, she should not be switched into a healthy Choice Specs Kyogre. Upon switching in, she usually forces the opponent to switch, therefore breaking their momentum. In this time, Blissey is excellent for providing support to allies, allowing her to get off a Heal Bell or Wish before the opponent’s Blissey counter gets to attack. However, this can become disadvantageous, as with team preview, it is very clear when Blissey will be sent in to sponge an attack as she is highly specialized, thus attracting double switches from your opponent. In addition to this, users of Blissey must be wary of mixed attackers such as Close Combat Xerneas that can surprise KO Blissey if they are not scouted first. Blissey should spread Toxic as much as possible and heal whenever allowed.

Team Options
========

Blissey’s best team options are physical walls that can take physical blows for Blissey. In addition, most of these walls have trouble with special attacks and/or status that Blissey can provide support from. Landorus-T and Groudon are especially good teammates, as they both have immense physical bulk, support options, good defensive typing, and threaten premier physical threats such as Ho-Oh. Blissey also greatly appreciates anti-entry hazard support as she takes all forms of hazard damage and thus gets worn down especially by Spikes. Many hazard setters, mainly Spikes users, also have no trouble setting hazards on Blissey, therefore warranting Defog or Rapid Spin support. Support Arceus formes, in general, tend to be excellent partners for Blissey as they not only provide Defog support, but can also neuter physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp and can soft check some of the threats that Blissey has trouble with. Ghost Arceus, in particular, is immune to Fighting-type moves, and thus provides a good defensive core as both Blissey (when running Shed Shell) and Ghost Arceus are immune to Shadow Tag. Water Arceus and Rock Arceus are also notable support Arceus formes, as the first can soft check Kyogre and Ho-Oh while the second can soft check Ho-Oh and Yveltal.

Calm Mind Arceus formes also make good teammates as they can only really be brought down by status, which Blissey can remove with her cleric support. Many of the Calm Mind Arceus formes, in general, can also soft check several threats to Blissey. Most checks to Fighting-types such as Ho-Oh and Giratina are also good choices as partners. A Choice Specs Kyogre check is also of great use when running Blissey, as it is essentially the only special attacker than she cannot stall out, assuming Kyogre is at full health. Tanks such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Klefki not only appreciate Blissey’s Wish support, but in return check Blissey’s weaknesses to threats such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Substitute Geomancy Xerneas. Mewtwo is also a good teammate as it can take down stallbreakers such as Gliscor and Poison Arceus that halt Blissey completely. Lastly, U-turn pivots can be handy when used with Blissey as they give an opportunity to switch into predicted Taunts from foes such as Mewtwo and Darkrai while still being valuable to a defensively oriented team.

Other Options
########

Blissey has several alternate support and offensive moves, but she suffers greatly from four-moveslot syndrome so she cannot typically afford to run any of these options. Blissey can run Thunder Wave over Toxic to cripple setup sweepers and offensive foes that come in to threaten her, though this leaves her unable to take down anything with recovery. Snatch can be handy for countering Calm Mind sets and attempts to eliminate Toxic status. Counter can hit physical attackers that are not powerful enough to OHKO Blissey. She also can run Fire Blast as an offensive move over Flamethrower, however the increased power is usually not worth its unreliability and low PP. Thunder gives Blissey a way to damage Choice Specs Kyogre to the point where she can wall it, while also being able to hit Mega Gengar. Finally, Blissey can function as a Stealth Rock user to potentially save another ally’s set from being ruined or hindered, though this is still a waste of a move on Blissey for most teams.


Checks and Counters
########

**Powerful Physical Threats**: Strong physical attackers have no trouble bypassing Blissey’s pathetic physical bulk and thus are very straightforward threats. These foes are typically very obvious and thus can be capitalized on, however the best Blissey can usually hope to do is to slap them with Toxic when they come in, while some are immune to Toxic. Notable foes under this classification are Mewtwo, Scizor with Superpower, Swords Dance Arceus formes, Zekrom, Ho-Oh, Mega Kangaskhan, and offensive Ground-types.

**Toxic Immunity + Recovery**: These threats cannot be stalled out by Blissey and some also have access to Taunt, which can prevent Blissey from fulfilling its support role. Even those without Taunt can lock Blissey into a stalemate, as without Toxic damage, these threats can continue to recover off Seismic Toss damage, while, in return, these threats can set up or smack Blissey hard. Such common threats in this category are Gliscor, Calm Mind Refresh Arceus, Poison and Steel Arceus, Substitute sweepers, and Gothitelle.

**Taunt Users**: As Blissey is especially weak to Taunt even for a wall, Taunt users can proceed to force Blissey to use Seismic Toss or Flamethrower while they can set up, drop entry hazards, or inflict status. Some users are defensive Yveltal, Skarmory, Sableye, and Darkrai.

**Spikers**: While Spike users can’t do much to Blissey, they can punish her by setting layers of Spikes that most Pokemon despise, including Blissey. The most common users of this move are Klefki, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Scolipede.

**Rest Users**: Pokemon with Rest can recover off any Seismic Toss damage while getting rid of Toxic. The cost is that they will be asleep and most of them cannot beat Blissey, thus creating a stalemate. Common users of Rest include Kyogre, Xerneas, and Giratina.

**Mega Gengar**: The support set is partially built around not being threatened by Mega Gengar, but it is mentioned simply because without Shed Shell or Leftovers with Flamethrower, Blissey is trapped and brought down. In addition, it is important to note that the rare Perish Trapper Gengar beats even the Leftovers with Flamethrower set.
