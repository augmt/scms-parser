Overview
########

While many changes have occured with the new generation, Giratina can still prove why its title of "The Great Wall" remains intact. Having impressive 150 / 120 / 120 defensive stats, Giratina can deal with some of the hardest Pokemon to check in the game, such as Swords Dance Arceus, Kangaskhan, Blaziken, and Calm Mind Electric Arceus. On the other hand, the buff to Defog caused Giratina to lose its important niche in spinblocking, and the new Fairy-types just add another weakness on top of its Dragon-, Ice-, Ghost-, and Dark-type ones. However, Giratina's Will-O-Wisp has gained an important accuracy boost, its Rest no longer resets upon switching out, and its Ghost typing means that it cannot be trapped by the omnipresent Gengar, unlike many other walls. Ultimately, use Giratina for what it's good at, which is checking threats, and it will pay back handsomely.

The Great Wall
########
name: The Great Wall
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Dragon Tail / Roar
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

The moves listed here are Giratina's only options for its role of walling things. Rest and Sleep Talk provide reliable recovery and allow Giratina to shake off status. Giratina's ability to absorb status like it's nothing is important in a status-heavy metagame. Will-O-Wisp is an important source of damage for Giratina and allows it to reliably check physical attackers. Dragon Tail and Roar are the phazing options Giratina can use to check certain setup sweepers; Dragon Tail is preferred as its damage output is important and it bypasses Taunt, but Roar is a viable option if you don't like Dragon Tail's accuracy or are worried about Substitute users. Running both Dragon Tail and Roar is an option, however, entry hazards are around much less to take advantage of this, and Will-O-Wisp's accuracy isn't as much of a problem now.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs are used to minimize damage from Stealth Rock. Pressure is a great ability on a Pokemon like Giratina, as it is useful for stalling low PP moves such as Sacred Fire. Run a Bold nature if you prefer Roar over Dragon Tail, as Giratina will take less damage from Foul Play.

Usage Tips
========

Giratina has one goal: wall things and then get the hell out. It can easily be taken advantage of by many Pokemon, especially ones with Taunt or Substitute, so it's best to use Giratina when you need him to check something and then switch out.

There are certain times when it is better to phaze out an opponent rather than burn it. An especially notable example is when against Lum Berry Swords Dance Arceus, as Arceus will occasionally be able to kill a weakened Giratina before getting burned. Giratina is also bulky enough to be able to take many special attacks, even without investment. However, you should use another set if you want Giratina to be able to take on things such as Choice Specs Kyogre.

Team Options
========

Giratina is the one supporting its teammates here, so its team options are quite many. In general, you should be using this on teams that need a physical wall and status absorber. Pokemon that can switch into many of Giratina's weaknesses are appreciated. Scizor is a notable option that can deal with Gengar and the Fairy-types that trouble Giratina; especially notable is it's ability to deal with Xerneas, which can easily set up on Giratina. Fairy-types are also solid teammates, as they are able to switch in on Dragon- and Dark-type attacks and can often heal Giratina with cleric support. In turn, Giratina can switch into many Pokemon that Fairy-types despise, such as Scizor and Poison Arceus. Shed Shell Blissey can be run with Giratina, for a defensive core that doesn't fear Mega Gengar.

Entry hazards are a big plus for Giratina as it can take advantage of them with its phazing move, and it doesn't particularly need Defog support. Stealth Rock in particular is easy to set up and lets Giratina deal with Ho-Oh much more easily. Spikes is also appreciated as it allows Giratina to pressurize checks more easily. Pokemon such as Dialga, Ferrrothorn, and Landrous-T are viable teammates that can set up entry hazards.

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Dragon Tail / Roar
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

There is very little need to change from what standard Giratina runs. While Will-O-Wisp may seem odd on a specially defensive set, it's still an important source of damage, and being able to halve damage from physical attacks makes this Giratina set frighteningly bulky overall.

Set Details
========
Run a Calm Nature if you choose Roar, as Giratina will take less damage from Foul Play.

Usage Tips
========

This Giratina is intended to wall special threats instead of physical ones. With important resistances to Water-, Electric-, and Fire-type attacks, this set can deal with many of the top special attacking threats. Especially notable is Kyogre, which can only threaten Giratina with a Choice Specs Ice Beam. While Giratina can't do much back apart from burning it and using Dragon Tail, it's still notable that it doesn't fall down to two Choice Specs Water Spouts. Other special threats such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Calm Mind Arceus detest this Giratina. Not even Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor coming from Dialga can OHKO this beast.

Team Options
========

Giratina is going to be supporting different Pokemon here since it walls different things. This set fits well on teams that can't afford or don't want to use Palkia or an Arceus forme to check Kyogre. Steel- and Fairy-types such as Xerneas, Scizor, and Sylveon are notable teammates, as they can switch into Giratina's weaknesses.

Other Options
########

A set consisting of Chesto Berry and Defog can be run if you need Defog support, but in general, you'll miss having reliable recovery with Leftovers and Sleep Talk. Rocky Helmet is also an option that be used over Leftovers to damage physical attackers such as Ho-Oh, which will take massive recoil damage with Brave Bird. But again, Leftovers recovery is generally preferred. Toxic is an option, as it does more damage than Will-O-Wisp over time, but it misses out on Steel-types, and the Attack drop from Will-O-Wisp is hard to pass up. Spite is an option that allows you to drain PP much more quickly, especially in tandem with Pressure, but Giratina generally needs the moveslot for more important moves. Any attacking options such as Calm Mind are better done by Giratina-O, which has better attacking stats.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Fairies such as Xerneas, Sylveon, and Fairy Arceus can come in easily on Dragon Tail and hit Giratina hard with a super effective STAB move, and they will often have cleric moves to ignore Will-O-Wisp.

**Dark-types**: Darkrai, Yveltal, and Dark Arceus can hit Giratina hard with Dark-type attacks, and many run Taunt, which will make its life miserable.

**Dragon-types**: Palkia, Giratina-O, Zekrom, Kyurem-W, Rayquaza, etc. can hit Giratina with their high attacking stats and super effective STAB attacks. However, they must watch out for Dragon Tail. Dialga is especially notable for often being able to ignore Will-O-Wisp with a Lum Berry, being neutral to Dragon Tail, and hitting hard with Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse.

**Taunt**: Taunt leaves Giratina extremely vulnerable to any Pokemon, as its only usable move will be Dragon Tail, or Struggle if it runs Roar.

**Substitute**: While Substitute can be countered by Roar, it can easily take advantage of weak Dragon Tails and allow free setup.

**Ghost Arceus**: Ghost Arceus hits Giratina hard with a super effective Judgement, and it doesn't mind Dragon Tail or Will-O-Wisp that much.

**Ho-Oh**: Some of the stronger sets such as Life Orb or Choice Band may be able to break Giratina's defenses with Brave Bird. Giratina struggles to do anything to Ho-Oh without Stealth Rock up, but Ho-Oh often can't do much back either.
