Overview
########

Wielding a Spooky Plate, Arceus's spectral incarnation remains a stellar Arceus forme and a top-tier threat in Ubers. Steel-type Pokemon now no longer resist Ghost-type moves, increasing the potency of Ghost as an offensive typing and augmenting Ghost Arceus's prowess as both a physically and a specially based setup sweeper. Defensively, Ghost Arceus can take advantage of its neutrality to most types and excellent base 120 / 120 / 120 defenses to run a viable support set that still retains significant offensive presence, handling Pokemon like Mewtwo with relative ease. With its typing giving it immunities to Normal- and Fighting-type moves, in conjunction with the move Will-O-Wisp getting an accuracy raise from 75% to 85%, Ghost Arceus also checks some of the best physical attackers in Ubers, including Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Kangaskhan, and Extreme Killer Arceus. In addition, Ghost Arceus can prevent entry hazard removal by blocking Rapid Spin, a move that has decreased in usage with the Defog buff but is nonetheless still viable in Ubers. Lastly, Ghost Arceus can use its typing to switch out of Shadow Tag unhindered, rendering it incapable of being trapped by another top-tier threat, Mega Gengar. However, Dark-types such as Darkrai and the newly introduced Yveltal significantly inhibit Ghost Arceus's potential and can easily exploit it to gain momentum. Still, all things considered, it must be reinforced that Ghost Arceus remains a versatile and very threatening Pokemon.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Judgment
move 3: Recover
move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Focus Blast
item: Spooky Plate
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Calm Mind boosts Ghost Arceus's Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage each; at +1 Special Attack, Judgment hits most neutral targets very hard, making this set a formidable mid- to late-game cleaner. Judgment is Ghost Arceus's reliable, powerful STAB move. Recover aids Ghost Arceus in setting up multiple Calm Mind boosts. Will-O-Wisp allows Ghost Arceus to check physical threats like Groudon and Mega Kangaskhan, even as it sets up. In conjunction with its max HP EVs, Ghost Arceus can also burn Extreme Killer Arceus and switch out to a relevant teammate relatively unscathed. Note that with its respectable natural bulk, possible Calm Mind boosts, and lack of weaknesses to most common offensive types, running Will-O-Wisp can make Ghost Arceus very difficult to break with both physical and special attacks, enhancing its ability to accrue multiple boosts (watch out for opposing status-inducing moves though). Also, with the buff to the Ghost typing, forgoing a coverage move becomes much less of an issue. Focus Blast can be run for hitting Arceus-Normal super effectively (also allowing Ghost Arceus to check Refresh variants more effectively), and landing a stronger hit on Ferrothorn and Heatran, possibly preventing them from using a status move or, in Heatran's case, Roar. However, its rather high 30% miss chance, along with the fact that Steel-type Pokemon now take neutral damage from Ghost-type moves, make it a less desirable option.

Thunder can be run over Focus Blast as it hits important targets in Kyogre, Yveltal, and Ho-Oh significantly harder, potentially killing them before they can damage Ghost Arceus. Keep in mind though that Thunder has similar accuracy to Focus Blast, and that running it means you miss out on running Will-O-Wisp/Focus Blast, which might be more useful for your team. Rain support from Kyogre is recommended if Thunder is used. Substitute can be used over Recover to foil enemy attempts to cripple Ghost Arceus with status or Leech Seed

Set Details
========

Maximum HP investment preserves Ghost Arceus's natural bulk, allowing it to comfortably take moderately powerful hits as it sets up, such as Hydro Pump from Palkia in neutral weather. Maximum Speed with a Timid nature allows Ghost Arceus to outspeed everything below its Speed tier and Speed tie with other Arceus formes. An alternative spread of 144 HP / 252 SpA / 112 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to let Arceus outspeed everything up to Jolly Garchomp; maximum Special Attack EVs allow Judgment to hit as hard as possible from the get-go. The remaining 144 EVs are invested in HP in order to let Ghost Arceus take hits a little better as it sets up. A third possible set would be 252 SpA / 252 Spe for maximum Speed and initial power. It is advised to use it along with Substitute and Focus Blast, which capitalizes on predicted uses of status inducing moves to set up a Substitute and in turn, rapidly pick up a Calm Mind boost or two. This set is more oriented toward posing an immediate offensive threat, while 252 HP / 252 Spe increases Ghost Arceus's ability to take hits while accruing multiple boosts.

Usage Tips
========

If you see weakened threats, pick them off with Judgment. Also, use Judgment to ensure opposing sweepers vulnerable to it, such as Mewtwo, don't set up on Arceus. Basically, don't be hesitant to spam Judgment. Secondly, it is effective to actively make aggressive double switches. If the opponent is likely to switch to their Mewtwo, don't be afraid to double switch into Ghost Arceus. Ghost Arceus can take most unboosted hits comfortably, so one should not be too worried about the occasional mispredict (again, watch out for status, though). On the other hand, don't be too eager to set up Calm Mind rashly early-to-mid-game. While being gifted with natural bulk, Ghost Arceus is no damage sponge. For example, an unboosted Ghost Arceus might be able to set up a Calm Mind and come out on top of a skirmish with an Adamant-natured Groudon, but it will accomplish this with at most 24% of its HP to spare, leaving it prone to being revenge killed by threats it could otherwise beat, such as Mewtwo or Aegislash running Shadow Sneak. That aside, this set also loathes status, as mentioned above. Burn and poison limit its longevity greatly, and paralysis gimps its great Speed. This makes it unwise to set up on threats you can ultimately kill but which will cripple you with status in the process, limiting your staying power and sweeping potential. Examples include Ferrothorn and Heatran. Also, be very wary of Yveltal and Darkrai; both are Pokemon that can rapidly snatch momentum away. Yveltal can switch into a Judgment and proceed to threaten your team massively with its possible Life Orb-boosted dual STAB moves. While Darkrai is too frail to be switching into Judgment repeatedly, it can take one and threaten to put something to sleep or set up.

Team Options
========

Make sure Dark-types like Yveltal and Darkrai are adequately dealt with. Fairy-types pair well with Ghost Arceus. Xerneas can take hits directed at it, as well as rid it of status with a bulky cleric set. Other Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Clefable are also viable teammates as they, too, provide type synergy and cleric support. However, do note that Fairy-types are both friend and foe to Ghost Arceus; it is crucial to have a reliable answer to a boosted Geomancy Xerneas as it can set up alongside with and overpower this set. Scizor can use Bullet Punch to pick off Xerneas that have taken prior damage from Judgment. Pokemon such as Bronzong and Jirachi can also reliably handle Geomancy Xerneas, but note that these compound the team's Ghost-type weakness. Ho-Oh is problematic for this set as its powerful dual STAB moves outdamage Ghost Arceus and prevent it from setting up; have teammates that can set up Stealth Rock reliably such that Ho-Oh loses 50% of its total HP upon each switch-in. Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Gliscor are good Stealth Rock setters that can also check Ho-Oh with their physical bulk when the need arises. However, note that neither can switch into Brave Bird/Sacred Fire repeatedly and the best way to keep Ho-Oh in check is really to make sure Stealth Rock stays up; a Judgment at +1 Special Attack from 0 SpA Ghost Arceus will always kill 248 HP Ho-Oh after it takes Stealth Rock damage and a round of Life Orb recoil. Thirdly, Ghost Arceus is vulnerable to powerful Choice Scarf users after it has gotten a kill. Choice Scarf Zekrom is a threat that can be dealt with by the aforementioned Landorus-T and Gliscor. Groudon can also be used if its lack of a Ground immunity is not an issue, and if teammates can take advantage of the sun it provides. Choice Scarf Kyogre is less of a threat if Ghost Arceus has gotten at least one Calm Mind boost, but a Water Spout at full or near-full HP is nonetheless incredibly threatening; Palkia is a good teammate to handle Kyogre. Finally, it would be pertinent to mention that this set's usage over another Arceus forme should be well-justified. For example, this set checks Mewtwo, so it would be a good addition to teams that are weak to Mewtwo. On the other hand, this set might not be the best addition to teams already vulnerable to opportunistic Dark-types like Darkrai. Notably, this set's draws over another Calm Mind Arceus forme should be evaluated. For example, if a team were weak to Mega Kangaskhan, running this set over a Calm Mind Arceus-Electric would be a good decision.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Shadow Force
move 3: Shadow Claw
move 4: Brick Break
item: Spooky Plate
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance instantly doubles Ghost Arceus's attack, skyrocketing its sweeping potential. Augmented by the Ghost buff, Shadow Force hits like a nuke, and at +2 Attack will KO virtually all Pokemon that do not resist or are immune to it, especially after Stealth Rock. Shadow Claw prevents Substitute/Protect users, such as Substitute Ho-Oh, from taking advantage of Shadow Force. With the buff to Ghost typing, running two Ghost-type moves is very viable, akin to not running a coverage move on the Calm Mind set. Brick Break in the last slot allows Ghost Arceus to hit Normal-types like Blissey and Kangaskhan that are immune to Ghost Arceus's STAB moves. It also hits Ferrothorn super effectively, and allows Ghost Arceus to come out on top against Extreme Killer Arceus. Recover can be used in the third or fourth moveslot, but it is not recommended, as running it in either slot will give you Arceus sub-optimal coverage. This set aims to pull off a quick, brutal sweep late-game, making Recover an inferior option, as opposed to on Calm Mind Ghost Arceus, which aims to stay healthy while possibly accruing multiple boosts. Extreme Speed can be run over Shadow Claw, as it hits pretty hard at +2 and can pick off annoying, fast but frail threats like Deoxys-A, Darkrai, and Blaziken, as well as weaknened Choice Scarf users. However, note that even after a Swords Dance, Extreme Speed is still a relatively weak move that does not hit anything super effectively, and is generally outclassed in usefulness by the listed moves. Stone Edge can be used in the third moveslot to nail Yveltal and Ho-Oh, notably the physically defensive variant; this is situationally useful and should only be run if one's team dearly needs these Pokemon out of the way.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment optimizes damage output. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Ghost Arceus to at least Speed tie other Arceus formes; this is very important as they can threaten a burn with Will-O-Wisp. An Adamant nature can be used as it achieves certain notable KOs, such as a guaranteed KO after Stealth Rock damage with a boosted Shadow Force against 252 HP / 0 Def Arceus formes. Note that on teams with Sticky Web support, it is highly advised to use an Adamant nature as it allows Ghost Arceus to become a phenomenal wallbreaker.

Usage Tips
========

Try only to reveal and use this set late-game after the opponent's Arceus forme has been revealed, any Choice Scarf users have been taken down, and the opposing team has been generally weakened to a level where this set can clean up. One of the main contributing factors to this set's effectiveness is the element of surprise, so try not to foil your opportunity. However, if the opponent's Choice Scarf Pokemon is likely to stick around (for example, if they are saving their Kyogre for a late-game sweep),  the best course of action would be to sneak Ghost Arceus in whenever opportunities present themselves, either by double switching or on weaker hits, and spam Shadow Force, or otherwise attempt to do as much damage as possible. Again, be very wary of Dark-types like Yveltal and Darkrai. Don't spam Shadow Force if they are healthy, as they can take a hit and force you to relinquish momentum.

Team Options
========

Make sure Dark-types can be reliably handled. Again, Fairy-types make good partners. Secondly, have a plan for Geomancy Xerneas, as with the Calm Mind set. Thirdly, make sure Stealth Rock can be set up, reliably and repeatedly. This is instrumental as Ghost Arceus can achieve many notable KOs at +2 Attack with Stealth Rock up. Sticky Web support is huge for this set, as it ensures that Choice Scarf users cannot revenge kill it, and provides it a lot more room to maneuver around the opponent. There is a chance that this set will lose to Extreme Killer Arceus one-on-one, and if so, there needs to be a reliable contingency plan. Support Groudon with Roar can phaze Extreme Killer in a pinch, and can also set up Stealth Rock for the team. On more offensive teams, Ditto is a good option to revenge kill a boosted Extreme Killer. Also, evaluate the effectiveness of using this over another Arceus set. This set is especially good at heaping immediate offensive pressure on the opponent, and is a good fit on teams that need an opportunistic wallbreaker/sweeper, but the opportunity cost of using it is that you forgo the advantages another Arceus set might provide.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Judgment
move 2: Recover
move 3: Defog
move 4: Will-O-Wisp
item: Spooky Plate
evs: 252 HP / 144 Def / 112 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Judgment is the obligatory STAB move. Recover ensures that Ghost Arceus has staying power and does not get whittled down by attacks. Defog provides team support by wiping entry hazards from the field, and Will-O-Wisp neuters physical attackers and checks physically based setup sweepers. Notably, Will-O-Wisp, in conjunction with the Defense investment, allow this set to check Extreme Killer Arceus.

Set Details
========

Max HP EVs and 144 Defense EVs allow Ghost Arceus to better stomach Mewtwo's Psystrike, as well as buffer against physical attacks that it might have to switch in on, or take in the event of Will-O-Wisp missing. 112 Speed EVs with a Timid nature outspeeds everything up to Jolly Garchomp.

Usage Tips
========

As with the other sets, try not to let Dark-types like Yveltal and Darkrai switch in on Arceus. Also, avoid switching in on strong special attacks, such as from a Palkia that you know has Choice Specs equipped. However, if users of such attacks have been weakened and are slower than Ghost Arceus, it can switch in, take a hit, and pick off the threat. Thirdly, a Ghost typing is much more offensively potent than most other support Arceus types, so it would be wise to take advantage of this by spamming Judgment. If the opponent is switching out their Pokemon, using Judgment twice is in many cases better than using Defog + Judgment, especially when the opponent's entry hazard setter can set up hazards again with relative ease.

Team Options
========

This section mirrors that of Calm Mind Ghost Arceus, really. One thing to add would be that support Ghost Arceus is a very reliable Defogger. Notably, it cannot be trapped by Mega Gengar, so teammates such as Ho-Oh that benefit greatly from the absence of entry hazards are much-appreciated.

Other Options
########

An anti-lead set with Magic Coat, Judgment, and Extreme Speed can be used to combat common leads like Deoxys-A/Deoxys-S. Flamethrower or Fire Blast can be used on the Calm Mind, support, and anti-lead sets to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Scizor. Note though, that with Ghost-type attacks hitting Steel-type Pokemon neutrally this generation, Fire-type coverage has decreased significantly in importance. Stone Edge can be run on the support set to nail Ho-Oh and hit Yveltal harder, as can Toxic to cripple walls or Thunder Wave to cripple setup sweepers. Ghost Arceus can take most +1 hits and retaliate by crippling its foe with status.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dark-types**: Most notably, Yveltal and Darkrai can switch in on Ghost Arceus's STAB Judgment and threaten it hugely with STAB Dark Pulse, or in Darkrai's case, put it to sleep with Dark Void and possibly proceed to set up. Other Dark-type Pokemon like Dark Arceus and Mandibuzz with Toxic also prevent Ghost Arceus from sweeping, or at least limit its longevity with status, as their STAB moves are super effective on Ghost Arceus. Tyranitar is less of a threat as Ghost Arceus commonly carries Will-O-Wisp, but it should not be ignored. Mega Gyarados also deserves a mention as it can harass Swords Dance Ghost Arceus in the interim; regular Gyarados can lower Ghost Arceus's Attack with Intimidate, following which it Mega Evolves to gain a resistance to Ghost-type moves and possibly proceed to set up with Dragon Dance and inflict significant damage before going down.

**Kyogre**: Specially defensive Kyogre can phaze the Calm Mind set; Kyogre in general can deal heavy damage to all sets with its rain-boosted STAB moves.

**Xerneas**: As with Kyogre, specially defensive Xerneas can phaze the Calm Mind set or cripple it with moves like Thunder Wave if it chooses to run that. In a one-on-one situation, Geomancy Xerneas can boost and come out on top against all sets.

**Unaware**: The two main users of this ability in Ubers, Clefable and Quagsire, are big thorns in Ghost Arceus's side, as they check the Calm Mind and Swords Dance sets respectively by ignoring any boosts Ghost Arceus might have gained and wearing it down with Toxic damage coupled with self-recovery.

**Ho-Oh**: Ho-Oh can cripple most sets with its STAB moves, especially under sun. Sacred Fire's 50% burn rate is also really nasty. If running Substitute, it can really mess around with the Swords Dance set if it does not run both Shadow Force and Shadow Claw.

**Blissey**: The pink blob counters the Calm Mind and support sets by virtue of its enormous Special Defense and access to Toxic.

**Status**: Ghost Arceus loathes status of any sort; paralysis gimps all its sets and burn/poison limit its longevity greatly, deterring it from spamming Judgment or setting up.

**Choice Scarf Users**: The commonly seen threatening ones are Zekrom and Kyogre, the latter especially if it is at high health. Choice Scarf Genesect with an Attack boost from Download can pose a threat with Iron Head and its 30% flinch rate.

**Kyurem-W**: Choice Specs Kyurem-W is very dangerous to support Ghost Arceus, threatening to OHKO with Draco Meteor (62.5% chance) after Stealth Rock damage. This is compounded by the fact that it can switch in after Ghost Arceus has used Defog, and has respectable 125 base HP and 100 base Special Defense with which it can stomach an uninvested Judgment rather comfortably.

**Groudon**: Physically defensive Groudon checks the Swords Dance set to an extent; it can stomach even a +2 Shadow Force and proceed to phaze Ghost Arceus with Roar, undoing its efforts in setting up. However, note that, especially against sets with Will-O-Wisp, it is fighting a losing battle.

**Mega Gengar**: Mega Gengar can revenge kill most sets with Shadow Ball. No matter how many boosts they might have attained, Calm Mind/Swords Dance Ghost Arceus is still threatened by Destiny Bond. Note that it can switch out of Shadow Tag though, so the only disadvantage will be that Arceus's sweep will be interrupted.

**Priority**: Although Ghost Arceus is immune to priority in Extreme Speed, Shadow Sneak from the likes of Giratina and Aegislash can pick it off if it has been significantly weakened. Sucker Punch from the aforementioned Yveltal, Mega Kangaskhan, and even lesser-seen Pokemon like Bisharp can do the same. This, however, is mitigated if Ghost Arceus has Will-O-Wisp.
