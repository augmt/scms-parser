Overview
########

Returning to Ubers for the new generation, Lugia must once again prove itself as deserving of the title "Great Wall." Lugia possesses excellent 106 / 130 / 154 base defensive stats, and its rare base 110 Speed allows it to outspeed practically every relevant wall other than Arceus, something not many defensive Pokemon can boast. Reliable recovery in Roost and two amazing abilities in Multiscale and Pressure make Lugia an appealing package. However, Lugia has flaws that hold it back from doing its job perfectly. Its typing offers few useful resistances and multiple weaknesses, such as to Electric- and Ice-type moves, and renders it vulnerable to Dark- and Ghost-type offensive powerhouses. Also, Stealth Rock strips away a quarter of Lugia's HP and deactivates Multiscale when it switches in, making a good amount of team support required for it to function properly. Despite these drawbacks, Lugia still stands firm as one of the best walls in Ubers, and shouldn't be taken lightly if you do not carry a solid answer to it.

Moves
========

As one of the two Great Walls in Ubers, Lugia has the arsenal of moves it needs to do its job well. Roost can reactivate Multiscale if Lugia is above 50% health, allowing it to take a number of hits that many other defensive Pokemon would gawk at. Combined with the ability to cripple opposing walls with Toxic, Lugia can stall out a good number of attackers or render most walls dead weight. However, Thunder Wave can be used as an alternative to Toxic if stopping opposing offensive Pokemon or Lugia's own checks and counters, such as Mega Gengar and Yveltal, is a top priority. If your team has enough Toxic users already, Thunder Wave can turn Lugia into an effective parashuffler. Whirlwind lets Lugia phaze out most sweepers foolish enough to set up in front of it, including those hiding behind a Substitute. However, Dragon Tail can be very annoying to the opposing team when combined with entry hazards and Toxic, as it adds to the residual damage, but keep in mind that Lugia cannot phaze Substitute users or Fairy-types with it. Aeroblast is Lugia's STAB move of choice, letting it defeat threats such as Mega Blaziken (2HKO), Mega Mewtwo X (2HKO), and even Mega Gengar (31.6% chance to 2HKO after Stealth Rock). On the other hand, Substitute can shield Lugia from stray Toxics and can allow it to outright wall anything that can't break it, but this comes at the cost of being complete and utter Taunt bait to faster threats such as Mega Gengar or Thundurus.

Set Details
========

With the above EV spread, Lugia can take on a great number of physical attackers, such as Groudon, Extreme Killer Arceus, Mega Mewtwo X, and Mega Blaziken with help of the defensive buff from Multiscale. Coupled with a Bold nature, Lugia can do decent damage with Aeroblast while taking less damage from Yveltal's Foul Play. However, an Impish nature can be used if Dragon Tail is Lugia's only attacking move in order to avoid decreasing its damage output. Lugia's two abilities, Multiscale and Pressure, let it do two different things when it comes to walling: Multiscale lets it hard check or counter most sweepers by preventing them from doing considerable damage to it, while Pressure allows Lugia to outstall most walls in conjunction with Substitute, Toxic, and Roost. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 176 Def / 80 SpD makes Lugia an effective mixed wall. Despite the specific EV spreads, Lugia's defenses are really flexible when it comes to investment, so you can invest in different stats depending on your team's needs without compromising too much of its overall bulk.

Usage Tips
========

First and foremost, if Multiscale is the chosen ability, be very careful when switching into Stealth Rock. Try to keep Stealth Rock off of your side of the field so that Multiscale and by extension, Lugia's walling capabilities, remain intact. Also, be extremely careful of possible Toxic users such as Landorus-T, Groudon, and Yveltal, as Lugia absolutely hates status ailments of any kind, so switch into these threats at your own peril. However, when on the field, be very generous when using Toxic or Substitute, as crippling switch-ins or warding against status conditions can be very beneficial to Lugia's overall effectiveness and longevity. Take advantage of predicted switches to come in on possible setup sweepers such as boosting variants of Xerneas or Extreme Killer, as forcing them into a corner with Whirlwind can keep your team safe and maintain your offensive or defensive momentum.

Team Options
========

Clerics are beneficial teammates as they can alleviate the status conditions that Lugia despises. The primary examples are Aromatherapy Xerneas and Sylveon, as they can remove Lugia's status conditions and deter Dark-types from switching in with a Fairy Aura-boosted Moonblast and Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice, respectively. Stealth Rock presents a large problem to Lugia, so it appreciates teammates such as Giratina and Arceus formes that can provide Defog support, burn opposing Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp, and utilize other support moves. Hazards are integral to Lugia's ability to pressure the opponent with phazing moves, so hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Klefki, Forretress, Landorus-T, and Dialga pair nicely with it. Natural teammates for Lugia are Pokemon that benefit from it crippling opposing walls with Toxic. Swords Dance Rayquaza and Kyurem-W are great offensive partners to Lugia as they appreciate having opposing walls weakened and offensive threats deterred. Furthermore, they can defeat the Steel-types that trouble Lugia with relative ease. Groudon can assist Lugia by fending off Zekrom and Tyranitar while setting up Stealth Rock. Fighting Arceus can take on a good deal of Dark-types by itself, including Darkrai, Tyranitar, and Dark Arceus, while also checking Kyurem-W. Yveltal can deal with Mega Gengar, defeat opposing walls with Taunt, and break past most Steel-types with a Dark Aura-boosted Dark Pulse. Finally, Palkia can reliably defeat Kyogre, fell most Steel-types with Fire Blast, and take down or cripple Yveltal with Thunder.

Other Options
########

Safeguard is a move Lugia can run to shield itself and its teammates from status for a short time. However, it takes up a moveslot that Lugia could otherwise reserve for another utility move, and a cleric can heal the entire team's status conditions. Earthquake allows Lugia to damage Steel-types immune to Toxic such as Dialga, and hurt Blaziken and Mega Gengar. However, Lugia's base 90 Attack and Attack-decreasing nature (used with Aeroblast) prevents the move from being used effectively. In the same vein, Stone Edge can be used to deal with Ho-Oh and Yveltal, but it has poor accuracy and suffers from the same problem that Earthquake does. Recover can be used over Roost to keep Lugia's Ground immunity, but Roost mitigates its weaknesses to Ice-, Electric-, and Rock-type moves, giving it more utility. Defog can let Lugia support its team by removing all the entry hazards in play, and Psycho Boost can OHKO Mega Blaziken and Mega Gengar. Unfortunately, Lugia's Stealth Rock weakness prevents it from utilizing Defog well, Psycho Boost does less damage when used in succession, and both moves are only legal with the ability Pressure.

Lugia is an effective user of Calm Mind, as its bulk and Multiscale allow it to accrue at least one boost without trouble. However, Lugia's base 90 Special Attack is pitiful, and it faces extreme competition from Arceus formes as a Calm Mind user. Lugia can set up dual screens at nearly any point in the match, and the screens combined with Multiscale make it ridiculously hard to defeat. Lastly, Lugia can utilize a RestTalk set to replenish HP and remove status conditions. Furthermore, as phazing moves lose their negative priority when chosen by Sleep Talk, Lugia can utilize its naturally high Speed stat to quickly phaze out most walls. However, Lugia loses the ability to reliably reactive Multiscale with Roost, and the luck factor that Sleep Talk introduces can prove troublesome at times.

Checks and Counters
########

**Stealth Rock**: Stealth Rock hinders Lugia's ability to check sweepers by removing a chunk of its health and deactivating Multiscale.

**Status Conditions**: Toxic completely ruins Lugia's ability to wall threats by breaking Multiscale every turn, and can KO Lugia if it stays in for too long. Paralysis makes Lugia slower than practically every other wall, causing it to lose an effective niche. Burns break Multiscale as well, though Toxic is more detrimental to Lugia.

**Ghost- and Dark-types**: The ever-rising popularity of Ghost- and Dark-type threats gives Lugia a run for its money. Tyranitar, Ghost Arceus, Darkrai, and Yveltal can all either damage Lugia with their STAB moves or cripple it with their utility options (such as Pursuit, Toxic, Dark Void and Taunt), forcing it out or using it as setup fodder.

**Bulky Steel-types**: Steel-types are immune to Toxic and resist all of Lugia's attacking options bar Earthquake. Defensive Steel-types such as Dialga, Ferrothorn, Bronzong, Jirachi, Aegislash, and Heatran can hard wall Lugia, cripple it with Toxic, and support their team with moves such as Wish or Stealth Rock.

**Mega Gengar**: Mega Gengar can easily deal with Lugia, as Shadow Ball, Taunt, Destiny Bond, and Shadow Tag can deter Lugia from even showing up on the battlefield. However, Lugia can phaze Gengar out with Whirlwind or Dragon Tail, cripple it with Thunder Wave, and/or potentially KO it with Earthquake or Psycho Boost.

**Kyurem-W**: With Turboblaze and its obscenely high Special Attack, Kyurem-W can KO Lugia in one fell swoop with a Choice Specs-boosted Ice Beam.

**Zekrom**: Zekrom ignores Multiscale with Teravolt, can smash Lugia with Bolt Strike, and packs an immunity to Thunder Wave. In addition, it can pivot out with Volt Switch when Lugia flees, gaining momentum for its team.

**Xerneas**: Defensive variants of Xerneas can outstall Lugia with Aromatherapy or RestTalk, but they can only hit back with Moonblast.

**Kyogre**: If Stealth Rock is up, Kyogre can defeat Lugia by hitting it with a rain- and Choice Specs-boosted Water Spout as it switches in. However, Kyogre dislikes Toxic, as the residual damage weakens the power of Water Spout.

**Mega Mewtwo Y**: Mega Mewtwo Y can Taunt Lugia and can survive three Aeroblasts afterwards, but cannot touch it unless Multiscale is broken.

**Blissey**: Blissey can Toxic Lugia and heal off status conditions with Natural Cure. However, Blissey loses one-on-one to Substitute Lugia, as it takes two Seismic Tosses to break Lugia's Substitute.

**Prankster users**: Thundurus-I, Sableye, and Klefki can all cripple Lugia with status moves, and the former two can utilize Taunt to defeat Lugia one-on-one. However, only Sableye can outstall Lugia as it is the only one out of the three with reliable recovery.
