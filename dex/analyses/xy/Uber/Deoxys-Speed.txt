Overview
########

Sporting the highest base Speed in the game, Deoxys-S excels in one particular role within the Ubers environment: setting up entry hazards. Stealth Rock, Spikes, Taunt, and Magic Coat give Deoxys-S all the tools it needs to get up multiple layers of entry hazards as well as deter opposing entry hazards, Taunt, and Defog. Deoxys-S's largest advantage over Deoxys-A as a dedicated lead on offensive teams is its significantly greater bulk, which allows it to set up Stealth Rock in many scenarios where Deoxys-A could not. For example, Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out easily OHKOes Deoxys-A, but it does not even come close to OHKOing Deoxys-S. Sadly, Deoxys-S lacks much of an offensive presence and is generally very predictable; its stats are decidedly mediocre with the exception of Speed, severely limiting its options. Moreover, as Deoxys-S usually sets up entry hazards and then faints, it often forces the user to play with one less team member, though this is more than worth it if the entry hazards that it sets are maintained and taken advantage of throughout the match. As long as Deoxys-S is used for what it does best, it is an invaluable addition to offensive teams.

move 4: Knock Off / Magic Coat

item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Timid

Moves
========

With the fastest Stealth Rock available, Deoxys-S can support its team from the get-go. Taunt allows Deoxys-S to stop Defog, status moves, and slower Taunts, as well as overzealous setup sweepers. It also allows Deoxys-S to stop opposing entry hazard users, which can be key as Deoxys-S will usually be without Defog or Rapid Spin support of its own. Aside from its Speed, Spikes sets Deoxys-S apart from other Stealth Rock users. Due to the ability to set up multiple layers, the move often pressures the opponent into dealing with Deoxys-S as quickly as possible. Knock Off hits moderately hard and cripples the opponents that it hits for the remainder of the match. However, Magic Coat is a fine option over Knock Off and is particularly useful against Taunt users with Prankster, such as Thundurus and Sableye. It also reflects any status moves or entry hazards back at the user.

Set Details
========

252 Attack EVs allow Knock Off to hit as hard as possible, but the EVs should be moved into HP and Deoxys-S's nature should be changed to Timid if Knock Off is not used. Maximum Speed investment makes Deoxys-S ridiculously fast; it allows Deoxys-S to outspeed most Choice Scarf users while also making it easier to set up entry hazards. A Focus Sash ensures that Deoxys-S can get at least one layer of entry hazards up.

Usage Tips
========

Deoxys-S should be led with most of the time, but if your opponent has a Pokemon that will prevent it from setting up multiple layers of entry hazards, such as Tyranitar, it's often beneficial to bring Deoxys-S in later. Make sure that Taunt is used against potential Defog users only after a layer of entry hazards has been set in case the opponent decides to attack immediately. Additionally, it should be stressed that correct prediction with Taunt and Magic Coat is essential in certain situations, such as against Prankster Taunt users, opposing Deoxys-S, and setup sweepers with priority. If you choose not to use Knock Off, then you should avoid lead matchups with opposing Deoxys-S. Lastly, it might be more important to remove a certain opposing Pokemon's item with Knock Off, such as a Choice Scarf, than to get up an extra layer of entry hazards.

Team Options
========

Type synergy is not very important when selecting teammates for Deoxys-S, as it will be led with, set up entry hazards, and then faint in most matches. However, several Pokemon are particularly good to use alongside Deoxys-S in addition to those that can simply make use of the entry hazards that it sets. Taunt users that can outspeed Arceus such as Darkrai, Mewtwo, and Thundurus are excellent at stopping Defog. Mega Gengar is particularly adept at this, as it can trap opponents, use Taunt, and KO many Defog users, as well as spinblock. Other spinblockers such as Ghost Arceus also pair well with Deoxys-S. It's worth noting that minimizing entry hazard weaknesses within a team is important when using Deoxys-S, as it should be used on offensive teams&mdash;such teams usually lack Defog or Rapid Spin support.

Other Options
########

Deoxys-S has many other options. A dual screens set is usable and can be highly effective thanks to Deoxys-S's extremely fast Taunt. Psycho Boost is a great attacking option that OHKOes Pokemon that it hits super effectively, such as Gengar. Ice Beam and Extreme Speed can be used for Rayquaza and Deoxys-A, respectively. Superpower usually OHKOes Tyranitar, while Fire Punch deals with Scizor, Genesect, Forretress, and Ferrothorn. Thunder Wave and Toxic are useful for crippling almost any Pokemon, but Deoxys-S has better things to do. Finally, a bulky Rocky Helmet set is an option to surprise anti-leads that rely on contact moves to take out Deoxys-S.

Checks & Counters
########

**Prankster Taunt**: Thundurus, Sableye, and Whimsicott completely shut down Deoxys-S that lack Magic Coat, while forcing those that do have it into a 50/50.

**Defog**: Giratina-O and Scizor immediately threaten Deoxys-S with priority and/or super effective moves and can clear all hazards with Defog once it has fainted. Support Arceus formes with an advantageous type matchup can do so as well.

**Rapid Spin**: Rapid Spin users such as Excadrill and Forretress can remove Deoxys-S's entry hazards once the spinblocker on its team has been eliminated.

**Priority**: Aside from Giratina-O and Scizor, priority users such as Extreme Killer Arceus can limit Deoxys-S to a single layer of entry hazards.

**Multi-Hit Moves**: Cloyster and Scolipede can limit Deoxys-S to one layer of entry hazards with Shell Smash + Icicle Spear and Pin Missile, respectively. Mega Kangaskhan can do the same with Return.

**Tyranitar**: Thanks to Sand Stream, Tyranitar is capable of limiting Deoxys-S to one layer of entry hazards.

**Icy Wind Gengar**: Once again, Gengar with Icy Wind can limit Deoxys-S to a single layer of entry hazards.

**Magic Coat and Magic Bounce**: Without an attacking move, Deoxys-S is completely stopped by Magic Coat and Magic Bounce users. Many are hit super effectively by Knock Off, however.
