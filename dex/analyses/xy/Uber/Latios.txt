Overview
########

Thanks to the +1 Special Attack and +1 Special Defense boost granted by the return of Soul Dew, Latios returns to Ubers as a ferocious wallbreaker that can blast almost everything into pieces with its powerful Draco Meteors and Psyshocks. Defog is a new move in Latios's arsenal that lets it clear hazards for itself and its teammates. The rise of Primal Groudon is good for Latios too, as it is able to competently check several variants of Primal Groudon thanks to its immunity to Ground and resistance to Fire. It is also able to somewhat check Primal Kyogre thanks to its resistance to Water and ability to deal heavy damage with Psyshock.

However, Latios is far from perfect. Its STAB moves have common immunities in Dark and Fairy, with Yveltal and Xerneas in particular being able to severely threaten Latios. Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar, Scizor, and Aegislash can also threaten to KO Latios as it tries to switch out. Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Ghost both outspeed and threaten Latios with super effective STAB Judgment. It can also be difficult to justify using Latios over Latias, due to the latter's superior bulk.


Offensive Defog
########
name: Offensive Defog
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Defog
move 4: Roost / Hidden Power Fire / Memento
ability: Levitate
item: Soul Dew
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is Latios's nuke move and blasts Primal Groudon and everything else neutral to it apart. Psyshock lets Latios easily 2HKO all but the bulkiest of Primal Kyogre, 2HKOes Geomancy Xerneas, and hits special walls such as Blissey for a ton of damage. It also lets Latios deal consistent damage without halving its Special Attack. Defog allows Latios to clear entry hazards. Hidden Power Fire lets Latios hit Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Scizor. You should choose the support move to suit your team best, but if you decide on Roost make sure you shouldn't be using Latias instead. Roost means that Latios can regain its lost HP on the switches it causes, while Memento can be used when Latios is no longer needed, providing a setup opportunity for something else.

Set Details
========

Max Special Attack and Speed investment is standard on special attackers and lets Latios hit as hard and fast as possible. A Modest nature with enough Speed to outrun base 90s can be used for the power boost but is generally inferior to Timid. 176 Speed EVs with a Timid nature can be used to give Latios a little more bulk, but again, if bulk is what is desired, Latias should be carefully considered.

Usage Tips
========

You should use Latios on offensive teams so that it can reach its full potential, using its nice defensive typing and insane special bulk to switch in on Water-type moves from Kyogre or Ground- or Fire-type moves from defensive Primal Groudon and firing off powerful Draco Meteors or Psyshocks. Defog should be used if you want to clear entry hazards and are using teammates that appreciate them being gone, such as Ho-Oh or Yveltal. Hidden Power Fire can be useful if your team has little coverage for the Scizors and Ferrothorns that try to come in on Latios to Pursuit trap it or set up hazards, but you must watch out for other Latios and Latias due to the reduced Speed IV that comes with Hidden Power Fire.

Use Roost to keep Latios at a high amount of health so that it can continue to switch in on the likes of defensive Primal Groudon. You should use Memento if you don't need/want Defog support and want to provide setup opportunities for teammates, as well as prevent Latios from being set up on after Draco Meteor drops. It also blocks the opponent's Defog, for what it's worth.

Team Options
========

Primal Groudon switches into Xerneas and Fairies in general, easily OHKOes Ferrothorn and Scizor with Lava Plume, KOes Tyranitar and Aegislash with Earthquake or Precipice Blades, and should probably be on your team anyway. Yveltal appreciates the Defog support and can deal with Darkrai to an extent after Dark Void has been used. Xerneas pairs nicely with Latios, with Geomancy going well with Memento, and can Moonblast away the Dark-types that Latios dislikes. Choice Scarf variants of Xerneas can also take Dark Voids and appreciate Latios's ability to switch into defensive Primal Groudon. Ho-Oh really appreciates the Defog support and easily eats Arceus-Dark as well as Fairy-types without Stealth Rock up.


Calm Mind + Draco Meteor
########
name: Calm Mind + Draco Meteor
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Draco Meteor
move 3: Psyshock
move 4: Roost
ability: Levitate
item: Soul Dew
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Calm Mind is for boosting Latios's Special Attack and Special Defense, stacking with Soul Dew nicely too (Soul Dew is a raw stat increase instead of a +1 boost). +1 Draco Meteor allows Latios to blast things apart, with Psyshock letting Latios easily win Calm Mind wars. +1 Psyshock also does 75-90% to Geomancy Xerneas and lets Latios break special walls easily. Roost lets Latios regain its health and continue to boost its stats, as well as shake off hits from things such as defensive Primal Groudon.

Set Details
========

Max Special Attack and Speed investment is straightforward. Latios should always use its dual STAB moves for strong attacks. Calm Mind lets Latios boost, while Roost allows Latios to regain its health.

Usage Tips
========

As always, make sure Latios is a better fit than Latias, as the two are relatively similar and can be interchanged quite easily. Use Latios offensively to break opposing cores and force trades with +1 Draco Meteor, but also to check certain things, such as defensive Primal Groudon. Use Draco Meteor wisely, however, as it is better to 2HKO an incoming Fairy with Psyshock than to be forced out by it. Make sure to use Roost consistently to keep Latios at high health so that it can shake off weak attacks from defensive Primal Groudon and other things that it can set up on, as well as healing damage from potential burns. You should make sure that Latios does not get poisoned, as its staying power will be limited significantly. However, allowing Latios to get poisoned so that it can KO an opposing wall for another team member is a sacrifice Latios is designed to make.

Team Options
========

Primal Groudon switches into Xerneas and Fairies in general, deals with Steel-types and Pursuit trappers, should probably be on your team anyway, and switches into Choice Scarf Xerneas, which can OHKO Latios with Megahorn through its +1 Special Defense boost. Xerneas pairs nicely with Latios, Choice Scarf variants in particular, and can Moonblast away the Dark-types that Latios dislikes while appreciating Latios's ability to switch in on defensive Primal Groudon. +1 Latios can kind of take on Darkrai post-Dark Void, however.

Other Options
########

Grass Knot can be used to hit Tyranitar for super effective damage, 2HKOing it after Stealth Rock. Thunder can be used to hit Yveltal, Kyogre, and Ho-Oh in one slot, but Draco Meteor and Psyshock tend to work just as well. Psychic can be used as it is more powerful than Psyshock against a target with higher Defense or equal defenses, but Psyshock is almost always better. Magic Coat can bounce back entry hazards and status. Tailwind can be used in a similar manner to Memento once Latios has served its purpose. Refresh can heal Latios of status, and Roar can be used to phase out opposing setup sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas. Lastly, Toxic can be used to spread status and hit switch-ins such as support Arceus.

Checks & Counters
########

**Pursuit Users**: Tyranitar, Scizor, and Aegislash can all Pursuit trap Latios. While Hidden Power Fire can OHKO Scizor, it does not even guarantee a 3HKO on Aegislash, and Tyranitar can easily take a Draco Meteor and OHKO back with Pursuit.

**Arceus-Dark**: Arceus-Dark can set up on or alongside Latios due to its immunity to Psyshock, allowing it to win a Calm Mind war easily with its super effective STAB Judgment. It also outspeeds Latios.

**Arceus-Ghost**: Arceus-Ghost can hit Latios super effectively while outspeeding it, with physically inclined variants easily OHKOing. Support variants and even Calm Mind variants can falter against Calm Mind Latios that is ahead in boosts, however, due to Psyshock hitting Arceus-Ghost's unboosted Defense.

**Klefki**: Klefki resists Psyshock, is immune to Draco Meteor, is not 2HKOed by Hidden Power Fire, can status Latios at its leisure with either Thunder Wave or Toxic, can set up Spikes, and deals 65-75% with Play Rough.

**Defensive Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy**: Defensive Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy are immune to Draco Meteor, are not 2HKOed by Psyshock, and can pile pressure on Latios with Moonblast or Judgment even if it is running Calm Mind. They must be careful not to let Latios set up too many Calm Minds beforehand, however.

**Sucker Punch Users**: Yveltal and Kangaskhan can easily revenge kill Latios with Sucker Punch. They cannot switch into a Draco Meteor, however, and Kangaskhan takes a heavy amount of damage from Soul Dew Psyshock.

**Physical Arceus formes**: Physical Arceus formes that outspeed Latios can OHKO or 2HKO it due to its mediocre physical bulk.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Choice Scarf Genesect, Zekrom, Xerneas, and Yveltal all outspeed and OHKO Latios with their STAB moves.

**Mega Gengar**: Mega Gengar outspeeds and can KO a weakened Latios with Shadow Ball or force a trade with Destiny Bond. It risks losing the Speed tie if not already Mega Evolved, however.
