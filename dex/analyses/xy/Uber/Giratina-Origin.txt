Overview
########

Giratina-O is an effective Defogger that can check a lot of the physically oriented Pokemon in the Ubers metagame. It has solid 150 / 100 / 100 bulk and a good typing that offers six resistances and three immunities counting its ability, Levitate. This allows Giratina-O to check Primal Groudon, Extreme Killer Arceus, Mega Kangaskhan, some Mewtwo variants, Mega Blaziken, and other Fighting-types. Being a Ghost-type, Giratina-O is able to escape Shadow Tag and other means of trapping, and because it has Levitate, it is immune to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web, and it is neutral to Stealth Rock. This makes Giratina-O a very reliable Defog user in the Ubers metagame. Additionally, Ghost is a potent offensive typing that has good neutral coverage and also gives it a niche in stopping Rapid Spin. However, a lack of reliable recovery plagues Giratina-O, as it is worn down by repeated attacks and residual damage from status and Stealth Rock. Giratina-O is forced to run Griseous Orb as well, and, while this provides a nice offensive boost to Giratina-O's STAB moves, it limits versatility and does not allow for the passive healing of Leftovers. It also faces new competition for a Defog slot from Latias and Latios, which boast similar advantages in bulk and Levitate, but they have access to reliable recovery in the form of Roost and Recover.

Physical Defog
########
name: Physical Defog
move 1: Defog
move 2: Shadow Sneak
move 3: Dragon Tail
move 4: Shadow Force / Earthquake
ability: Levitate
item: Griseous Orb
evs: 248 Atk / 248 Def / 12 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Defog is used to clear entry hazards and free up an Arceus slot. Shadow Sneak allows Giratina-O to anti-lead Deoxys-A and Deoxys-S; priority has a lot of utility in general. Dragon Tail allows Giratina-O to phaze setup sweepers that would be difficult to stop otherwise, such as Rock Polish Primal Groudon and Extreme Killer Arceus. Shadow Force is a very strong physical attack in general coming from a decent base 120 Attack stat further boosted by Griseous Orb. It also stops Geomancy Xerneas from setting up, as it hopefully puts Xerneas in range of Shadow Sneak after a bit of prior damage. Earthquake can hit Primal Groudon, Klefki, and Diancie super effectively. Will-O-Wisp gives Giratina-O a second way to deal with physical attackers besides Dragon Tail, and it should be used if a team absolutely needs a burn on setup sweepers such as Ground and Extreme Killer Arceus. It also gets passive damage on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Yveltal, and Clefable. Lastly, Stone Edge is a viable move used to deal with Ho-Oh, which Giratina-O often lures in, and hit Yveltal on the switch. It should be noted that if the role of entry hazard removal is already fulfilled by one of Giratina-O's teammates, another move can replace Defog on this set, making Giratina-O more of a specific check for physical attackers than an entry hazard-controlling support Pokemon.

Set Details
========

Griseous Orb is the mandatory item for Giratina-O. 248 Defense EVs allow Giratina-O to evade the KO from a +2 Adamant Extreme Killer Arceus's Shadow Claw after Stealth Rock damage. 12 Speed EVs let Giratina-O outpace maximum Speed Diancie before it Mega Evolves. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack and give Giratina-O the ability to hit harder in general; for example, with the EVs, Giratina-O has a stronger Shadow Sneak for picking off weakened foes, deals more chip damage with Dragon Tail, and hits Xerneas harder with Shadow Force. However, an alternative spread of 148 HP / 100 Atk / 248 Def / 12 Spe, which invests enough Attack to 2HKO Mewtwo with Shadow Sneak, can be used with Earthquake; otherwise, if running Shadow Force, maximum Attack investment is important to hit Xerneas harder.

Usage Tips
========

It is important to try to utilize immunities and resistances to get Giratina-O in safely. The need to use Defog should often be weighed, as having Stealth Rock up on your opponent's side can greatly increase the effectiveness of spamming Dragon Tail. However, be wary when the opponent has a Fairy-type Pokemon in the back when spamming Dragon Tail. Finally, try to minimize the residual damage that Giratina-O takes, as the lack of recovery makes Giratina-O susceptible to being worn down. If Giratina-O is needed to check a specific threat, it is important to preserve Giratina-O's HP.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support is greatly appreciated to make Dragon Tail more effective. Bulky Stealth Rock setters make for the best partners; two examples are Dialga and Primal Groudon. Stealth Rock setters that can set up consistently over the course of a match are greatly preferred over suicide entry hazard leads. Giratina-O also appreciates teammates that check Fairy-types, such as Klefki, Scizor, Metagross, Aegislash, Jirachi, Ho-Oh, and Primal Groudon. It should be noted that the Fairy checks with a secondary Ghost or Psychic typing can compound weaknesses to Dark-types, which is not ideal. Giratina-O also appreciates Fairy-types such as Xerneas, Clefable, and Klefki as partners, because they check Dark-types for Giratina-O. Wish and cleric support from the likes of Blissey, Clefable, and Diancie on bulkier teams can keep Giratina-O healthy and prevent it from being overwhelmed. Offensive Arceus formes such as Swords Dance Ground Arceus and Calm Mind Dark Arceus appreciate the Defog role filled by Giratina-O, because this means that a support Arceus forme does not need to be used.

Other Options
########

Giratina-O has a number of viable alternatives, but it is hard-pressed to make space in its four moveslots. A mixed attacking set with Draco Meteor and Shadow Ball can be used, which allows Giratina-O to bypass physically defensive walls. Magic Coat is a cool move that anti-leads very effectively by bouncing back entry hazards, Taunt, and status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic. Substitute eases prediction and blocks status while making Shadow Force easier to use; however, it tends to run through Giratina-O's limited HP quickly. Rest is Giratina-O's only viable recovery move and means of removing status, so it can be used to increase longevity. Giratina-O tends to draw Fairy-types to itself, so Iron Tail is a viable move to hit them. If accuracy and Fairy-types are problematic, Roar is another phazing option which Giratina-O has. Toxic puts timers on opposing Pokemon, including both Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, which cannot be burned, and support Arceus formes. Thunder Wave cripples faster Pokemon and can deter setup from the likes of Geomancy Xerneas and non-Refresh Salamence. Lastly, Hex can be a very powerful attack if an opposing Pokemon has any status, such as a burn, and allows Giratina-O to bypass Gliscor.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dark-types**: Dark-types make for the best checks to Giratina-O, as they resist Ghost and threaten with super effective Dark-type moves. Yveltal easily switches in and OHKOes Giratina-O with Dark Pulse, though it can be hit with Stone Edge as it switches in. Darkrai threatens Giratina-O with a powerful Dark Pulse, and it can put a teammate to sleep with Dark Void. Dark Arceus switches in and can threaten Giratina-O with Dark-type Judgment or set up Calm Mind. Tyranitar can switch in relatively easily, but it dislikes being burned and does not do too much damage in return.

**Fairy-types**: Bulky Fairy-types threaten Giratina-O, though they do not resist Ghost-type attacks. Defensive Xerneas does not take too much from Giratina-O's attacks and deals heavy damage with Moonblast. Fairy Arceus fears little from Giratina-O, threatens with Judgment, and can use Defog, Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, or Calm Mind. Clefable can use Giratina-O to pass Wishes and clear status with Heal Bell; it also threatens to use Moonblast, albeit a weaker one. Shadow Force does a lot of damage to Clefable, however.

**Ho-Oh**: Assuming that Stealth Rock is not set up on Ho-Oh's side and Giratina-O is not running the uncommon Stone Edge, Ho-Oh freely switches in on Giratina-O and deals a lot of damage, as Dragon Tail damage is negated by Regenerator.

**Gliscor**: Gliscor walls Giratina-O relatively well by using Roost to keep itself healthy and being immune to Will-O-Wisp because of its Toxic Orb. It can also use Toxic itself, which puts Giratina-O on a timer. A Draco Meteor from a mixed set will do significant damage to Gliscor, however.

**Fast Dragon-types**: Dragon-types that outspeed Giratina-O can threaten it out with a powerful Dragon-type move. Zekrom can outspeed and hit Giratina-O with a powerful Outrage, Dragon Claw, or Draco Meteor, while Palkia outspeeds and hits Giratina-O with Spacial Rend. However, neither enjoys switching into a Dragon Tail.

**Toxic**: Due to Giratina-O's lack of reliable recovery or way to rid itself of status, Toxic wears it down very rapidly and makes it susceptible to being overwhelmed by repeated hits.
