Overview
########

Scizor is a useful Pokemon in the Ubers metagame; it is very capable of checking Xerneas, a key threat, through the use of its strong, super effective priority in the form of Bullet Punch. It possesses a lot of utility for more defensive teams, as it is capable of checking Mega Gengar with Pursuit and Bullet Punch. It also has an useful Mega Evolution, which is a bit bulkier and slightly faster while retaining its offensive capabilities. However, the prominence of Ho-Oh and the birth of Mega Blaziken are significant drawbacks for Scizor, as is its loss of its Dark and Ghost resistances. Overall, despite its clear weaknesses, its strong typing and utility give Scizor a meaningful place in the metagame.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Bullet Punch
move 2: Roost
move 3: Superpower / Pursuit
move 4: U-turn / Toxic / Knock Off
ability: Light Metal
item: Scizorite
evs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Bullet Punch does at least 54% to bulky Geomancy Xerneas. Roost provides consistent recovery. Superpower deals heavy damage to Extreme Killer Arceus and Chansey, while Pursuit gives Scizor the opportunity to handle Mega Gengar, though for this, Scizor should run the specially defensive spread mentioned in Set Details. U-turn and Toxic are both useful moves for hitting opposing switch-ins; Toxic is especially useful for handling Calm Mind Arceus formes. Knock Off removes foes' items. Defog, while not listed, is a fantastic support move that Mega Scizor can use, but it may struggle with pulling it off against more offensive teams. Scizor can rarely afford the moveslot to run Swords Dance, but it can help to Pursuit trap Aegislash and also clean up late-game.

Set Details
========

Light Metal is used to reduce the power of the rare Low Kick or Grass Knot that Scizor switches into, since when it Mega Evolves, it regains Technician anyway. It is also useful when Ditto switches in before Scizor, as it is left without the boost of Technician. It is difficult to bluff a Choice Band set with Technician since there is such a drop in power, so Light Metal is generally the most useful. A spread of 248 HP / 16 Atk / 116 Def / 128 SpD with an Adamant nature can be used as an exchange of power for bulk without losing the ability to check Xerneas and Extreme Killer Arceus sufficiently. A spread of 248 HP / 16 Atk / 244 SpD with an Adamant nature is still capable of almost always 2HKOing standard Geomancy Xerneas, but because of the increased special bulk, it is the recommended spread for trapping Mega Gengar. It should also be noted that it can deal at least 54% to bulky Extreme Killer Arceus with Superpower. 248 HP EVs reduces the damage taken from Stealth Rock by Scizor.

Usage Tips
========

Unless Scizor is using a specially defensive spread, it can still have difficulty switching directly into Xerneas, but can deal significant damage to it before being attacked. The main spread can deal a minimum of about 57% to standard Geomancy Xerneas. If possible, you should inflict prior damage upon Xerneas in order to bring it into the KO range of Scizor's Bullet Punch. Likewise, Extreme Killer Arceus should be brought into the KO range for Scizor's Superpower; the main spread can deal at least 63% to bulky Extreme Killer Arceus whilst doing at least 71% to offensive Extreme Killer Arceus. When using Scizor to trap Mega Gengar, it in general works best when double switched into it, and must be wary of Hidden Power Fire as well as Destiny Bond. Bullet Punch can also be used to revenge kill heavily weakened Pokemon. Scizor has few other opportunities to come in against offensively oriented teams, whilst against less offensive teams it should use any free turns to disrupt the foe.

Team Options
========

Choice Scarf Zekrom pairs nicely with Scizor, as it can take care of Ho-Oh and Kyogre, whilst Mega Scizor checks both Extreme Killer Arceus and Xerneas, and they also can form a VoltTurn core. For a team relying on it to Pursuit trap Mega Gengar, options that require that form of support, such as defensive Xerneas, pair well with it. Other teammates that can handle Fire-types and other threats that get a free switch on Scizor, such as Kyogre, are ideal. You should also carry a second check to Geomancy Xerneas, such as Ho-Oh, if you are using Scizor to Pursuit trap Mega Gengar, in case you lose Scizor to Destiny Bond.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Bullet Punch
move 2: Superpower
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Technician
item: Choice Band
evs: 248 HP / 212 Atk / 48 Def
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Bullet Punch allows Scizor to check Xerneas and revenge kill weakened threats. Superpower allows it to heavily damage Extreme Killer Arceus, as well as other Pokemon that are weak to Fighting-type attacks, such as Blissey, Mega Kangaskhan, and Rock Arceus. U-turn and Knock Off are for gaining momentum and disrupting switch-ins. Pursuit is an option for trapping opponents, primarily Mega Gengar, but Scizor doesn't enjoy being locked into it, and this version of Scizor is inferior to the Support set at performing this role.

Set Details
========

Choice Band gives Scizor a lot of power. It is guaranteed to 2HKO most variants of Xerneas with Bullet Punch. The defensive EVs allow it to not be OHKOed by Jolly Life Orb +2 Extreme Killer Arceus's Earthquake after a switch into Stealth Rock from full health. A spread of 248 HP / 20 Atk / 48 Def / 192 SpD and a Careful nature can take Focus Blast, or even a Hidden Power Fire in the rain, from Xerneas after a Geomancy boost and 2 Stealth Rocks, whilst still hitting hard. 248 HP EVs reduce Stealth Rock damage.

Usage Tips
========

Unless using the bulkier spread, this set struggles to switch in on opposing Xerneas and still requires some prior damage to defeat it; however, it can deal a minimum of 75% to Geomancy Xerneas with Bullet Punch. Superpower deals a minimum of 83% to bulky Extreme Killer Arceus. It tends to not switch in during many other parts of the game due to its relative frailty, especially since it requires the bulk it does have to defeat certain threats. Bullet Punch can also be used for revenge killing. Knock Off and U-turn allow Scizor to disrupt more defensive teams.

Team Options
========

The best Pokemon to pair with Scizor are those that can check Pokemon that obtain a free switch on it, such as Ho-Oh and Kyogre. Because of this, Pokemon such as Palkia and Zekrom pair well with it, as they are able to come in on some of these Pokemon and threaten them. Zekrom forms a VoltTurn core with Scizor, which is of great benefit to a team for the momentum it can provide.

Other Options
########

Thanks to Technician, Bug Bite is a stronger Bug-type STAB than U-turn. Tailwind is quite gimmicky, but in combination with U-turn, it could be quite powerful, providing sweeping opportunities for teammates. Lum Berry is also an option to soak up a Will-O-Wisp. Assault Vest could be used, but the drop in damage output is significant. Baton Pass is an option, but it suits very few players or teams. Thief deserves a small mention for its consistency, and for being stronger than Knock Off against Mega Evolutions and Arceus formes (factoring in the boost from Technician), most particularly Arceus-Ghost. Finally, Counter deserves a mention, as it is more reliable against Extreme Killer Arceus if it attacks with a physical attack.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire types**: Ho-Oh is a particularly potent threat, although it dislikes Knock Off and Toxic, while other users of Fire-type attacks such as Blaziken and Mega Charizard X can find opportunities to set up against Scizor.

**Physically Bulky Pokemon**: Rocky Helmet Skarmory punishes U-turn spam, and if Scizor doesn't carry Defog, Skarmory can set up Spikes on it. Aegislash hates Knock Off, Swords Dance, and Pursuit, but it is otherwise a solid check. Landorus-T and Gyarados fear only Toxic and Knock Off, whilst Gliscor fears nothing from Scizor and can also Taunt it. Mega-Aggron laughs at anything that Scizor tries to do.

**Will-O-Wisp**: Support Arceus formes and Giratina can burn Scizor, neutering it, although cleric support can remedy this.

**Kyogre**: Physically defensive Kyogre doesn't care about Scizor, whilst other sets only mind Toxic, Knock Off, and U-turn.

**Thundurus**: Thundurus can use Taunt to stop Roost and Defog, whilst hitting hard with an unresisted Electric-type STAB attack, although it dislikes taking too many hits from Scizor.

**Forretress**: Forretress doesn't mind Scizor's attacks and can set up hazards unless Scizor carries Defog, although it dislikes Knock Off.

**Fire-type Attacks**: Other Fire-type attack users include Genesect, Palkia, and Dialga, which can use powerful Fire-type attacks to destroy Scizor. Hidden Power Fire and Overheat from unexpected Pokemon, such as Mega Gengar, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Xerneas, can really cause it trouble.

**Zekrom**: Zekrom can 2HKO Scizor but fears Toxic and Knock Off. It also dislikes taking U-turns.
