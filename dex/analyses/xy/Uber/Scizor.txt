Overview
########

Mega Scizor is known for being a great Xerneas check thanks to access to Bullet Punch and a strong base 150 Attack. It also has a great movepool, with access to Roost, Pursuit, U-turn, and a variety of other tricks. U-turn and Roost in particular help Mega Scizor to differentiate itself from other Xerneas checks such as Aegislash; U-turn helps Mega Scizor keep momentum for an offensive team and Roost provides reliable recovery. Mega Scizor is also one of the few viable Pursuit trappers, which is one of the best methods for checking threats such as Mega Gengar, Latios, and Latias. Technician is an ability that would be ineffective on most Pokemon; however, for Mega Scizor it works well due to the low Base Power of its moves. Its Steel / Bug typing has always been an effective defensive typing, granting several resistances and an immunity while leaving a single exploitable 4x weakness to Fire-type moves. Mega Scizor's immunity to Poison allows it to switch into a variety of threats without the fear of being hit with Toxic, which is a great asset to both offensive and defensive teams. However, due to Mega Scizor's exploitable weakness, several Pokemon run Fire-type coverage moves almost exclusively for Mega Scizor, meaning that potential danger is always present. Mega Scizor is also bait to powerful threats such as Ho-Oh and Kyogre and it can be passive because Steel and Bug are poor types offensively. The lack of Leftovers recovery means that Mega Scizor struggles to maintain ample HP when burned in addition to loosing all offensive presence.

Moves
========

Bullet Punch serves as Mega Scizor's primary STAB attack. Technician combined with STAB raises Bullet Punch to a more respectable 90 Base Power and checks common Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Diancie. Although Bullet Punch isn't that strong and common types resist Steel-type attacks, the priority of the move has useful utility. Roost is used to give Mega Scizor some staying power, as it is unable to receive passive recovery though Leftovers. Pursuit allows Mega Scizor to forcibly remove threats such as Latios, Latias, Lugia, and Mega Gengar, as Pursuit will hit even if the opponent switches them out. Toxic is a solution to threats such as Lugia and Ghost Arceus, which cannot be taken down by Mega Scizor's offensive moves alone. U-turn is an option in place of Toxic for more offensively oriented teams that helps keep momentum and prevents Mega Scizor from becoming bait to threats such as Ho-Oh. Lastly, Superpower is a coverage option which nails Extreme Killer Arceus and Mega Kangaskhan and can finish some Steel-types such as Ferrothorn.


Set Details
========

248 HP EVs are used to raise Mega Scizor's overall bulk and help with the ability to use Roost. 60 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature guarantee that Mega Scizor can 2HKO 200HP Xerneas. The remaining 200 EVs are allocated into Special Defense to compensate for Mega Scizor's lower special bulk and to grant it the ability to tank Hidden Power Fire from Mega Gengar.


Usage Tips
========

Although Hidden Power Fire usage on Xerneas has decreased, it is still a possible danger. This set has no qualms about switching into defensive or Choice Scarf Xerneas sets so long as it doesn't have Hidden Power Fire. However, unlike Xerneas checks such as Klefki, you do not necessarily want to switch Mega Scizor into a Geomancy Xerneas on the turn it sets up. The reason being that although Mega Scizor has priority with Bullet Punch, Xerneas will survive if it is at full health and can proceed to knock out Mega Scizor if it has Hidden Power Fire. An alternative approach is to damage Xerneas enough on its setup turn to where Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch can revenge kill the boosted Xerneas; then either sack your least useful Pokemon to get Mega Scizor in for free or directly switch Mega Scizor into a predicted Moonblast if it has enough HP to survive the attack. Xerneas is not the only Pokemon that runs Fire-type coverage moves because of Mega Scizor; even Pokemon such as Blissey have the potential to hit Mega Scizor as it comes in, so scouting for these type of moves is paramount.

Because Mega Scizor is immune to Toxic, it can be used as a pivot against defensive threats such as Lugia and serve as an offensive team's solution to opposing Toxic use. Although Bullet Punch is not very strong and has poor offensive typing, Mega Scizor's access to priory should not be overlooked. Keeping Mega Scizor around to threaten Focus Sash users and fast, frail Pokemon such as Deoxys-A can be of great assistance. Mega Scizor should be kept away from burns at all cost, as it will become significantly more difficult to revenge kill Xerneas; the loss of HP each turn also makes keeping Mega Scizor healthy enough to check intended threats very difficult if not impossible. This set is massive bait to Ho-Oh and Kyogre, therefore Mega Scizor's best option if you foresee these threats coming in is either to U-turn out or slap them with Toxic and switch out, assuming you can afford to give these threats a free turn.


Team Options
========

Often a team's greatest weapon against Ho-Oh is Stealth Rock, and because Mega Scizor tends to draw in Ho-Oh, it is best to have a setter of this move that can force Ho-Oh out. Primal Groudon can check both Ho-Oh and Kyogre, which are two of the greatest threats to Mega Scizor, while in return Mega Scizor can check Lugia, Latias, and Latios. Dark-types such as Yveltal, Darkrai, and Dark Arceus can all be excellent teammates because they annihilate Ghost-types such as Ghost Arceus and Giratina while they benefit from Mega Scizor's ability to check Fairy-types. Latias and Latios can provide anti-entry hazard support for Mega Scizor while they appreciate Mega Scizor's ability to switch into Fairy-type attacks. Kyogre can crush the Fire-types that give Mega Scizor trouble. Rock Arceus pairs well with Mega Scizor, as it is one of the best checks to Ho-Oh. Tyranitar can also check Ho-Oh and appreciates Mega Scizor's immunity to Toxic and check to Fairy-types. Palkia can beat several Fire-types and also gives Mega Scizor a switch-in to Kyogre. Lastly, Zekrom can smash Ho-Oh and Kyogre, which are two of the biggest threats to Mega Scizor.


Other Options
########

Knock Off is a possible option over Pursuit. However, in general the utility provided by Pursuit is more useful. A set making use of Swords Dance can help to make Mega Scizor a bit less passive, but with common threats such as Primal Groudon resisting Bullet Punch, it is less viable than in was in previous Generations. Mega Scizor does have the potential to run Defog, which can potentially free up a moveslot for another Pokemon, but in general other Defoggers in Ubers such as Arceus, Latios, Latias, and Giratina-O are more effective. A Choice Band set can give Mega Scizor a bit more power and doesn't forfeit the Mega Evolution slot, but the inability to use support moves and the decreased bulk hurts. Lastly, a Life Orb set can still give Mega Scizor a bit more power and the ability to change moves at the cost of taking recoil damage and being slightly weaker than a Choice Band set.


Checks & Counters
########

**Ho-Oh**: Other than with Toxic and Knock Off, Mega Scizor cannot punish Ho-Oh while it can easily OHKO Mega Scizor with Sacred Fire.

**Primal Groudon**: Primal Groudon resists Mega Scizor's STAB moves and often runs Fire-type moves such as Lava Plume and Fire Punch, which completely wreck Mega Scizor.

**Fire-type Pokemon**: All Fire-types pose an obvious danger to Mega Scizor due to its exploitable weakness. Blaziken can easily OHKO Mega Scizor with Flare Blitz as can Victini with V-Create.

**Kyogre**: Due to Kyogre's sheer mightm it can rip through Mega Scizor with neutral Water-type moves. Offensive sets do not like being hit with Toxic or U-turn as they come in, however.

**Ghost Arceus**: Support and Calm Mind Ghost Arceus can burn Mega Scizor with Will-O-Wisp and deal solid damage with Judgment. However, they dislike being poisoned by Toxic.

**Palkia and Dialga**: Palkia and Dialga commonly run Fire Blast and resist Mega Scizor's STAB attacks.

**Sableye**: Sableye is bulky enough to comfortable tank Mega Scizor's attacks and can punish it with Will-O-Wisp.

**Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory**: Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Skarmory can comfortably take any move Mega Scizor has except for Superpower and can proceed to stack Spikes.

**Burns**: Will-O-Wisp and Scald are the two most common sources of burns on Mega Scizor, both of which hamper Mega Scizor from checking its intended threats by halving its Attack stat and dealing passive damage.

**Fire-type Coverage Moves**: Many Pokemon have the potential to be running Fire-type coverage moves that can potentially knock out Mega Scizor. Some examples include Hidden Power Fire Xerneas, Hidden Power Fire Latios, Overheat Extreme Killer Arceus, and Flamethrower Blissey.
