Overview
########

Rock Arceus carves itself a unique niche in Ubers by virtue of its typing and solid all-around base stats. Its resistances to both of Ho-Oh's STAB moves differentiate it from its counterparts as one of few quality checks to the phoenix. In addition to hitting Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Rayquaza super effectively, Rock is a good offensive typing that gets excellent neutral coverage within the tier, thus freeing up moveslots for Rock Arceus to support itself and its teammates with moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Defog. Unfortunately, weaknesses to common and potent offensive types such as Water, Ground, and Fighting render it vulnerable to many prominent offensive threats. Overall, Rock Arceus provides very specialized team support, even if it requires plenty of support itself.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Judgment
move 2: Defog
move 3: Recover
move 4: Will-O-Wisp
item: Stone Plate
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Judgment is a powerful, reliable STAB move, striking down the tier's Flying-types and hitting neutral targets quite hard. Defog wipes entry hazards from the field; Rock Arceus is an effective user of the move as it can utilize its Speed and typing to find free turns to use it. Recover replenishes Rock Arceus's health, ensuring it does not get whittled down by attacks over the course of the match. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers, notably helping with Rock Arceus's Ground- and Steel-type weaknesses.

Set Details
========

An EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature makes good use of Rock Arceus's excellent natural bulk while giving it its best odds against Extreme Killer Arceus; Jolly 252 Speed variants risk losing a Speed tie and getting burned by Will-O-Wisp, while anything slower is outsped. Another viable EV spread is 252 HP / 64 Def / 192 Spe. 192 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Rock Arceus to outspeed and OHKO Thundurus with Judgment. Notably, Gengar is also outsped before it Mega Evolves. 252 EVs are used to maximize HP, and the remaining 64 EVs are placed in Defense to give Rock Arceus a small buffer against physical attackers such as Ho-Oh and Zekrom.

Usage Tips
========

This set has a 94% chance of OHKOing 248 HP / 0 SpD Ho-Oh with Judgment while resisting both of its STAB moves. It goes without saying, then, that this set's primary aim is to check Ho-Oh, if you see it in Team Preview. It is important to scout what Ho-Oh set the opponent is using early on in the game and proceed to play around it accordingly. Leftovers variants are generally safe to switch into, as their damage output is relatively lower: 0 Atk Ho-Oh's Brave Bird does a mere 16-18% damage to Rock Arceus. Just note that Toxic is a viable, albeit uncommon move on these Ho-Oh variants. However, Life Orb and Choice Band Ho-Oh are progressively harder to switch into; a Life Orb-boosted Brave Bird caps out at 32% damage and a Choice Band-boosted one at 36%. Therefore, it is wise to be liberal in your usage of Recover after switching into more offensive variants of Ho-Oh. Also, bear in mind that once Rock Arceus is revealed, Ho-Oh will actively attempt to burn it with Sacred Fire on the switch-in, and a burned Rock Arceus is worn down more quickly as it takes an additional 12.5% residual damage every turn. Your main priority should be keeping Rock Arceus as healthy as possible so it can effectively check and dispatch Ho-Oh when the need arises, especially later in the game.

Keep in mind that offensive variants of Ho-Oh often carry Earthquake as a coverage move. A Life Orb-boosted Earthquake does 60-71% damage to Rock Arceus and a Choice Band-boosted one does 70-82%, meaning Rock Arceus cannot switch in on one of these at all. After revealing Rock Arceus by switching into Ho-Oh initially and discovering from its damage output that it is an offensive variant, you should be mindful that Ho-Oh will likely begin to use Earthquake in anticipation of future Rock Arceus switch-ins. A wise move from then on might be to switch to a Ground-resistant or immune teammate against Ho-Oh, or else a dispensable teammate that you can afford to sacrifice at worst. Rock Arceus will most probably be required to land a swift OHKO on Ho-Oh at some point later in the game, meaning that you cannot afford to lose it by hastily switching it in on a super effective coverage move.

Possessing weaknesses to common types, Rock may be a poor defensive typing overall, but it does allow Rock Arceus to switch into attacks such as Yveltal's Oblivion Wing, Mega Kangaskhan's Return, and Rayquaza's V-create. Offensively, Rock is a great typing that gets excellent neutral coverage across the tier, while Pokemon resistant to it generally loathe getting burned, so be smart in your usage of Judgment and Will-O-Wisp to wear down Rock Arceus's switch-ins. Will-O-Wisp can also be used to check Extreme Killer Arceus and Ground-types in a pinch, although Rock Arceus should never be your primary option versus these threats. Defog should be used with discretion, as it allows opponents to either get in a free attack or switch into one of Rock Arceus's checks. This is particularly pertinent given Rock Arceus's vulnerability to many common attacks from the likes of Palkia, Groudon, and even its counterparts in Water and Grass Arceus.

Team Options
========

A dedicated Kyogre check is beneficial, making Palkia a great teammate. On more stall-oriented teams, Pokemon such as Gastrodon and specially defensive Kyogre are viable options. A Palkia check is also required, as unlike its support Arceus counterparts, Rock Arceus cannot deal with Palkia well at all. Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Sylveon are particularly notable as they double as clerics (see below). Stalltwo beats all Palkia variants one-on-one, while Rock Arceus helps it against Yveltal. Blissey is a prime Palkia check on defensive teams. A cleric is highly recommended to rid Rock Arceus of status conditions, notably Sacred Fire burns from Ho-Oh. This can prove particularly useful as Life Orb or Choice Band Ho-Oh can combine burn damage with Brave Bird or sun-boosted Sacred Fire to do well over 50% damage to Rock Arceus on the switch-in, pressuring it immensely. Shaymin-S is an interesting offensive teammate that benefits greatly from Rock Arceus checking Ho-Oh; in return, it deals with many of Rock Arceus's checks, such as Ground-types, non-Choice Scarf Kyogre, and Water and Grass Arceus. In the same vein, Mega Blaziken can decimate Steel- and Grass-types. Defensively, Fire-weak Pokemon such as Scizor and Ferrothorn enjoy Rock Arceus's support, but note that Mega Blaziken threatens such cores immensely. Ironically enough, Ho-Oh is a good partner as it checks Grass- and Steel-types brilliantly while Rock Arceus provides it with Defog support. However, it does compound a troubling weakness to Kyogre and Palkia. Giratina-O checks Ground- and Fighting-types and appreciates Rock Arceus checking Ho-Oh and Yveltal. On defensive builds, Lugia is a good teammate for the same reasons.

Finally, it is worth highlighting that due to its poor defensive typing, Rock Arceus's usage over another Arceus forme should be well-justified. For example, Water Arceus and Electric Arceus are, on the whole, defensively sturdier fomes that can check many of the same threats as Rock Arceus, albeit not nearly as well or consistently.


Other Options
########

A Calm Mind all-out attacker with Fire Blast and Grass Knot as coverage moves is a viable, though niche set that is very hard to wall at +1 Special Attack. It is encouraged to use 252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature on such a set to maximize damage output, although a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Thundurus and Gengar. Recover can be used over Calm Mind on more balanced teams in order to preserve Rock Arceus's longevity. Secondly, a mono-attacking set with Calm Mind can be used with Will-O-Wisp and Recover, making Rock Arceus an effective late-game sweeper that is very hard to break with both physical and special attacks after it has picked up a Calm Mind boost. Refresh can also be used over Will-O-Wisp to shrug off status afflictions as Rock Arceus sets up. However, weaknesses to many common types make this a rather mediocre set that should only be used over another Calm Mind Arceus forme for its ability to reliably check Ho-Oh at any point in the game â€” a feat that most other Arceus formes cannot accomplish.


Checks & Counters
########

**Water-types**: Due to their ubiquity and usage of specially based STAB moves, Water-types are the prime checks to Rock Arceus. Offensive Kyogre and Palkia threaten to OHKO it right off the bat, while defensive variants, along with Water Arceus and Gastrodon, wear it down quickly.

**Blissey**: The pink blob counters Rock Arceus with her enormous Special Defense and access to Toxic.

**Grass-types**: Grass Arceus and Ferrothorn can both take down Rock Arceus while staying relatively healthy with Recover and Leech Seed respectively. Shaymin-S outspeeds Rock Arceus and threatens to OHKO it with a Life Orb-boosted Seed Flare, but is OHKOed itself by Judgment.

**Fighting-types**: Mega Blaziken and Mega Mewtwo X can OHKO Rock Arceus with a STAB Low Kick, while Mega Lucario can do the same with STAB Close Combat. However, note that the latter two cannot switch into Will-O-Wisp. Fighting Arceus can easily beat Rock Arceus one-on-one due to its type advantage.

**Offensive Ground-types**: Groudon, Landorus-T, and Ground Arceus all detest burns, but the former two can viably carry Lum Berry to bypass Will-O-Wisp and severely cripple Rock Arceus with a STAB Earthquake, while the latter has a 50% chance of winning Speed ties with it.

**Steel-types**: Most Steel-types are large hindrances to Rock Arceus. While uncommon, Steel Arceus is the best of these checks as it has reliable recovery and a super effective STAB Judgment. Scizor, Aegislash, Jirachi, Klefki, and Bronzong are all relatively common Pokemon that can check Rock Arceus with their typing and STAB/status moves. However, all of these Pokemon dislike burns, as their STAB move of choice is often physical. Mega Mawile deserves a mention as a niche Steel-type that can severely dent Rock Arceus with STAB Iron Head. Heatran is a shakier check; it is immune to Will-O-Wisp but takes neutral damage from Judgment and can at best cripple Rock Arceus with Toxic.

**Status**: Rock Arceus loathes status of any sort; paralysis destroys its Speed advantage over many Pokemon, while poison and burns greatly limit its longevity.
