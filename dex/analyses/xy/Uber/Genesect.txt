Overview
########
The generation shift has seemingly gone very much against Genesect. It lost its resistances to Dark and Ghost in exchange for a new resistance to Fairy. The lack of Soul Dew in the Ubers metagame means that Genesect lost two very important targets in XY: Latios and Latias. The rarity of Dragon Dance Rayquaza means that a big niche Genesect had in revenge killing it has also diminished. However, Genesect still has the title of being one of the best Choice Scarf users thanks to Download, its great typing, and excellent coverage options, making it able to turn the tides of battle easily.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: U-turn
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Explosion / Extreme Speed
move 4: Ice Beam / Blaze Kick
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 248 Atk / 8 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Hasty

Moves
========
Genesect's ability to become one of the best Choice Scarf users in the Uber tier has not changed this generation. U-turn is the move that will be primarily used, taking advantage of forced-out enemy Pokemon and creating momentum for your own team. Iron Head is used to smack Fairy-type Pokemon very hard, being able to 2HKO all but the most physically bulky Fairy-types after Stealth Rock, while coming with a handy 30% flinch rate. Explosion is a last resort move to deal huge amounts of damage, allowing Genesect to become an emergency check to Extreme Killer Arceus, and is Genesect's best attack against Ho-Oh, being able to OHKO with a Download boost behind it. Extreme Speed gives Genesect extra utility by adding some priority to a team, and can revenge kill severely weakened threats that might be faster than it such as Geomancy Xerneas or Mega Blaziken. Ice Beam allows Genesect to deal heavy damage to Dragon- or Ground-types such as Zekrom, Groudon and Landorus-T, and it also OHKOes Rayquaza after it has taken a round of Life Orb recoil. Blaze Kick is useful to hit the Steel-types that might come in to absorb a U-turn such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Forretress.

Set Details
========
The EV spread is relatively simple. Put 248 EVs into Attack and max Speed out to allow Genesect to hit hard while being as fast as possible. Dump the remaining EVs into Special Attack, or Defense if you're not using Ice Beam, and opt for a Naive nature if Extreme Speed or Blaze Kick are not being used to take physical priority attacks better from Pokemon such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Mega Scizor. If Extreme Speed or Blaze Kick are being used, use a Hasty nature to maintain legality.

Usage Tips
========
If a dedicated lead is not being used, leading with Genesect is a great idea to gain momentum on the opponent from the start. If the matchup is favorable and you expect the opponent to switch, U-turn out into a Pokemon that can apply immediate pressure to whatever the opponent switched into. Genesect should not be used as a straight-up attackerâ€”its role on a team is mainly to revenge kill threats and create momentum with U-turn. Take care when switching into Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Fairy Arceus as they might have a move that can cripple or severely weaken Genesect. Xerneas might have Hidden Power Fire and Fairy Arceus might try to burn Genesect with Will-O-Wisp on the switch. Keep in mind that Genesect isn't particularly great at revenge killing a boosted Geomancy Xerneas either, as Xerneas will now outspeed and take Genesect out with a coverage move. If not using U-turn, be careful what move Genesect will lock itself into using as it might give the opponent a free switch.

Team Options
========
Genesect loves having Pokemon that can reliably set entry hazards and maintain offensive pressure to keep them up. Reliable Stealth Rock users such as Dialga and Landorus-T can keep hazards up and make sure the switches that Genesect forces are punished more by entry hazard damage. Spikes users such as Deoxys-S or Klefki are also great options for hazard laying. Sticky Web is also something Genesect appreciates as with Sticky Web on the field, Genesect can now take a +1 Speed Xerneas out with Iron Head. Shuckle is the best user of Sticky Web, and Genesect can support it by discouraging Darkrai from anti-leading Shuckle. Genesect suits offensive teams the best due to its abilities to gain momentum and revenge kill threats, and as such should not be used alongside defensive Pokemon. A Defog user such as Arceus-Water or Giratina-O can be useful for when there are too many entry hazards on Genesect's side of the field, as Genesect hates entry hazards itself as they can stop it from freely creating momentum, but this can be counterproductive; aim mainly to keep offensive pressure to keep your entry hazards up and the opponent's entry hazards away. Zekrom is a nice partner as it can handle some threats that Genesect can't do too much against such as Kyogre and Ho-Oh and can form a VoltTurn core.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: U-turn
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Extreme Speed
move 4: Blaze Kick / Explosion
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Hasty

Moves
========
Genesect can swap Speed for more power by equipping a Choice Band. U-turn now has a lot more power behind it, severely denting any Pokemon that do not resist it and creating momentum for Genesect's team. Iron Head hits like a truck and will easily 2HKO if not OHKO any Fairy-type or Rock-type while also being able to 2HKO max HP Arceus formes with a Download boost. Extreme Speed has priority and allows Genesect to revenge kill faster threats such as Mewtwo, Deoxys, and Mega Blaziken. Blaze Kick destroys any Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, or Forretress that might try to take a U-turn or Iron Head. A Choice Band-boosted Explosion is a literal nuke with a Download boost behind it, able to OHKO even the bulkiest of Arceus formes. Ice Beam is an alternative option to hit bulky Ground-types such as Groudon, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon harder.

Set Details
========
Max out Attack and Speed for maximum power and to take advantage of Genesect's nice Speed tier. Put the rest of the EVs in Defense, and use a Hasty nature to keep the set legal; Blaze Kick and Extreme Speed are event moves.

Usage Tips
========
Most opponents will expect a Choice Scarf set, so this set acts very well by still forcing switches in the same way but with more power behind it. As such, take care not to reveal what item Genesect is holding by staying in on naturally faster Pokemon that you can't scare out very well such as Palkia, otherwise Mewtwo and other very fast threats will be more inclined to stay in and take Genesect out if it's revealed that it is not holding a Choice Scarf.

Team Options
========
This set really appreciates entry hazards to punish switches. Sticky Web works very well with this set as Genesect can now outspeed threats that are faster than it, making Shuckle a good teammate. For other entry hazard setters, good Stealth Rock users include Landorus-T, Groudon, and Dialga, while good Spikes users include Deoxys and Klefki. Zekrom also is effective here, and can take on the role of the Choice Scarf user, making a VoltTurn core.

Other Options
########
A Choice Scarf set consisting of special moves such as Bug Buzz and Flamethrower is an alternative, but the addition of Fairy-types make this set very easy to play around. Shift Gear is a fine idea for a boosting move, though it is quite redundant as Download can gain the Attack boost and a Choice Scarf can gain the Speed Genesect seeks, as well as the fact that Genesect isn't very powerful as a standalone attacker. Other coverage options such as Thunder can be a good idea for some teams, but Thunder lacks utility in general.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ho-Oh**: With the help of Regenerator, Ho-Oh can switch into Genesect easily if Stealth Rock is not set up. Genesect can't do much to Ho-Oh outside of Explosion.

**Heatran**: Heatran ultimately walls Genesect as none of its attacks can really scratch Heatran, while Heatran easily OHKOes it with Lava Plume.

**Fire-types**: Fire Arceus, Reshiram, and Blaziken are not really bothered by Iron Head or U-turn and easily OHKO with their Fire-type moves.

**Steel-types**: Steel Arceus, Dialga, and Aegislash can switch into most of Genesect's attacks with ease and whittle Genesect down or set up. Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Forretress can also do this but must be very wary of Genesect's Fire-type coverage.

**Status Moves**: Moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave can catch Genesect off-guard and leave it effectively useless.

**Bulky Attackers**: Pokemon that can take most of Genesect's attacks and OHKO back are large threats, but it can be difficult to back Genesect into a corner due to U-turn. Kyogre, Zekrom, and Groudon are good examples of Pokemon that can do this.

**Entry Hazards**: Entry hazards can limit Genesect's switching room and make it difficult for Genesect to zip around teams. Sticky Web also removes Genesect's Speed advantage.
