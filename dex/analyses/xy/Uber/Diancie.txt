Overview
########

Upon Mega Evolving, Diancie gains an incredibly useful new ability, Magic Bounce. Diancie is also graced with powerful base 160 offensive stats coupled with a fast 110 base Speed. These stats when combined with its Rock / Fairy typing allow Mega Diancie to check common threats such as Darkrai, Yveltal, Ho-Oh, Latias, and Lugia. Regular Diancie is no slouch either; although its offenses are low, its bulk can be quite useful and doesn't forfeit a Mega slot. Despite having some key resistances, Diancie is hampered by a quadruple weakness to Steel and a weakness to common Ground-type moves. While Diancie does have access to useful support moves such as Heal Bell, Stealth Rock, and Trick Room, its lack of instant recovery is quite disappointing. Diancie's movepool on the offensive side is somewhat similar, as it can make use of two excellent STAB moves and Earth Power but does not have many other tricks. Both Diancie and Mega Diancie are stuck with a low base 50 HP, and Mega Evolving Diancie proves quite difficult, as it keeps its low Speed for that turn while becoming less bulky.



Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Moonblast
move 2: Diamond Storm
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Protect / Heal Bell / Calm Mind
ability: Magic Bounce
item: Diancite
evs: 80 Atk / 252 SpA / 176 Spe
nature: Timid / Naive


Moves
========

Moonblast is Diancie's primary option for a STAB attack, as it allows Diancie to check Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon. Meanwhile, Diamond Storm has use to hit threats such as Ho-Oh, Lugia, and Blissey; it also prevents Diancie from being trapped and becoming setup bait to the rare Gothitelle. Earth Power is typically Diancie's best option for a coverage move, as it hits common switch-ins such as Primal Groudon and Steel-types. In the final slot, Diancie has several options. Protect ensures Diancie's Mega Evolution turn and has other utility such as scouting. Heal Bell, on the other hand, allows Diancie to give emergency cleric support for a more offensive team. Lastly, Calm Mind can be used to turn Diancie into a stallbreaker that doesn't mind Ho-Oh or Lugia, two common threats to Calm Mind users. Magic Bounce further supports Diancie's efforts to use Calm Mind, as it provides an immunity to Toxic and phazing moves, thus allowing Calm Mind Diancie to pressure stall teams hard if opposing Primal Groudon and Kyogre have been eliminated.

Hidden Power Fire is an alternate coverage move for Diancie that hits common switch-ins such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Genesect much harder than Earth Power. In the final slot, Stealth Rock is an option if it is too detrimental to fit anywhere else on your team, and Mega Diancie has the benefit of being immune to Taunt; however Mega Diancie's lack of bulk compared to alternative non-suicide entry hazard setters is disappointing.


Set Details
========

176 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Mega Diancie to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon. A Timid nature is used because the Attack drop does not significantly impact any targets of Diamond Storm, although Naive is an option to have sightly more physical power at the cost of some special bulk. Significant Special Attack investment keeps this set offensive and OHKOes threats such as Rayquaza and Mega Salamence. The remaining EVs go into Attack to make Diamond Storm hit slightly harder. If Hidden Power Fire is being used, run at least 180 Speed EVs with a Timid nature due to the IV drop. Max Speed is an option when Diancie is not using Hidden Power Fire to Speed tie with opposing base 110 Speed Pokemon.


Usage Tips
========

The Mega Evolution turn is very important, especially when Diancie is not using Protect. Diancie has more bulk when not Mega Evolved, so when it needs to survive a certain attack, sometimes the right choice is to not Mega Evolve. When using Protect, the danger of giving your opponent a free setup turn is present, although you don't have to worry about entry hazard stacking. Mega Evolving early is important for a Magic Bounce user, as Mega Diancie will want to be sent in to Magic Bounce certain attacks. Because the intended targets of Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire can punish Mega Diancie hard, you'll often have to rely on predictions to hit them as they come in. Although Mega Diancie isn't a glass cannon, it's far from indestructible; because it lacks recovery, instant or passive, there are only so many times this set can switch into even resisted attacks. Even though Mega Diancie has Magic Bounce, it doesn't necessarily lead well against all common leads; Primal Groudon and Dialga can be very dangerous due to their powerful type advantages, as can Deoxys-A with Psycho Boost.


Team Options
========

Ho-Oh is an excellent partner for offensive Mega Diancie, as it threatens Steel-types and appreciates the anti-entry hazard support provided by Magic Bounce. Latias and Latios are good choices as well because they can fit on offensively oriented teams and provide a Ground immunity, while in return Diancie checks Dark-types and can offer cleric support. Giratina-O also provides a Ground immunity and appreciates Diancie's checking of common Dark-types. Palkia can greatly benefit Diancie, as it is an excellent Kyogre check and can power through several common Steel-types. Primal Groudon also checks Kyogre and destroys Steel-types, which is highly useful for Diancie. Arceus-Ghost checks Steel-types quite well with Judgment and Will-O-Wisp, while Arceus-Ghost benefits from Diancie's checking of Darkrai and Yveltal. Diancie struggles with Calm Mind Arceus formes that aren't Ground- or Dark-type, and although Dialga stacks a weakness to the Ground-type, it is an effective check to Calm Mind Arceus and several Steel-types.



Mega Utility
########
name: Mega Utility
move 1: Protect
move 2: Diamond Storm
move 3: Moonblast / Toxic
move 4: Heal Bell
item: Diancite
ability: Magic Bounce
evs: 248 HP / 124 Def / 136 Spe
nature: Bold / Impish


Moves
========

Protect is invaluable for ensuring a safe Mega Evolution turn and has general utility for scouting moves and stalling. Diamond Storm prevents this set from being bait for specially defensive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Blissey, and Gothitelle. Moonblast allows Diancie to hit the Dark- and Dragon-types that it is intended to check, such as Darkrai and Rayquaza, respectively. Although Steel-types are immune to Toxic and tend to switch into Diancie, it is still a great move, as it can nail Arceus formes and Primal Groudon. Heal Bell provides cleric support to teammates and is especially useful because Mega Diancie is immune to Taunt. Although Stealth Rock is not slashed, Diancie can function as a setter if there is no room for the move on another teammate.


Set Details
========

248 HP EVs are used to make this set more bulky, but Mega Diancie is still hampered to an extent because of its low base HP along with its lack of instant recovery. 136 Speed EVs are just enough to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza. 124 Defense EVs with a Defense-boosting nature allow Mega Diancie to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Ho-Oh Brave Bird, survive Earthquake from max Attack Rayquaza, survive +1 Mega Salamence Earthquake, and tank other physical attacks. A Bold nature is used because the Attack drop does not significantly impact any targets of Diamond Storm. Impish is the better option if Diancie is not using Moonblast, as it will only have a physical move. Alternatively, a spread of 248 HP / 164 Def / 96 Spe with a Bold nature beats base 90 Speed Pokemon and gains a bit of physical bulk. Max Defense is also an option to guarantee that Mega Diancie is 3HKOed by Choice Band Ho-Oh Brave Bird after Stealth Rock and survives +1 Mega Salamence Earthquake after Stealth Rock; the loss of Speed isn't that great of an issue, as Diancie loses to common base 90 Speed Pokemon anyway.


Usage Tips
========

Although Protect ensures Diancie's safe Mega Evolution, it can potentially give the opposing Pokemon a free setup turn. It is also important to note that Diancie has better bulk before Mega Evolution, so don't Mega Evolve on an attack that would knock out Mega Diancie but that Diancie would survive. Even though Diamond Storm gives frequent Defense boosts, don't allow this to trick you into thinking that Mega Diancie can comfortably tank a Bullet Punch or Earthquake; it is usually better to switch into an appropriate counter. Mega Diancie is good at forcing switches, and it is during these times that it is best to use Heal Bell.


Team Options
========

Latias and Latios are great partners for this set despite creating a stacked weakness to Steel-types. Both greatly appreciate the cleric support and the check to Dark-types that Mega Diancie provides, and in return they check both Primal Groudon and Kyogre. Ho-Oh appreciates the anti-entry hazard support provided by Mega Diancie and can annihilate common Steel-types. Other Pokemon immune to Ground-type attacks, such as Giratina-O, are also good teammates for Mega Diancie and in return are provided cleric support. Arceus-Ghost is greatly threatened by Yveltal, Darkrai, and status, all of which can be checked by Diancie while Arceus-Ghost can check Steel-types. Due to its lack of instant recovery, Wish support for Mega Diancie is highly appreciated when using this set on more defensive teams. Lugia's common checks, such as Stealth Rock, Toxic, Taunt, and Dark-types, can all be effectively combated with Diancie, while Diancie appreciates Lugia's ability to check Primal Groudon. Primal Groudon serves as a good check to Kyogre and the Steel-types that can threaten Diancie. Due to Mewtwo's dislike for status and Yveltal, Diancie naturally pairs well with it. Lastly, Palkia and Dialga can serve as Kyogre and Calm Mind Arceus checks.



Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Diamond Storm
move 3: Heal Bell / Protect
move 4: Toxic / Heal Bell
item: Leftovers
ability: Clear Body
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Impish


Moves
========

Stealth Rock is a fantastic choice on a Pokemon that deters common Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Diamond Storm is not only a strong choice for a STAB attack, but it also smashes Ho-Oh and the Defense boosts can be quite handy. Heal Bell not only allows Diancie to remove status from itself but also provides further support for teammates. Protect is still quite useful on normal Diancie, as it can be used to scout threats, stall for Toxic damage, and gain added Leftovers recovery. In the final slot, Toxic gives Diancie a way to punish Defog Arceus and Latias and stall out other defensive threats. Although it is not slashed, Moonblast is an option that deals about 15% more damage to Mega Salamence than Diamond Storm does and can hit Palkia switch-ins.


Set Details
========

248 HP investment is used to offset Diancie's pathetic base 50 HP. Max Defense investment helps Diancie tank physical attacks from Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, and Mega Salamence. All of the remaining EVs go into Special Defense to help combat Pokemon such as Yveltal. Leftovers is used as a held item to give Diancie some passive recovery, as it lacks access to an instant recovery move.


Usage Tips
========

Because Leftovers is Diancie's only recovery, it can be worn down by switching in many times. Although it can be difficult, try to keep Diancie with enough health remaining that it is able to still check what it needs to; this often means playing less aggressively. Heal Bell is a great move to remove status from both Dianice and teammates; however, it does have limited PP and should not be wasted. When battling more defensive teams, be very aware of how much PP you have remaining for Heal Bell. Although you can use Toxic against Arceus formes and Primal Groudon that may come in, you can't use Toxic on Steel-types, so the better option in these cases is to double switch. Even though it is often just for a turn, Diancie can capitalize on bluffing the possibility of being Mega Diancie.


Team Options
========

Arceus-Ghost is an excellent teammate that easily fits on defensively oriented teams. Arceus-Ghost appreciates Diancie's cleric support and checking of Yveltal and Ho-Oh, while in return it can check many Steel- and Ground-types. Latias also appreciates cleric support and the check to Yveltal and can act as a check to Primal Groudon and Kyogre. Steel-types, although they are weak to Ground-type moves, appreciate the check to Ho-Oh and are generally great assets for defensive teams due to their numerous resistances. Primal Groudon can also check Kyogre, and even defensive variants have no trouble blasting through Steel-types that pose a danger to Diancie. Palkia and Dialga both check Kyogre and Calm Mind Arceus in addition to several Steel-types.



Trick Room
########
name: Trick Room
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Trick Room
move 3: Diamond Storm
move 4: Explosion
item: Life Orb
ability: Clear Body
evs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Def
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Brave


Moves
========

Diancie is a Trick Room setter that is not at all afraid of Ho-Oh or Yveltal, allowing it to provide effective support to its team. Stealth Rock is great on this set as well, as Diancie repels Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Diamond Storm is this set's best option for a STAB attack, as it deals significant damage to Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, offensive Yveltal, and Mega Salamence. Explosion can be a great last ditch move, and when using in conjunction with Trick Room, Diancie can explode on support Arceus formes and prevent Defog.


Set Details
========

Because this set needs to be able to take a few hits as setup occurs, 248 HP EVs are used to offset Diancie's low base HP. Diancie already has very high defenses, so 252 Attack EVs with a Brave nature are used to allow Diamond Storm and Explosion to hit their intended targets as hard as possible. A Life Orb further boosts the power of Dianice's attacks at the cost of some HP; however, this drawback is completely irrelevant when using Explosion. A Speed-reducing nature in addition to 0 Speed IVs is used to minimize Diancie's Speed, allowing it to move first once Trick Room has been set.


Usage Tips
========

This set is underutilized, so its unexpectedness should be capitalized upon. Diancie can often set Trick Room on the switch, but unfortunately, Steel-types are highly threatening regardless of if Diancie moves first or not. Deciding when to, if at all, use Explosion can be tricky, particularly once the set is revealed, so be wary of Protect use and Ghost-types. This set can switch into Ho-Oh if necessary, but because its moves are physical, Diancie does not want to risk being burned from Sacred Fire.


Team Options
========

The best teammates for this set are Pokemon that can effectively abuse Trick Room. Typically, the Pokemon are quite powerful and bulky, but are hampered by their Speed stat. Some examples of potential Trick Room abusers include Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Mega Mawile, and Ho-Oh. Victini is an interesting partner that can also function as a setter of Trick Room and appreciates Diancie's check to Yveltal. Dialga and Palkia are notorious setters and abusers of Trick Room and can dually function as checks to Kyogre. Arceus-Ghost isn't necessarily an abuser of Trick Room, although it has excellent synergy with Diancie due to its ability to check Steel-types while Diancie checks Dark-types. Ground immunities in general are handy for this set due to the prevalence of Primal Ground and Ground-type coverage.



Other Options
########

A defensive RestTalk set similar to RestTalk + Aromatherapy Xerneas is possible, as Dianice has access to Rest, Sleep Talk, and Heal Bell, but it is usually outclassed by Xerneas. Diancie does have access to dual screens, but with the prevalence of Defog, they are typically not a good choice. Magnet Rise is an interesting option, as several Pokemon can only hit Diancie with Ground-type moves, but it is often situational and prediction-reliant. Lastly, Rock Polish can be using to greatly increase Mega Diancie's Speed on an offensive set, but most common checks still beat it regardless of its Speed.



Checks and Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Although Steel tends to be a poor offensive type, it is highly threatening to Diancie, as it exploits a quadruple weakness. As a result, Steel-types such as Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and Genesect can blast through any Diancie set. Even though the offensive set's coverage options of Earth Power and Hidden Power Fire can deal significant damage to or even knock out predicted switch-ins, Steel-types are still excellent checks to Mega Diancie.

**Arceus-Ground**: Arceus-Ground has become a very popular Arceus forme that can squash all Diancie sets with super effective Earthquake or Judgment. Defensive Diancie sets can, however, Toxic it as it comes in.

**Other Ground-types**: In a similar vein to Arceus-Ground, Ground-types in general are solid checks to every Diancie set. Although Ground-types can deal significant damage to Diancie, most don't like switching into Toxic, and Primal Groudon takes solid damage from Earth Power.

**Kyogre**: Although it has become less common, Kyogre is still a great check to all Diancie sets. Origin Pulse can knock out Diancie, while the most damage Diancie can do in return is not very significant, especially if the set is defensive.

**Choice Scarf Users*: Choice Scarf users have dropped in usage, but they are still significant threats. Choice Scarf Zekrom, for example, can potentially revenge kill the offensive set after prior damage.

**Calm Mind Arceus Formes**: Although Diancie can beat the common Calm Mind Arceus-Dark, other formes can be potentially problematic. Calm Mind Arceus with dual coverage can be slapped with Toxic, although the offensive set does not run this move. Other Calm Mind Arceus formes, such as Arceus-Rock and Arceus-Fairy, can afford to run a move such as Refresh that makes Toxic useless.

**Shaymin-S**: Shaymin-S is both faster than Mega Diancie and able to KO it with Seed Flare, although it does not want to switch into Diamond Storm or even Moonblast due to its low bulk.
