Overview
########

With the release of Soul Dew in ORAS, an item that boosts Latias's Special Attack and Special Defense by 50%, she returns to the forefront of the Ubers tier with both new and old tricks. One of the newer ones is her access to Defog, which provides a team with an excellent non-Arceus Defogger and allows her to function as an effective defensive pivot. Levitate is as useful as ever due to the common use of Ground-type attacks, and further helps to mitigate entry hazard damage. Latias is also quite useful both defensively and offensively, thanks to a great 110 base Speed, strong offenses and defenses, and an ability to check both Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. She is not without flaws, however; although Pursuit has limited distribution it is still a very dangerous threat. Certain Fairy-types can also pose a significant threat, along with common Dark-types such as Darkrai and Yveltal. Latias is also in competition with Latios to an extent, although her comparatively higher bulk gives her a niche even for offensive sets. Another niche she has over her twin is the move Healing Wish, which is an incredibly useful move for offensive teams.


Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Defog
move 2: Roost / Healing Wish
move 3: Psyshock
move 4: Draco Meteor
item: Soul Dew
ability: Levitate
evs: 212 HP / 120 SpA / 176 Spe
nature: Timid


Moves
========

This set revolves around Latias's ability to provide excellent Defog support while serving as a blanket check to several threats. Using Latias as a Defogger also has the advantage of not forfeiting your Arceus to a support set, allowing you to be more flexible when building with Pokemon such as Ho-Oh. For balance and defensive teams, Roost is mandatory as you will need Latias to have staying power. On offensive teams that appreciate emergency Defog support Latias has the option of running Healing Wish as an additional support move. Psyshock is Latias's best option for a Psychic-type STAB move as it bypasses specially bulky Pokemon such as Kyogre and Blissey. Draco Meteor nukes many of the physically bulky Pokemon that Psyshock doesn't, and is Latias's best choice to deter threats such as Primal Groudon, Palkia, and Rayquaza.


Set Details
========

176 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are used to ensure that Latias is faster than Pokemon with base 100 Speed, such as Palkia and Mega Kangaskhan. 120 Special Attack EVs allow Latias to 2HKO offensive Primal Kyogre with Psyshock and 2HKOes Primal Groudon that lack significant Special Defense investment. All other investment for this set goes into HP, allowing Latias to escape the 2HKO from Primal Kyogre's Ice Beam. An alternate spread of 160 HP / 52 Def / 120 SpA / 176 Spe still checks Kyogre but gives up some special bulk to better tank Dragon Claw from Adamant Primal Groudon. 96 Speed EVs and a Timid nature will beat Pokemon with base 90 Speed, while 136 Speed EVs and a Timid nature will beat max Speed Rayquaza. Lastly, max Speed is an option to Speed tie with opposing Latias, Latios, Gengar before Mega Evolution, and Mega Diancie.


Usage Tips
========

This set despises Pursuit, so the best way to help combat this is to double switch into appropriate teammates when you see potential Pursuit users in Team Preview. In addition to Pursuit, this set also dislikes status in general, so use tactics such as sending Gliscor into a Klefki that attempts to Toxic or Thunder Wave Latias. Fairy-types also like to come into Latias, so effective use of Psyshock can punish those obvious switch-ins, especially if they are from offensive teams. Healing Wish should only be used when Latias has less potential use than an injured teammate; it can also effectively give a sweeper two chances to sweep.


Team Options
========

When using Defog Latias on an offensive team, you will want an entry hazard setter that is not a suicide lead such as Groudon or Dialga. This is because offensive teams with suicide leads are focused on keeping entry hazards up for the duration of the match, which is counterproductive when running Defog. For balance and defensive teams, your Arceus is now free to run a stallbreaker set rather than a Defog support set. Ho-Oh in general is an excellent teammate for this Latias set because it threatens a variety of the Pokemon that like to switch into Latias, while Ho-Oh benefits from the anti-hazard support and Latias's ability to check Pokemon such as Kyogre and Primal Groudon. Primal Groudon is also a great partner, as it can usually comfortably switch into the Fairy-types and Steel-types that come into Latias, and can absorb Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Mega Scizor is a good partner for a similar reason and can also come into Toxic, has reliable recovery and thus reduced switching cost, and can threaten opposing Lugia with Toxic; Mega Scizor can also Pursuit trap Shadow Ball Gengar. An offensive or defensive Fairy-type is also a good choice, as Arceus-Dark completely walls this Latias, while Darkrai and Yveltal pose a great threat. Mega Salamence and Yveltal, like Ho-Oh, also greatly appreciate the Defog support Latias provides. An emergency cleric such as Xerneas or Mega Diancie on an offensive team can also be of great utility for Latias, as Toxic is very detrimental to this set, while more defensive clerics such as Blissey or Clefable suffice for balance and stall teams.



Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Roost
move 3: Psyshock
move 4: Draco Meteor
item: Soul Dew
ability: Levitate
evs: 80 HP / 252 SpA / 176 Spe
nature: Timid


Moves
========

Combined with Soul Dew, Calm Mind further boosts Latias's Special Attack and Special Defense to high levels. Roost is mandatory to retain good health as Latias sets up, and makes eliminating her much more difficult. Psyshock creates an excellent combination with Calm Mind as it allows Latias to win Calm Mind wars against certain Pokemon because Psyshock damages based on Defense rather than Special Defense. Draco Meteor is used for its sheer might. Although it might seem counterproductive to have Calm Mind raise Special Attack just to have it decreased by Draco Meteor, Latias's other options for a Dragon-type STAB move are far too underwhelming.


Set Details
========

176 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are used to meet the benchmark of outspeeding base 100 Speed Pokemon. High Special Attack investment is used to help Latias blast through threats and capitalize on Soul Dew + Calm Mind boosts. All other EVs go into HP to help Latias take hits. Max Speed is an option to Speed tie with other base 110 Speed Pokemon.


Usage Tips
========

Keep in mind that even without a Calm Mind boost Latias hits quite hard, so setup is not always necessary before attacking as you can deter common switch-ins with chip damage. Using Calm Mind as your opponent goes into a check can also work as the Calm Mind set can beat some Pokemon such as support and Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost and Arceus-Fairy; Latias is also strong enough to blast through some other checks at +1 if they have taken prior damage. Pursuit, status, and powerful Dark-, Fairy,- and Steel-types are still annoying for this set, so you'll want them eliminated or damaged before setting up or you will be wasting a turn setting up with Calm Mind and then switching.


Team Options
========

Ground-types such as Groudon or Arceus-Ground are typically excellent partners for Calm Mind Latias, as they can threaten Steel-types and absorb Thunder Wave. Both offensive and defensive Fairy-types are also good partners, as this set still gets walled by Calm Mind Arceus-Dark and doesn't like Pokemon similar to Yveltal. Toxic is one of the main threats to this set, so cleric support from Pokemon like Xerneas and Mega Diancie is invaluable. Pokemon that are immune to status altogether or can eliminate status with Refresh or Rest can also be handy to send in. Chople Berry Tyranitar with Low Kick can come into Arceus-Dark quite nicely, do well versus Yveltal, and even Pursuit trap Mega Gengar. A Steel-type of your own can also serve as a check to fast Dragon-types such as Mega Salamence, Latios, and other Latias so that risking a Speed tie isn't necessary. Klefki in particular is one of the better checks to Mega Salamence and Yveltal, and can lay Spikes to help Latias wallbreak later. Even though this set doesn't provide Defog support, Ho-Oh can still be a good partner as it deters common Latias checks. Lastly, Mega Gengar can be used to eliminate defensive Fairy-types, threaten Lugia, and remove some Steel-types that check Latias, such as Dialga.



All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Healing Wish
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Draco Meteor
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Roost
item: Soul Dew
ability: Levitate
evs: 76 HP / 252 SpA / 180 Spe
nature: Timid


Moves
========

Healing Wish in addition to her superior bulk is one of Latias's niches over Latios for an offensive set, allowing for the support of a teammate when she is no longer needed. Psyshock is still Latias's best option for a Psychic-type STAB move, as it pairs well with Draco Meteor and does enough to Geomancy Xerneas that Stealth Rock + Extreme Speed from Arceus can revenge kill it. Draco Meteor is again Latias's primary method of nuking threats and checking offensive Dragon-types such as Palkia and Rayquaza. Hidden Power Fire is a great coverage option for greeting Klefki, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor, which often switch into Latias. Roost is another option for this set as opposed to Hidden Power Fire to give Latias some staying power, although this is still an offensive set.


Set Details
========

180 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Latias to outspeed max Speed base 100s accounting for the IV drop from using Hidden Power Fire. This is an offensive set, 252 Special Attack EVs are used to maximize damage output. The additional EVs go into HP to help Latias take priority and attacks in general better. Max Speed is an option to Speed tie with other max Speed base 110s, but because Hidden Power requires an IV drop in Speed, only use max Speed with Roost.


Usage Tips
========

Despite this set not using a Choice item it tends to be a hit-and-run Pokemon. Pursuit is a big issue; the only thing you can really do is try to double switch out of potential Pursuit trappers seen in Team Preview. When using Hidden Power Fire, this set can beat specially defensive Mega Scizor even if it switches into Psyshock, so attack rather than switch. Predictions with Hidden Power Fire are important because Latias will not want to hit intended targets after they have switched in due to their ability to survive the attack and retaliate back. Use Healing Wish when you have an injured teammate that has more effectiveness against the opponent's team at that time when compared to Latias.


Team Options
========

Primal Groudon pairs well with this Latias set, as it can beat many of its checks and deter others, such as Klefki, Xerneas, and Mega Metagross. Offensive Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Mega Diancie are also good partners for sending into Arceus-Dark, Yveltal, and Darkrai that threaten Latias; they also serve as Dragon immunities and have other utility for offensive teams. Setup sweepers, especially Swords Dance Arceus formes, greatly benefit from Healing Wish support because they can effectively get two chances to sweep. Offensive Pokemon that are immune to certain status effects are still quite helpful, as they allow for switching on offensive teams without being punished with status. Lastly, Calm Mind Primal Kyogre is a great partner for Latias as it can set up on Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Fairy, and appreciates Latias's check to Primal Groudon and Palkia.



Other Options
########

Grass Knot is usable to hit Pokemon like Tyranitar and Primal Groudon without lowering Special Attack, but generally Psyshock and Hidden Power Fire have more utility. Latias also has access to Reflect and Light Screen, the first being quite useful to boost her Defense. Tailwind is another interesting option for offensive support, but it is generally outclassed by Healing Wish. Refresh is great considering how much Latias despises status, but she just doesn't have room for it due to both her STAB types having types immune to them. Toxic can be great to nail Lugia and other bulky Latias checks as they come in, while Thunder Wave can really punish more offensive Latias checks. Magic Coat can be used to deflect status like Toxic, along with other moves like Taunt, but again there really isn't room and it's a prediction-reliant move.


Checks & Counters
########

**Pursuit**: Tyranitar, Aegislash, and Mega Scizor are the most common Pursuit users. Pursuit will severely damage or even knock out Latias if she switches on the turn the move is used, and if she doesn't switch, there is the risk of taking attacks from these threatening Pokemon. The all-out attacker set with Hidden Power Fire can, however, beat Mega Scizor.

**Dark-types**: Arceus-Dark is the most threatening Dark-type, as it can wall every Latias set and set up in Latias's face. Yveltal is also quite threatening due to Sucker Punch and its powerful Dark Pulse. Darkrai is faster than Latias and can threaten her with Dark Void or Dark Pulse, although it won't be switching into a Draco Meteor.

**Lugia**: Lugia can take any of Latias's attacks, Whirlwind Calm Mind sets, and threaten with Toxic. Other than running a move like Toxic, there is little Latias can do to Lugia.

**Steel-types**: Mega Metagross is a great check to Latias, resisting both of her STAB types and being able to threaten her with powerful physical moves. Ferrothorn doesn't like Hidden Power Fire but can Toxic or Leech Seed Latias and hit hard with Gyro Ball. Skarmory and Bronzong also resist both of Latias's STAB types and can Toxic stall her out. Specially defensive Dialga can also threaten Latias with Toxic and doesn't take significant damage from Draco Meteor.

**Fairy-types**: Klefki is immune to Draco Meteor, resists Psyshock, and can hit Latias back with Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Play Rough. Defensive Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy can avoid the 2HKO from Psyshock, but they can be beaten by the Calm Mind Latias set. Mega Diancie can threaten Latias as well, but it won't like switching into Psyshock or a Calm Mind.

**Arceus-Ghost**: Calm Mind Latias can beat support and Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost, but the other sets are quite afraid of this spooky Pokemon. Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost can also revenge kill Calm Mind Latias regardless of Calm Mind boosts.

**Dark- and Ghost-type Priority**: Although Latias is quite bulky, she still doesn't like having to take Sucker Punches from Mega Kangaskhan or Shadow Sneaks from Giratina-O when she is damaged.
