Overview
########

Upon Mega Evolving, Kangaskhan becomes a strong offensive threat that is notorious for being a destroyer of offensive teams. Due to Parental Bond, her Attack is effectively increased by fifty precent. Her Speed is also quite good, outspeeding relevant Pokemon with base 90, 95, and 99 Speed. With access to Fake Out and Sucker Punch, she becomes an excellent user of priority attacks, which further increases her ability to anti-lead; however, at times she has an over-reliance on them. Normal typing is like a double-edged sword that has only a single weakness to the Fighting-type and a handy immunity to the Ghost-type, but grants no resistances. Although Mega Kangaskhan has a wide movepool, she isn't able to run all the coverage and utility she wants on a single set. Unfortunately, Ghost-types along with burns bring an effective stop to Mega Kangaskhan, and in general she can struggle against defensive teams due to her lack of immediate power. Parental Bond has one disadvantage in regards to Rocky Helmet and Iron Barbs, as they deal twice as much damage as they would to a typical contact attacker. She also takes damage from every type of entry hazard, which significantly reduces her longevity, especially considering that she frequently comes into battle in order to abuse Fake Out. Lastly, Mega Kangaskhan is somewhat underwhelming for a Mega Pokemon.

Moves
========

Fake Out has incredible utility, allowing Mega Kangaskhan to anti-lead, revenge kill, Mega Evolve for free, and whittle down offensive threats; when combined with her STAB and Parental Bond, the move deals respectable damage. Earthquake is Mega Kangaskhan's primary coverage move, which hits the Steel- and Rock-types that resist her STAB attacks. Ghost-types are immune to Mega Kangaskhan's STAB attack, so a Dark-type coverage move is warranted; Sucker Punch furthers her access to priority and has a high Base Power. Crunch deals just as much as damage as Sucker Punch, however it can hit Pokemon on the switch and those that use support moves; it also has an increased opportunity to lower the foe's Defense due to Parental Bond. Return is Mega Kangaskhan's primary STAB attack, as it has perfect accuracy and a Base Power of 102. Double-Edge can be used, as it hits harder than Return, but with the cost of further placing Mega Kangaskhan on a timer through recoil damage. Body Slam is also an alternative STAB move for Mega Kangaskhan, which has a 51% paralysis rate due to Parental Bond, although the power drop is noticeable. Lastly, Low Kick is a coverage option that can be run over Earthquake, which still smashes Steel- and Rock-types while also hitting Normal-types.


Set Details
========

252 Attack EVs are used to help Mega Kangaskhan maximize damage output from her priority moves. 252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature are used so that Mega Kangaskhan can outspeed relevant threats such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Dialga, Rayquaza, Yveltal, and Xerneas. An Adamant nature can be used to allow Mega Kangaskhan to hit slightly harder at the cost of forfeiting the guarantee to outspeed the previously listed Pokemon.


Usage Tips
========

Kangaskhan's ability before Mega Evolution is Scrappy, which allows for Normal-type moves to hit Ghost-types. You can intentionally choose not to Mega Evolve if it is advantageous to Fake Out a Ghost-type or use Return if you predict a Ghost-type coming in. When in a scenario with a setup sweeper, Mega Kangaskhan can use Fake Out, then switch out and continually Fake Out until the opposing threat is knocked out. Mega Kangaskhan typically leads well and should be your go-to when anti-leading suicide entry hazard leads that often rely on a Focus Sash. Kangaskhan is quite predictable, however, and draws out Ghost-types immune to Fake Out or physically bulky Pokemon holding a Rocky Helmet or with the ability Iron Barbs. In these situations, Mega Kangaskhan can either smash them with appropriate coverage as they come in or switch into a better matchup, such as sending in Yveltal when an opponent's Ghost Arceus switch is obvious. Try to keep Mega Kangaskhan alive so long as there is an opposing Pokemon that can be easily picked off with priority, such as Deoxys-A or something significantly damaged. An immunity to Ghost should not be overlooked, as it completely prevents the foe from using moves such as Shadow Force. Because Mega Kangaskhan lacks recovery on this set, passive or instant, and has useful utility throughout a match, she shouldn't be switching directly into attacks very often; rather it is better to get her in for free either after something is knocked out or via a double switch.


Team Options
========

Dark-type Pokemon are obvious teammate choices for Mega Kangaskhan due to her inability to break through most Ghost-types. Pokemon such as Yveltal, Dark Arceus, and Darkrai can smash Ghost Arceus and Giratina-O, which tend to switch into Fake Out. Ghost Arceus itself is a great partner and is able to threaten common Steel-types with Will-O-Wisp and neutral Judgment; it is also able to beat Giratina-O and Gengar. Ghost-types in general are a great asset due to their immunity to Fighting, while in return Mega Kangaskhan provides an immunity to Ghost. Reliable anti-entry hazard support can be handy when using Mega Kangaskhan because she takes damage from all types of entry hazards. Both Giratina-O and Ghost Arceus can make good use of Defog, as can Latias and Latios; all of these Pokemon can additionally check some common threats to Mega Kangaskhan, such as Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Blaziken. Setters of Toxic Spikes are an interesting partner choice because, when combined with the chip damage from Fake Out, the passive damage caused by the poison can add up quickly while the foe cannot even move. Primal Groudon can be used to blast through physically bulky Pokemon with Lava Plume and can effortlessly absorb burns intended for Mega Kangaskhan. Ho-Oh can also absorb Will-O-Wisp and threatens some of Mega Kangaskhan's checks such as Ghost Arceus and Ferrothorn. Kyogre can be used to threaten physically bulky Pokemon in general such as Ghost Arceus, Mega Sableye, Gliscor, Mega Scizor, and Landorus-T with its massive Special Attack and rain-boosed STAB attacks. Xerneas can deal significant damage to every relevant Fighting-type and OHKO physically defensive Yveltal and Mega Sableye, which also hamper Mega Kangaskhan. Lastly, Mewtwo can be used to pressure Ghost Arceus and its varied special movepool can get around a wide variety of typical Mega Kangaskhan checks.



Other Options
########

With access to Wish and Seismic Toss, Mega Kangaskhan can run a more defensively oriented set that works better on more passive teams, although her reliance on a two-turn healing move, lack of Leftovers, and use of a Mega Slot usually make this not a primary choice for defensive teams. Power-Up Punch is an option to grant Mega Kangaskhan some additional power and can help against defensive teams; however, Earthquake and Dark-type coverage moves are usually better options. Fire Punch can be used to nail Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn along with the uncommon Skarmory and Bronzong, while Ice Punch can hit Mega Salamence and Landorus-T. Drain Punch is a decent option that still hits Rock- and Steel-types in addition to granting Mega Kangaskhan some recovery; however, the lower Base Power of the move makes other coverage options more appealing. Circle Throw gives Mega Kangaskhan the utility to phaze threats, while Substitute can block status coming from slower threats or Pokemon that switch in as it is set up. Toxic is an interesting option to punish some typical switch-ins such as Ghost Arceus and Lugia, although if you predict these to come in you are often better off double switching anyway. Headbutt's flinch rate can be abused with Fake Out, as can the accuracy drops of Mud Slap, although these moves are quite weak and luck-dependent. Lastly, Icy Wind can be used to lower a target's Speed by two stages, while Crush Claw abuses its high chance to lower the foe's Defense with Parental Bond.



Checks & Counters
########

**Ghost-types**: Ghost Arceus, Giratina, and Sableye can all come into Mega Kangaskhan's STAB attacks for free and neuter her with a burn from Will-O-Wisp. While Crunch can threaten them, it is not enough to outright beat these threats when they are at full health.

**Fighting-types**: Mega Blaziken, Mega Mewtwo X, Fighting Arceus, and Terrakion can all win one-on-one against Kangaskhan due to their strong super effective attacks. Mega Blaziken and Terrakion cannot afford to switch into Mega Kangaskhan's Earthquake, however.

**Ferrothorn**: With its resistance to Normal-type moves, high Defense, and Iron Barbs, Mega Kangaskhan does not want to use contact moves against Ferrothorn. It can also stall out Mega Kangaskhan with moves such as Leech Seed and Toxic.

**Physically Bulky Pokemon**: Pokemon such as Yveltal, Gliscor, Scizor, Lugia, Groudon, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Bronzong have enough physical bulk to either stall out Mega Kangaskhan completely or retaliate hard. While it is uncommon, these Pokemon can also hold a Rocky Helmet to further annoy Mega Kangaskhan.

**Burns**: Being burned severely reduces Mega Kangaskhan's offensive presence and deals passive damage every turn. Burns typically originate from the moves Will-O-Wisp and Scald, so keep Mega Kangaskhan away from these.
