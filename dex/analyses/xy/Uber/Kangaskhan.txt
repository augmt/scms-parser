Overview
########

Kangaskhan was blessed with a Mega Evolution this generation that has one of the best abilities in the game: Parental Bond. In fact, Parental Bond was so strong that it was the reason Kangaskhanite got banished to Ubers! Thanks to Parental Bond, Mega Kangaskhan effectively has a base 213 Attack stat. Its solid bulk allows it to take some hits, and it is also decently fast after Mega Evolving, reaching base 100 Speed; this allows it to outspeed the crowded base 90 to base 99 Speed tier. Mega Kangaskhan has access to priority in Sucker Punch and STAB Fake Out, which in conjunction with Parental Bond makes it a great revenge killer. Another large plus of Mega Kangaskhan is its ability to break Focus Sashes and Substitutes, thanks to Parental Bond.

However, Kangaskhan is very prone to being burned, which cripples it a lot. It also has to compete for a Mega slot with the likes of Mega Blaziken, Mega Gengar, and Mega Mewtwo, all phenomenal Pokemon. Faster offensive Pokemon such as Mega Blaziken and Mega Mewtwo X also spell doom for Kangaskhan. Its coverage is great, but it suffers from a severe case of four-moveslot syndrome. Its lack of resistances also brings no defensive synergy to a team and makes it a bit difficult for Kangaskhan to switch in often. Overall, Mega Kangaskhan has a few flaws, but it's still a great choice for any Ubers team!

########
name: Wrath Of Khan
move 1: Return
move 2: Fake Out
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Earthquake / Crunch
ability: Scrappy 
item: Kangaskhanite
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly / Adamant

Moves
========

Fake Out allows Kangaskhan to revenge kill weakened foes and gives it a free turn to Mega Evolve so it can boost its base Speed to 100. Return is a mandatory STAB move and hits a large portion of the metagame very hard. Sucker Punch used in conjunction with Fake Out can pick off many weakened foes and lets Kangaskhan serve as a revenge killer. Earthquake is a viable option to hit Ferrothorn and avoid Iron Barbs damage while also hitting many other Steel-types such as Klefki, Heatran, and Mega Scizor. Crunch is also a good option as it is more reliable than Sucker Punch and hits Giratina, but it is very redundant with Sucker Punch. Power-Up Punch is usable, as it destroys defensively oriented teams, but Kangaskhan prefers coverage options instead. Finally, Low Kick is a great coverage move that usually strikes for 120 Base Power thanks to most Pokemon in the metagame being heavy.

Set Details
========

The EV spread is simple, maximizing Kangaskhan's power and Speed. 4 Defense EVs ensure that Genesect does not receive an Attack boost from Download. Jolly is the nature of choice for Mega Kangaskhan to outspeed any Pokemon in the base 90 to base 99 Speed tier while also Speed tying with other base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Palkia. Jolly also lets Kangaskhan outspeed and hit Xerneas before it uses Geomancy. Scrappy is the ability of choice before Mega Evolving, as Kangaskhan can then hit Ghost-types on a predicted switch. An Adamant nature increases Kangaskhan's damage output significantly, but it really needs to outspeed everything below base 100 Speed.

Usage Tips
========

Fake Out gives Kangaskhan space to Mega Evolve while also acting as great chip damage to ease OHKOs with Return. This set is supposed to punch holes and act as a revenge killer with Fake Out, while also having the natural bulk to take some hits if necessary. Be wary when using Sucker Punch as it is a bit of a shaky move; for example, Mega Kangaskhan could try to Sucker Punch a Mega Mewtwo Y only to be hit by a Will-O-Wisp, so always scout beforehand if a Pokemon has any surprise status moves. Mega Kangaskhan does not like switching into many attacks because of its lack of resistances, so double switching is advised. Fake Out can potentially give an opponent a free switch with proper prediction, so don't hesitate to use Return if you think they will switch. Never keep Kangaskhan in on anything that could potentially carry Will-O-Wisp, as this will cripple it. Scout for Rocky Helmet Pokemon such as Yveltal; Kangaskhan takes double Rocky Helmet damage because of Parental Bond. Also be wary of Rough Skin and Iron Barbs.

Team Options
========

Yveltal is a great partner as it can handle Lugia and Ghost-types that trouble Mega Kangaskhan. Landorus-T and Groudon beat most Steel-types for Mega Kangaskhan if it lacks Crunch, and Landorus-T in particular can handle Fighting-types that Kangaskhan is weak to. Specially defensive Kyogre can beat most support Arceus, making it a good partner, and it can also absorb burns for Kangaskhan. Deoxys-A and Kangaskhan form a neat core that can be hard to handle with their insane offensive prowess. Cleric support is necessary; some Pokemon that provide cleric support are Xerneas and Sylveon, both of which handle Fighting-types quite nicely as well. Finally, offensive Kyogre and Shaymin-S both beat Arceus-Rock, a Pokemon that can cause issues for Mega Kangaskhan.

Other Options
########

Fire Punch is a notable coverage move to nail Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Scizor. Drain Punch gives a method of reliable healing, but it is outclassed by other coverage moves for the most part. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe gives Mega Kangaskhan a lot more bulk, but the loss in Speed is very unappealing. Toxic is an option to hit support Arceus and other walls that stand in Mega Kangaskhan's way. Body Slam approximately has a 50% chance to paralyze the opponent, which can come in handy, although it is often too weak to be of use. Facade is a cool move, as it takes advantage of burns, but it is fairly weak if Mega Kangaskhan is not burned. Double-Edge is insanely powerful, but it has an expense of very heavy recoil, and Mega Kangaskhan is worn down too quickly when using it. Power-Up Punch can turn Kangaskhan into a massive threat, but it has a hard time setting up and it is too slow to take advantage of these boosts. However, with Sticky Web support, a set that utilizes Power-Up Punch can absolutely steamroll teams. Low Kick is a great coverage move and often has 120 Base Power thanks to the heavy Pokemon that reside in the tier. Finally, a Wish set consisting of Wish / Toxic / Protect / Seismic Toss can be used, as thanks to Parental Bond Seismic Toss hits for 200 damage every time, enabling it to 2HKO a large portion of the metagame, but this set is easily beaten by Mega Gengar.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types are immune to Mega Kangaskhan's STAB move and can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Such Pokemon include Giratina and Sableye, and these Pokemon do not take much damage from any of Mega Kangaskhan's moves bar Crunch.

**Will-O-Wisp**: Will-O-Wisp is Mega Kangaskhan's worst nightmare, as it cuts its Attack in half and renders it useless.

**Physical Walls**: Rock Arceus, Lugia, Dialga, support Arceus, and physically defensive Yveltal are a few walls that cause problems for Mega Kangaskhan. Arceus-Rock and Dialga are very physically bulky and resist nearly everything Mega Kangaskhan throws at them, but both of them fear Earthquake. Lugia can either Toxic stall it or Whirlwind it away, and is only beaten by Power-Up Punch + Crunch. Support Arceus outspeeds Mega Kangaskhan and can cripple it with a burn, but cannot directly switch into Mega Kangaskhan. Physically defensive Yveltal commonly carries Rocky Helmet, which causes Mega Kangaskhan to lose 25% of its health every time it attacks. Finally, Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Bronzong wall any sets lacking Crunch or Fire Punch.

**Fighting-types**: Mega Lucario, Mega Mewtwo X, and Terrakion can all dispose of Mega Kangaskhan with their STAB moves, though none can switch directly into it. Mega Blaziken can use Protect to avoid Fake Out and will outspeed after the Protect thanks to Speed Boost.

**Residual Damage**: Sandstorm, Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and entry hazards cut down Kangaskhan's health fast, and it lacks Leftovers to mitigate this.
