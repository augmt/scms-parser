Overview
########

Arceus-Dark has received a few indirect buffs in the ORAS metagame due to the reintroduction of the Soul Dew for Latias and Latios, an increase in Giratina-O's usage, and the addition of Primal Groudon, a Pokemon that can punish Fairy-type Pokemon, which are the most common checks to Arceus-Dark. However, it does dislike the slight decline of stall in the more offensively-oriented metagame. Like all Arceus formes, Arceus-Dark has access to exceptional 120 / 120 / 120 bulk, which grants it many setup opportunities. Thanks to its typing, it serves as a solid offensive check to many Psychic- and Ghost-type threats in the metagame, such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Latias, Latios, Arceus-Ghost, and Giratina-O. Dark is also a great offensive typing, especially because there is no type immune to it. This allows an effective mono-attacking set to be run, freeing up a slot for Refresh, which allows it to shrug off status and become a menacing stallbreaker. Unfortunately, it still struggles against Fairy-types, which are very common in Ubers, as well as against Fighting-types, though they have been in decline since the introduction of the Fairy-type. Additionally, Dark as a defensive type does not have many useful resistances, so Arceus-Dark faces intense competition from other Arceus formes that run viable support sets. In spite of this, Arceus-Dark is one of the best Calm Mind Arceus formes that can be a fierce stallbreaker and late-game sweeper.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Judgment
move 3: Recover
move 4: Refresh
ability: Multitype
item: Dread Plate
evs: 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Calm Mind allows Arceus-Dark to set up against Pokemon it threatens, such as Latias, Latios, Arceus-Ghost, and Giratina-O, and proceed to break through stall or initiate a late-game sweep. Judgment is Arceus-Dark's primary and only attack, having great neutral coverage for a STAB move while reliably hitting pretty hard after a Calm Mind boost or two. Recover allows it to stay around longer and set up on support Pokemon or weaker offensive threats. Refresh is useful to remove annoying status such as poison, paralysis, or burns, improving Arceus-Dark's impressive stallbreaking capacity. Will-O-Wisp is another option you could use over Refresh if you prefer your Arceus-Dark to check physical threats instead of being a frightening stallbreaker, but Refresh tends to be more useful if a team is adequately prepared for said physical threats.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP investment maximizes Arceus-Dark's mixed bulk, which allows it to set up more easily. Running 176 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allows it to outspeed positive-natured base 110 Speed Pokemon, such as Latias, Latios, and non-Mega Gengar, and KO them with Judgment before they can attack; Gengar in particular threatens Arceus-Dark with Destiny Bond. Other viable Speed investment options include 96 Speed EVs with a Timid nature for outspeeding base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Palkia, non-Mega Salamence, and Kangaskhan, while 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allows Arceus-Dark to Speed tie with at worst other Arceus formes. The remaining EVs go into physical bulk because Ubers is mostly dominated by numerous physical threats.

Usage Tips
========

Use Arceus-Dark's typing and bulk to switch in on some special attackers such as Palkia and neutral support Arceus, as well as Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon that Arceus-Dark can set up on. When doing so, be wary of Mega Mewtwo X and Focus Blast Mega Mewtwo Y; Mega Mewtwo Y's Focus Blast can deal as much as 81% to Arceus-Dark, while Mega Mewtwo X has a solid chance to OHKO it with Low Kick. It is often crucial to scout opposing Mewtwo before switching in, lest you lose a valuable win condition for your team. If Arceus-Dark is not needed to check members of the opposing team, it can be effective to reveal it late-game and sweep when the opposing team has been weakened or lacks checks to Arceus-Dark.

Team Options
========

Reliable switch-ins to Fairy-types, such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, are indispensable partners for Arceus-Dark, as Arceus-Dark tends to give them free switches and is often threatened out by them. Mega Gengar can remove Fairy-types altogether by virtue of Shadow Tag and its typing. Klefki, Scizor, and other Steel-types check Geomancy Xerneas, which is useful if other checks to Fairy-types cannot reliably check this Xerneas variant. Latias and Latios appreciate Pokemon that threaten them such as Arceus-Ghost checked by Arceus-Dark, while they check Fighting-types for it and provide Defog support. Lugia checks Fighting-types and physical attackers in general, which can often revenge kill or do considerable damage to Arceus-Dark. Finally, bulky Fairy-types of your own, especially Xerneas, can check Mega Mewtwo X for Arceus-Dark.

Other Options
########

Arceus-Dark can plausibly run a support set that utilizes its wide range of support moves. It can use Defog against many of the threats that the Calm Mind variant can set up on and check Psychic- and Ghost-types as well as Yveltal to some extent. It should be noted that a support set of Arceus-Dark is not susceptible to Shadow Tag, which gives it a distinct niche over other support Arceus formes; however, it lacks many useful resistances. Sludge Bomb can help Arceus-Dark bypass some of the Fairy-type Pokemon that threaten it. Lastly, Substitute is an useful move that can be used over Refresh, as it blocks status, including Leech Seed, and can aid in setup.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types are the most prevalent and dangerous checks to Arceus-Dark in the metagame. Geomancy Xerneas easily sets up on Arceus-Dark, while Choice Scarf Xerneas can switch in on any move except for Sludge Bomb and begin to spam Moonblast. Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy and Calm Mind Xerneas can also set up on Arceus-Dark. Klefki can use Thunder Wave and 3HKO Arceus-Dark with Play Rough if it gets lucky or use Arceus-Dark as Spikes fodder, although it is prone to being worn down with repeated hits. Bulky Fairies such as Arceus-Fairy, Sylveon, and Clefable do fairly well against Arceus-Dark; however, it should be noted that all three are weak to Sludge Bomb. Clefable is especially notable because its ability Unaware allows it to ignore Arceus-Dark's Calm Mind boosts. Mega Mawile resists Judgment and can do at least 72% to Arceus-Dark with an uninvested Play Rough.

**Fighting-types**: Though they may be less common, Fighting-types are still strong checks that can beat Arceus-Dark. Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Blaziken after a Speed boost both outspeed and have a chance to OHKO Arceus-Dark with Low Kick. Lucario can tank a Judgment, or outspeed 176 Speed Arceus-Dark if it has already Mega Evolved, and OHKO with Close Combat. Arceus-Fighting can also beat Arceus-Dark by virtue of its typing.

**Tyranitar**: Tyranitar is an effective check to Arceus-Dark, as it resists Judgment, has an impressive Special Defense stat that is further boosted by Sandstorm, and can retaliate with Low Kick, which does 40%-47% to Arceus-Dark uninvested, not counting residual damage from the sand. Low Kick also has twice as much PP as Arceus-Dark's Recover, so Tyranitar will easily stall out Arceus-Dark. Tyranitar can also phaze it with Roar.

**Fast Physical Attackers**: Fast physical attackers, especially ones that have high Attack stats or access to super effective coverage moves, can revenge kill or severely dent Arceus-Dark, capitalizing on its unboosted Defense stat. Genesect is a good check to Arceus-Dark despite the fact that it takes significant damage if it switches into Judgment. With a Download-boosted STAB U-turn, Genesect can effectively revenge kill Arceus-Dark, dealing 58%-69%. Zekrom can also do around 50% with Bolt Strike. Life Orb Deoxys-A can hit it with a super effective Low Kick or Superpower for 67%-80%, while Mega Salamence does 51% minimum with Double-Edge.

**Specially Bulky Pokemon**: Pokemon with exceptional special bulk can act as soft checks to Arceus-Dark. Primal Kyogre with investment in bulk can tank Arceus-Dark's Judgments and, while it doesn't do much damage back, can phaze Arceus-Dark. Ho-Oh can tank hits, hit moderately hard with Brave Bird, fish for burns with Sacred Fire, or phaze with Whirlwind, but it is not a particularly reliable check without Whirlwind.
