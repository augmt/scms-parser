Overview
########

With a Dread Plate equipped, Arceus assumes a somber guise and the Dark typing to match. Coupled with excellent all-around base 120 stats, this allows Dark Arceus to function as a bulky setup sweeper that checks top-tier offensive threats like Ghost Arceus and Mega Mewtwo Y. Also, because no typing is immune to Dark-type attacks, Dark Arceus can afford not to run a coverage move alongside its STAB Judgment, opting instead for Refresh to let it shed any status afflictions it is stricken with. With Steel-types no longer resisting Dark-type attacks, this further heightens its effectiveness as both a stallbreaker and late-game sweeper. However, the newly introduced Fairy-types are major impediments to Dark Arceus's success, being able to overwhelm it with their favorable typing. Additionally, Fighting-type powerhouses such as Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Blaziken are more than capable of breaking Dark Arceus with their powerful STAB moves. These factors also inhibit Dark Arceus's effectiveness in a supportive role. In all, Dark Arceus is a Pokemon that requires robust team synergy to perform, but once this is accounted for, it is exceedingly difficult to break.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Judgment
move 3: Recover
move 4: Refresh
item: Dread Plate
evs: 252 HP / 144 SpD / 112 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Calm Mind boosts Dark Arceus's Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage each, which is integral for staging a late-game sweep. Judgment is the obligatory STAB move, achieving neutral or super effective coverage on many important targets such as Mewtwo, Ghost Arceus, Lugia, the Giratina formes, and Scizor. Recover ensures Dark Arceus stays healthy as it stallbreaks with Refresh and/or accrues Calm Mind boosts. In the last slot, it is recommended to use Refresh to shrug off status afflictions from the numerous bulky Pokemon in the tier such as Ferrothorn, Dialga, and various support Arceus formes, all of which can otherwise end Dark Arceus's sweep with a simple Toxic. Refresh also proves very useful in Calm Mind wars with other Arceus using Will-O-Wisp.

Set Details
========

112 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Dark Arceus to outspeed everything up to Jolly Garchomp. Notably, it sets Dark Arceus ahead of positive-natured Palkia and Mega Kangaskhan. 176 Speed EVs can instead be used to allow Dark Arceus to outspeed and dispatch unevolved Mega Gengar with Judgment. 252 EVs are invested in HP to make the best of Arceus's natural bulk, and the remaining 144 EVs are placed in Special Defense to let Dark Arceus switch into Palkia better, as well as to provide some added insurance against Mega Mewtwo Y and Choice Scarf Kyogre as it sets up. Alternatively, the 144 EVs can go in Defense as it goes a long way in helping Dark Arceus stall out Life Orb-boosted physical attacks such as Groudon's Earthquake and Extreme Killer Arceus's Extreme Speed with Recover, and eventually pick them off with Judgment.

Usage Tips
========

Switch Dark Arceus into special attackers like Palkia, Ghost Arceus, and Mega Mewtwo Y, as it can check these threats with its favorable typing while keeping itself in pristine condition with Recover and Refresh. Be cautious of Fighting-type coverage moves these Pokemon might use though, most notably Focus Blast on Mega Mewtwo Y, which takes a hefty 61-72% off Dark Arceus. Focus Blast is also a viable move on Ghost Arceus. Secondly, be prudent with Dark Arceus early- to mid-game. Do not use Calm Mind rashly then. If Dark Arceus's teammates can stand up to the opponent's team in the interim, hold back from revealing it until its checks are removed or sufficiently weakened, where you should then seize the opportunity to orchestrate a late-game sweep. This set invests EVs in bulk rather than offenses and does not pack enough firepower to wallbreak from the get-go. That being said, you should switch Dark Arceus into bulky Pokemon it can eventually overwhelm, such as type-neutral support Arceus formes. Play to its strengths as a stallbreaker that can absorb status for its teammates. Lastly, when facing a Mewtwo that has not Mega Evolved, it is wise to use Dark Arceus's teammates to scout the identity of its Mega Evolution (if any), lest it get butchered by an unwelcome Mega Mewtwo X.

Team Options
========

First and foremost, it is necessary to have a reliable switch-in to bulky Fairy-types like Xerneas, Fairy Arceus, and Sylveon. Ho-Oh is a good teammate that can repeatedly shrug off unboosted Fairy-type attacks while maintaining a significant offensive presence with the threat of its powerful STAB moves. Additionally, having a means of keeping Geomancy Xerneas in check is required; Scizor can pick off weakened ones with Bullet Punch, while specially defensive Kyogre can survive even a boosted Thunder and phaze Xerneas out with Roar. Note that Pokemon like Ho-Oh are excellent checks to bulky Fairy-types, but fail to handle a boosted Geomancy Xerneas. Regardless, the point is to ensure your team can comfortably handle both bulky Fairy-types and Geomancy Xerneas, especially because using Dark Arceus inherently increases your team's vulnerability to Fairy-types. Next, Lugia handles the physical attackers that threaten Dark Arceus and also holds up well against bulky Fairy-types. Physically defensive Xerneas is another good teammate that also provides cleric support with Aromatherapy, while Stalltwo appreciates Dark Arceus's ability to solidly check Ghost Arceus. A good switch-in to Kyogre is needed as unboosted Dark Arceus fares poorly against all variants; for example, it cannot overcome Choice Scarf Kyogre without having attained at least one Calm Mind boost. Specially defensive Palkia is an excellent Kyogre check, and easily the most reliable. Finally, Ground-types like Landorus-T are useful partners to check Zekrom, take a physical hit in a pinch, and reliably set up Stealth Rock, which checks Ho-Oh, otherwise a problematic Pokemon to face.

Other Options
########

Substitute can be used in the last moveslot to shield Dark Arceus from Leech Seed, in addition to status moves and Seismic Toss. Sludge Bomb is another option to consider as it allows Dark Arceus to overcome bothersome Fairy-types once it has attained a Calm Mind boost; its 30% poison rate also proves useful in the aforementioned Calm Mind wars. Still, Dark Arceus will sorely miss the utility of Refresh, as status removal is an invaluable trait for a Calm Mind user. With its extensive movepool, Dark Arceus can opt to use a support-oriented set consisting of moves like Defog, Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, Stone Edge, Roar, and Perish Song, alongside the obligatory Judgment and Recover. However, Dark typing renders this set susceptible to Fairy-types like Xerneas and Fairy-Arceus, which are relatively common in the tier, making it a mediocre support Arceus at best.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: These are very prominent in Ubers. Geomancy Xerneas stands out among them as it can set up on Dark Arceus with abandon. In the same vein, Calm Mind Fairy Arceus and Calm Mind Xerneas are also especially threatening. Choice Scarf Xerneas can switch in on any move bar Sludge Bomb and strike Dark Arceus down with its STAB Fairy Aura-boosted Moonblast. Unaware Clefable ignores any boosts Dark Arceus might have attained. Whimsicott can Encore Dark Arceus into a non-damaging move and proceed to freely use Substitute and Leech Seed. Most bulky Fairy-types such as Fairy Arceus can beat Dark Arceus one-on-one. If luck is on your side, Klefki can annoy Dark Arceus hugely with Prankster Thunder Wave while whittling its HP down with Play Rough, which has a 73% chance to 3HKO. Note that Sylveon is unable to boost its stats alongside Dark Arceus and will eventually get overwhelmed by it. Also, Dark Arceus can opt to use Sludge Bomb as a coverage move, so be wary of that when attempting to check it with Fairy-types.

**Fighting-types**: Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Blaziken can straight-up OHKO Dark Arceus with a STAB Low Kick. Mega Lucario can do the same with STAB Close Combat. Fighting Arceus can beat Dark Arceus one-on-one, but is not a reliable answer if Dark Arceus has used Calm Mind at least once.

**Kyogre**: Specially defensive Kyogre can phaze out the Calm Mind set; Kyogre in general can deal heavy damage to all sets with its rain-boosted STAB moves.

**Tyranitar**: If it is using Low Kick, Tyranitar checks Dark Arceus rather well. With good natural bulk and the 1.5x Special Defense boost it acquires from sandstorm, even a boosted Judgment does pittance to it, while a 0 Attack Low Kick does 43-51% to 252 HP / 0 Def Dark Arceus. Because Low Kick caps out at 32 PP as opposed to Recover's 16, Tyranitar will eventually emerge victorious from the face-off.

**Ho-Oh**: Ho-Oh checks Dark Arceus with its powerful STAB moves coupled with stellar special bulk. Even a +1 Judgment caps at 44% damage against 248 HP / 0 SpD Ho-Oh, meaning that factoring in Sacred Fire's burn chance, Dark Arceus will be too busy keeping itself healthy to do meaningful damage to Ho-Oh. Note that Ho-Oh does not check Dark Arceus with Stealth Rock active, though.

**STAB U-turn**: Scizor can use a slow U-turn to build momentum on Dark Arceus by hitting it and switching into a teammate that can then pick it off. Choice Scarf Genesect can subdue weakened Dark Arceus with a speedy Download-boosted U-turn, while Choice Band versions have a 62.5% chance of outright KOing it.

**Revenge Killers**: Faster threats can come in after Dark Arceus has KOed something and threaten to revenge kill it. Deoxys-A with Low Kick or Superpower is a notable example; a Life Orb-boosted 4 Atk Low Kick/Superpower does a hefty 73-86% to Dark Arceus. Choice Scarf Kyogre and Choice Scarf Zekrom do about 50% to Dark Arceus with Surf and Bolt Strike respectively, while a full-powered Modest Water Spout does 76-90%.
