Overview
########

With the introduction of Primal Groudon to the tier and the return of Latios and Latias, dedicated Kyogre answers are no longer as necessary. This leaves Palkia in a spot where justifying its use on teams becomes rather difficult. However, it does come with some unique advantages; Palkia still remains one of the best Kyogre answers out there, as it is not weak to Pursuit trapping like Latios and Latias are, and it also does not bait in Dark Arceus and Ghost Arceus as much as Latios and Latias do. Palkia's movepool and power also cannot be ignored, as they give Palkia ways to get around many of its checks.

Moves
========

Spacial Rend is a great STAB move for Palkia, offering strong reliable damage in conjunction with Lustrous Orb. Hydro Pump is a STAB move that gives great neutral coverage on most Pokemon in Ubers alongside Spacial Rend, and also receives a boost from Lustrous Orb, although it comes with somewhat low accuracy. Fire Blast offers the best coverage available, allowing Palkia to break past many Steel-types, especially Ferrothorn, which resists both of Palkia's STAB moves. Thunder Wave gives Palkia a way to annoy its usual switch-ins and prevent them from setting up, as Pokemon such as bulky Arceus, Xerneas, Latios, and Latias are all heavily crippled by the loss of their Speed. Dragon Tail is useful for phazing Calm Mind Primal Kyogre, a common set that can beat Palkia in a 1v1 situation, and deterring setup sweepers and general Palkia switch-ins. Draco Meteor is an alternative STAB option over Spacial Rend, offering more power at the cost of lower accuracy and a drop to Special Attack after use; Thunder Wave or Dragon Tail help to deter free setup after Palkia uses Draco Meteor.

Set Details
========

Maximize both Special Attack and Speed to give Palkia the tools to hit as hard and fast as possible, and use a Timid nature to take advantage of its nice base 100 Speed tier. Then put the remaining EVs in HP. Lustrous Orb gives an appreciated 1.2x boost on its STAB moves without any sacrifices.

Usage Tips
========

Palkia can use its resistances to Water-, Steel-, and Fire-type moves to provide switch-in opportunities, but its lack of recovery means caution should be used when switching into moves repeatedly. Fire off STAB attacks whenever possible -- not many Pokemon can switch into a Palkia safely due to the sheer power of boosted Spacial Rends and Hydro Pumps. Fire Blast also limits potential checks to Palkia and should be used to hit Ferrothorn. Be wary of Fairy-type Pokemon such as Xerneas and Fairy Arceus switching in , as they pose an immediate threat to Palkia and can also threaten the rest of its team. Thunder Wave should be used upon predicted switch-ins, as using it to neuter a threat such as a Geomancy Xerneas that is already on the field nearly always results in a sacrificed Palkia. Dragon Tail can be used for similar purposes and brings the utility of phazing a potential threat such as Calm Mind Arceus or a boosted Primal Kyogre. The lack of regular weather in ORAS Ubers means that Palkia will rarely find its moves weakened by weather conditions; use this to your advantage.

Team Options
========

Palkia's biggest worries are Fairy-type Pokemon, so checks to them are essential. Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh are both excellent answers to Fairy-types due to their typing and bulk, so they synergize very well with Palkia. Latias and Latios are also potential threats since they are faster than Palkia and have the ability to deliver a swift OHKO with Draco Meteor, meaning checks to the Eon Twins such as Ghost or Dark Arceus are welcomed. Steel-type Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, Klefki, Aegislash, Ferrothorn, and Jirachi can help to check Fairy-types, Latios, Latias, as well as Blissey and Lugia, making them great teammates. Mega Scizor and Aegislash are especially useful because they can Pursuit trap Lugia, Latios, and Latias, adding to their usefulness on a team utilizing Palkia. With Blissey also being a major nuisance for Palkia, teammates that can set up entry hazards to pressure Blissey, such as Dialga and Ferrothorn, are welcomed. Physical setup sweepers such as Refresh + Roost Mega Salamence and offensive Primal Groudon can also turn Blissey into a liability. Dark-types such as Darkrai, Dark Arceus, Yveltal, and Tyranitar are great for dealing with Lugia, who can usually deal with Palkia's attacks. Mega Gengar can also trap and KO Lugia and potentially Blissey lacking Shed Shell.

Other Options
########

Specially defensive Palkia is a set that has fallen in viability with the introduction of Primal Groudon, which can run a similar set with much more effectiveness, leaving such a set on Palkia outclassed. Choice Scarf and Choice Specs bring the niche of either making Palkia a revenge killer or a powerful wallbreaker respectively, but being locked into a STAB move will give a free turn to either Xerneas or Primal Groudon. Toxic can be used on teams that need a way to passively break Calm Mind Arceus formes, but with the most popular forme (Dark Arceus) being able to fit Refresh on its moveset without much trouble and the sharp decline in Electric Arceus's viability, makes Toxic a sub-par choice. Heal Block is a niche move that allows Palkia to pressure bulky walls with recovery, but Palkia does not have space for it. Thunder can be used to 2HKO Primal Kyogre and do the same to Lugia if Stealth Rock is set up but is a generally niche option. Haban Berry gives Palkia the ability to live most Dragon-type attacks once and possibly get a surprise KO in return; however, some very strong attacks such as Latios's Draco Meteor and Zekrom's Outrage can still OHKO Palkia even with the Berry, so it is an unreliable item choice. Trick Room can work on dedicated teams that need an extra setter and Kyogre check in one, but it should be noted Palkia's Speed tier is awkward to work with, being slower than some Ubers and faster than others.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Fairy-types**: The biggest threats to Palkia are Xerneas, Fairy Arceus, and Mega Diancie, which can use their Dragon immunity to switch in on Palkia and threaten to OHKO it. Palkia can cripple them with Thunder Wave or deal good damage on the switch with Hydro Pump, however.

**Blissey**: Blissey is difficult for Palkia to break through on its own because Blissey is able to to switch into Palkia whenever it likes and recover off any damage while shaking off status with Natural Cure. However, Blissey can easily be taken advantage of by other team members.

**Dialga**: Specially defensive Dialga can avoid the 2HKO from Spacial Rend due to its neutrality to Dragon and great bulk, making it able to switch in and threaten to OHKO Palkia with Draco Meteor.

**Latios and Latias**: Latios and Latias outspeed Palkia and can switch in on either Hydro Pump or Fire Blast and threaten to OHKO with Draco Meteor. They are generally an unreliable switch-in despite this, but they can revenge KO Palkia easily.

**Bulky Arceus Formes**: Maximum HP variants of Arceus can switch into one of Palkia's moves and recover off the damage. Calm Mind variants can eventually beat Palkia 1v1 but Thunder Wave and possible Dragon Tail make it a tough job.

**Lugia**: Palkia can have trouble breaking past Lugia due to its insane special bulk and Multiscale, which allows it to Toxic stall Palkia. Lugia hates status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave, though, meaning Palkia isn't exactly helpless against it.

**Revenge Killers**: While many Pokemon have trouble outright switching into Palkia, a few can revenge kill a weakened one. Pokemon such as Mewtwo, Deoxys-Attack, Choice Scarf Zekrom, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Gengar are some examples.
