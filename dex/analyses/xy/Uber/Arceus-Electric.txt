Overview
########

Rising high above the Earth, the Supreme Creator emerges onto the battlefield, this time wielding the power of the mighty electron. Dare not incur His wrath, as a Judgment coming off of a 508 Special Attack after a Calm Mind boost is not something one should mess with. With a new metagame dominated by new threats, the God of Lightning is able to check many of them, including Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Kyogre. Not even paralysis can stop Him from bringing His electrifying justice. However, with the loss of permanent weather, He cannot sling around Thunder like He used to. Also, with lackluster defensive typing, He cannot easily switch into many attacks. Nevertheless, Electric Arceus is still a big threat, and should always be prepared for when building a team.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Judgment / Thunderbolt
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Recover
item: Zap Plate
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Calm Mind Electric Arceus is a powerful force that must not be underestimated, as after a Calm Mind boost Electric Arceus puts a major dent into any Pokemon without a resistance to Electric-type moves. Judgment is Electric Arceus's preferred STAB move, as it has a solid 100 Base Power. When boosted by STAB, Zap Plate, and possible Calm Mind boosts, Judgment can rip through many Pokemon in the tier. Thunderbolt is another option, as it has eight additional PP and a 10% chance to paralyze its target. However, compared to Judgment, Thunderbolt has ten less Base Power this generation, and this difference is quite noticeable:

+1 252 SpA Zap Plate Judgment vs. 252/4 Kyogre: (102.4 - 120.7%) — guaranteed OHKO
+1 252 SpA Zap Plate Thunderbolt vs. 252/4 Kyogre: (92 - 108.9%) — 56.3% chance to OHKO

Ice Beam provides BoltBeam coverage, which is resisted by very few Pokemon in Ubers. Recover is in the final moveslot so that Electric Arceus can prolong His lifespan, to assist in setup or allow Him to maintain a sweep. Substitute can be used instead of Recover to block status conditions like toxic poison and burn, but He loses out on much-needed recovery.

Set Details
========

The given EVs maximize Electric Arceus's power and Speed and allow Him to 2HKO Groudon with Ice Beam. A Timid nature is recommended, as it allows Electric Arceus to Speed tie with other max Speed Arceus types. If better bulk and a reliable switch-in to Palkia is preferred, Electric Arceus can opt for a spread of 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe. For both power and bulk, 160 EVs can be siphoned from Speed and deposited into HP, as 96 Speed EVs are enough for Electric Arceus to outspeed fully invested base 100s.

Usage Tips
========

This set has a seemingly simple strategy (set up and sweep), but there are a few guidelines to follow in order to effectively utilize Electric Arceus. It's best to start by attacking directly with Electric Arceus, and only use Calm Mind if the opponent's Pokemon is weakened and unable to KO Electric Arceus before He does the same. For example, when facing Groudon, premature boosting is futile as one Earthquake can be all it takes to KO Electric Arceus, so it's best to throw out Ice Beam. Recover should only be used when needed, or when predicting a switch against something like Palkia.

Team Options
========

Electric Arceus has a singular weakness to Ground-type moves, so Pokemon that can take advantage of this, such as Kyogre and Yveltal, along with checks to Ground-types, such as Landorus-T and Giratina-O, are useful teammates. Mixed Rayquaza is a good partner too, as it is immune to Ground-type attacks and can handle many of Electric Arceus's common checks. Lastly, Mega Gengar is useful for trapping and eliminating many of Electric Arceus's checks and counters, most notably Chansey, Blissey, and weakened Excadrill. Most non-Ground-type teammates appreciate Electric Arceus's immunity to Thunder Wave, making Him a useful teammate to them as well.

Other Options
########

Electric Arceus has access to a few other viable moves that He can utilize. Thunder can be used over Judgment for more power, but the nerf to weather makes the move unreliable. Focus Blast can be used to deal with a few checks, such as Dialga, Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn, but it is just as unreliable as Thunder is. Electric Arceus can attempt to run a support set, but His lackluster defensive typing, which provides Him with resistances to only Electric-, Flying-, and Steel-type attacks, makes Him less viable for such a role, and another Arceus type should be run if a support set is required. It is, however, the only Arceus able to switch into Yveltal in a pinch while simultaneously being a great Palkia check.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Ground-types**: Bulky Ground-types that can switch in on Judgment and take an Ice Beam easily serve as excellent checks, as they can either set up or retaliate with Earthquake. Examples include Excadrill, Quagsire, Ground Arceus, Groudon, and Gastrodon.

**Ferrothorn**: Ferrothorn can easily tank Electric Arceus's common moves, damage Him with Toxic or Leech Seed, and set entry hazards.

**Bulky Fairy-types**: Clefable, Xerneas, and Sylveon are all bulky Fairy-types that cannot be immediately one-hit knocked out, provide some sort of support through Wish or Aromatherapy, and can poison Electric Arceus with Toxic. Furthermore, Xerneas can even phaze out Electric Arceus with Roar.

**Blissey**: Blissey, with her high HP and Special Defense stats, can easily take all of Electric Arceus's moves and stall Him out with a combination of Toxic and Soft-Boiled.

**Dialga**: Dialga can take both Judgment and Ice Beam fairly easily and either retaliate with Toxic or phaze Him out with Roar or Dragon Tail.

**Mega Tyranitar**: With its high Special Defense, which is further boosted by the sand it summons, Mega Tyranitar can wall Electric Arceus without the rare Focus Blast.

**Giratina**: Giratina has a high HP stat and above average defenses, meaning that it can tank any move from Electric Arceus with relative ease, even a boosted Ice Beam, and phaze Him out.

**Abomasnow**: Abomasnow and Mega Abomasnow resist Judgment, takes little from Ice Beam, and can fight back with Leech Seed and Wood Hammer.

**Mega Charizard X**: It's not a good idea to switch Mega Charizard X in on a boosted attack, but if it manages to nab a Dragon Dance, it has a high chance to KO Electric Arceus with a +1 Tough Claws-boosted Flare Blitz. It can also heal off damage with Roost.

**Lugia**: Lugia is a prominent threat, capable of crippling Electric Arceus with Toxic before phazing Him out with Whirlwind or Dragon Tail. However, it takes decent damage from Judgment.

**Toxic**: Electric Arceus hates Toxic, as He will steadily lose HP and will eventually lose more that He can Recover back. Unfortunately, many Pokémon run Toxic as a filler move, meaning that Electric Arceus must be used carefully.

**Sticky Web**: Sticky Web isn't a common entry hazard, but it can slow Electric Arceus down and render Him vulnerable to faster sweepers.
