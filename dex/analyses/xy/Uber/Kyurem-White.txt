Overview
########

Back from a generation's worth of pillaging and plundering, Kyurem-W returns to the legendary Ubers battlefield with blazing fury and a cold-hearted soul. With a massive base 170 Special Attack, a decent base 95 Speed, and a great Dragon / Ice offensive typing, Kyurem-W is an exemplary wallbreaker. It has access to the most powerful Draco Meteor in the game, and Turboblaze allows it to bypass abilities such as Multiscale, Levitate, and Flash Fire. Kyurem-W's bulk is solid, as 125 / 90 / 100 defensive stats are nothing to scoff at by wallbreaker standards, and its weakness to Stealth Rock is less of an issue with Defog support, though entry hazards still hold it back at times. In addition, it has good albeit few resistances to Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type moves, which are fairly common, granting it opportunities to switch in. Despite these strengths, Kyurem-W returns to a tier where Fairy-types such as Xerneas, Fairy Arceus, and Sylveon run amok, preventing it from spamming Draco Meteor without rational thought like it did before. While its typing is good offensively, it is horrible defensively, preventing it from synergizing well with its team and leaving it weak to common attacking types such as Fighting, Dragon, Steel, and Fairy. Though its Speed gives it an advantage against Pokemon in the crowded base 90 Speed tier, it's outsped by threats such as Palkia and Genesect. Outside of its coverage moves, Kyurem-W's movepool is sparse, preventing it from performing different roles. Even worse, all of its reliable moves bar Fusion Flare were nerfed, decreasing its power by a noticeable amount. However, don't disregard Kyurem-W, as it is a legitimate threat to prepare for, and tread carefully if you wish to prevent your Pokemon from being smashed.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Fusion Flare
move 4: Focus Blast / Earth Power
item: Choice Specs
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========

When Kyurem-W is equipped with Choice Specs, its Special Attack stat hits a record-breaking 723 with a Modest nature, allowing Draco Meteor to deal massive damage. Kyurem-W's signature selling point is that only a small group of Pokemon, consisting of Blissey, Fairy-types, and the bulkiest of Steel-types, can take the hit well. Ice Beam is a spammable STAB move that Kyurem-W can fall back upon when needed, and will shatter walls such as Lugia, Groudon, specially defensive Yveltal, Grass Arceus, Ground Arceus, and Gliscor. Fusion Flare lets Kyurem-W break past the multitude of Steel-types run to deal with wallbreakers, severely damaging Aegislash, Jirachi, Steel Arceus, and Bronzong outside of rain and incinerating Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Genesect. Focus Blast is Kyurem-W's only way of getting past Blissey, as it 2HKOes it of them after Stealth Rock, and can break past Extreme Killer, Mega Kangaskhan, Rock Arceus, Dialga, and Tyranitar. However, if you want extra insurance against Steel-types in rain in addition to perfect neutral coverage, Earth Power fits the bill quite nicely, and can reliably KO Zekrom, Mega Charizard X, and Heatran.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack investment is vital to Kyurem-W's success as a wallbreaker, and 4 Defense EVs rather than 4 HP EVs allow it to switch into Stealth Rock five times if necessary. 252 Speed EVs let Modest Kyurem-W Speed tie with neutral nature base 95s such as Swords Dance Rayquaza, but a Timid nature allows it to avoid the Speed tie entirely and dispose of Adamant Rayquaza with Ice Beam. A Timid Kyurem-W has other advantages over a Modest one, such as the ability to outspeed positive base 90s, taking advantage of its relatively solid Speed tier. However, it misses out on some important KOs with Draco Meteor in the process, such as the OHKO on 252 HP Arceus after Stealth Rock, and the 2HKO on the blobs after Stealth Rock. If Kyurem-W's bulk interests you, a spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Spe with a Modest nature can allow Kyurem-W to stay in the match longer, only missing out on the ability to outspeed Lugia and Yveltal.

Usage Tips
========

Although using Draco Meteor right off the bat is very enticing, be very careful when using it if the opponent has a Xerneas or if their Arceus forme has not been revealed yet. A poorly timed Draco Meteor can open up opportunities for the opponent to set up or use Defog to get rid of your hard-earned entry hazards. If you do not have Stealth Rock up and are not running Focus Blast on Kyurem-W, defeating Blissey is a no-go, so a teammate's assistance in dealing with Blissey is required. Though prediction is very important for any Choice user, it is especially so for Kyurem-W as its primary STAB move has an immunity. If a Fairy-type or sweeper is waiting in the wings and you predict a switch correctly, Kyurem-W can damage them beyond repair. Even though Kyurem-W's bulk is impressive, it has next to no resistances to take advantage of it, so switch in at your own risk. However, Kyurem-W can find opportunities to switch in against defensive Pokemon or entry hazard setters such as Groudon and Landorus-T and rip them to pieces. Furthermore, it doesn't mind being poisoned or burned, so play aggressively against defensively oriented teams. Try fitting Kyurem-W on teams that have trouble breaking past defensive Pokemon such as Giratina, Lugia, Blissey, and utility walls that halt the progress of sweepers.

Team Options
========

Though Kyurem-W's power is great, it's not a one-man demolition crew. It cannot KO Blissey, which stallbreakers like Yveltal or powerful Fighting-types can deal with. Mega Gengar can trap most Arceus formes and Fairy-types that give Kyurem-W trouble, and it can give Kyurem-W an opportunity to switch in when it cripples a wall with Taunt. If switching in Kyurem-W is an issue, VoltTurn support is a good option, as Kyurem-W can come in on a predicted switch with little risk involved provided entry hazards are not present. Ho-Oh is another threat Kyurem-W has to deal with, but keeping Stealth Rock on the field (Kyurem-W scares away most Defog users), having a counter to it such as Rock Arceus, or sending out a team member carrying Stone Edge can keep it in check. Keeping Stealth Rock off the field is a priority in order for Kyurem-W to switch in freely, so Defog users such as Arceus, Giratina, and Lugia are beneficial as they can clear all entry hazards or dual Screens on the field. On the other hand, spinners such as Excadrill and Forretress can maintain your own hazards, and so are superior, as having Stealth Rock in play grants Kyurem-W a chance to OHKO 252 HP Arceus and Ho-Oh with Draco Meteor and 2HKO the blobs with Focus Blast. Excadrill can both spin and set up Stealth Rock, while hazard setters like Groudon, Landorus-T, and Dialga can lay hazards down reliably at almost any point in the match. Finally, have a fallback plan against sweepers if you decide to use Draco Meteor, as Kyurem-W will be forced out, giving setup opportunities to sweepers such as Extreme Killer and offensive Xerneas with Geomancy or Calm Mind. Skarmory and physically defensive Yveltal can deal with Extreme Killer, while Ho-Oh, Jirachi, Bronzong, and Aegislash can take on Xerneas.

Choice-less
########
name: Choice-less
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Fusion Flare / Toxic
move 4: Roost / Substitute / Focus Blast
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Though the temptation of running Choice Specs is strong, Kyurem-W can function as a Choice-less variant, as Draco Meteor still hurts without a Choice Specs boost. Ice Beam is as reliable a STAB move as ever, and with the freedom to switch moves, Kyurem-W can deal considerable damage to Lugia, Yveltal, and other Pokemon weak to Ice-type moves. Fusion Flare helps Kyurem-W against Steel-types, and even without Earth Power, Turboblaze bypasses Heatran's Flash Fire, preventing it from escaping a fiery fate. Toxic lets Kyurem-W get past bulky attackers and walls that attempt to stop its rampage and prevents Ho-Oh, the pink blobs, and Water and Electric Arceus from walling this set entirely. Roost lets Kyurem-W stay in the match for a significantly longer period of time, heals off residual damage and Life Orb recoil, and helps Kyurem-W stall out the aforementioned targets of Toxic. Kyurem-W can also utilize Substitute in conjunction with Leftovers, shielding Kyurem-W from damage and status moves, scouting out coverage moves, and allowing Kyurem-W to sweep from behind cover. Focus Blast damages targets, and can still do similar damage in comparison to Choice Specs if Life Orb is used with it due to Life Orb's slightly less powerful 1.33x boost rather than 1.5x. A Life Orb-boosted Stone Edge can be used to KO standard Ho-Oh, even if Kyurem-W has no Attack investment and an Attack-decreasing nature.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature is best used with Life Orb, letting Kyurem-W outspeed positive base 90s while still maintaining the power of a Modest nature. Leftovers should be used with a Modest nature, as bulk is more important than Speed in this case. Also, keep in mind that Kyurem-W can stall out Calm Mind Electric and Water Arceus with Toxic + Roost and Leftovers, two very potent checks that will force it out otherwise. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA with a Modest nature with Roost, Substitute, Leftovers, or Toxic can be used to turn Kyurem-W into a bulky tank. One important thing to consider when running Choice-less Kyurem-W is that with the cramped coverage options, the specific checks/counters that correspond with their specific coverage moves (such as Steel-types weak to Fusion Flare) can either be easily taken down or be impossible to break past. With the respective non-damaging moves and the items, the goals of the set change from all-out-attacking to sweeping/cleaning to outstalling walls, so the set changes dynamically depending on what you run.

Usage Tips
========

If you are using Life Orb with Roost, or just Roost in general, try switching into something you can force out and proceed to heal off the damage as they switch. However, if you do not need to Roost off damage, try to predict the switch well enough that you can backhand the next thing that comes in with Toxic or the correct coverage move. The same situation applies with Substitute, and has the added utility of scouting out threatening attacks. Though Draco Meteor must be used carefully, try to play aggressively as you can, as the switches Kyurem-W can force give it an opportunity to either set up a Substitute or severely damage an incoming sweeper. As mentioned before, be cautious when using Draco Meteor, as giving an opportunity for Fairy-types to come in and being immediately forced out the next turn is not fun in the slightest.

Team Options
========

Despite the decrease in power compared to the Choice Specs set, Stealth Rock is not as needed this time around, as Choice-less Kyurem-W misses out on most of the OHKOs it could achieve before. However, Kyurem-W still appreciates Stealth Rock support, as a Timid Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor can OHKO 252 / 80 Ho-Oh after entry hazard damage. Groudon is an excellent partner, as it can cripple opponents with Thunder Wave and Toxic to make Kyurem-W's life easier and Drought boosts the strength of Fusion Flare, which is invaluable in damaging Steel-types. Landorus-T can also set up Stealth Rock and can bring Kyurem-W in with U-turn. As Kyurem-W dislikes Stealth Rock on your playing field, spinners like Forretress and Excadrill are useful to keep entry hazards away. Defog can also work in this situation, but Kyurem-W appreciates the residual damage that entry hazards provides. Sticky Web and/or SmashPass support can be used to assist Kyurem-W in sweeping or cleaning. Smeargle can provide either of these, or even both, and doesn't bother team synergy too much if it is on a hyper offense team.  However, the same team members mentioned in Choice Specs can be used here as well as Kyurem-W's goals do not change whatever it runs, and its checks and counters do not as well.

Other Options
########

Flash Cannon is an option if Fairy-types are troublesome for your team, and the Choice Specs set can OHKO standard offensive Xerneas with it after Stealth Rock. However, the move doesn't provide any other relevant coverage. Dragon Pulse can be used if getting forced out by Draco Meteor just isn't your style, but the power drop is significant, and Kyurem-W wants to have that power the Draco Meteor provides. Blizzard is an alternative to Ice Beam, as its sheer power is good. However, it needs hail support in order to be spammed reliably, and usually isn't worth the trouble. Ancient Power is an option to hit Ho-Oh on the special side, and the boosts can allow Kyurem-W to sweep. However, due to its pitiful Base Power, Ancient Power doesn't do enough damage to other Pokemon weak to Rock-type moves such as Lugia and Yveltal, and hits Ho-Oh on its significantly weaker physical side, so Stone Edge is generally the superior choice. Choice Scarf Kyurem-W can function as a revenge killer, but it cannot gain momentum, has a Stealth Rock weakness, and its Draco Meteor is significantly weaker than a Choice Specs-boosted one, making it a hard bargain to be locked into. Lastly, an Assault Vest can be used to increase Kyurem-W's bulk and tanking capabilities, but it prevents the usage of moves such as Substitute and Roost, and Kyurem-W prefers a boosting item instead.

Checks and Counters
########

**Blissey**: As it has titanic special bulk, Blissey is pretty much the only Pokemon that can safely switch in and reliably wall Kyurem-W. However, if Choice Specs Kyurem-W carries Focus Blast and Stealth Rock is up, it cannot switch in without being 2HKOed.

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types such as Xerneas, Fairy Arceus, and Sylveon can defeat Kyurem-W with their Fairy-type STAB moves and utilize support options to benefit the team. They also prevent Kyurem-W from spamming Draco Meteor, as they can take advantage of the move to set up (especially Geomancy Xerneas). However, only Sylveon can switch into Choice Specs-boosted Ice Beam or Fusion Flare unless Stealth Rock is up, as it has the best special bulk out of the three.

**Ho-Oh**: If Stealth Rock is not up, Ho-Oh can stall out Kyurem-W with Roost as it can stomach at least one Draco Meteor and KO with Brave Bird.

**Bulky Steel-types**: Steel-types not 4x weak to Fusion Flare such as Aegislash, Jirachi, Steel Arceus, and Bronzong can check Kyurem-W well, especially if rain is up, but they must switch in with caution if Kyurem-W carries Earth Power.

**Scizor**: Scizor can utilize Bullet Punch to check Kyurem-W effectively, and though it is 4x weak to Fusion Flare, it resists most of Kyurem-W's other coverage moves.

**Specially Defensive Water-types**: Bulky Water-types such as specially defensive Kyogre and Water Arceus can stomach all of Kyurem-W's moves bar Draco Meteor, and either stall it out with a recovery move or phaze it out with Roar.

**Fighting Arceus**:  Support variants of Fighting Arceus can withstand at least one Draco Meteor and threaten to 2HKO with Judgment.

**Rock Arceus**: Though disposed of quickly with Focus Blast or Earth Power, Rock Arceus can switch in on Fusion Flare and can threaten to 2HKO with Judgment.

**Calm Mind Arceus Formes**: Though very broad at first, the primary threats that encompass this are Electric Arceus and Ghost Arceus. Electric Arceus can't switch into Earth Power and neither can switch into Draco Meteor, but otherwise both can set up Calm Minds in Kyurem-W's face or just force it out if it lacks Roost + Toxic.

**Revenge Killers**: Revenge killing Kyurem-W or striking first to minimize collateral damage is probably the safest way to deal with it outside of walling it with the pink blobs. Though Kyurem-W has a decent Speed, it is outsped and KOed by Pokemon such as Palkia, Mega Blaziken, Mewtwo, Genesect, Terrakion, and Mega Lucario. However, none of these can switch in safely without being KOed or severely damaged.
