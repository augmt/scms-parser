Overview
########
- An awkward mix of good and bad.
- Typing allows it serve as a check to Kyogre as well as other major metagame threats.
- At the same time, the typing leaves it vulnerable to other very important threats like Mega Gengar and Mega Blaziken.
- Because the weaknesses outshine the advantages, Grass Arceus requires heavy amount of team support.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Judgment / Grass Knot
move 2: Recover
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Defog / Stone Edge
item: Meadow Plate
nature: Timid
evs: 248 HP / 144 SpD / 112 Spe

Moves
========

- Judgment is a consistent STAB that will hit Darkrai and Landorus-T a lot harder than Grass Knot but Grass Knot is 120 base power against a large majority of the metagame.
- Recover allows Grass Arceus to remain healthy. 
- Will-O-Wisp complements well with Grass-type STAB as it burns resists like Zekrom and Klefki, it also lets Grass Arceus to serve as a check to physical threats like Mega Kangaskhan and Extreme Killer Arceus. 
- Defog clears hazards for the team.
- Stone Edge helps with the weakness to Ho-Oh.
- Thunder Wave also pairs well with Judgment and Grass Knot but it's useless against threats like Klefki and Zekrom on top of paralysis being generally unhelpful on the types of teams that Grass Arceus is found on. 
- Earthquake can help KO Mega Gengar as well as get some decent damage on Blaziken and Zekrom but is otherwise fairly specialized and takes from Arceus's bulk.
- Toxic allows Grass Arceus to serve as a check to Calm Mind Electric Arceus amongst other things but it has poor synergy with Arceus's Grass-type STAB and is easily punished with nearly any Steel-type.

Set Details
========

- Speed evs are just enough to outspeed Garchomp and Palkia with the rest poured in Special Defense to better check Kyogre.
- Use 248 HP / 72 Atk / 80 SpD / 112 Spe with a Hasty nature if opting for Earthquake.

Usage Tips
========

- Play very carefully when you see a Mega Gengar. You should be using Pursuit support with Grass Arceus but burning Gengar can still help with Destiny Bond shenanigans.
- Grass Arceus is 2HKOed by Choice Specs Kyogre's Water Spout so you will have to intimidate the healthy Kyogre with Arceus's Grass-type STAB and Recover on the predicted switch or attack it to weaken an aggressive Kyogre that tries to predict your Recover.
- Status like Toxic and Paralysis will heavily impact Grass Arceus's ability to check threats so make sure to scout sets for Toxic.


Team Options
========

- Pursuit. Mega Gengar is way too dangerous to risk running Grass Arceus without Pursuit support from Scizor or Tyranitar.
- Tyranitar also has a Mega forme that makes it an excellent check to Ho-Oh, another pokemon that preys on Grass Arceus.
- Blaziken can easily setup on Grass Arceus so it's good to have multiple checks to it like Kyogre, Landorus-T, or Lugia.
- Klefki and Ferrothorn have an easy time coming in to Spike on Grass Arceus while threatening to cripple it with Toxic. Burning them as they come in helps but running a Rapid Spin user will help even more.
- Cleric support from Sylveon or Xerneas will help with Grass Arceus's weakness to status.


Other Options
########

- A mono-attacking set with Refresh and Calm Mind is interesting in such a status heavy metagame but Grass is a very poor type offensively.


Checks & Counters
########

- **Shadow Tag**: Mega Gengar destroys Grass Arceus with STAB Sludge Wave. Gothitelle has no difficulty setting up on it while Wobbuffet doesn't have to do much to transform Grass Arceus into total setup fodder for a sweeper.
- **Fire-types**: Both Ho-Oh and Blaziken fear next to nothing from Grass-Arceus while they can hit back very hard with their powerful STAB attacks. Blaziken can also use Grass Arceus as a free Swords Dance making it very difficult to check.
- **Steel-types**: Klefki, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Forretress have no in switching in on Grass Arceus and setting up layers of Spikes, although burns are bothersome. Dialga can setup SR or go straight for the Toxic. Scizor and Mega Lucario can also destroy Grass Arceus if it doesn't run Will-O-Wisp.
- **Yveltal**: Resists Grass-type attacks and destroys Arceus with Oblivion Wing and Hurricane. It dislikes having extra passive damage from Will-O-Wisp on top of a crippled Sucker Punch, though.
- **Shaymin-S**: Double resists Grass Arceus's STAB and barely has to try when flinch haxing with Air Slash. Can safely spam Substitute to block whatever status Arceus may have.
- **Poison Arceus**: Can setup a Calm Mind sweep on Grass Arceus without difficulty.
- **Kyurem-W**: Resists Judgment and Grass Knot while hitting back very hard with STAB Ice Beam.
- **Reshiram**: Not bothered by much short of Stone Edge while Blue Flare is very threatening to Grass Arceus.
- **Status**: Toxic and Paralysis prevents Grass Arceus from staying in and abusing Recover. Burns aren't as troublesome but the passive damage can still rack up quickly.
