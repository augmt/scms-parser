Overview
########

Thundurus is a nightmare for offensive teams to play against for one reason: Prankster. Prankster allows Thundurus to cripple almost any opponent with Thunder Wave, making it capable of stopping a sweep cold or simply incapacitating a Speed-reliant Pokemon. The ability also turns Thundurus into an effective anti-lead, as a Prankster Taunt can stop leads such as the Deoxys formes regardless of how fast they are. Thundurus's great offensive movepool, which includes gems such as Volt Switch and Grass Knot, complements its good base 125 Special Attack and 111 Speed well and grants it acceptable coverage with just two moves. Unfortunately, Thundurus is incredibly frail by Ubers standards and will be OHKOed by most strong STAB moves. More importantly, it suffers from a weakness to Stealth Rock, which is potentially devastating in conjunction with Life Orb recoil and the constant use of Volt Switch. Thundurus can still be an incredibly useful asset to a team, but its level of utility is heavily matchup-based.

Moves
========

Thunder Wave is the main reason to use Thundurus. Thanks to the priority boost it receives from Prankster, the move allows Thundurus to shut down countless offensive threats, including Xerneas and Mewtwo, even if they are statistically faster. Taunt also benefits from Prankster and stops moves such as Defog and Stealth Rock. It's notably useful against Deoxys-S lacking Magic Coat as well. Volt Switch is deceptively powerful with a Life Orb boost and can create momentum for Thundurus's team, though Thunderbolt can be used instead if its greater power and lack of a forced switch effect are preferred. Grass Knot is the optimal choice in the final slot, hitting Ground-types such as Groudon and Hippowdon for large amounts of damage. However, Hidden Power Ice can be used instead to OHKO Landorus-T and deal a solid amount of damage to Zekrom. Superpower is also an option to hit foes such as Dialga, Excadrill, and Tyranitar harder than any of the previously mentioned moves can.

Set Details
========

Maximum EV investment in Special Attack and Speed lets Thundurus hit as hard and fast as possible, as it is extremely fragile. A Timid nature is necessary in order for Thundurus to outspeed Palkia and slower Arceus formes. Prankster is the obvious ability choice, while a Life Orb is used to make Thundurus's attacks moderately stronger. If Superpower is used, Thundurus's nature should be changed to Naive and the Defense EVs should be moved into Attack.

Usage Tips
========

The main draw of using Thundurus is its Prankster Thunder Wave, which can stop a Speed-boosting sweeper or otherwise fast threat in its tracks. Aside from this, Thundurus can easily switch in against and threaten many Ground-types; it won't get many other opportunities to switch in, so make use of this fact. Additionally, Thundurus is a great choice to lead with, particularly because of its ability to stop entry hazard users with Taunt. Finally, Volt Switch is a great tool to have that can often bail Thundurus out of an unfavorable matchup.

Team Options
========

Thundurus is best suited on offensive teams, where ideal teammates for it begin with U-turn users such as Genesect that can help form a VoltTurn core. Ground-types also work well with Thundurus&mdash;Excadrill is a fantastic teammate as it can check Zekrom, Electric Arceus, and Dialga, while Thundurus handles Ground- and Fighting-type moves and can use Volt Switch to bring it in safely. Dialga itself is also a great partner, checking Electric- and Grass-types while Thundurus covers its two weaknesses. Fairy-types such as Xerneas are good teammates for dealing with Dragon-types, preferably alongside a Ground-type in order to safely check Zekrom. Ferrothorn handles Electric-types and most Grass Arceus effectively. Lastly, Shadow Tag users, namely Mega Gengar, appreciate being sent in via Volt Switch, making them excellent teammates as well.

Other Options
########

Thundurus has many other options. Toxic is a nice surprise that cripples most support Arceus formes and various other threats that aren't terribly bothered by paralysis. Nasty Plot is an excellent boosting move, but the inability to outspeed Arceus coupled with low defenses means Thundurus will have trouble sweeping. Thunder is a strong STAB move, but the lack of permanent rain makes it unreliable. Focus Blast hits a few Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn, harder than Superpower, but it is generally inferior due to its awful accuracy. Sludge Wave hits Fairy-types and Grass Arceus super effectively but is significantly less useful than Thundurus's other coverage options. Knock Off can be used for its item-removing effect, though Thundurus will have difficulty finding room for it.

A few other items are viable as well. Zap Plate and Leftovers reduce the residual damage that Thundurus takes, but it needs all the power it can get. Focus Sash is an interesting option that turns Thundurus into an even more effective anti-lead.

Checks & Counters
########

**Electric-types**: Zekrom and Electric Arceus are by far the best counters to Thundurus. They cannot be paralyzed, resist Electric-type moves, and take little from Thundurus's coverage moves. Electric Arceus needs to watch out for the uncommon Toxic, however.

**Dragon-types**: Most Dragon-types that lack a 4x weakness to Hidden Power Ice can deal with Thundurus with their STAB moves, though none of them will enjoy being paralyzed. These include Dialga, the Giratina formes, Kyurem-W, Reshiram, Mega Charizard X, and Dragon Arceus.

**Grass-types**: Ferrothorn and Grass Arceus resist Thundurus's STAB moves and aren't bothered by most of its potential coverage moves. Both can easily KO Thundurus due to its frailty.

**Ground-types**: Excadrill does not take much damage from Grass Knot or Hidden Power Ice, meaning it fears only Fighting-type coverage from Thundurus. Landorus-T handles any Thundurus lacking Hidden Power Ice. Ground Arceus outspeeds and OHKOes Thundurus with Stone Edge after one instance of Life Orb recoil.

**Specially Bulky Pokemon**: Blissey and Heatran must be careful of Superpower and Focus Blast, but they do an exceptional job of walling Thundurus otherwise.
