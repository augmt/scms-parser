Overview
########

With access to Rapid Spin, two types of entry hazards, strong multi-hit moves, and Shell Smash, Cloyster carves itself a very specific niche in XY Ubers. It is particularly useful as a lead for offensive teams due to its ability to control entry hazard setup. Cloyster sets itself apart from all of its competitors because of its offensive presence, which helps it defeat many spinblockers and other entry hazard users. Additionally, its colossal base 180 Defense allows it to take neutral physical hits easily, even without investment. However, Cloyster will be brought down to its Focus Sash by almost any special attack, and it is often unable to do its job against bulky opponents. Moreover, Cloyster is largely useless outside of this niche; the abundance of support Arceus formes with Will-O-Wisp and the popularity of Kyogre render it ineffective as a sweeper in comparison to in BW. Regardless, when used correctly, Cloyster is an excellent asset to offensive teams.

Moves
========

Icicle Spear will always hit five times thanks to Skill Link, making it a fully accurate 125 Base Power STAB move that will OHKO frail leads such as Deoxys-A straight through their Focus Sash. This forces them to choose between attacking Cloyster and bringing it down to its own Focus Sash, settling for a single layer of entry hazards, or switching out; each of these scenarios will usually allow Cloyster to either remove the opposing entry hazard user with Icicle Spear and/or their entry hazards with Rapid Spin, or simply switch out and come back in later with its Focus Sash still intact. At the cost of physical bulk, Shell Smash allows Cloyster to pose an immediate danger to bulkier leads and most spinblockers with Icicle Spear while maintaining the threat of Rapid Spin and entry hazards. For example, a +2 Icicle Spear will easily OHKO Groudon and Deoxys-S, while bringing support Dialga to its knees.

The choice between Spikes and Toxic Spikes is mainly one of personal preference. In general, Toxic Spikes is preferable on teams that struggle with certain setup sweepers, such as Substitute + Calm Mind Arceus formes lacking Recover. However, as Cloyster will generally only manage to get a single layer down, if any, Toxic Spikes should not be used on status-heavy teams, as normal poison status can potentially protect an opposing Pokemon that needs to be paralyzed, burned, or put to sleep. Alternatively, Explosion is a viable option in the last slot, as at +2 it is able to OHKO all but the physically bulkiest variants of Ho-Oh and Kyogre.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment allows Icicle Spear to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature lets Cloyster outrun the entire unboosted metagame after a Shell Smash. It also allows Cloyster to outspeed several Pokemon with a higher but uninvested base Speed stat, such as Groudon, Dialga, and Deoxys-D. A Focus Sash ensures that Cloyster is able to use Rapid Spin if necessary.

Usage Tips
========

The purpose of using Cloyster is to guarantee a single removal of entry hazards, specifically Stealth Rock, as well as to KO or severely weaken the opponent's entry hazard setter or spinblocker. Cloyster should generally be led with, but if it is not matched up against its desired target, it should be switched out in order to preserve its Focus Sash. However, it should be brought back in immediately once the entry hazard user shows up later in the game in order to threaten to use Rapid Spin and maintain offensive momentum. It's important to note that Cloyster does not necessarily need to KO the opponent's entry hazard user if it is slow, but simply weaken it to the point where its teammates can deal with it at any given moment before it gets another chance to set up. Thus, Cloyster's number one priority should be ensuring that its side of the field is free of all entry hazards when it faints. Finally, do not expect Cloyster to be able to set up its own entry hazards every game, as that is not its primary objective. However, using Spikes or Toxic Spikes punishes switches effectively, and the ability to stack them will often force the opponent to deal with them quickly. Also, on occasion, having a layer of Spikes or Toxic Spikes up may be more beneficial than using Rapid Spin, though this is entirely matchup based.

Team Options
========

Cloyster requires little to no support of its own, but it should be used on offensive teams alongside Pokemon that absolutely require Stealth Rock off of their side of the field. Ho-Oh is the main reason behind Cloyster's use, and it is a nightmare to play against when not plagued by Stealth Rock. Incidentally, Cloyster works well on sun teams because of its ability to threaten many bulky Ground-types that give them trouble, such as Landorus-T. Explosion is highly recommended if Cloyster is used on a sun team, as it can surprise Kyogre by OHKOing it at +2. Good Pokemon to pair with Cloyster also include those that appreciate its capacity to soften up or KO specific spinblockers. Extreme Killer Arceus is a notable example of this, able to plow through many teams that have a weakened or fainted Giratina forme.

Other Options
########

Cloyster does not have many other worthwhile options. Rock Blast hits Ho-Oh, Kyurem-W, and the odd Shuckle lead, but it is less useful overall than Explosion. Ice Shard provides Cloyster with a priority move, but it is too weak to be of much use.

A full-on sweeping set utilizing a moveset of Shell Smash, Icicle Spear, Rock Blast, and Hydro Pump with a Life Orb or King's Rock equipped is usable, but such a set leaves Cloyster very prone to being burned or walled. More importantly, it will see very few opportunities to set up, though it can be done against Choice-locked Ice-type moves or with Wobbuffet support.

Checks & Counters
########

**Physically Bulky Tanks**: Nearly anything that can take an Icicle Spear will beat Cloyster one-on-one, but Cloyster's main jobs are spinning away entry hazards, weakening opposing Stealth Rock users, and optimally getting a layer of Spikes or Toxic Spikes down. Therefore, Pokemon that can stop it from doing these things are ideal, as is not allowing Cloyster to weaken or KO one's Stealth Rock user.

**Priority Users**: Once Cloyster is down to its Focus Sash, it can easily be picked off by priority moves even after using Shell Smash. Using priority may also deprive Cloyster of chances to use Rapid Spin before fainting.

**Spinblockers**: Ghost Arceus and Aegislash can take a +2 Icicle Spear and are immune to Explosion, while Sableye can burn Cloyster with Prankster Will-O-Wisp. However, all other viable Ghost-types barring physically defensive Giratina are OHKOed by a boosted Icicle Spear.

**Darkrai**: Darkrai can put Cloyster to sleep and threaten to OHKO it in spite of its Focus Sash thanks to Bad Dreams.

**Heatran**: Heatran takes little from Cloyster's attacks barring a rare Water-type move and can OHKO it if Lava Plume burns. It can then proceed to set up Stealth Rock.

**Jirachi**: With Thunder Wave and Iron Head, Jirachi can ensure its own Stealth Rock stays up against Cloyster. Cloyster also can't hit Jirachi nearly hard enough to OHKO it without a significant amount of prior damage.

**Forretress**: Forretress can set up its own hazards and spin away any that Cloyster uses, then use Volt Switch and bring out a Ghost-type.

**Skarmory**: Skarmory works similarly to Forretress and is able to clear away Cloyster's entry hazards with Defog and set up its own. It can also use Whirlwind to force Cloyster out and remove any Shell Smash boosts.

**Entry Hazard Removal**: In the event that Cloyster manages to get its own entry hazards down, Rapid Spin or Defog users can remove them. However, Defog should not be used if there are entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field, as it will remove them as well.
