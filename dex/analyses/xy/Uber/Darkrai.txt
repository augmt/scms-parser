Overview
########

The generational transition has been a mixed bag for Darkrai. Its signature move, Dark Void, has been negatively affected by the sleep nerf, and two of the most common Ubers, Xerneas and Yveltal, can often stop Darkrai in its tracks. With such a bulky, but hard-hitting metagame, Darkrai's mediocre defenses are also much more apparent. However, the Steel-type nerf means that Darkrai's STAB is much more potent and its Ghost- and Dark-type resistances are all the more useful. Despite sleep no longer being reset on switches now, it's still very useful for what Darkrai is trying to accomplish. Overall, Darkrai remains as one of the most useful sweepers in the game thanks to its great Speed, Special Attack, and ability to sabotage opponents.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Dark Void
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Taunt / Nasty Plot
move 4: Thunder / Sludge Bomb
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Dark Void is going to be Darkrai's most important attack, allowing it to easily stop a potential check by rocking it to sleep. Dark Pulse is the STAB move of choice, as it's the most powerful Dark-type attack Darkrai can run. Taunt is a very useful move to have, allowing Darkrai to stop Sleep Talk users completely. It's also useful for Pokemon reliant on inflicting status or recovery such as Blissey and Chansey. If you run Darkrai on a hyper offensive team reliant on entry hazards, Taunt is a very good choice to stop Defog in its tracks. Nasty Plot is the boosting move of choice, allowing Darkrai to have a Special Attack stat exceeding 700. Darkrai can find opportunity to use it by either forcing something out or putting something out of commission with Dark Void.

The last moveslot is used to deal with threats that can check Darkrai. Thunder 2HKOes Yveltal and Kyogre. Sludge Bomb is used to deal with Fairy-types, notably  Fairy Arceus and Xerneas. If you don't want to choose between the two, it's viable to run both with one taking up the third moveslot. Another viable option for the last moveslot is Thunder Wave; Darkrai can easily take advantage of the switches caused by Dark Void to further cripple the opposing team.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature is needed so that Darkrai beats max Speed Arceus formes. Life Orb is the preferred item, as it allows Darkrai to greatly increase its damage output, but Focus Sash is also usable for a lead Darkrai, though lead Darkrai isn't as good as it was last generation, due to different leads being popular and the sleep nerf.

Usage Tips
========

Darkrai can be very hard to wall thanks to its Speed and power. In general, the most common ways to deal with Darkrai are specially defensive tanks and Choice Scarf users. As such, planning which Pokemon should be set to sleep is crucial to the success of this set. If you can, leaving only one non-Choice Scarf check to Darkrai can easily allow it to sweep thanks to Dark Void. It isn't a bad idea when it first comes in to test the waters and see what the opponent sends out, before you Dark Void. Look out for Sleep Talk users if Darkrai runs Nasty Plot.

Darkrai doesn't have to go with the sweeping role with this set, though. Using Dark Void to allow another member of the team to clean up later is just as viable. Additionally, Darkrai's Life Orb-boosted coverage moves and STAB Dark Pulse can leave big dents for other Pokemon to make use of later.

Team Options
========

Darkrai is mostly a self-sufficient Pokemon due to Dark Void, but like any sweeper, it appreciates teammates that can deal with its checks. Xerneas is a useful offensive partner because it can bring out Lugia and Aegislash, and can lure Ho-Oh and nail it with Rock Slide. Rock Arceus can be a useful switch-in to Ho-Oh. If Darkrai run Thunder, teammates that can take on Fairy-types such as Gengar and Scizor will make its life easier. Wobbuffet is very old-school, but it's able to stop Choice Scarf users completely. Teammates that can stop common Choice Scarf users are appreciated in general. Palkia, Landorus-T, Fairy Arceus, Grass Arceus, Groudon, and Ferrothorn all can deal with common Choice Scarf users such as Kyogre and Zekrom. Teammates that appreciate Thunder Wave support, such as set-up sweepers, will like this Darkrai as well if you choose to run it.

Substitute
########
name: Substitute
move 1: Dark Void
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Nasty Plot
item: Leftovers
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Dark Void acts as a great support move and Dark Pulse is the best STAB option. Substitute is what differs this set from others, acting as a great sweeping tool. Darkrai can easily utilize Substitute thanks to Dark Void and its ability to freely cause switches. Nasty Plot is preferred for the last slot here, as it's much easier to boost when under the protection of a Substitute. Darkrai is one of the few Pokemon in the tier capable of viably running mono Dark-type coverage, so Nasty Plot allows it to power through many things. Thunder and Sludge Bomb are also viable in the last slot, as under a Substitute, it's much easier to take down Darkrai's checks.

Set Details
========

The only viable item choice is Leftovers; Life Orb will drain Darkrai's HP way too fast when combined with Substitute, and Focus Sash obviously doesn't work well with Substitute. It should be noted that thanks to Leftovers, you can use Darkrai as a switch-in to Ghost- and Dark-type attacks somewhat more.

Usage Tips
========

This Darkrai is more focused on beating potential checks with its mono-Dark-type coverage rather than its power. Substitute is very unique in that it allows Darkrai to mess with Choice Scarf users much more safely. In addition, if it manages to get a Substitute up without putting anything to sleep, Darkrai becomes insanely scary, as it can now Nasty Plot with impunity and put something to sleep all under safety. This Darkrai set is definitely more late-game oriented, and it'll likely end up as your win condition.

Team Options
========

All of the teammates that pair with other sets work pretty well here. It should be noted that this Darkrai appreciates paralysis and Toxic support much more than the last set. Thanks to Substitute and Leftovers, it can easily bait for a full paralysis or outstall a special wall that's been badly poisoned.

Other Options
########

There aren't that many options that Darkrai can viably run that haven't been said yet. Ice Beam lets Darkrai hit many of the same things as Thunder, but it is generally going to be weaker and inferior. Focus Blast isn't going to be very useful at all, but it does allow Darkrai to hit niche Pokemon such as Terrakion. Darkrai can run a physical set focusing on Swords Dance, Knock Off, and Sucker Punch, which has a good surprise factor; however, it won't be hitting nearly as hard as Nasty Plot, and so it will be easily walled once the surprise is gone. A Choice Scarf set with Trick is somewhat viable, as Darkrai has a great Speed tier, but it hits like a pansy unboosted and Trick can be hard to pull off, so in general, it's not a great revenge killer.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting Arceus**: One of the few Pokemon that can switch into Darkrai once Dark Void has been used and not be afraid of any coverage attack.

**Bulky Fairy-types**: Darkrai is very hard to totally counter because of Dark Void. Once the threat of Dark Void is gone, it becomes infinitely easier to stop. Fairy-types such as Xerneas, Clefable, and Sylveon all wall sets lacking Sludge Bomb, and often have a way to deal with status due to Sleep Talk or cleric support. Fairy Arceus lacks a way around Dark Void, but can easily wall Darkrai sets without Sludge Bomb.

**Dark-type Tanks**: Tyranitar, Yveltal, and Dark Arceus can easily wall Darkrai after sacking a teammate to sleep, provided Darkrai doesn't have the appropriate auxiliary coverage.

**Kyogre**: Kyogre must watch out for Thunder and Dark Void (if it lacks Sleep Talk), but can tank a hit and smash Darkrai with boosted Water-type attacks.

**Ho-Oh**: When Stealth Rock and Dark Void aren't an issue, Ho-Oh can wall Darkrai and 2HKOes back with Sacred Fire or Brave Bird.

**Revenge Killing**: Thanks to how frail Darkrai is, it is fairly easy to revenge kill. Choice Scarf Pokemon with Sleep Talk such as Terrakion and Zekrom, make some of the best Darkrai checks due to their ability to surprise it for an OHKO. Mega Gengar and Mewtwo are naturally faster than Darkrai and can nail it with a super-effective Fighting-type attack. Choice Scarf users lacking Sleep Talk can still come in after Darkrai has KO'd something and proceed to OHKO it or force it out. Priority attacks aren't going to OHKO Darkrai, but they can easily stop one that has been weakened thanks to Life Orb or Substitute damage. Common priority users and many revenge killers aren't going to enjoy directly switching into Darkrai at anytime though.

**Status**: Darkrai absolutely hates being paralyzed as its great Speed becomes completely useless, and its sweeping potential goes down the drain. Other status ailments such as poison and burns don't bother Darkrai as much, but they can drain down a Life Orb set rather quickly.
