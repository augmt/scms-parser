Overview
########

Greninja has a high Speed stat that allows it to function well as a suicide lead in Ubers. Furthermore, Greninja has a great signature ability, Protean, which allows it to switch its type depending on what move it uses, meaning it can easily play around opponents. Greninja has a huge movepool with many status moves as well as physical and special moves. However, one of Greninja's downsides is its mediocre offensive stats and bulk. Additionally, Greninja can be stopped quite easily by faster offensive attackers. Lastly, Greninja faces huge competition from the Deoxys formes as a suicide lead, although its niche lies in Toxic Spikes and its ability to block Rapid Spin because of Protean Shadow Sneak.

Suicide Lead
########
name: Suicide Lead
move 1: Toxic Spikes
move 2: Spikes
move 3: Taunt
move 4: Shadow Sneak
ability: Protean
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Toxic Spikes is an entry hazard that affects all Pokemon not immune to poison on the switch in, and it eventually wears down most Pokemon after two layers. Spikes is another hazard that hurts the opponent on the switch in, and it also removes the effect of any Focus Sash. Taunt prevents the opponent from using any status attack against Greninja, most notably Defog, which can remove the hazards Greninja has set up. Shadow Sneak allows Greninja to change its typing to Ghost, which allows it to block Rapid Spin. It also helps Greninja pick off weakened Pokemon and beat Deoxys-A. Hydro Pump is another option to use in order to hit Mega Diancie for super effective damage, which is important as Mega Diancie bounces hazards back and can OHKO Greninja with a super effective Moonblast. Other notable targets for Hydro Pump are Mega Sableye and Landorus-T.

Set Details
========

Protean allows Greninja to play around with the opponent by changing its type every time it uses a move with a different typing. Focus Sash is the best item because it prevents Greninja from being OHKOed, guaranteeing that it will be able to get up a hazard or Taunt a Pokemon. The Attack EVs help Greninja to 3HKO Deoxys-S, and the Speed EVs help Greninja to outspeed Arceus variants so that it can Taunt them before they set up. A Jolly nature helps Greninja to outspeed up to base 120 Speed Pokemon, such as Mega Salamence. If Greninja runs Hydro Pump, make sure to use an EV spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe along with a Timid nature because this allows Greninja to OHKO Naive Mega Diancie if it tries to switch in.

Usage Tips
========

Greninja works best as a lead, although you must be careful when dealing with Magic Bounce users such as Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie. Set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes depending on the opposing team; Spikes troubles bulky offense teams, while Toxic Spikes beats up defensive teams by dealing damage every turn. Use Taunt when predicting the opponent to set up on you, use Defog, or set up their own hazards. Shadow Sneak is the best option to use if you predict the opponent will try to Rapid Spin away your hazards, and it has the added benefit of beating common leads such as Deoxys-A and Deoxys-S.

Team Options
========

Support from offensive Pokemon such as Mega Gengar, Mega Salamence, Genesect, and Primal Groudon is good because they prevent the opponent from using Rapid Spin or Defog. Other Taunt users such as Yveltal or Darkrai can prevent the opponent from removing your hazards with Defog once Greninja has fainted. Aside from those, Pokemon that can deal with a Darkrai lead such as Mega Diancie make for good partners too, as its ability, Magic Bounce, will bounce back Dark Void which would prevent Greninja from setting up hazards. However, when predicting the opponent with Darkrai, lead with Diancie, as it won't bounce back hazards when it switches in as regular Diancie. Furthermore, Primal Groudon is another good partner as it can set up Stealth Rock and benefit from the Toxic Spikes, which wear down its defensive checks. Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Kyurem-W, and Darkrai that appreciate having hazards on the field to net KOs more easily make good partners. Other examples of good teammates include Mega Scizor and Primal Kyogre, which beat Mega Diancie, and Xerneas, which beats Mega Sableye. Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar or Aegislash, can help to trap Latios and Latias which can try to Defog. Powerful U-turn users such as Scizor and Landorus-Therian make good partners too, as they can lead and hit opposing Deoxys formes and then switch into Greninja, which can then beat them with a Shadow Sneak. Lastly, Pokemon that can flinch opponents, such as Shaymin-Sky or Kangaskhan, benefit from Poison damage that Toxic Spikes provide.


Other Options
########

An all-out attacking set with great coverage such as Gunk Shot, which can OHKO Xerneas, Low Kick, and Grass Knot, which can 2HKO Primal Groudon, is usable, but such a set is largely outclassed by Deoxys-A, which has superior offensive presence. U-turn can be used by Greninja to maintain momentum and switch out of its checks and counters, but Greninja cannot miss out on any of its current moves as it will lack a hazard, a block to Defog, or a block to Rapid Spin. Additionally, Haze is an option to remove stat boosts, but Taunt prevents the opponent from setting up on Greninja anyway.


Checks & Counters
########

**Darkrai**: Darkrai outspeeds Greninja and puts it to sleep with Dark Void, preventing it from setting up hazards. However, it doesn't like taking a Gunk Shot.

**Magic Bounce**: Magic Bounce users such as Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie bounce back the entry hazards Greninja tries to set up and beat it with one of their attacks.

**Taunt**: Faster Taunt users such as Darkrai and Deoxys-S can Taunt Greninja, preventing it from setting up Spikes, though the latter needs to be wary of Shadow Sneak.

**Strong priority**: As Greninja is frail, strong priority such as an Extreme Speed from Deoxys-A or Arceus can quickly bring Greninja to its end.
