Overview
########

Greninja is an interesting case in the Ubers tier. While its ability and movepool might suggest offensive sets with Life Orb, Greninja is much better suited as a capable lead that can set up both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, with the latter in particular working particularly effectively against offensive and defensive teams alike. Greninja's base 122 Speed allows it to Taunt opposing Defog Arceus as well as other entry hazard removers. Lastly, Shadow Sneak gives Greninja a method of spinblocking on its own, as Protean and the priority of Shadow Sneak mean that Greninja can transform into a Ghost-type before the opponent can spin. Shadow Sneak is also useful to anti-lead Deoxys-A and to a lesser extent Deoxys-S. These traits allow Greninja to differentiate itself from another popular and effective dual Spikes lead, Scolipede.

Moves
========

Spikes and Toxic Spikes are fantastic entry hazards and are hard to come by in Ubers, with Greninja being one of only two Pokemon able to viably use both. Taunt allows Greninja to prevent Defog from support Arceus. Shadow Sneak allows Greninja to temporarily spinblock and lets Greninja anti-lead Deoxys-A. You can also use Night Slash alongside Shadow Sneak to limit Deoxys-S to one layer of hazards and also deal more damage than Shadow Sneak does. An interesting thing that Greninja can do is deal with slower Stalltwo (running 176 Speed EVs and a Timid nature), as it can outrun, Taunt, and deal heavy damage with Night Slash, being immune to Psystrike thanks to Protean.

Set Details
========

Max Speed and Attack investment allows Greninja to outspeed Arceus and deal as much damage as possible with its attack(s), with HP investment being useless. Max Attack investment allows Greninja to 2HKO 252 HP Deoxys-S with Night Slash + Shadow Sneak, as well as have a chance to 2HKO 0 HP Deoxys-S with Shadow Sneak. 4 Defense EVs allow Greninja to take priority hits slightly better. Focus Sash allows Greninja to survive any hit, allowing it to set up more entry hazards.

Usage Tips
========

You should usually lead with Greninja so that it has the chance to set up as many entry hazards as possible, as well as potentially anti-leading the opponent. If running Night Slash + Shadow Sneak, you can limit any variant of Deoxys-S to one layer, with Deoxys-A falling to two Shadow Sneaks. Taunt Defog Arceus that lead or come in to try and Defog Greninja's hazards away. Any Rapid Spinners that try to lead against Greninja can have their Rapid Spin blocked by Shadow Sneak.

Against Tyranitar leads that try to anti-lead Greninja and break its Sash with sand, you should set up Spikes first as Protean will change Greninja's type to Ground, which lets it avoid taking sand damage. Taunting slower Stealth Rock leads such as Dialga or Groudon so that they do not get it up on your side is also highly beneficial to your team, but you should watch out for U-turn Landorus-T, as it may try to break Greninja's Sash for free.

Analyzing your opponent's team to determine which kind of Spikes will be more beneficial is important. Spikes help to wear down bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Dialga, and Aegislash, while also dealing 12.5% damage to all other grounded Pokemon. Toxic Spikes can be very beneficial against opposing Geomancy Xerneas, Palkia, Darkrai, and Arceus, Pokemon that tend to come in for more than one turn, as well as doing consistent damage to walls such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Grass, potentially pushing them into 2HKO range for your teammates. Against teams with multiple Pokemon that are immune to Toxic Spikes, it is better to set up Spikes as they will have more of an effect. Something to watch out for is Arceus-Poison, as it can absorb your Toxic Spikes for free&mdash;it is smart to look carefully at Team Preview and evaluate what the opponent's Arceus forme could be for this reason. Lastly, two layers of Toxic Spikes can ruin Calm Mind Arceus formes and other grounded Pokemon that try to set up without you having to Toxic them manually, but bear in mind that bad poison only starts to outdo the damage from regular poison on the 4th turn that the opponent is out.

Team Options
========

Dialga sets up Stealth Rock and smashes Giratina-O with Draco Meteor, preventing it from Defogging, as its Shadow Sneak can cause Greninja problems. Things that appreciate Toxic Spikes and Spikes wearing down their checks and counters work nicely too. For example, Choice Specs Kyogre likes it when Arceus-Grass has to come in on Spikes and get poisoned, as with all the residual damage Water Spout can OHKO, and an advantage is that such a powerful Pokemon forces the opponent to choose between Defogging but getting OHKOed, and attacking. Choice Scarf Kyogre works fairly nicely too.

Other Taunt users such as Mewtwo and Darkrai prevent your entry hazards being removed. Yveltal cannot prevent Defog with Taunt as it is outsped by Defog Arceus, but it does have the benefit of being able to trample Giratina-O, dealing considerable damage with Dark Pulse, which is further enhanced by the Poison damage. U-turn Yveltal can also U-turn off of Deoxys-S into Greninja. Lastly, Yveltal appreciates the poison damage, which limits things that try to avoid Sucker Punch. Darkrai works better if you run Spikes only on Greninja, as the poison does not interfere with Dark Void, which can be a huge boon to offensive teams, but Darkrai is still more than usable alongside Toxic Spikes, and can also beat up on Giratina-O.

A Giratina-O of your own works nicely for a secondary spinblocker and walls the most prominent Rapid Spin user, Excadrill, and it wear down teams by dragging them through entry hazards with Dragon Tail. Icy Wind Gengar helps anti-lead Deoxys-S if you want to run both types of Spikes on Greninja, and also traps things for your offensive teammates. Gengar also appreciates the ability to Mega Evolve early vs opposing Deoxys-S offense teams too, which is very nice for checking Extreme Killer Arceus in particular (watch out for Psycho Boost from Deoxys, however). Other means of offensive pressure such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Geomancy Xerneas are appreciated as it prevents the opponent from Defogging or spinning (if they do, you get to set up for free).

Lastly, a Choice Scarf user to deal with lead Darkrai is appreciated, as it can easily put Greninja to sleep and break Greninja's Focus Sash with Bad Dreams. U-turn Genesect forces Darkrai out, as well as being able to U-turn off of Deoxys-S into Greninja, limiting it to one layer even if you are not running Night Slash. Other Choice Scarf users such as Zekrom and Xerneas can also deal with Darkrai and, in the latter's case, can catch it by surprise. However, it is advised to watch what you lock your Choice Scarf users into during the game, as you do not want to give free turns to the opponent so that they can Defog. Genesect works better in this aspect as it is hard to pin down thanks to U-turn (unlike Zekrom, for example, which can have Giratina-O or Arceus-Grass switch into Bolt Strike and get a chance to Defog).

Other Options
########

Haze can be used so that if your Focus Sash is intact mid- or late-game and something like Geomancy Xerneas sets up, Greninja can get rid of any boosts in an emergency. Hidden Power Fire lets Greninja dispose of Scizor, which can carry Defog. Ice Beam deals heavy damage to Giratina-O that try to Defog on Greninja. Protect blocks Kangaskhan's Fake Out, scouts Choice Scarf users, and gives Greninja an immunity to Giratina-O's Shadow Sneak, as well as preventing Defog and Rapid Spin that turn. Extrasensory lets Greninja win against Rapid Spin Tentacruel and, alongside Shadow Sneak, means that it can limit Scolipede to one layer of hazards. Rock Slide can be used to mess up Ho-Oh that try to break Greninja's Focus Sash with a Sacred Fire burn. Lastly, offensive sets with Life Orb and three or four attacking moves might seem good at first but are bad in Ubers due to Greninja's low 103 Special Attack, frailty, and susceptibility to priority.

Checks & Counters
########

**Defog Scizor**: Scizor can either 2HKO Greninja with Bullet Punch as it Taunts or Defog as Greninja sets up more layers, then Bullet Punch Greninja for a KO.

**Giratina-O**: Giratina-O can play games with Shadow Sneak and Defog, easily 2HKOing Greninja with Shadow Sneak if it Taunts, while Defogging away your hazards if you try to set more up or switch out. Greninja's Night Slash and Shadow Sneak also do a depressingly low amount of damage to Giratina-O.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Choice Scarf users outspeed Greninja and limit it to one layer of either hazard and chip damage with Shadow Sneak. Genesect can U-turn into a priority user to limit the layers Greninja can set up, with Zekrom being able to do the same with Volt Switch.

**Priority Users**: Priority users easily limit Greninja to one layer of entry hazards.

**Mega Kangaskhan**: Parental Bond allows Mega Kangaskhan to break through Greninja's Focus Sash, and it is immune to Shadow Sneak.

**Ho-Oh**: Any variant of Ho-Oh can bring Greninja down to its Focus Sash with Sacred Fire and beat it if it gets a burn, limiting it to one layer of entry hazards.
