Overview
########

Formerly crowned the "King of Ubers," Kyogre struggles to hold onto its title as the generation shift nerfed its metagame-defining ability, Drizzle. Five turns of rain is still more than enough for the leviathan to drown most of the metagame, and it can occasionally be enough to support Kyogre's teammates, but it no longer allows rain-dependent Pokemon to be consistently effective.

However, with its superb base 150 Special Attack, STAB moves that are boosted by rain, access to the incredibly powerful Water Spout, and excellent special bulk, Kyogre can perform a variety of offensive and defensive roles, ranging from a devastating wallbreaker to a powerful revenge killer to a sturdy wall that effortlessly shrugs off status.

Although versatile and effective in its roles, Kyogre is not without its shortcomings. Its base 90 Speed is low for an offensive threat, and its mediocre physical bulk leaves it vulnerable to powerful physical attackers. Furthermore, as Kyogre takes damage, its most powerful attack, Water Spout, weakens considerably. Nevertheless, Kyogre remains a major threat for teams to prepare for.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Water Spout
move 2: Surf / Scald
move 3: Thunder
move 4: Ice Beam
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========

Equipped with a Choice Scarf, Kyogre gains the Speed it needs to be a powerful revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Water Spout is immensely powerful at full health, outdamaging even super effective Thunders and Ice Beams. It is Kyogre's main move, and allows it to OHKO many Pokemon that lack a resistance to Water. Surf provides Kyogre with a consistent STAB move unaffected by Kyogre's remaining HP (Water Spout is weaker than Surf when Kyogre is below 60%). As an alternative to Surf, Kyogre can use Scald, which is weaker but occasionally punishes opposing Pokemon with a burn, or Hydro Pump, which has greater power, but an unreliable 80% accuracy.

Thunder gives Kyogre coverage against Flying-types and its fellow Water-types. It has perfect accuracy in the rain and a 30% paralysis rate, which can cripple switch-ins. Ice Beam rounds out Kyogre's coverage, hitting Grass- and Dragon-types super effectively.

Set Details
========

In order for Kyogre to revenge kill and clean effectively, Speed and Special Attack are maximized. A Modest nature is preferred, as it gives Kyogre additional power while still allowing it to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame, up to and including Mega Mewtwo Y. However, for teams that lack priority users to check Deoxys-A, Kyogre can use a Timid nature to outspeed it as well. A Timid nature also allows it to outspeed Adamant Mega Blaziken after a single Speed boost.

Usage Tips
========

Choice Scarf Kyogre can be very powerful, but it relies on Water Spout for a lot of its might. Since Water Spout weakens significantly as Kyogre loses HP, Kyogre should be switched in conservatively, and if possible, into non-attacking moves or after a Pokemon has fainted. A teammate's U-turn or Volt Switch can help get it in safely. Surf should be used instead of Water Spout against powerful priority users, as their attacks can weaken Kyogre enough for Surf to outdamage Water Spout. Ice Beam must be used carefully, as it is quite weak and often fails to OHKO even targets that take super effective damage, such as Zekrom, without it being somewhat weakened.

Team Options
========

Mega Gengar excels at trapping and eliminating many of Kyogre's checks, such as Grass Arceus and Chansey, allowing Kyogre to devastate teams lacking multiple Pokemon that resist Water-type moves. Bulky Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Fairy Arceus can check Palkia, the primary check to Kyogre.

Bulky Ground-types such as Groudon, Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Gliscor can help check the Electric-types and physical attackers that threaten Kyogre. Bulky Grass-types such as Grass Arceus and Ferrothorn resist both of Kyogre's weaknesses and appreciate Drizzle mitigating their weakness to Fire-type moves. Grass Arceus can also check Palkia in rain. Ho-Oh can check Grass-types and forms a powerful offensive duo with Kyogre.

Anti-hazard support such as Defog helps conserve Kyogre's HP and allows it to dish out powerful Water Spouts for as long as possible. Wish support from teammates such as Chansey, Blissey, or Sylveon is also highly beneficial to Kyogre for the same reason. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Zekrom, Thundurus, and Scizor can help Kyogre switch in safely.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Water Spout
move 2: Surf / Hydro Pump
move 3: Thunder
move 4: Ice Beam
item: Choice Specs
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Donning a pair of Choice Specs, Kyogre forgoes Speed in order to become one of the most terrifying wallbreakers in the game. Its monstrous power pinnacles in Water Spout, which is so destructive that many Pokemon that resist it, and even Chansey - the sturdiest special wall in the game - cannot avoid a 2HKO. Surf is considerably weaker, but is still powerful and allows Kyogre to remain a potent force at low health. Hydro Pump can be used for more power, allowing Kyogre to retain the 2HKO on Chansey when weakened, but has unreliable accuracy.

Thunder gives Kyogre coverage against Water- and Flying-types, while boasting perfect accuracy in rain and a 30% paralysis rate. Ice Beam serves as coverage against Grass- and Dragon-types.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Kyogre's offensive potential. A Timid nature is preferred, as Kyogre's rain-boosted STAB moves are so powerful that the drop is often insignificant. However, the additional power from a Modest nature can be helpful, especially for Kyogre's coverage moves. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Spe with a Modest nature can also be used, allowing Kyogre to survive more attacks from Pokemon that it cannot hope to outspeed.

Usage Tips
========

Choice Specs Kyogre has overwhelming power but is quite slow, and is therefore generally most effective when used in a hit-and-run fashion. Kyogre often forces switches when it is brought in on Pokemon that it outspeeds and can OHKO, or on Pokemon that it threatens far more than they threaten it. These free turns should be used to deal as much damage as possible before retreating. Once Kyogre's checks have been sufficiently worn down or eliminated, it can usually proceed to use Water Spout or Surf mindlessly. Water Spout should only be used when an opposing Pokemon cannot threaten Kyogre significantly, can be outsped and OHKOed, or is highly likely to switch out, as Kyogre can become a liability when locked into Water Spout at low health.

Team Options
========

Bulky Ground-types such as Groudon, Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Gliscor can check Electric-types and physical attackers, which are some of the main threats to Kyogre. Bulky Grass-types such as Grass Arceus and Ferrothorn resist the Electric- and Grass-type attacks that threaten Kyogre, while the rain it summons protects them from Fire-type attacks. In rain, Grass Arceus can also check Palkia effectively. Ho-Oh also resists Grass-type attacks and is a powerful physical wallbreaking counterpart to Kyogre. Bulky Fairy-types can also help Kyogre by checking Palkia, its main check.

Anti-hazard support, such as Defog, helps preserve Kyogre from hazard damage, which weakens its Water Spout. Kyogre also appreciates Wish support in order to maintain Water Spout's high power, as well as mitigate its inability to heal otherwise. Volt Switch and U-turn users can be used to bring Kyogre in safely and give it the momentum to devastate teams with Water Spout.

Paralysis or Tailwind support is very helpful, as Kyogre's middling Speed is one of its greatest weaknesses.

RestTalk
########
name: RestTalk
move 1: Scald
move 2: Roar
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

With maximum investment in HP and Special Defense, Kyogre becomes a durable special wall, capable of checking powerful threats such as Geomancy Xerneas. Scald allows Kyogre to wear down offensive Pokemon and spread burns, potentially crippling physical attackers that could overpower it. Kyogre can utilize Roar to prevent setup sweepers from taking advantage of it, and in tandem with entry hazard support, it can wear down its own checks. Rest allows Kyogre to restore health and remove status, giving it the longevity it needs to function as an effective wall, and Sleep Talk prevents opponents taking advantage of its turns spent asleep.

Set Details
========

A Calm nature and the given EVs maximize Kyogre's special bulk in order to allow it to absorb powerful special attacks. A spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD can be used to improve its physical defense while retaining great special bulk, allowing it to better check physical attackers, support Groudon, and both Mega Mewtwo formes.

Usage Tips
========

This set should be used not for offensive presence, but rather for longevity and durability. With enormous special bulk, a chance to burn opponents, Roar, and the ability to heal off damage and status, Kyogre is very difficult to overpower or wear down. However, it must be wary of physical and mixed attackers, as most powerful physical attacks will 2HKO it. Ideally, Rest should be used against Pokemon that can do little damage to Kyogre, as Kyogre is easier to take advantage of while asleep and must survive for two turns before it can use Rest again. Roar can be used on predicted switches to wear down Kyogre's checks with entry hazard damage.

Team Options
========

This Kyogre set is considerably weaker than the others and lacks coverage, as it focuses on walling threats. Entry hazards and Toxic users can considerably help wear down the opponents that take little damage from Scald. Some notable hazard setters are Landorus-T, Dialga, Groudon, and Ferrothorn. Good Toxic users include Landorus-T, Groudon, Ho-Oh, and defensive Yveltal.

Bulky Ground-types such as Groudon, Hippowdon, Landorus-T, and Gliscor have excellent synergy with Kyogre; it can absorb powerful special attacks, while they can absorb powerful physical attacks. Kyogre also resists the Ice- and Water-type moves they are weak to, while they are immune to the Electric-type moves that threaten Kyogre. Bulky Grass-types such as Grass Arceus and Ferrothorn also have excellent synergy with it, resisting both Grass- and Electric-type moves, while Kyogre resists Fire- and Ice-type moves. Ho-Oh also resists the Grass-type attacks that threaten Kyogre.

Thunder Wave
########
name: Thunder Wave
move 1: Thunder Wave
move 2: Surf
move 3: Thunder
move 4: Ice Beam
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpA
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Kyogre can effectively utilize Thunder Wave, as its good special bulk and ability to force switches allow it to easily spread paralysis. Surf is a powerful STAB move that heavily damages most Pokemon that do not resist it. Scald can also be used for its chance to burn opposing Pokemon, although this can occasionally interfere with Kyogre's attempts to paralyze opponents . Thunder hits Water- and Flying-types hard and has an additional 30% chance to paralyze, while Ice Beam breaks through Grass- and Dragon-types.

Set Details
========

The EVs and the Modest nature maximize Kyogre's power and bulk, as it will outspeed any paralyzed opponents. Hydro Pump can be used for additional power, although Surf is more consistent and this set is more focused on spreading paralysis than dealing damage. A Lum Berry can be used to allow Kyogre to function as a check to Darkrai or avoid status once, but the Leftovers recovery helps Kyogre spread paralysis for longer.

Usage Tips
========

As this set is uncommon, it has a surprise value that can help Kyogre cripple key threats with Thunder Wave. Because using Thunder Wave reveals the set, the first use of the move should be chosen carefully. Taking damage should be avoided early on if possible, as this allows Kyogre to bluff a Choice set. Thunder Wave must be used carefully if the opponent has Electric-type Pokemon, as they can use their paralysis immunity to switch in and force Kyogre out.

Team Options
========

Wish support from the likes of Chansey, Blissey, and Sylveon helps Kyogre spread paralysis for as long as possible, as even with bulk investment and Leftovers, Kyogre lacks much longevity.

As this set sacrifices significant offensive utility for the ability to spread paralysis, powerful wallbreakers such as Ho-Oh, Kyurem-W, and Zekrom pair well with it, as their main shortcoming, a lack of Speed, is mitigated by paralyzed opponents.

Other Options
########

Calm Mind allows Kyogre to become immensely powerful and specially bulky, and can be used on offensive sets with three attacks or more defensive sets alongside Rest and Sleep Talk. However, Kyogre's low Speed and exploitable Defense give it poor staying power, making the more immediate power of Choice Specs more appealing. The short duration of rain also hampers the utility of such sets, as they rely on staying on the field, sometimes for longer than the rain will last.

Substitute can be used to avoid status and ease prediction, but the loss of Water Spout hurts Kyogre's offensive capabilities. Furthermore, with only Leftovers recovery, Kyogre struggles to use Substitute repeatedly.

Blizzard can be used instead of Ice Beam for significantly greater power, but it is very unreliable due to its 70% accuracy.

Toxic can be used in a similar manner as Thunder Wave, but Kyogre is generally outclassed as a Toxic user and is more suitable to performing other roles.

Kyogre can hold a Damp Rock in order to extend the duration of rain to eight turns, but as Kyogre is rarely able to stay on the field for more than five turns and the item has far less utility than many others, a team must benefit from rain substantially for it to be worthwhile.

Checks & Counters
########

Choice Scarf and Choice Specs Kyogre are so powerful that teams almost invariably need solid checks to them, or at least a bulky Pokemon that resists Water and has ways to pressure Kyogre.

**Palkia**: Palkia can safely switch in on Kyogre, fearing only a boosted Thunder, and can threaten Kyogre with a powerful Thunder of its own. However, if Palkia lacks Rest, it will struggle against RestTalk Kyogre.

**Grass Arceus**: Grass Arceus shrugs off most of Kyogre's attacks with ease, threatens it with Grass Knot or Judgment, and has reliable recovery. However, Grass Arceus must beware of Mega Gengar, which can trap and eliminate it.

**Gastrodon**: Gastrodon hard counters any Kyogre set lacking Calm Mind and Ice Beam due to its bulk and immunity to both Water- and Electric-type moves, and it can wear Kyogre down with Toxic or retaliate with Mirror Coat. However, Gastrodon is highly situational and can be easily taken advantage of by other Pokemon.

*Ferrothorn**: Ferrothorn can switch into any move barring a Choice Specs Water Spout or Hydro Pump, and can wear Kyogre down with Leech Seed or threaten it with Power Whip, although Scald burns will hamper it.

**Amoonguss**: Amoonguss can effortlessly absorb any attack from Kyogre except a boosted Ice Beam, threaten it with Grass Knot, and heal itself with Regenerator. Major threats such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal can freely switch into it, though.

**Chansey/Blissey**: Chansey and Blissey avoid a 2HKO from any move outside of a Choice Specs-boosted Water Spout or Hydro Pump, and can wear Kyogre down with Toxic or Seismic Toss. However, they are vulnerable to being trapped and removed by Mega Gengar.

**Abomasnow**: Although Scald burns hamper it, (Mega) Abomasnow can switch in easily if Stealth Rock is absent, and wear down Kyogre with Leech Seed or threaten it with Wood Hammer or Grass Knot.

**Bulky Water-types**: Water Arceus and RestTalk Kyogre can safely switch into any move other than Thunder, but both struggle to hurt Kyogre in return. Since the five turn counter for rain is not replenished if a different Drizzle user is switched in, opposing Kyogre often only have limited turns to take advantage of the rain too.

**Giratina**: Specially defensive Giratina can absorb any attack but a boosted Ice Beam, but it struggles to do much to Kyogre in return.

**Dialga**: Support Dialga can survive any attack from Kyogre and hit hard with Thunder, but it will most often be unable to switch in safely.

**Zekrom**: Without prior damage, Zekrom can survive any attack but a Choice Specs-boosted Water Spout or Ice Beam and OHKO Kyogre with Bolt Strike.

**Groudon**: Even with significant investment in Special Defense, Groudon is heavily damaged by most of Kyogre's moves, but it can come in after Kyogre has KOed a Pokemon or act as an emergency check, destroying Kyogre's momentum thanks to Drought.

**Revenge Killers**: As Kyogre is fairly slow, many offensive Pokemon can revenge kill it once it has been sufficiently weakened. Choice Scarf Kyogre is outsped by many opposing Choice Scarf users such as Xerneas and Genesect. Powerful priority users such as Arceus, Yveltal, and Mega Kangaskhan can pick off Kyogre or severely weaken its Water Spout.

**Entry Hazards**: Entry hazards can help to weaken Kyogre's Water Spout, mitigating the threat it presents.
