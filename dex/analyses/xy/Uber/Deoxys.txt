Overview
########

When looking at Deoxys-N, one has to wonder what it could ever possibly be used for that would give it an advantage over its other formes. That is the problem; it has no advantages. The small gain in defenses it has over Deoxys-A is still nowhere near enough of a reason to merit its use seriously, especially when it is also sacrificing power. However, a small advantage of the defense boost is that it can survive Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out. Deoxys does still have very powerful 150 / 150 offenses and 150 base Speed, so by itself it is not a bad Pokemon. Its downfall is clearly shown when it's compared to its other formes, not having either the bulk and Speed of Deoxys-S or the tremendous power of Deoxys-A. In Generation 5 the only semi-viable set it had was a Dual Screens set, but thanks to the buff to Defog, which is now very common on most teams, even this set is now useless. This leaves Deoxys with no effective niche at all that can't already be accomplished by Deoxys-A or Deoxys-S, which unfortunately means that it is a completely useless Pokemon in the Ubers metagame.

Lead Hazards Setter / Anti-Lead
########
name: Useless
move 1: Psycho Boost
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Spikes
move 4: Magic Coat / Taunt / Hidden Power Fire
item: Focus Sash
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

This set is the most salvageable thing that can be done with Deoxys. Psycho Boost is the strongest STAB move that Deoxys can use, and it works very well on this set for denting support Arceus formes, other entry hazard leads, or opposing Defog users that try to stand in its way. Stealth Rock and Spikes are two great entry hazards that Deoxys can use effectively because its base 150 offenses and Speed can still force switches, allowing it to get hazards up without too many problems. The last moveslot is dependant on what you wish to achieve. Magic Coat can anti-lead Deoxys-S by bouncing back its Taunt or entry hazards, rendering it effectively useless and forcing it to switch out or attack Deoxys-N. Taunt can accomplish a similar feat, and works better on slower entry hazard setters like Groudon as they do not carry Magic Coat to stop the Taunt. Hidden Power Fire is an option that allows Deoxys to deal heavy damage to entry hazard setters rather than keeping their hazards away. It brings Forretress down to Sturdy and 2HKOes Ferrothorn while also having a high chance to OHKO physically defensive Mega Scizor after Stealth Rock damage, which can be a good lure as Bullet Punch from Scizor is unable to OHKO Deoxys.

Set Details
========

Deoxys has to be as fast as possible, so run 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature. Timid does not cause any harm to Deoxys's already pitiful defenses and as no physical attacks are being used, Timid is the best choice. Maximize Special Attack to get the most from Psycho Boost and Hidden Power Fire, and add the rest to HP. Focus Sash means that Deoxys is guaranteed to get up at least one layer of entry hazards.

Usage Tips
========

This Deoxys set is rather easy to use. Lead with it and aim to Taunt opposing leads or possible setup sweepers, or get up Stealth Rock first, then possibly Spikes should the opponent offer no resistance. If you think Deoxys is about to go down, Psycho Boost the enemy.

Team Options
========

Firstly, the use of Deoxys is highly discouraged due to its lack of advantages over Deoxys-A or Deoxys-S. Should you choose to run Deoxys however, it doesn't tend to need support, as it is usually the one that's giving it. Instead, opt for teammates that can benefit from entry hazards to ensure a sweep, such as Mega Blaziken or Extreme Killer Arceus. This Deoxys set suits hyper offensive teams very well as an entry hazard setter that can also provide great offensive pressure. Mega Gengar is great to stop the opponent from using Defog to remove Deoxys's entry hazards, as it can trap them, Taunt them, or just eliminate them. An answer to Yveltal is necessary on teams with Deoxys leads, as it's immune to Psycho Boost and takes little damage from Hidden Power Fire. Yveltal can also Taunt Deoxys, leaving it with no options other than to switch out.

Useless
########
name: Still Useless
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Psycho Boost
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Hidden Power Fire
item: Mind Plate
evs: 88 Def / 240 SpA / 180 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

While this set does look laughable, it takes advantage of Deoxys's small defensive boost over Deoxys-A and puts it into practical use. Thanks to Deoxys's Speed, it can effectively get a Calm Mind boost before anything can touch it, giving the element of surprise and even letting it survive some powerful special attacks, such as Choice Scarf Kyogre's Ice Beam and Thunder. A Calm Mind boosted Psycho Boost from Deoxys can be terrifyingly powerful, easily OHKOing Groudon, Xerneas, Zekrom, and offensive variants of Palkia. If Stealth Rock is in play, the potential grows larger. After Stealth Rock damage, a +1 Psycho Boost can OHKO Ho-Oh, Kyogre, Giratina-O, and even Extreme Killer Arceus! Shadow Ball is used for coverage, hitting Mewtwo and Giratina for solid damage. Hidden Power Fire can OHKO Pokemon such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, and if Stealth Rock is up, Hidden Power Fire can also OHKO Skarmory and Forretress at +1 due to Sturdy being broken.

Set Details
========

The EVs may seem unconventional, but they take advantage of how Deoxys is able to survive unboosted priority attacks and use that to its advantage. 88 Defense EVs allow Deoxys to survive an unboosted Extreme Speed from Adamant Extreme Killer Arceus if they are not carrying a damage boosting item and are instead running Lum Berry, while also allowing Deoxys to take hits such as Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor and Mega Lucario. 180 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allows Deoxys to outspeed everything up to and including Mega Mewtwo Y. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack.

Usage Tips
========

Use Calm Mind when Deoxys is given a free opportunity, such as an opponent setting up entry hazards or boosts, and then punish them with Psycho Boost. Deoxys can survive some weak neutral hits, such as Bullet Punch from Mega Scizor or Ice Beam from Kyogre, so if you think that Deoxys can survive a predicted attack, take the opportunity to Calm Mind there as well. With this set, Deoxys is very prone to being revenge killed, as it can't take any strong attacks and is forced out, so be on the lookout for Choice Scarf users such as Zekrom and Genesect. Don't be too greedy with Calm Mind boosts; Deoxys only needs one to be more powerful than Deoxys-A, and after one Calm Mind, Deoxys has all the tools it needs to blow a hole in the opposing team.

Team Options
========

This set fits well on balanced or offensive teams that need a small trump card, as after Deoxys gets a Calm Mind boost, something is more than likely going down on the enemy team. Wobbuffet can be a good partner to this set, as it can Encore support moves to provide a free setup opportunity for Deoxys. Using Wobbuffet can stack Dark weaknesses, which means that a Yveltal check is absolutely needed, as it provides huge trouble for this Deoxys set. Having a Defog user can be beneficial as well, as entry hazards can bring Deoxys into the KO range for the priority attacks that it could originally survive.

Other Options
########

Generation 5's Dual Screens set is still possible, but it is not worth the effort thanks to Defog. An all-out attacker set is certainly possible, but is completely outclassed by Deoxys-A. Counter can take advantage of the small fact that Deoxys can survive a Bullet Punch from Scizor or Mega Lucario and retaliate back, but is a rather gimmicky option that has limited use. On the Calm Mind set, Nasty Plot could be swapped for Calm Mind, turning Deoxys into an extremely powerful nuke, but it loses the Special Defense increase that Calm Mind gives, leaving it more vulnerable defensively.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dark-types**: Dark-types such as Yveltal, Darkrai, and Dark Arceus can easily take advantage of Deoxys to set up as they are immune to Psycho Boost. Tyranitar can also bring Deoxys down to its Focus Sash and let the sandstorm damage finish it off. Dark-types are also the biggest enemy of the Calm Mind set.

**Defog Users**: Defog users such as Giratina-O can effectively deal with Deoxys's entry hazards set and take out Deoxys with Shadow Sneak before it can get more up, but must beware of the Calm Mind set as it can leave a huge dent in most Defog users.

**Priority Users**: Priority users can easily take out Deoxys as it has no room for priority of its own, limiting Deoxys to one layer of entry hazards before being knocked out or forced to switch. While the Calm Mind set does survive some forms of priority, it cannot avoid being OHKOed from Giratina-O's Shadow Sneak or Yveltal's Sucker Punch.

**Multi-Hit Moves**: Users of multi-hit moves such as Scolipede (Pin Missile) and Cloyster (Icicle Spear, and Rock Blast) can pierce through Deoxys's Focus Sash and leave Deoxys with only one entry hazard up.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Choice Scarf users such as Genesect and Xerneas can outspeed Deoxys and limit its hazard laying. They can easily revenge kill the Calm Mind set as well.

**Mega Kangaskhan**: Mega Kangaskhan's ability, Parental Bond, can pierce through Focus Sash and OHKO Deoxys with no problem. However, Deoxys does survive a Fake Out.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types resist Psycho Boost and can check Deoxys if it's not carrying Hidden Power Fire. Aegislash is a notable example, as its Shadow Sneak will either KO Deoxys or bring it down to its Focus Sash.

**Magic Coat Users**: Anti-leads such as Deoxys-S can bounce a Taunt back to Deoxys, or entry hazards onto its own side of the field, preventing Deoxys from doing its job.
