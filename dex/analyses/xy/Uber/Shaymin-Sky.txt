Overview
########

Shaymin-S is one of the great pioneers of the "60% = 100%" bias, and it returns to prove itself in Ubers once again. With the combination of Seed Flare and Air Slash, Shaymin-S can break through special walls with Special Defense drops and secure KOs by repeatedly flinching its targets. With an excellent base 127 Speed, Mewtwo, Mega Gengar, Deoxys-A, and Deoxys-S are the only unboosted threats that can catch up to it. In addition, an immunity to Sticky Web furthers its usefulness on a team. Though Shaymin-S's Special Attack stat might seem average, Seed Flare's side effect can remedy it quite nicely. Unfortunately, Shaymin-S's subpar defensive typing and frailty hold it back from switching in whenever it wants, and its weakness to Stealth Rock compounds with this, even with the popularity of Defog users. Also, Shaymin-S has somewhat sparse coverage options, and its STAB moves don't provide much coverage. Regardless, Shaymin-S can utilize Serene Grace very efficiently to wreak havoc.

SubSeed
########
name: SubSeed
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Leech Seed
move 3: Seed Flare
move 4: Air Slash
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

With Substitute, Shaymin-S can take advantage of the switches it forces against bulky Water-types and Ground-types to shield itself from damage and status. Leech Seed works well with Substitute as the move increases Shaymin-S's survivability and replenishes its health against walls and tanks. With a high Base Power and an 80% chance to reduce the target's Special Defense stat by two stages, Seed Flare helps Shaymin-S bypass special walls. Air Slash completes Shaymin-S's STAB combination, has an incredibly handy chance to flinch the opponent, and can be a reliable move to spam when Substitute and Leech Seed have been used.

Set Details
=========

A Timid nature and maximum Speed investment allow Shaymin-S to set up Substitutes quickly and proceed to spam Seed Flare. Due to Shaymin-S's slight reliance on Seed Flare to deal damage, maximum Special Attack investment is highly recommended. The remaining four EVs are placed into Special Defense to grant it a minuscule buffer against special attacks. Leftovers is the chosen item as it works well in tandem with Substitute and Leech Seed, passively restoring Shaymin-S's HP.

Usage Tips
=========

One of the rules of thumb when using Substitute is to stay on top of predicted switches in order to gain setup opportunities. This is important as Shaymin-S can force out threats such as Groudon, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and even the mighty Kyogre, and set up a Substitute for free. Try using Substitute to scout for super effective coverage moves, and try to use it before using Leech Seed, as to avoid taking damage from attacks. When using the two moves, choose Substitute when you feel an offensive threat is coming in to scout out its set, and use Leech Seed if you think a defensive Pokemon or phazer is coming in so that Shaymin-S can score some passive damage. Shaymin-S's STAB moves have mediocre coverage, but they are very threatening and spammable, so fire away when needed. Try to avoid Steel-types, priority users, and possible phazers unless Shaymin-S has a Substitute up (for Steel-types and priority users) or can flee with Leech Seed in effect (against phazers).

Team Options
=========

Though it is a rage-inducing soloist most of the time, Shaymin-S has many potential allies. The primary ones are VoltTurn users such as Thundurus, Genesect, and Zekrom, which can gain momentum and bring Shaymin-S in on a fleeing opponent. Groudon is a very solid partner for Shaymin-S, as it can set up Stealth Rock and check Ho-Oh, Skarmory, and Scizor with the right moves. Mega Gengar can trap Steel-types and cripple them with Taunt, leaving them vulnerable to Shaymin-S's shenanigans. Yveltal is a solid partner, as it can smash many common Steel-types and assist Shaymin-S with Taunt and U-turn. Heatran is a very helpful partner as it can provide Stealth Rock support as well as lure out Ground-type attacks and Pokemon for Shaymin-S to switch in and set up on. Entry hazard setters such as Forretress, Ferrothorn, Dialga, and Landorus-T are also crucial to Shaymin-S's success, as Stealth Rock and/or Spikes can allow it to finish off and defeat support Arceus formes and Ho-Oh. Entry hazard removal is equally important, as Shaymin-S wants to switch in as much as it can, so Defog users such as Arceus and Giratina and spinners such as Excadrill and Forretress can help out in this regard. Shaymin-S can support the aforementioned teammates with Leech Seed to increase their recovery and longevity.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Seed Flare
move 2: Air Slash
move 3: Earth Power / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Healing Wish
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

When equipped with Life Orb, Shaymin-S can be a dangerous attacker capable of fending for itself when needed. Seed Flare deals good damage with the boost from Life Orb, and nothing likes switching into it in fear of a Special Defense drop. Earth Power is Shaymin-S's main move for defeating Steel-types that wall its STAB combination, and has a 20% chance to lower the opponent's Special Defense. Hidden Power Fire can be run so that Shaymin-S can defeat Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Forretress, and Scizor that don't care too much about Earth Power. If Shaymin-S is not useful or cannot deal enough damage to the opponent, it can utilize Healing Wish, a support move that only a few Pokemon have access to. Healing Wish allows Shaymin-S to sacrifice itself in order to restore a damaged sweeper, pivot, or revenge killer to full health. Though unlisted, Hidden Power Rock allows Shaymin-S to heavily damage or KO Ho-Oh, and can reliably damage other Flying-types due to the boost from Life Orb.

Set Details
========

With a Timid nature, Shaymin-S outspeeds most of the unboosted tier, and with Life Orb, its damage output is very acceptable. A Modest nature can be used for additional power, but doing so sacrifices Shaymin-S's ability to outspeed max Speed Arceus formes and Darkrai. In terms of EVs, Shaymin-S should not deviate from the given spread, as its Speed and power are too precious to give up.

Usage Tips
========

When attacking, don't be afraid to mispredict with Shaymin-S's STAB moves, as they are extremely spammable and are backed by Life Orb. Seed Flare is often the best move to use unless a Steel-type that checks Shaymin-S is on the opposing team. However, be wary of the damage that Life Orb induces, as the recoil could reduce Shaymin-S's HP to the point that a priority user such as Yveltal, Scizor, or Extreme Killer Arceus could revenge kill it with ease. As a result, try to avoid priority users as much as possible, as Shaymin-S's frailty combined with Life Orb recoil can turn it into a high-priority target.

Team Options
========

As with any offensive threat, Shaymin-S can take advantage of entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field with its offensive pressure to rack up residual damage. Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T, Dialga, and Groudon in addition to Spikes setters such as Forretress and Ferrothorn will obviously help greatly in this regard. Entry hazards on Shaymin-S's side of the field are detrimental, so Defog users such as Arceus and Giratina as well as spinners like Forretress and Excadrill are beneficial partners. Even with Earth Power or Hidden Power Fire, Shaymin-S needs extra support against Steel-types. Therefore, Fire-types such as Ho-Oh, stallbreakers like Yveltal, and even Darkrai can assist Shaymin-S. VoltTurn is a safe method for bringing Shaymin-S in: Thundurus, Zekrom, and Genesect can grab momentum for the team and provide utility. Lastly, lures for Ground-types can bring Shaymin-S in safely; in particular, Heatran excels at this role with its 4x weakness to Ground-type attacks.

Other Options
########

Shaymin-S has a relatively solid set of options to choose from when thinking outside the box. A Choice Specs or Choice Scarf set is one that comes to mind quickly, as the former can provide immense wallbreaking power with Seed Flare, while the latter's increased Speed can help it revenge kill even boosted threats like Rock Polish Groudon. However, Shaymin-S dislikes being locked into a move, and the Choice Scarf set lacks power. Shaymin-S has a boosting move in Swords Dance, which complements its great Speed, but its physical movepool is more barren than a Ditto's expression, with only Seed Bomb and Return as options. In terms of filler options, Shaymin-S has access to the rare Aromatherapy, which can allow it to function as an offensive cleric that can take on opposing walls with Seed Flare. Shaymin-S has Dazzling Gleam, which can deal solid damage to Dark- and Dragon-types, but a neutral Seed Flare hits them for roughly the same amount of damage. Shaymin-S has a large arsenal of other Grass-type moves at its disposal. Leaf Storm can provide more immediate power but reduces Shaymin-S's Special Attack, Energy Ball has more PP and accuracy than Seed Flare does, and Giga Drain can restore its health. However, the sheer utility and usefulness Seed Flare has to offer causes it to greatly overshadow these options. Finally, Shaymin-S can utilize Toxic to cripple walls and Defog users, and can run it in tandem with SubSeed. Keep in mind though that Shaymin-S's moveset is relatively cramped and Toxic can be run on a bulkier team member.

Checks and Counters
#########

**Ho-Oh**: Ho-Oh is a large threat with its massive special bulk, 4x resistance to Seed Flare, and ability to KO Shaymin-S with Sacred Fire and Brave Bird. However, if Stealth Rock is up and/or Shaymin-S has Hidden Power Rock, Ho-Oh will go down without too much of a hassle.

**Mega Gengar**: With its resistance to Seed Flare, access to Taunt, and greater Speed, Mega Gengar can easily check Shaymin-S. It can trap and KO Shaymin-S without trouble, but it must be wary of Earth Power as it Mega Evolves.

**Levitating Steel-types**: Skarmory and Bronzong cause a great deal of trouble for Shaymin-S. Although Shaymin-S can do almost nothing to Bronzong, it can hit Skarmory with Hidden Power Fire for good damage.

**Scizor**: If Shaymin-S does not carry Hidden Power Fire, Scizor can switch in on a Seed Flare and pick it off with a Technician-boosted Bullet Punch.

**Dialga**: Dialga usually carries Special Defense investment, can take all of Shaymin-S's attacks bar Earth Power, and can deal severe damage to it with Draco Meteor.

**Charizard**: As both have a 4x resistance to Seed Flare, Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y can switch in on the move and threaten to KO Shaymin-S with their STAB Fire-type attacks. However, both are vulnerable to being flinched repeatedly by Air Slash, Mega Charizard X falls to Earth Power, and Mega Charizard Y does not like Hidden Power Rock.

**Heatran**: Heatran can hard wall Shaymin-S due to its typing and Flash Fire, and can KO it with Lava Plume. However, it doesn't stand a chance if Shaymin-S has Earth Power.

**Zekrom**: Zekrom's typing allows it to switch into any move Shaymin-S has bar Earth Power and threaten Shaymin-S greatly with Bolt Strike. It can also use Volt Switch after Shaymin-S is forced out.

**Kyurem-W**: Shaymin-S cannot switch into Kyurem-W's devastating attacks, and Kyurem-W does not take too much damage from Shaymin-S's coverage options.

**Sylveon**: Sylveon's great special bulk and ability to attack through Substitute with Hyper Voice can annoy Shaymin-S.

**Blissey**: Blissey can take any hit the All-Out Attacker set can throw at it. However, it is complete setup fodder for the SubSeed set, and loans incomprehensible amounts of HP through Leech Seed.

**Lugia**: Shaymin-S cannot hit Lugia hard enough without Hidden Power Rock or Stealth Rock up, whereas Lugia can heal itself with Roost and threaten Shaymin-S with Aeroblast.

**Revenge Killers**: Revenge killers are probably the biggest thorn in Shaymin-S's side and the best ways to deal with it. Choice Scarf users such as Kyogre and Genesect as well as priority users like Yveltal and Extreme Killer Arceus can take advantage of Shaymin-S's poor bulk and KO it easily.

**Stealth Rock**: Stealth Rock prevents Shaymin-S from switching in freely without losing 25% of its health, and can rack up residual damage over the course of the match.

**Status**: Paralysis utterly cripples Shaymin-S, preventing it from taking advantage of its great Speed stat and leaving it open to opposing attacks. Shaymin-S also dislikes Toxic and burns, as the residual damage leaves it more vulnerable to revenge killing.

However, keep in mind that many of the aforementioned Pokemon cannot take on Shaymin-S as if it were like any other special attacker. This is because Seed Flare can reduce its opponent's Special Defense to the point where a coverage move can easily cripple or KO it.
