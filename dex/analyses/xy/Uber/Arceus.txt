Overview
########

With the strongest priority in the Ubers tier, fantastic 120 base stats across the board, and a wide array of coverage moves, Arceus-Normal makes for a fantastic late-game sweeper that can easily set up and sweep mid- or late-game once its checks and counters have been even slightly weakened. However, a huge part of Arceus-Normal's viability also comes from its ability to serve as a very strong revenge killer for its team, taking out weakened offensive threats with its Life Orb Extreme Speed. Arceus-Normal also pairs well with Primal Groudon both offensively and defensively, with the two breaking physical walls for each other or Primal Groudon simply providing Stealth Rock support, Lava Pluming physical walls, and absorbing Will-O-Wisp. Arceus-Normal also fares well against opposing Primal Groudon due to the latter's weakness to Ground, allowing Arceus-Normal to break through with Earthquake. Arceus-Normal also appreciates the decline of Will-O-Wisp Support Arceus, non-Primal Groudon, and Landorus-T in the generation transition, competent checks in XY. However, a new check in Mega Salamence has been introduced, and old checks such as Mega Gengar are still viable. The indirect rise of Arceus-Ghost due to Latias and Latios is not particularly appreciated either.

Extreme Killer
########
name: Extreme Killer
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Extreme Speed
move 3: Shadow Claw / Stone Edge
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Multitype
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance grants Arceus-Normal the ability to double its Attack, allowing it to OHKO various Pokemon such as Mewtwo and offensive Yveltal with little or no prior damage. Extreme Speed allows Arceus-Normal to bypass Speed tiers and Choice Scarf users, and it can and should be used to revenge kill offensive Pokemon such as Darkrai, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Blaziken once they have been even slightly weakened. Earthquake should be used to break through Primal Groudon as well as Steel- and Rock-types, namely Dialga, Arceus-Rock, and Mega Diancie, while Shadow Claw is used to break through Lugia and Ghost-types, namely Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O. Stone Edge is an equally viable alternate option to Shadow Claw that can be used to break through Lugia, defensive Yveltal, Mega Salamence and Ho-Oh with one moveslot.

Various other coverage moves can be used in lieu of Shadow Claw, Stone Edge or Earthquake, although Earthquake is often nigh-on mandatory. Ice Beam takes out Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock, OHKOes the albeit rare Landorus-T and Gliscor after Stealth Rock as well, and can also 2HKO non-Primal Groudon. Overheat or Fire Blast can be used to blow Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor away, with Fire Blast also 2HKOing regular Groudon thanks to Drought. Lastly, Shadow Force can be used to OHKO Arceus-Ghost and Giratina-O as well as block Defog, but bear in mind it is easy for the opponent to switch in something that resists or is immune to Ghost during the charge turn, and Lugia is also given a free turn to Roost back to full health and reactivate Multiscale.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Arceus to at worst Speed tie with opposing Arceus. Life Orb grants a significant power boost to all its attacks. Either Silk Scarf or Lum Berry can be used alongside an Adamant nature and a more bulky spread of 240 HP / 252 Atk / 16 Spe or 200 HP / 252 Atk / 56 Spe, with 16 Speed outspeeding neutral max Speed base 90s and 56 Speed outspeeding Adamant Rayquaza. Investing heavily in HP makes Arceus a lot bulkier, allowing it to set up more easily, and a Lum Berry allows Arceus to absorb a Will-O-Wisp or a Dark Void.

Usage Tips
========

Don't just use Arceus-Normal late-game, as it's an amazing revenge killer that can take out dangerous opposing threats when they are weakened. Do not set up whilst checks are still healthy, as you should be using teammates to wear them down to the point where Arceus can OHKO them and avoid taking damage or status. You should wear down Will-O-Wisp users as well.

Similarly, do not set up on something like Primal Kyogre's Origin Pulse, as Arceus-Normal takes a huge amount of damage and can no longer sweep due to it being in range of opposing priority attacks, as well as being able to take fewer turns of Life Orb recoil. Setting up on things like Latios's -2 Draco Meteor is smarter, as it means Arceus-Normal doesn't get blasted on the turn it sets up.

When revenge killing bulky opposing threats, it is necessary to deal significant damage to them as they set up so that Arceus-Normal can revenge kill them easily. Foes such as Primal Groudon, Xerneas, and Mega Salamence need to be significantly weakened in order for Extreme Speed to KO them after you sacrifice a Pokemon to bring Arceus in safely. For Pokemon like Darkrai, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Blaziken, only a slight amount of prior damage is needed to push them into Extreme Speed range, but it is wise to calculate whether they will fall to Extreme Speed or not before trying to revenge kill them.

Team Options
========

Primal Groudon absorbs burns for Arceus-Normal while setting up Stealth Rock and potentially weakening Lugia with either Lava Plume burns, Toxic, or Stone Edge. Darkrai or Yveltal can be double switched into Arceus-Ghost, Giratina-O, and Lugia, either KOing them or forcing them out and making them take more entry hazard damage the next time they come in. Shadow Ball Mega Gengar can trap checks such as Lugia and severely weaken Arceus-Ghost as well, and can it also run Hidden Power Fire for Ferrothorn or Mega Scizor. Xerneas can easily switch into defensive Yveltal, with Choice Scarf and Geomancy Xerneas both working very well on the kinds of teams Arceus-Normal finds itself on. Healing Wish Latias can be used to bring Arceus-Normal back for a second go at the opponent's team as well.

How Refreshing
########
name: How Refreshing
move 1: Refresh
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Extreme Speed
move 4: Shadow Claw
ability: Multitype
item: Silk Scarf
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Refresh allows Arceus-Normal to absorb Will-O-Wisp and heal it easily. Swords Dance doubles Arceus's Attack, with Extreme Speed being the obvious STAB move of choice. Shadow Claw lets Arceus-Normal break through Arceus-Ghost, Giratina-O, and Lugia.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed investment should be used so that Arceus-Normal can at worst Speed tie with opposing Arceus formes. Silk Scarf boosts the power of Extreme Speed without causing recoil damage.

Usage Tips
========

Don't just use Arceus-Normal late-game; it's an amazing revenge killer that can take out weakened threats. Refresh Arceus should also be used as an Arceus-Ghost check, as the ability to absorb Will-O-Wisp and an immunity to Ghost-type Judgment means Arceus can set up Swords Dances on it and, with some luck, break through Arceus-Ghost without being burned at the end of the exchange. Don't be afraid to let Arceus-Normal take a Will-O-Wisp or a Toxic if it lets Arceus-Normal KO something important, as the status can always be Refreshed away later.

Setting up on a powerful attack, such as Mega Salamence's Return or Double Edge, is a bad idea, as Arceus takes a huge amount of damage and can no longer sweep effectively due to it being severely weakened and in the range of opposing priority. Setting up on a Pokemon that Arceus-Normal forces out, such as a Pokemon Choice-locked into a move that cannot deal much damage to Arceus-Normal, works nicely.

Team Options
========

Primal Groudon absorbs burns for Arceus-Normal, sets up Stealth Rock, and, most importantly, blows every Steel-type away with either Earthquake, Fire Punch, or Lava Plume. Again, Dark-types such as Darkrai and Yveltal are appreciated to help with Arceus-Ghost, Giratina-O, and Lugia, although, with some luck, Arceus-Normal can break Arceus-Ghost itself. Mega Gengar can trap checks such as Lugia and severely weakens Arceus-Ghost as well, and it can trap Steel-types that would wall Arceus-Normal, disposing of them with Focus Blast or Hidden Power Fire. Blaziken or its Mega Evolution tramples Steel-types and can weaken Salamence for Arceus-Normal or vice versa. Ho-Oh beats up on physical walls, reduces Steel-types to molten slag, and softens Primal Groudon for Arceus-Normal.

Palkia is an interesting option, as it can remove Ferrothorn with Fire Blast, switches into defensive Primal Kyogre, and can also lure in support Arceus-Ghost to paralyze it with Thunder Wave, allowing Arceus-Normal to break through it much more easily.

Xerneas and Klefki deal with defensive Yveltal, with the former providing a strong offensive presence that scares Giratina-O away and potentially also providing additional cleric support should Arceus-Normal not find a turn to Refresh, and the latter setting up Spikes and spreading paralysis and poison to cripple the opposing team, while also walling Lugia.

Lastly, Latias or Latios with Hidden Power Fire can lure in and dispose of Ferrothorn and Scizor, with Latias also being able to use Healing Wish to bring Arceus-Normal back for a second go at the opponent's team.


Other Options
########

Choice Band + Trick gives Arceus-Normal an initially stronger Extreme Speed, and lets it potentially cripple certain checks, but leaves it at the mercy of Mega Gengar should it get trapped while locked into an unfavorable move. Wallceus is a defensive set that benefits from Normal's sole weakness to a very uncommon type in Ubers, and it can run moves such as Ice Beam and Earth Power alongside Will-O-Wisp and Recover so that Arceus can KO some of the things it is supposed to be checking, such as Rayquaza, Salamence and Primal Groudon. 56 Speed EVs should be used to outspeed Adamant Rayquaza, with maximum HP investment and the rest being poured into Defense along with a Bold nature.

Checks & Counters
########

**Arceus-Ghost**: Arceus-Ghost can at worst Speed tie with Arceus-Normal if both are running maximum Speed, survives a +2 Shadow Claw, and cripples Arceus-Normal with Will-O-Wisp. It can falter against Refresh variants, however. Focus Blast Arceus-Ghost is capable of dealing immediate damage to Arceus-Normal as well.

**Defensive Yveltal**: Yveltal survives anything except +2 Life Orb Stone Edge, which has a small chance to OHKO from full health and is a guaranteed KO after Stealth Rock. Yveltal can OHKO +2 Arceus-Normal in return with Black Glasses-boosted Foul Play or KO with Foul Play after Stealth Rock damage, a round of Rocky Helmet recoil or a round of Life Orb recoil.

**Giratina-Origin**: With proper investment, Giratina-O can survive a +2 Shadow Claw after Stealth Rock and can either cripple Arceus-Normal with Will-O-Wisp or phaze it with Dragon Tail.

**Lugia**: Lugia is insurmountable if its Multiscale is intact, easily phazing Arceus-Normal. It can also Roost back to Multiscale even while taking +2 Shadow Claws. However, +2 Life Orb Stone Edge can OHKO after Stealth Rock.

**Will-O-Wisp Arceus**: Arceus formes such as Ground and Fairy can take a +2 attack and burn Arceus-Normal with Will-O-Wisp, crippling it. Arceus-Rock resists Extreme Speed but risks losing the speed tie and getting KOed by +2 Earthquake.

**Sableye**: Sableye can Prankster Will-O-Wisp to cripple Arceus and can deal severe damage with Foul Play, OHKOing if Arceus tries to Swords Dance again after getting burned. Mega Sableye can also take a +2 Life Orb Earthquake and retaliate with Foul Play or Will-O-Wisp.

**Salamence**: With Intimidate before Mega Evolving and huge physical bulk after Mega Evolving, Salamence can win one-on-one if Stealth Rock is not on the field, 2HKOing with Return or at worst dealing huge damage with Double-Edge or Return. It falls to Ice Beam or boosted Stone Edge after Stealth Rock damage, however.

**Mega Gengar**: Mega Gengar outspeeds Arceus-Normal and can either heavily damage it with Focus Blast or give its life to take Arceus-Normal down with Destiny Bond. It is outsped and KOed by Jolly variants if it has not already Mega Evolved, however.

**Skarmory, Ferrothorn and Scizor**: Skarmory completely walls any Arceus variant without a Fire move, phazing it while barely taking a scratch. Scizor can take a +2 Earthquake reasonably well and deal heavy damage to Arceus with Superpower. Ferrothorn can rack up residual damage on Arceus-Normal with Leech Seed, Iron Barbs, and Protect, but it does not take +2 Earthquake very well and runs the risk of letting Arceus set up Swords Dance on its Protects. All three of these Steel-types are also promptly KOed by Fire Blast or Overheat.

**Unaware Clefable**: Physically defensive Unaware Clefable ignores any Swords Dance boosts, takes less than half from Extremespeed, and can slowly stall Arceus-Normal out with either Moonblast or Toxic.

**Choice Scarf Genesect**: Genesect resists Extreme Speed and can either deal heavy damage with Explosion or revenge kill a very weak Arceus-Normal with a faster Extreme Speed.
