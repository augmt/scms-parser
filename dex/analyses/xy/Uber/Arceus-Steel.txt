Overview
########

When equipped with an Iron Plate, Arceus takes on a more rigid incarnation, sporting resistances to eleven of the eighteen types. This, combined with his base 120 / 120 / 120 defenses, makes him the most defensive of not only all of the Arceus formes, but also of the majority of all Pokemon. This is very helpful in a metagame infested with Dragon-types; their most powerful unboosted STAB moves don't come even close to a 3HKO, let alone a 2HKO. He also has an immunity to Poison, and by extension Toxic, meaning that his sweeping sets are less restricted than most other sweepers. Additionally, his STAB moves are now more potent than before, as they hit Fairy-types super effectively.

While all of this very beneficial to a Pokemon that likes to go offensive, there are a few things that hold Steel Arceus back from being unstoppable. The rise in usage of Blaziken and Ho-Oh means he can't easily establish an offensive presence. Furthermore, checking Xerneas is somewhat troublesome, as it often runs Focus Blast as a coverage move. Nevertheless, Steel Arceus is a force to be reckoned with, and he must be prepared for if you don't want to be annihilated.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Judgment
move 3: Will-O-Wisp / Thunder / Substitute
move 4: Recover
ability: Multitype
item: Iron Plate
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Calm Mind Steel Arceus is unique from other offensive Arceus formes in that he is immune to Toxic, meaning his sweep can't be cut short by bad poison. Judgment is his strongest special STAB move, and after a Calm Mind boost, it does considerable damage to Xerneas, even after a Geomancy. Will-O-Wisp is useful for inflicting residual damage on opponents that don't mind taking a Judgment, and it is notable for countering Mega Kangaskhan. Alternatively, if Ho-Oh is a major concern for you, Thunder can be used, and it offers a respectable damage output after a boost. For the last move, Recover is preferred, as it gives Steel Arceus more longevity and time to set up. Roar is another option that can help win wars with opposing Calm Mind Arceus, as well as phazing out specially defensive Kyogre and Palkia that try to do the same. Substitute can protect Steel Arceus from being revenge killed, and blocks Wil-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, moves which can irritate Steel Arceus otherwise.

Set Details
========

Calm Mind Steel Arceus should run maximum investment in HP and Speed if he runs Roar in order to survive a hit and successfully phaze out the opponent. If not running Roar, then it is best to have at least 176 EVs in Speed to outspeed Mega Gengar, leaving 80 EVs free. Alternatively, if Mega Gengar is not your top priority, consider 112 EVs in Speed to outspeed Pokemon with base 100 Speed and Garchomp. By doing that, 144 EVs will be left over to put into other stats.

Usage Tips
========

Calm Mind Arceus Steel is not meant to sweep as much as he is meant to tank hits while taking out foes. In fact, he functions almost like a support Arceus, because he has access to a great defensive typing that provides a Poison immunity, doesn't mind burn's Attack drop, and can cripple physical attackers Will-O-Wisp. Therefore, when sending out Steel Arceus, it is initially best to treat him as a support Arceus, and only afterward, when his checks and counters have been eliminated, should he start boosting for a clean finish. Setting up prematurely is not preferred, as it will most likely attract phazers who will render his boosts useless. However, boosting too late in the game can also have negative consequences, like being setup bait for opposing sweepers. For this reason, if Steel Arceus can take out an opponent, it's best that he does so. Finally, he should not begin to set up until Ho-Oh is gone unless he runs Thunder, which will easily KO at +1 after Ho-Oh has taken Stealth Rock damage.

Team Options
========

With the prominence of Fire-types this generation, having a Pokemon like Kyogre who can easily remove that weakness is strongly encouraged. Steel Arceus can also handle the Grass-types that are problematic for Kyogre, making them a great pair. Specifically, physically defensive Kyogre works well at taking a hit from Ho-Oh that like to spam Sacred Fire and retaliating with Scald. Landorus-T is also a good teammate, as it handles Ho-Oh and Blaziken with Stone Edge and Earthquake, respectively, while being immune to the Ground-type moves that Steel Arceus despises. If not running either, then at least running a check to Ho-Oh is mandatory, as well as a Stealth Rock user.

For other troublesome Pokemon, Palkia is a useful teammate especially if checking Kyogre is a priority, and all of Palkia's weaknesses are resisted by Steel Arceus. Giratina-O is also useful for providing type synergy. Giratina-O is immune to Ground- and Fighting-type moves and resists Fire-type attacks, while Steel Arceus can take on Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-types. Steel Arceus does not particularly enjoy facing a Palkia with Thunder Wave, so having a Fairy-type partner for healing and tanking Fighting-type moves, like Xerneas, is encouraged; Xerneas can also dispose of Mega Mewtwo X and Blaziken quite nicely.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Stone Edge / Recover
ability: Multitype
item: Iron Plate
evs: 252 Atk / 4 HP / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

If a physical set is required, Steel Arceus is no slouch with his Swords Dance. Iron Head is his most reliable Steel-type STAB move, having a respectable 80 Base Power and a handy 30% flinch chance. Earthquake provides good coverage and is useful for hitting things that resist Iron Head, such as Heatran and Aegislash. For the last moveslot, Stone Edge rounds out the coverage, hitting everything that resists Earthquake and Iron Head and providing a solid answer to Ho-Oh. On the other hand, if coverage is not needed, Recover is once again an option to help prolong Steel Arceus's lifespan.

There are a couple more options that can benefit Steel Arceus but are difficult to include in his moveset. Overheat can be useful for heavily damaging Scizor and Skarmory, but it doesn't have much use outside of that. Extreme Speed can surprise Deoxys-A, but it doesn't provide good coverage for a Pokemon that is already struggling to fit it in.

Set Details
========

This set is purely for offense, and Steel Arceus's numerous resistances provide him with enough defense as is; as such, Attack and Speed should be maximized. Investing in HP can be worthwhile, but it is imperative that Steel Arceus runs at least 112 Speed EVs to outspeed all Garchomp that don't run Choice Scarf.

Usage Tips
========

Though Ground Arceus has a greater offensive presence, what sets Steel Arceus apart is his typing and the eleven resistances that come with it. Therefore, this set is best used as a late-game cleaner because he is likely to survive long enough to get to a point where attaining Swords Dance boosts is easily accomplished. This set functions similarly to the Calm Mind set in that knowing when to boost is as important as knowing when to attack and/or regain HP. Something to note, however, is that this set is not meant to check Xerneas; rather, it's purely for late-game cleaning.

Team Options
========

As always, Kyogre is very good at mitigating Steel Arceus's Fire-type weakness, and it still gets first mention. Additionally, a check to Ho-Oh, like physically defensive Kyogre or Landorus-T, is still needed. Since he is now physically offensive, having a Pokemon that can absorb burns, like Gliscor or Heatran, is necessary to give Steel Arceus an easier time switching in and setting up. Giratina-O provides good type synergy with Steel Arceus. Other Pokemon to consider for teammates include Yveltal, who can switch into Ghost- and Ground-types, and mixed Rayquaza, who can take out bulky Ground-types. Both of these Pokemon appreciate Steel Arceus's resistance to Fairy.

Other Options
########

Steel Arceus's numerous resistances allow him to run a number of other options in his movesets. A support set consisting of Judgment, Will-O-Wisp, Roar / Defog, and Recover could work, but it is too similar to the Calm Mind set, and other Arceus types, like Grass, Fairy, and Water, are better suited for this role. Thunder Wave and Toxic can be used to spread status, but they leave Steel Arceus walled by Ground- and Electric-types for the former and Steel- and Poison-types for the latter. Roar can be used to force out unwanted foes, but Steel Arceus is not very effective when it comes to keeping them out. Fire Blast can nab Scizor and Skarmory, but shaky accuracy and lower Base Power than Overheat leave something to be desired. Perish Song can be used as an alternative to Roar, as it makes the opponent choose between switching and fainting, but Mega Gengar fulfills that role a lot better, and Roar is more effective at immediate phazing. Magic Coat is useful for bouncing back Taunts, but it only really works for leads such as Deoxys-A, and it's hard to find space for it.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ho-Oh**: Ho-Oh resists Steel Arceus's STAB attacks, is immune to Earthquake, and can heal off any damage taken, threatening a powerful Sacred Fire in return.

**Mega Mewtwo X**: Mega Mewtwo X can destroy Arceus with a STAB Low Kick, and the only things it really fears are status conditions.

**Fire-types**: Blaziken, Heatran, Reshiram, and Fire Arceus all threaten Steel Arceus with their respective Fire-type STAB attacks, but they should take care not to switch into a boosted Earthquake.

**Ground-types**: Ground-types can deal heavy damage to, if not outright KO, Steel Arceus with Earthquake or Earth Power. Notable examples include Groudon, Ground Arceus, Excadrill, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon.

**Water-types**: Even though Water is not super effective against Steel, Water-types such as Kyogre and Water Arceus resist Steel Arceus's STAB moves and threaten him with their own respective neutral, but powerful, STAB moves.

**Skarmory**: Although Skarmory doesn't really threaten the Calm Mind set and even fears a boosted Thunder, it has enough physical bulk to completely wall the Swords Dance set. This allows it to Whirlwind Steel Arceus away, along with any boosts he managed to accumulate.

**Mega Scizor**: Mega Scizor can check most Swords Dance variants by easily tanking a boosted Earthquake and retaliating with a strong Superpower.

**Extreme Killer Arceus**: Extreme Killer Arceus that run Earthquake can deal major damage to Steel Arceus after a Swords Dance boost.

**Palkia**: Palkia is able to paralyze Steel Arceus with Thunder Wave and then either phaze him out if he is running a specially defensive EV set or outright KO him with Fire Blast.

**Deoxys-A**: Deoxys-A is able to revenge kill a weakened Steel Arceus, although its checking power is limited due to its frailty.
