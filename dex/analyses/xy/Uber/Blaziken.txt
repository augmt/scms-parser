Overview
########

Blaziken takes the title of being the first, and currently sole, starter to be banished to Ubers thanks to its  Speed Boost ability. With Speed Boost, Blaziken can outspeed and KO many threats as well as pass boosts to teammates  thanks to Baton Pass. Blaziken makes its second debut in Ubers with a new boon: a Mega Evolution. It thus continues to be a formidable threat in the Ubers metagame; with base 100 Speed when Mega-Evolved, it can come in and outspeed the common base 90 Speed Pokemon in the Ubers metagame. Blaziken can use a physical attacking set to sweep opposing teams, or, if you want a different Mega Evolution for your team, a Life Orb can be used; however, Blaziken isn't held to only utilizing an offensive set as it can also run an effective Baton Pass set. The nerf to weather this generation is a mixed bag for Blaziken. On one hand, it doesn't have ever-present sun support anymore to boost its power; on the other hand, the rain that used to cripple Blaziken doesn't last forever either, so Drought is no longer needed to counter Kyogre's rain.

However, everything is not as perfect as it may seem for the speedy chicken. It has rather poor bulk even with the improvements of the Mega Evolution, leaving it open to being revenge killed by priority, making it rather tough to switch it in and difficult to set up. It also depends on Flare Blitz as its STAB move, which has recoil that further burdens its poor bulk. Its Mega Evolution set, which is arguably its best set, has an opportunity cost compared to other available Megas such as Mewtwo and Gengar, albeit a very small one. Nevertheless, with proper switching in and setting up, Blaziken is a formidable threat to look out for.

Offensive
########
name: Blaze is Back
move 1: Low Kick
move 2: Flare Blitz
move 3: Swords Dance / Protect
move 4: Protect / Knock Off
ability: Speed Boost
item: Blazikenite / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Low Kick is Blaziken's Fighting-type STAB dealing maximum damage against the many heavy Pokemon in the Ubers metagame; it is also not as risky as High Jump Kick. Flare Blitz is Blaziken's Fire-type STAB; when used in conjunction with Low Kick, Blaziken hits most Pokemon in Ubers for super effective or neutral damage. Swords Dance allows you to get a quick +2 Attack boost to massively increase damage output. Protect not only provides guaranteed Speed boosts, but also lets Blaziken scout your opponent's move. Knock Off is another great utility move as it allows Blaziken to deal massive damage to Pokemon that resist its STAB moves. such as the Giratina formes; it also allows you to catch your opponent on a switch. potentially taking off an otherwise useful item from their switch-in. Baton Pass can be used on this set to provide Speed boosts to other team members if Blaziken's HP is low; always make sure to use Protect with Baton Pass since it will guarantee Speed boosts. High Jump Kick can be an alternative to Low Kick, offering 10 more Base Power at the cost Blaziken dealing massive damage to itself if it misses; however, Low Kick is preferred, as High Jump Kick only deals more damage to the rare Quagsire. Stone Edge can be used instead of Knock Off if your team needs to damage Ho-Oh; it also has the added benefit of denting Lugia and physically defensive Yveltal.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment in both Attack and Speed allows Mega Blaziken to come in and immediately get to work, capitalizing on Blaziken's offensive stats and allowing it to become the fearsome wallbreaker it is. The slashes represent three possible sets that you can run: Protect and three attacks, Swords Dance and three attacks, or Swords Dance and Protect with two attacks. An Adamant nature is used to OHKO Pokemon such as Kyogre that are not normally OHKOed if using Jolly. Jolly can be used over Adamant in order to allow Blaziken to outspeed Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Zekrom after one or two boosts, depending on whether it is in Mega forme or using the Life Orb set. However, by using Jolly, Blaziken loses offensive prowess it would otherwise enjoy. Life Orb Blaziken allows you to use a different Mega Evolution on your team.

Usage Tips
========

Be wary about directly switching Blaziken in as its relatively low bulk leaves its vulnerable to taking heavy damage. In addition, watch out for priority moves that can revenge kill it, such as Extreme Speed from Arceus or Rayquaza. Protect allows Blaziken to gain +1 from Speed Boost, helping you easily build momentum; it also offers added utility in seeing what move your opponent was going for, giving you an advantage. Don't just spam Flare Blitz blindly, as recoil racks up quickly, leaving Blaziken vulnerable to revenge killers. If you opt for Knock Off, it allows Blaziken to catch Pokemon on the switch and cripple them; it even allows more damage against Giratina, a common check to Blaziken.

Team Options
========

Stealth Rock support helps Blaziken deal with Lugia, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal, so Pokemon like Groudon or Landorus-T make great teammates. Groudon also helps Mega Blaziken by setting up sun and dispelling rain; it also checks Extreme Killer Arceus with its great physical bulk and can retaliate with an attack or cripple with Thunder Wave. Groudon can also run Lava Plume in order to catch opposing Landorus-T off guard and score a burn, leaving Landorus-T crippled for the rest of the match. Landorus-T as a teammate itself provides Intimidate support and checks Ho-Oh, a counter to Blaziken. Landorus-T also carries U-turn which gets Blaziken in safely. Yveltal breaks many of the Pokemon that can wall Blaziken, such as the Giratina formes. Xerneas can be used as another offensive sweeper that is also able to deal with both Giratina formes. Wobbuffet is an interesting team member as it is able to trap and take out any checks or counters to Blaziken; it can be used with Xerneas carrying Hidden Power Fire to create a powerful core that benefits Blaziken greatly. Palkia is a great team member as it can sponge water moves thrown at Blaziken and also deal with Rayquaza, which can otherwise revenge kill Blaziken. U-turn/Volt Switch users such as Genesect and Zekrom can get Blaziken in safely. Extreme Killer Arceus can be a good team member as well; Blaziken can weaken the opponent's team by KOing or debilitating Arceus's checks, allowing Arceus to come in and sweep.

Baton Pass
########
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Protect
move 3: Substitute / Roar
move 4: Flare Blitz
ability: Speed Boost
item: Leftovers
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Baton Pass is used to pass on Speed boosts to another team member. Protect allows Blaziken to gain guaranteed Speed boosts and is absolutely necessary for this set. Substitute used in conjunction with Protect allows you the best option in getting Speed boosts as alternating between them lets Blaziken get boosts without taking much damage. On the other hand, Roar is an interesting option that allows you to prevent Blaziken from being phazed out and losing its Speed boosts; it also prevents opponents from setting up on it. Flare Blitz provides a reliable and powerful physical Fire-type STAB to deal with opposing Pokemon with Taunt.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed let Blaziken switch in, use a Protect, and begin to outspeed the opponent while having respectable Attack in case Flare Blitz needs to be used. By investing in Attack, Blaziken is not a sitting duck in front of setup sweepers and can actually deal significant damage while gaining boosts. A Jolly nature is used here to ensure a Substitute after your first Protect. After one boost, Blaziken can outspeed many of the non-Choice Scarf Ubers Pokemon. This prevents Blaziken from taking severe damage or being completely knocked out. Its survival is necessary to pass on Speed boosts to the rest of the team. Leftovers is used to increase Blaziken's longevity; it works great in conjunction with Protect as Blaziken gets a Speed boost and +6.25% recovery.

Usage Tips
========

Watch out for potential Taunt users like Deoxys-S as they can cripple this entire set. Protect is a cornerstone of this set, allowing Blaziken to stay in and get Speed boosts. It also provides utility as you can scout what move your opponent is going for, allowing you to plan accordingly. A good strategy is to come and and use Protect to get a Speed boost. Then, alternate with Substitute and continue to do so to maximize your Speed boosts for another Pokemon. Also, a predicted switch allows you to use Substitute and then Protect on the next turn, allowing Blaziken to gain a Speed boost and pass on a Substitute to another Pokemon on your team. Roar is used mainly to prevent Blaziken from being phazed out. It is faster than most phazers after one Speed boost, so its Roar will go first and prevent it from being switched out. Watch out for priority moves such as Extreme Speed or Shadow Sneak that can mortally damage Blaziken. By passing your Speed boosts to another Pokemon that is powerful but slow, you are able to turn the tide against your opponent and potentially sweep their team with your Speed-boosted switch-in.

Team Options
========

Groudon can be used to help boost Blaziken's Flare Blitz by setting up the sun and dispelling any rain; sun support also lowers any damage from Water-type moves. You can Baton Pass Speed boosts to terrifying offensive Pokemon plagued by their sub-par Speed, allowing them to pull off sweeps that would otherwise be difficult. These include Life Orb or Choice Band Zekrom, Mega Kangaskhan, Life Orb or tank Ho-Oh, Lustrous Orb or Life Orb Palkia, Choice Specs Kyogre, or Choice Band Groudon. By passing to these Pokemon, you are able to use Baton Pass Blaziken to its fullest.

Other Options
########

Brave Bird can be utilized as it provides neutral damage against most Pokemon, but the only common threats it hits for super effective damage are Mega Mewtwo-X and Fighting Arceus, which take massive damage from Flare Blitz as is. Otherwise, Brave Bird is another recoil move that shouldn't really be used over any other moves on any set. Rock Slide can be used, but its main target is Ho-Oh. Stone Edge is a better option in order to deal more damage to Yveltal and Lugia. Shadow Claw can be used instead of Knock Off to deal more damage to Mega Gengar and Giratina-O since their items can't be knocked off. However, it doesn't have as much utility against opposing tanks and switch-ins by knocking off Leftovers or Choice items. Boosting moves such as Swords Dance and Bulk Up can be used on the Baton Passing set, but they have a marginal or non-existent bonus for special attackers and require more turns to set up,  limiting Blaziken's longevity. Overheat can be used on the Baton Pass set to cut down on recoil damage, but it isn't consistent damage-wise. By lowering Special Attack, it limits your Baton Passing to physical attackers since special attackers won't appreciate lowerd Special Attack. Choice Band can be used to grant Blaziken an immediate power boost, but is constrictive and counterproductive with Speed Boost. Blaziken won't be able to switch attacks, making it easily blocked by opposing tanks such as Water Arceus and Fairy Arceus, forcing it to switch out and lose its Speed boosts.

Checks & Counters
########

**Giratina**: Both Giratina formes can take anything Blaziken throws at them except for a boosted Knock Off and are able to eventually KO it or phaze it out.

**Gyarados**: Gyarados resists both of Blaziken's STABs, letting it easily come in and get an Attack drop from Intimidate. It can also threaten to KO Blaziken with Waterfall.

**Landorus-Therian**: Landorus-T can switch in and take a hit with Defense investment and Intimidate, although it doesn't appreciate a boosted Flare Blitz. It is able to KO Blaziken with Earthquake as well.

**Fairy Arceus and Water Arceus**: Physically defensive variants can tank a few hits. They each resist one of Blaziken's STAB, but don't appreciate the other STAB that it can go for.

**Ghost Arceus**: Ghost Arceus is immune to Blaziken's Fighting-type STAB and can retaliate back with a Judgment. However, it must be wary of Flare Blitz.

**Quagsire**: Unaware ignores Blaziken's stat boosts and Quagsire can attack back with its Water- and Ground-type STABs; it doesn't fare well against High Jump Kick though.

**Kyogre**: Kyogre can come in and set up rain, which severely limits Blaziken's coverage and helps out Pokemon that resist or are immune to Blaziken's Fighting-type STAB such as Fairy Arceus and Ghost Arceus. Kyogre also threatens to KO Blaziken with its Water-type STAB attacks.

**Phazers**: Phazers are able to Whirlwind/Roar/Dragon Tail the Baton Pass set. They can also force the offensive set out, canceling its Speed boosts.

**Prankster Users**: Thundurus and Klefki can use priority Thunder Wave to cripple the offensive set, and Thundurus can also Taunt to shut down the Baton Pass set.

**Poison**: Poison limits Blaziken's longevity as it increases in damage each turn and is especially harmful for the Baton Pass set, lowering the time Blaziken can stay in and thus the amount of boosts it can pass on.

**Revenge Killers**: Pokemon such as Normal Arceus or Rayquaza with Extreme Speed are able to revenge kill Blaziken due to its paltry bulk and recoil damage.
