Overview
########

With a lack of Ice-resistant Pokemon in Ubers, Ice Arceus has the ability to wreak havoc to unprepared teams thanks to its access to Ice-type STAB moves, which is rare, as well as excellent coverage in Thunder and Fire Blast. Its Ice typing causes many problems, however, such as a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock and no notable resistances, making Ice Arceus difficult to fit into a team, especially when an Arceus forme is typically chosen to cover up weaknesses in a team. However, the return of viable Defog users in Latios and Latias help with the Stealth Rock issue, and having an Arceus forme that can deal with Mega Salamence, a huge threat, is useful for some offensive teams.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Judgment
move 3: Recover
move 4: Thunder / Fire Blast
item: Icicle Plate
evs: 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Calm Mind allows Ice Arceus to threaten the opposing team and maintaining offensive presence with the boosted Special Attack while also being able to survive many special moves thanks to the boosted Special Defense. Judgment is the most reliable and powerful Ice-type STAB move Ice Arceus has access to; due to a lack of Ice-resistant Pokemon in the tier, it is very spammable. Recover gives Ice Arceus the longevity it needs to consistently check threats or accumulate enough Calm Mind boosts to potentially sweep teams. Thunder is the coverage move of choice, preventing Primal Kyogre and Water Arceus from checking Ice Arceus while also hitting Ho-Oh super effectively. Fire Blast is an alternative that can be used to OHKO Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor and heavily damage Klefki and Aegislash. Ice Beam can be used over Judgment, giving up some power for a chance to freeze the foe, which can prove useful in a Calm Mind war.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs give Ice Arceus the bulk it needs to check Mega Salamence and Rayquaza while minimizing Stealth Rock damage at the same time. Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Ice Arceus to, at worst, tie with other Arceus formes and Mega Salamence. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack; however, relinquishing the HP EVs to maximize Special Attack is an option to allow Ice Arceus to 2HKO Ho-Oh with a +1 Thunder, something that cannot be done with 8 Special Attack EVs.

Usage Tips
========

Ice Arceus's Judgment is very potent in ORAS Ubers, and it should be used whenever it can be used. Be very careful when switching Ice Arceus in, however, as its poor defensive typing and weakness to Stealth Rock can make it KOed more easily. Switching Ice Arceus in to revenge kill a foe is a great way to avoid damage and get it in safely. Try to weaken possible checks to Ice Arceus such as Ho-Oh before revealing it, or your opponent might try to preserve them to stop it. Ice Arceus works best as a late-game cleaner with Calm Mind and Judgment, but can also be used early-game to revenge kill Dragon-types if necessary.

Team Options
========

Defog is absolutely necessary when using Ice Arceus to remove entry hazards, as Stealth Rock will remove 25% of Ice Arceus's health upon every switch in if it is not removed; Ice Arceus is also very weak to Toxic Spikes. Latios, Latias, and Giratina-O are good options for Defog users. Stealth Rock setters, such are Dialga, Primal Groudon and Mega Diancie, are appreciated to punish Ho-Oh switch-ins and chip at other enemy Pokemon, allowing Ice Arceus to clean up later. Primal Groudon is a great teammate due to its resistances to Fire and Steel, ability to set Stealth Rock up, and its ability to check Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, Aegislash, and Klefki, all of which are huge threats to Ice Arceus.

Other Options
########

Ice Arceus doesn't have many other viable options. Ancient Power could be used to 2HKO Ho-Oh without any boosts or Special Attack investment, but is usually not worth the trade off unless you absolutely need ways to get around Ho-Oh. Refresh is a way to deal with status, but the subsequent lack of coverage leaves Ice Arceus walled by a lot of Pokemon and is not typically worth bothering with.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ho-Oh**: Ho-Oh is able to switch in and OHKO Ice Arceus with Sacred Fire with great ease. A +1 Thunder can 2HKO it after Stealth Rock, however.

**Steel-types**: While not all Steel-types common in Ubers resist Ice, they all have the bulk to take Judgment and heavily damage Ice Arceus with their STAB attacks. Some Steel-types, such as Klefki, Mega Scizor, and Aegislash, are hard to beat without Fire Blast.

**Water-types**: Water-types such as Primal Kyogre and Water Arceus resist Judgment and can win Calm Mind wars due to Ice Arceus not resisting Water.

**Fire-types**: Fire-types are large threats to Ice Arceus; Primal Groudon is neutral to Ice and is commonly seen with a Fire-type STAB move or Rock-type coverage move, making it difficult for Ice Arceus to beat it. Mega Blaziken can also switch into Ice Arceus and OHKO it with its STAB moves. Fire Arceus can also deal with Ice Arceus easily thanks to its resistance to Ice.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Lucario, and Mega Blaziken can switch into Judgment, Thunder, and Fire Blast, and OHKO Ice Arceus with their Fighting-type STAB moves.

**Rock-types**: While Rock-types such as Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Rock Arceus do not resist Ice, they can switch in and easily KO Ice Arceus with their STAB moves.
