Overview
########

Sporting a large base 145 Attack and great physical bulk bolstered furthered by its ability, Intimidate, Landorus-T is back and ready to terrorize what it can in the treacherous XY Ubers metagame. Its excellent typing gives teams it's on an invaluable immunity to Ground- and Electric-type attacks. Its great typing also gives it an immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web, one of the biggest reasons to use it over the other Ground-types inhabiting the tier. Furthermore, being blessed with great offensive and supportive moves, Landorus-T is capable of running a few different viable sets. However, it is quite frail on the special side and pretty slow, meaning most special attackers in the tier can either force it out or flat out OHKO it. Also, having no access to reliable recovery means that its longevity is greatly compromised. Regardless, use Landorus-T to its strengths and it won't disappoint.

Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Toxic / U-turn
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Earthquake is a standard STAB move for Landorus-T, and it hits relatively hard even without investment due to Landorus-T's high Attack stat. Stealth Rock is a mandatory support move for all teams and Landorus-T is one of the better users of the move, finding many chances to set the hazard up due to its physical bulk. Stone Edge is there to hit what Earthquake cannot, so that Pokemon with Levitate or the Flying typing don't completely wall this set. However, if Stone Edge isn't doing super effective damage, it won't be hitting very hard due to the lack of STAB and Attack investment. Toxic is an excellent move for Landorus-T, allowing it to put pressure on Pokemon that otherwise like to switch in on it, such as Hippowdon, Groudon, Lugia, support Arceus formes, and opposing Landorus-T. Toxic also prevents support Arceus formes from being able to stay in and constantly Defog away your entry hazards, and in general prevents walls from staying in and recovering their health. U-turn is another great option to consider as the move provides your team with momentum and is useful considering all the switches Landorus-T tends to cause, meaning that it can U-turn out into an appropriate counter or check.

Set Details
========

The EV spread is pretty straightforward, with maxed out HP and Defense so that Landorus-T can do what it does best, which is check many physical attackers. As Landorus-T has no other form of recovery, Leftovers is a must if you are using it as a defensive pivot. The remaining 4 EVs can go into Attack to make its offensive moves hit a bit harder.

Usage Tips
========

The best way to capitalize on this set's bulk is to bring Landorus-T in on physical attackers or walls that can't do much to it, allowing it to set up Stealth Rock, attack, or U-turn out. Landorus-T is especially good for teams that have trouble with prominent physical attackers, but be wary of those that are capable of running mixed sets. Some examples of mixed attackers include Swords Dance Ground Arceus and Mega Mewtwo X carrying Ice Beam, and Life Orb Zekrom, all of which do a lot to if not flat out OHKO Landorus-T. Despite being physically defensive, Landorus-T cannot beat a full health Extreme Killer Arceus, as Landorus-T cannot phaze it out. Furthermore, due to its good bulk, Extreme Killer can set up again. It is recommended to have another Pokemon present on your team that can deal with Extreme Killer Arceus, such as support Arceus with Will-O-Wisp, physically defensive Yveltal or Ho-Oh, or Lugia (which can also tank special attacks).

Team Options
========

Since Landorus-T won't be tanking many special attacks, a Pokemon such as Blissey or Grass Arceus that can switch into special attackers is highly recommended. A cleric is also very useful as Landorus-T doesn't have any way to heal itself. Having a Fairy-type cleric such as Sylveon or Xerneas gives your team immunities to Zekrom's STAB moves. Specially defensive Kyogre makes a great partner, as it can tank most special attacks and status ailments aimed at Landorus-T, and can phaze as well. Water Arceus resists Ice- and Water-type attacks and has good type synergy with Landorus-T in terms of Electric-type moves. Palkia is also a good partner, as it can take Water-type attacks aimed at Landorus-T and can beat the physical walls that Landorus-T has trouble with.

Offensive Earth Plate
########
name: Offensive Earth Plate
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Toxic / U-turn
item: Earth Plate
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Stealth Rock is a standard support move for the team. Earthquake hits incredibly hard with full Attack investment and Earth Plate when compared to more defensive Landorus-T variants. Stone Edge is there to hit Pokemon that Earthquake cannot. Even given the offensive nature of this set, there are some Pokemon that it cannot break through, and that is where Toxic comes in. Toxic puts pressure on a lot of them, as the move rapidly reduces its target's health. U-turn is also a great option that allows Landorus-T to keep momentum on offensive teams, which this set should be used on.

Set Details
========

The EV spread is straightforward: full investment in Attack and Speed allows Landorus-T to hit hard and fast. Earth Plate is preferred on this set to boost the power of Earthquake and avoid the nasty recoil of Life Orb. An Adamant nature is preferred since it gives Landorus-T just a bit more power, but a Jolly nature can also be used as it guarantees that Landorus-T will outspeed all unboosted base 90s, such as Kyogre, Zekrom, Dialga, and Ho-Oh. Most of these threats run an Adamant or Modest nature, but if they do run a Speed-boosting nature, they will outspeed Adamant Landorus-T.

Usage Tips
========

This Landorus-T set should be played more offensively than the others, so don't be afraid to attack or scout with U-turn if the situation allows for it. This set is capable of putting pressure on Mega Scizor as a Defog user, as it does approximately 50% to max HP variants. Know its limits though, as it will fail to break through Defog users such as Giratina, Giratina-O, and support Arceus formes without using Toxic. Even then, be aware that they can put pressure on Landorus-T before it can do the same to them. This Landorus-T hates burns more than anything, so if it is faced with a Pokemon that it cannot outspeed and OHKO, and is likely to burn it, switch out. It is also important to keep in mind that this variant of Landorus-T does not have nearly the same amount of bulk as the other sets, so be wary of mindlessly switching it into physical attackers.

Team Options
========

Given the offensive nature of this set, it is best suited on offensive oriented teams. Since this set has a lot of trouble with physical walls, Pokemon that can take them out are recommended. Mega Gengar and, albeit more niche, Gothitelle can come in on support Arceus formes and beat them, making Landorus-T's job significantly easier. Furthermore, Palkia and Xerneas make great partners as they can beat both Giratina formes and physical walls in general. Since this Landorus-T hates status, a one-time status absorber is nice to have as well, examples being Xerneas, Ho-Oh, and even some Sleep Talk users. A Pokemon such as Sylveon, Bronzong, Blissey, Aegislash, or Arceus that can switch into special attacks aimed at Landorus-T is good to have as well.

Setup Sweeper
########
name: Setup Sweeper
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: Rock Polish
move 4: Swords Dance / Explosion / Hidden Power Ice
item: Life Orb
evs: 140 HP / 252 Atk / 116 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Earthquake is the standard STAB move and Stone Edge allows Landorus-T to hit Flying-types; in general, the two moves have great synergy together. Rock Polish is what makes this set work, boosting Landorus-T's Speed and allowing it to make use of its great Attack stat. The last move can be a bit of a toss up: Swords Dance is an excellent move that boosts Landorus-T's Attack stat even further, but may be hard to set up alongside Rock Polish. Explosion is an another amazing option, doing up to 90% to max HP Arceus formes. Furthermore, Explosion prevents a potential Rapid Spin or Defog due to there being no target for the move to hit. Hidden Power Ice should only be used if you want this set to significantly damage Gliscor and opposing Landorus-T, which otherwise wall this set.

Set Details
========

Landorus-T's Attack stat is maxed out so that it can do as much damage as it can, while the Speed EVs allow it to outspeed all base 100 Speed Choice Scarf users and below after a Rock Polish boost. The rest of the EVs are placed into HP to give Landorus-T some additional bulk. If you are using Hidden Power Ice as the final move, a Naughty nature can be used so that the move's power isn't decreased. Life Orb is the prime choice for this set as it provides a big boost to Landorus-T's attacking moves, giving it a large chance to OHKO common Uber Pokemon if Stealth Rock is up. Another item that can be considered on this set is Lum Berry. Lum Berry grants Landorus-T more setup opportunities against Pokemon that would otherwise status it. One final item that can be considered if Swords Dance is used is Leftovers. While seemingly odd, Leftovers allow even this variant of Landorus-T to act as a semi-defensive pivot and set up against opposing Landorus-T and walls lacking Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. It is important to note that the power drop that comes with using Leftovers or Lum Berry is quite significant, and Landorus-T will lose a number of OHKOs.

Usage Tips
========

This set is generally highly outclassed by Groudon, and unless you have a very specific reason for using Landorus-T (i.e., you need a Ground immunity on your team, or for some reason Groudon's Drought interferes with your team structure) always consider Groudon for this role before Landorus-T. Groudon has better overall bulk to take on priority and a slightly higher Attack stat. When using this set, it is not necessary to set up with both Rock Polish and Swords Dance, and you should take a close look at your opponent's team before deciding on which boost to attain. Set up Rock Polish against hyper offense teams, and use Swords Dance against bulky/stall teams. However, Landorus-T will need both boosts to get past balanced teams. On another note, don't set up if an opponent's Pokemon can force out Landorus-T without taking much damage in the process. Notable examples include Giratina-O, Gliscor, and opposing Landorus-T (unless Landorus-T carries Hidden Power Ice, in which case Gliscor an Landorus-T are significantly easier to deal with). Naturally, don't try to set up in front of a Pokemon that can OHKO Landorus-T either. Your best bet is to set up on a Pokemon that can't hurt Landorus-T much or on a predicted switch. This set is best used as a late-game sweeper, when all its checks and counters are gone. When you attempt to sweep with Landorus-T, ensure that Stealth Rock is up, as it turns many 2HKOs into OHKOs.

Team Options
========

Having a teammate that can remove physically defensive Pokemon is a must for Landorus-T, as it cannot sweep until they have been removed. Palkia, Mewtwo, and Kyurem-W are all excellent options that can decimate any Pokemon that walls Landorus-T. Mega Gengar can be used to trap support Arceus formes, and in general, trap any Pokemon that might stop Landorus-T's sweep. Dual screens support from the likes of Klefki or Deoxys is useful, as it allows Landorus-T to set up much easier. Wobbuffet can also help Landorus-T set up through the use of Encore and Safeguard. If you choose to run Hidden Power Ice on this set, Zekrom is an excellent partner as Landorus-T can lure common Ground-types in and attempt to knock them out, paving the way for Zekrom. Lastly, since this Landorus-T doesn't carry Stealth Rock, have another Pokemon present on your team that does, possible examples being Deoxys-S and Deoxys-A on hyper offense teams.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Superpower / Explosion
item: Choice Band
evs: 200 HP / 252 Atk / 52 Def
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Earthquake and Stone Edge give Landorus-T solid neutral coverage, the former being a powerful STAB move and the latter being able to smash many of the Pokemon that are immune to Ground-type moves. U-turn is an excellent scouting move that allows you to maintain offensive pressure, and is a safe move to spam if you don't know what's going to switch in. Superpower allows Landorus-T to hit Ferrothorn and guarantees an OHKO on full health Extreme Killer Arceus after Stealth Rock damage (and any other Arceus forme that is hit for super effective damage by Superpower). Explosion is an incredibly powerful nuke, OHKOing Arceus at full health 62% of the time and OHKOing Gliscor switch-ins. However, as Landorus-T is KOed in the process, be very cautious against opposing Ghost-, Steel-, and Rock-type Pokemon. Knock Off is an excellent move that allows Landorus-T to cripple some of its common switch-ins by removing their items, but the move becomes significantly weaker after the first use.

Set Details
========

The EV spread maximizes Landorus-T's Attack and bulk, while at the same time ensuring that it will never be OHKOed by a +1 Extreme Killer Arceus's Life Orb-boosted Extreme Speed after it takes damage from Stealth Rock.

Usage Tips
========

Be extremely careful when using Choice Band Landorus-T due to the drawbacks of its attacks: look at your opponent's team before choosing your move. Two of its moves have immunities, and you want to minimize the amount of free turns you give your opponent. Don't use this set as your team's sole check to Extreme Killer Arceus, as if Landorus-T is even a little bit weakened, Extreme Killer Arceus can rip right through it, leaving you in a bad spot. Also keep a close eye on its health throughout the match if you intend to use it to take on physical attackers.

Team Options
========

A teammate such as Kyurem-W or Yveltal that can remove physically defensive walls is really appreciated. Darkrai is also a good option, as it can deal damage to physical walls and provide general team support with Dark Void and Taunt. A cleric is really useful, as if Landorus-T is burnt, it is essentially ruined. As this set does not carry Stealth Rock, have another Pokemon with the move that has weaknesses that differ from those of Landorus-T. Furthermore, as Landorus-T will often be locked into a move that will give your opponent free turns, it is pivotal for your team to have a good defensive backbone. Water Arceus and specially defensive Kyogre are good teammates as they can take many of the special attacks aimed at Landorus-T, while Landorus-T is immune to the Electric-type moves that give them trouble. Blissey and Xerneas are teammates that work well with this Landorus-T, as they offer cleric support should Landorus-T get burned and contribute to a specially defensive backbone. Having Xerneas as a cleric gives your team immunities to Zekrom's STAB moves.

Other Options
########

A Choice Scarf set is usable, as Landorus-T's base 91 Speed allows it to outspeed the base 90 Choice Scarf users in the tier, such as Zekrom and Kyogre. However, as many Pokemon are immune to its main STAB move, Landorus-T is not the best Choice Scarf user. Knock Off can be used on sets other than the Choice Band set, and is a nice move to remove the opposing Pokemon's item, but Landorus-T's other moves offer far more general utility. Gravity is another move that Landorus-T can run, as it allows Landorus-T to hit Pokemon that were previously immune to Earthquake, such as Bronzong, Gliscor, and Giratina-O. One final move to be considered on Landorus-T is Substitute. Since Landorus-T tends to cause a lot of switches, it can easily set up a Substitute and act accordingly from there.

Checks & Counters
########

**Support Arceus Formes**: Grass Arceus and Water Arceus especially, can come in on most of Landorus-T's attacks and Recover off any damage while using Defog to eliminate entry hazards. They can also burn Landorus-T with Will-O-Wisp; however, they hate Toxic.

**Giratina Formes**: Giratina-O is immune to Landorus-T's Ground-type moves, takes pittance from any move bar a Swords Dance-boosted Stone Edge, and can force Landorus-T out with Dragon Tail or the threat of Will-O-Wisp. Specially inclined versions can OHKO Landorus-T with Draco Meteor. Due to its extreme bulk, Giratina can come in on any of Landorus-T's moves and Rest away all status and damage.

**Gliscor**: Unlike most physical walls that wall Landorus-T, Gliscor doesn't fear Toxic and thanks to its typing takes near nothing from any attack Landorus-T offers bar Hidden Power Ice. Gliscor can then proceed to Toxic stall Landorus-T.

**Landorus-T**: Landorus-T takes little damage from Landorus-T's attacks. However, unless it caries Toxic or Hidden Power Ice, it can't do much back.

**Hippowdon**: Due to its massive physical bulk, Hippowdon can come in on Landorus-T over and over again, only fearing a potential Toxic.

**Bronzong**: Bronzong is immune to Landorus-T's main STAB move, resists Stone Edge, and is immune to Toxic.

**Skarmory**: Skarmory is immune to Toxic and does not take much damage from any of Landorus-T's moves. In return, it can set up Stealth Rock or phaze Landorus-T away.

**Mega Scizor**: Physically defensive Scizor carrying Toxic can come in on and poison Landorus-T, putting it on a timer. Scizor is immune to Toxic and can avoid a 2HKO from Earthquake. Physically defensive Scizor only fears a Swords Dance-boosted Earthquake.

**Faster Special Attackers**: While speedy threats such as Palkia, Kyogre, Mega Mewtwo Y, Mewtwo, Mega Mewtwo X carrying Ice Beam, and Xerneas might not be able to switch in directly, most of them can easily OHKO Landorus-T with a super effective move.

**Status**: Since Landorus-T is a physical attacker without access to reliable recovery, both burns and Toxic are real nuisances for it.
