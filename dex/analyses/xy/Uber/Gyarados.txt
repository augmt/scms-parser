Overview
########

While Gyarados is an uncommon Pokemon in Ubers, its unique typing and access to Intimidate give it a niche. Despite its unimpressive Defense stat, Intimidate goes a long way in helping Gyarados check threats such as Ho-Oh, Blaziken, and Lucario, the former two being very prominent threats in the tier.

Gyarados also gets a Mega Evolution this generation. Although the typing change might seem unfortunate, it does have its uses. The greater number of weaknesses that came along with the Dark typing sucks, but Mega Gyarados also gains useful resistances to Psychic- and Dark-type attacks and some much needed extra bulk. If you are not a fan of defensive Gyarados, Mega Gyarados can take on an offensive route and become one of the bulkiest sweepers in the game, as even with uninvested defenses, monstrous threats such as Kyogre can never OHKO Mega Gyarados without Choice Specs, even after Stealth Rock damage. Access to Taunt is a blessing, as it lets Gyarados run over most defensive Pokemon. In addition, Gyarados isn't affected much by the weather nerf as it doesn't rely on weather to function, unlike former threats such as Kingdra.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Waterfall
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Dragon Tail / Roar
move 4: Toxic / Earthquake
ability: Intimidate
item: Leftovers / Gyaradosite
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
=========

This set is the standard Gyarados set, and it aims to check dangerous threats such as Blaziken while still having utility in Taunt and either Dragon Tail or Roar. Waterfall is Gyarados's best STAB move, as it hits Ho-Oh and Blaziken for good damage. Taunt is a great move in Ubers, preventing threats such as Arceus from boosting and shutting down defensive Pokemon including Defog Skarmory and Scizor. Taunt also stops Aegislash from using Toxic and King's Shield. Roar phazes opponents, and Fairy-types aren't immune to it. Dragon Tail is a good option for chip damage and uses Gyarados's respectable Attack stat; however, it invites Xerneas to switch in for free. Earthquake hits Aegislash, Dialga, and Lucario for major damage. Keep in mind this Gyarados set is rather weak. Earthquake also hits unsuspecting Mega Gengar switch-ins, but Thunderbolt will be an easy OHKO although it is a rare move.

Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall, but it can miss and loses the 20% flinch chance. Fire Blast surprises Ferrothorn and Forretress, easily 2HKOing both in neutral weather. Rest helps to recover fast and remove status, and is best used when paired with a cleric such as Blissey, Sylveon, or Xerneas. Sylveon is usually best as it can pass Wishes too. Protect helps to scout and grant some recovery. Thunder Wave can be used over Toxic to stop fast threats such as Darkrai, Choice Scarf Kyogre, Mewtwo, and others.

Set Details
=========

Intimidate is the key to this set's success. It not only helps buff Gyarados's Defense, but it also supports the team overall. Defensive Gyarados is weak and does not carry any offensive pressure, and as such should be not be used on offensive teams. This set beats Blaziken relatively well while also checking Ho-Oh, although burns and Life Orb Brave Birds will be a 2HKO if Stealth Rock is up. It can also check Extreme Killer Arceus, Rayquaza and other Swords Dance Arceus formes such as Bug and Ground once. Maximum Defense is required to reduce damage from Blaziken, Ho-Oh, Arceus and other threats as much as possible. Gyaradosite is an option to reduce Knock Off damage and gain significant bulk, but Gyarados will no longer have Intimidate and certain useful resistances.

76 Speed EVs can be used to outrun slow base 90s such as Groudon and Giratina so Gyarados can move before they can set up Stealth Rock or burn it. More Speed can help to outrun defensive Xerneas, but it is usually not worth losing the bulk. If you want an offensive Gyarados with Taunt, the Dragon Dance set is a better choice.

Usage Tips
=========
This set is best used in defensive and balanced teams that need a check to Lucario, Blaziken, and a shaky check to Ho-Oh. Taunt annoys defensive Pokemon such as Blissey, Skarmory, and Scizor. Intimidate is very useful, so you should feel free to switch Gyarados in on physical attackers whenever you need to weaken them. However, be wary of Gyarados's weakness to Stealth Rock, so a teammate that can remove hazards is much appreciated.


Team Options
=========

Ferrothorn pairs up nicely with Gyarados in terms of synergy, and it also sets up hazards. Dialga resists Thunder and beats Kyogre and Palkia, and it appreciates Gyarados's immunity to Ground and resistance to Fighting. Excadrill can spin away Stealth Rock and shares perfect type synergy with Gyarados. Groudon can form a physically defensive core with Gyarados, and Drought makes Thunder inaccurate at the cost of Waterfall's power. These Ground-types can also beat Zekrom. Offensive Groudon and Excadrill can defeat Rock Arceus, which can 2HKO Gyarados with Judgment. Blissey and Sylveon can use Heal Bell and pass Wishes, and they have good special bulk. Aegislash is a great partner to beat Xerneas and it has great Special Defense to support Gyarados.

Utility
########
name: Mega RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Waterfall
move 4: Dragon Tail
ability: Intimidate 
item: Gyaradosite
evs: 248 HP / 244 Def / 16 spD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

This set gives Gyarados the ability to check threats repeatedly and can Mega Evolve after it's done with checking Blaziken and Lucario. After Mega Evolving, Gyarados gains extra bulk, and this helps it to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Kyogre's Water Spout and take on Yveltal. Mega Gyarados is also not 2HKOed by Mega Mewtwo Y's Aura Sphere and is immune to Psytrike, a move that would normally 2HKO standard Gyarados.

Waterfall is the best STAB move and it takes out Blaziken, Ho-Oh, Rock Arceus, Ground Arceus and Excadrill. Waterfall also uses Gyarados's good Attack stat which is further boosted on Mega Evolving. Dragon Tail is the preferred phazing move as it bypasses Taunt, and is a useful move to phaze out Yveltal and others. Dragon Tail also lands a solid hit on Dragon-types such as Palkia, Rayquaza, and Kyurem. The EV spread gives the best overall bulk. 16 Special Defense EVs get a jump point while the rest are maxed out in Def and HP. With Intimidate, normal Gyarados can check the standard threats it is supposed to check and only Mega Evolve when the time is right such as when it needs to cushion a huge hit and Intimidate is no longer needed. For example, Mega Gyarados survives Choice Scarf Zekrom's Bolt Strike 100% of the time with Intimidate.

Keep in mind that Gyarados only has a 1/3 chance to phaze while asleep. This set can lure Fairy Arceus and Xerneas in to spam their STABs, but luckily, repeated Waterfalls can easily wear down offensive Xerneas. Fairy Arceus doesn't hit as hard and can be beaten with teammates which resist Fairy-type moves, such as Ho-Oh. Rest gives Gyarados much needed recovery, and with the new sleep mechanics, it is a great way to cure off status and recover. This also lets Gyarados switch in freely in on Scalds, random Lava Plumes such as from Groudon, and Sacred Fire.

Set Details
========

Defensive Mega Gyarados plays similarly to Kyogre, but checks different threats. Ghost- and Dark-type resistances are useful for tanking attacks from Ghost Arceus and Darkrai. However, Focus Blast hits Mega Gyarados for super effective damage. Fortunately, Focus Blast rarely hits more than 3 times in a row and has low PP. Stone Edge can be used if you want Mega Gyarados to OHKO Ho-Oh and 2HKO Yveltal. Earthquake crushes Dialga, and Gyarados can survive even a Choice Specs Draco Meteor; it has the added bonus of hitting Aegislash and Zekrom. This set can completely wall Aegislash without Sacred Sword as Rest removes poison.

If you prefer regular Gyarados's resistances and consistent Intimidate ability instead, use a spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD for maximum physical bulk. It lets Gyarados check powerful physical threats such as Blaziken, Lucario, and Ho-Oh, while keeping it healthy with Rest.

Usage Tips
========

You have to pick the right time to Mega Evolve Gyarados. Knock Off from Blaziken fails to KO Gyarados even after Stealth Rock because it wont be boosted. Once Mega Evolved, Gyarados becomes essentially a mixed tank, able to stave off hits such as Choice Specs Kyogre's Surf and Arceus's Judgment. Intimidate can also let Gyarados check Ho-Oh, Groudon, Mega Charizard X, and Arceus. Groudon's -1 Stone Edge fails to 2HKO Gyarados. If you choose to Mega Evolve then Mega Gyarados can easily tank it, but keep in mind that this makes it vulnerable to Earthquake the next switch in, especially from the Earth Plate variants.

Even with base 155 Attack, don't expect Gyarados to hit hard. Waterfall still hits decently hard against less bulky threats such as Genesect and offensive Yveltal, but it barely scratches Arceus and defensive Groudon.

Team Options
========

Aegislash is a solid partner as it helps beat Xerneas, a major threat to this set. Sylveon is another great partner; it provides Wish support to Gyarados, while beating Palkia with Hyper Voice. Xerneas with Aromatherapy can wake Gyarados up immediately and beats up most Dragon-types with Moonblast. Gastrodon helps wall Choice Specs Kyogre and non-Choice Specs Palkia. It can also come in on Bolt Strike or Thunder for free while spamming Scald, which can easily annoy would-be counters to Gyarados and Gastrodon, such as Ferrothorn. Ho-Oh can phaze Xerneas once and defeat Ferrothorn and Skarmory. In return, Gyarados can take on Rock Arceus fairly well, especially with the increased bulk of this set.


Mega Dragon Dance
########
name: Mega Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Waterfall
move 4: Earthquake / Stone Edge / Bite
ability: Intimidate
item: Gyaradosite
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Offensive Gyarados finally got some use in Ubers thanks to its Mega Evolution. This Gyarados can easily set up Dragon Dance and has a chance at sweeping. Taunt is the main move as it is that move separates Gyarados from other sweepers. Waterfall is Gyarados's main STAB move, and it has a bonus 20% chance to flinch and never misses. Aqua Tail can be used for more power but has a risky 10% miss chance. Earthquake is a great coverage move as it destroys Aegislash, Lucario, Dialga, Zekrom, and is Mega Gyarados's best move against Ferrothorn. Mold Breaker Earthquake also hits Bronzong and Gengar for super effective damage. Bite is a weak STAB move but it OHKOes Mewtwo after a Dragon Dance, and packs a great 30% flinch chance. Bite also takes out Giratina formes without resorting to Outrage. Stone Edge destroys Ho-Oh in any weather, breaks through Lugia's Multiscale, and is Mega Gyarados's best move against Yveltal and Kyurem. Taunt can be used if you want to avoid status from defensive threats such as Arceus. Substitute can also stop status, but it does not prevent Roar and Whirlwind from working. Ice Fang OHKOes Rayquaza but it is otherwise nearly useless.

The EV spread can be changed accordingly. HP and Special Defense can be maxed out, but Gyarados will lose a lot of power. 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def is a fine spread, but Mega Gyarados won't outrun everything up to Choice Scarf Terrakion at +2, and loses out on Choice Scarf Kyogre and other base 90s at +2. Taunt can be used with a bulky spread, but Mega Gyarados is still relatively bulky without investment anyway.

Set Details
========

Intimidate is the recommended ability in order to maximize Gyarados's bulk while using Dragon Dance and give it more setup opportunities. It also helps Gyarados's role as a team player. Moxie is great for sweeping teams that sacrifice something to bring in their Gyarados check. You don't have to Mega Evolve instantly; sometimes, you want to keep Gyarados's ability and typing, such as against Blaziken. Mold Breaker is a near-useless ability in Ubers, but it helps breaks Lugia's Multiscale and the rare Gastrodon's Storm Drain. Maximum Attack is used, as Gyarados's STAB moves are disappointingly weak despite its high Attack. Maximum Speed outruns everything up to Shaymin-S after a Dragon Dance with Adamant, while with Jolly, Gyarados can outrun Mega Mewtwo Y and Rash Deoxys-A.

Usage Tips
========

Intimidate and the great resistances provided by Gyarados's Flying typing are great for setting up. After Mega-Evolving, Gyarados gains more unfortunate weaknesses and will no longer be able to check Blaziken and Lucario. Gyarados is 1 point faster in base Speed than normal Blaziken, so it can outrun the latter before or on the turn Blaziken Mega Evolves or against normal Blaziken. It is likely Blaziken will use Protect first on that turn, allowing you to act accordingly. Gyarados can use its type change for a free Dragon Dance as Mega Gyarados. For example, Gyarados can switch in on Landorus-T and Mega Evolve to take laughable damage from Stone Edge. Mega Gyarados can survive Thunders if it has full health, so use that chance to grab another boost if you desperately need it. Not even Life Orb Mewtwo's Aura Sphere can OHKO minimal bulk Mega Gyarados after Stealth Rock damage. A +2 Earthquake OHKOes Kyogre and Palkia after Stealth Rock damage, so you can grab another boost as they come in to try and Thunder you if you're feeling ballsy. Simply spamming attacks from the start can be great to weaken down foes such as Groudon. Support Groudon can't really destroy Gyarados quickly, so wear it down first before attempting a sweep. Rain boosts Gyarados's power, and is greatly appreciated but not necessary because Kyogre shares some unfortunate weaknesses with Gyarados. Mega Gyarados is one of the bulkiest sweepers, so use that to your advantage. It can tank hits such as Dialga's Draco Meteor and KO back with a boosted Earthquake. Mega Gyarados is immune to Psytrike so you can play around Mewtwo. Even if the opponent predicts well and uses Aura Sphere, Mega Gyarados can survive and take out Mewtwo with a boosted Bite or Waterfall. Iron Head is your best move against Xerneas but does not provide much coverage. Mega Gyarados can outrun and almost OHKO Rock Arceus and Ground Arceus after a boost, something other physical sweepers such as Mega Kangaskhan can't boast. Gyarados also has no problem destroying Ho-Oh, although switching in directly can be very risky.

Team Options
========

Stealth Rock is great for wearing down opponents. Defog support helps Gyarados live as long as possible since it lacks recovery. Excadrill makes a great partner for using Rapid Spin, setting up Stealth Rock and firing off Earthquakes to weaken threats such as Ferrothorn and Dialga. Defog support is also useful, but Gyarados enjoys Stealth Rock on the opponent's side of the field as well. Landorus-T forms a nice core with Gyarados and beats Zekrom. If Landorus-T uses Earth Plate, it also has a chance to OHKO Zekrom and Dialga. Ho-Oh can switch in on potential Will-O-Wisps and destroy Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and other Steel-types. Heal Bell and Aromatherapy support help Gyarados by removing status issues such as random burns from Scald.

Other Options
########

Dragon Dance Gyarados can use Life Orb over Gyaradosite, but it will be usually outclassed by more powerful threats such as Rayquaza. The reason to use offensive Mega Gyarados is its great bulk and flexibility in type change. A Choice Band or Choice Scarf can be used with Moxie to dish out good damage, but Gyarados is too slow and weak for a Choice Scarf.

Checks & Counters
########

Regular Gyarados and Mega Gyarados can have different checks and counters, but they both share an Electric-type weakness.

**Zekrom**: Zekrom can switch in easily on Waterfall and Taunt, while threatening back with Bolt Strike, OHKOing every Gyarados variant, as Gyarados will never switch in directly to Intimidate Zekrom before attempting a daring Mega Evolution. Toxic and repeated Dragon Tails can be annoying, however. Earthquake from Mega Gyarados will OHKO at +1, but Choice Scarf Zekrom can outspeed and OHKO it first.

**Groudon**: Groudon's Drought weakens offensive Gyarados and can phaze it out with Dragon Tail. Roar variants are stopped by Taunt and Groudon can't really take out Gyarados quickly. Defensive Gyarados can shrug off Stone Edge with Intimidate and Toxic Groudon while Mega Gyarados doesn't care about support Groudon's attacks. Earth Plate Groudon can overpower Mega Gyarados with Earthquake as long as Intimidate isn't active.

**Ferrothorn**: Gyarados cannot take out Ferrothorn easily with its standard moves, and Ferrothorn fears only the rare Fire Blast. Mega Gyarados hates taking Power Whips. However, Taunt causes Ferrothorn to lose if it doesn't carry Power Whip. Leech Seed will also wear down non-Taunt variants of Gyarados.

**Xerneas**: Xerneas can 2HKO Gyarados with Moonblast and has the bulk to take at least one attack. Physically defensive Xerneas walls Gyarados and does not fear Toxic. Taunt isn't a big issue as Moonblast does a lot of damage.

**Dialga**: Dialga can fry regular Gyarados with Thunder while Earthquake from defensive Gyarados is only a 3HKO. However, Mega Gyarados easily survives one Thunder, and a boosted Earthquake will destroy Dialga. Dialga must carry Thunder or risk getting walled completely by Mega Gyarados's RestTalk set.

**Kyogre**: Kyogre can KO Gyarados with Thunder and isn't weak to Dragon Tail. Mega Gyarados can live one hit though, and a +2 Earthquake squashes frailer Kyogre variants. Defensive Kyogre can phaze out offensive Mega Gyarados once but fails to do anything significant outside of fishing for a Scald burn.

**Electric Arceus**: Electric Arceus OHKOes normal Gyarados with Judgment. Keep in mind though, that, even minimum bulk Mega Gyarados can survive a hit and OHKO with a +1 Earthquake 50% of the time.

**Fighting Arceus**: Fighting Arceus can survive a boosted Waterfall from Mega Gyarados and 2HKO with Judgment. However, regular Gyarados can Toxic, Taunt, and wall Fighting Arceus, as even a -1 Stone Edge doesn't do a lot.

**Grass Arceus**: Grass Arceus can take on Gyarados with Grass Knot, which hits Gyarados for 120 Base Power. Mega Gyarados is also weak to Grass-type attacks. A resistance to Waterfall means that Grass Arceus has nothing to fear from offensive Gyarados except for the rare Bounce. Toxic from defensive Gyarados can cripple Grass Arceus, but Grass Arceus will still likely win as Grass Knot will 3HKO at worst.

**Yveltal**: Yveltal can Taunt defensive Gyarados first and slowly KO with Foul Play or just use Oblivion Wing to recover off damage. Keep in mind that Mega Gyarados can defeat Yveltal with Stone Edge. The additional Special Defense and resistance to Foul Play means that Yveltal is stopped by Mega Gyarados instead of stopping it.

**Scizor**: Mega Scizor has huge Defense and is able to 2HKO Mega Gyarados with U-turn. It can heal off damage with Roost, but Taunt will prevent that. Regular Gyarados completely walls Scizor.

**Revenge Killers**: Mega Gengar can come in on regular Gyarados and take it out with Thunderbolt. Palkia can Thunder Gyarados for the OHKO, but fails against Mega Gyarados, which can grab another boost and smash Palkia with Earthquake. Dragon Tail also hits Palkia for super-effective damage. Mega Lucario can outrun and OHKO Mega Gyarados with Close Combat, but regular Gyarados beats it. Shaymin-S can 2HKO every Gyarados variant with Seed Flare, but Stone Edge will take it down. Mewtwo OHKOes regular Gyarados with Thunder but cannot beat Mega Gyarados reliably, as Aura Sphere doesn't 2HKO.

**Entry Hazards**: Gyarados generally lacks reliable recovery, so repeated attacks will eventually take it down, although the RestTalk set can heal off damage pretty well. Regular Gyarados is also weak to Stealth Rock.
