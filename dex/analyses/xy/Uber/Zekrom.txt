Overview
########

Zekrom is a force to be reckoned with in the Ubers metagame, as it possesses an excellent STAB combination along with high-Base Power moves and a great Attack stat. Immunity to paralysis makes it an excellent revenge killer along with a Choice Scarf. Zekrom can lure in Ground-types and deal damage, either for itself or for another teammate, while simultaneously forcing out nearly all Flying- and Water-types. Unfortunately, Zekrom is one of many Pokemon that struggles against Primal Groudon. Though Zekrom can deal damage to Primal Groudon, the latter's bulk makes it a tough opponent for Zekrom. Moreover, Zekrom has trouble spamming its STAB attacks because Fairy- and Ground-type Pokemon are each immune to one of them. Base 90 Speed is also not good enough, as Zekrom needs a Choice Scarf to outspeed important threats such as Arceus, Latios, Latias, and Mewtwo.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Bolt Strike
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Draco Meteor
move 4: Volt Switch
ability: Teravolt
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naughty

Moves
========

Bolt Strike demolishes anything that isn't a Ground-type. Outrage hits Pokemon that resist or are immune to Bolt Strike such as Grass Arceus and Landorus-T and gives Zekrom a fighting chance against offensive variants of Primal Groudon. Draco Meteor hits physically defensive Ground-types such as Gliscor, and Volt Switch allows Zekrom to maintain momentum for its team while simultaneously inflicting decent damage.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment in Attack and Speed is necessary for Zekrom to hit as hard and as quickly as possible. A Naughty nature is preferred over Naive in order to 2HKO Electric-neutral, bulky variants of Arceus with Bolt Strike. Teravolt is useful for dealing serious damage to Lugia through Multiscale.

Usage Tips
========

This set is typically used on offensive teams that desire both a revenge killer and a dedicated late-game cleaner, as well as a Pokemon that has the ability to outspeed common threats such as Latios, Latias, and Extreme Killer Arceus. Zekrom will be switching in and out often, so don't let it get worn down by repeated attacks and passive damage. Generally, Zekrom should only enter the battlefield on a free switch or a predicted Thunder Wave. When in doubt, scout with Volt Switch, but don't abuse it because Ground-types can block it completely. As all of Zekrom's moves have common immunities, prediction is very important in order to conserve momentum for your team. Predict incorrectly and Zekrom will be unable to effectively deal damage.

Team Options
========

Stealth Rock support will turn some of Zekrom's 2HKOs into OHKOs, particularly against Lugia, Skarmory, and defensive variants of Yveltal. Landorus-T and Gliscor are two Stealth Rock users that can also absorb Ground-type attacks for Zekrom. Primal Kyogre takes on the Ground-types that give Zekrom a hard time in Ubers, particularly Primal Groudon. Ho-Oh also has great defensive synergy with Zekrom due to its massive Special Defense, resistances to Fairy- and Grass-type moves, and immunity to Ground-type moves. Mega Gengar can switch in on Ground-type moves thanks to Levitate before it Mega Evolves and can trap and KO most other threats to Zekrom such as Xerneas. Zekrom also forms a great VoltTurn core with Mega Scizor, which can be switched into Xerneas or Mega Diancie.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Bolt Strike
move 2: Outrage / Dragon Claw
move 3: Draco Meteor
move 4: Volt Switch / Tailwind
ability: Teravolt
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naughty

Moves
========

Bolt Strike is an incredibly powerful STAB attack that plows through anything that it hits neutrally. Outrage is the best choice for a secondary STAB attack, hitting Grass-, Dragon-, and Ground-types such as Grass Arceus, Kyurem-W, and Landorus-T, respectively, which have no trouble taking a Bolt Strike. Alternatively, Dragon Claw can be used if Zekrom does not wish to be locked into Outrage and confused, though Zekrom usually prefers Outrage's power. Volt Switch is the best option in the fourth slot to help Zekrom pivot around and maintain momentum for its team. Tailwind can act as a pseudo-Agility and help Zekrom outspeed the entire unboosted metagame while giving its teammates a temporary Speed boost. However, Focus Blast can be used instead if your team struggles against Ferrothorn.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment in Attack and Speed is necessary for Zekrom to hit as hard and as quickly as possible. A Naughty nature is preferred over Naive because Zekrom finds maximum Attack to be more useful than maximum Speed. Teravolt is useful to OHKO Lugia through Multiscale. If running Focus Blast, an EV spread of 160 Atk / 96 SpA / 252 Spe can be used to always 2HKO Ferrothorn.

Usage Tips
========

The one-two punch of Draco Meteor and Outrage is a great way to lure and KO most Ground-types, including Primal Groudon. Because Zekrom is not locked into a move, its attacks are much more spammable than usual, as Zekrom can Volt Switch out of an unfavorable matchup as long as the foe is not a Ground-type. If running Tailwind, use it on a predicted switch, when Zekrom is about to be KOed, or when facing a foe that does not threaten Zekrom. Be sure to lure and KO opposing Ground-types that attempt to block Volt Switch. After the opponent has lost their Ground-types, use Volt Switch primarily on predicted switch-ins.

Team Options
========

Zekrom appreciates entry hazard support in order to help it sweep opposing teams more easily. Setters such as Landorus-T, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Gliscor can not only set up entry hazards but also take on the Ground-types that give Zekrom trouble. Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre have great defensive and offensive synergy, respectively, with Zekrom and appreciate Tailwind support to alleviate their somewhat low Speed stats. If running Volt Switch, Zekrom forms a good VoltTurn core with Scizor, which can deal with the Fairy-types that block Zekrom's Outrage. Pokemon that lose to Primal Groudon one-on-one, such as Xerneas, Mewtwo, and Extreme Killer Arceus, enjoy having Zekrom use Outrage to heavily damage Primal Groudon. Fairy-weak Pokemon such as Mega Salamence and Dark Arceus appreciate Zekrom's ability to dent Fairy-types with Bolt Strike as well.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Bolt Strike
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Dragon Claw
move 4: Volt Switch
ability: Teravolt
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Naughty

Moves
========

Bolt Strike is a very spammable STAB move that 2HKOes nearly everything that it hits neutrally. Outrage is Zekrom's second best bet against Pokemon that it cannot 2HKO with Bolt Strike, such as defensive Dialga. Dragon Claw is noticeably weaker than Outrage, but it does not prevent Zekrom from switching, so it can be more easily spammed in the presence of Steel-types such as Skarmory. Volt Switch maintains momentum, allowing Zekrom to pivot out of a predicted switch-in or a bad matchup.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment in Attack and Speed make Zekrom hit as hard and as quickly as possible. An Adamant nature is preferred to boost Zekrom's Attack and not lower its defenses, though Naughty can be used if you do not wish to lower the power of Volt Switch. Teravolt allows Zekrom's Bolt Strike to OHKO Lugia through Multiscale.

Usage Tips
========

This set has the role of an extremely powerful wallbreaker, denting the defensive Pokemon that hyper offense teams struggle against. Because Ground- and Fairy-types stop Zekrom cold, you can't be reckless with this set despite its sheer power. Expert prediction is absolutely required to ensure Zekrom can break through opposing walls. Conversely, if you have eliminated your opponent's Fairy- and Ground-types, feel free to spam Outrage and Bolt Strike. To maximize your chances of landing a KO with Zekrom, bring it in against a slower Pokemon that it forces out, particularly Primal Kyogre, Giratina-O, or Blissey, then use prediction to hit the switch-in with the proper STAB attack.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Zekrom's usual checks make for good partners. For example, Giratina-O and Blaziken enjoy having Xerneas and Primal Groudon defeated, respectively. Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre have great defensive and offensive synergy, respectively, with Zekrom, so both can take on the walls that Zekrom struggles against, such as Ferrothorn and Ground Arceus. A Ground-immune Stealth Rock user such as Landorus-T, Skarmory, or Gliscor can take Ground-type attacks aimed at Zekrom and wear down opposing walls, making it easier for Zekrom to break them. A pivot such as Genesect or Mega Scizor can form a VoltTurn core with Zekrom and get it in the battlefield unscathed.

Other Options
########

Sleep Talk allows Zekrom to switch into Darkrai and Smeargle easily and subsequently annihilate them with any move that Sleep Talk selects. Earth Power 2HKOes most variants of Primal Groudon on the switch, but it requires prediction and significant Special Attack investment to use. Magnet Rise can be used on a predicted switch in order to make Zekrom immune to Ground-type moves. Fusion Bolt is an alternative STAB attack with perfect accuracy, but it is significantly less powerful than Bolt Strike and cannot paralyze the foe. Substitute with Hone Claws gives Zekrom a way to boost its Attack stat. In combination with Shuca Berry, Hone Claws also allows Zekrom to act as a great lure to Primal Groudon and a check to Mega Salamence.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ferrothorn**: Aside from the occasional Focus Blast, Ferrothorn resists all of Zekrom's moves and walls it to no end.

**Ground-types**: Ground-types such as Primal Groudon, Landorus-T, Excadrill, Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Ground Arceus all prevent Zekrom from safely using Bolt Strike. However, most Ground-types, even Primal Groudon, struggle to switch into Zekrom's Dragon-type attacks. The exception is Ground Arceus, which beats all of Zekrom's sets except for the Choice Scarf set if the Zekrom player predicts correctly.

**Fairy-types**: Xerneas, Mega Diancie, and Fairy Arceus all block Zekrom's Dragon-type moves and OHKO it back with a STAB attack. However, none of them can switch into even an unboosted Bolt Strike, especially if entry hazards are set up.

**Fast Dragon-types**: Kyurem-W, Palkia, Latios, and Latias all outspeed non-Choice Scarf Zekrom and OHKO it with their Dragon-type STAB moves.

**Deoxys-A**: Deoxys-A outspeeds even Choice Scarf Zekrom and OHKOes Zekrom with Psycho Boost or Ice Beam.
