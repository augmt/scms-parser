Overview
########

Zekrom is the quintessential anti-metagame Pokemon, capable of keeping staples such as Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal in check with its powerful Bolt Strike. Its excellent offensive typing, 150 / 120 attacking stats, and new-found immunity to paralysis make it an exemplary Choice Scarf user and grant it the ability to 2HKO almost anything in Ubers with the correct move. Moreover, the heavy decline in usage of Ferrothorn and Excadrill since BW eliminates the need for Zekrom to run any coverage moves whatsoever, allowing it to function with nothing but its powerful STAB attacks. However, Zekrom does not appreciate the introduction of the Fairy typing, and it remains unable to break through many Ground-types without the aid of a Choice Band. Its Speed is also decidedly average without a boost. These minor flaws notwithstanding, Zekrom is a fantastic addition to nearly any team.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Bolt Strike
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Draco Meteor
move 4: Outrage
ability: Teravolt
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naughty / Lonely

Moves
========

Bolt Strike is what makes Zekrom so deadly and is capable of 2HKOing nearly anything that doesn't resist it; the move has great coverage in Ubers thanks to the scarcity of opposing Grass- and Electric-types. Volt Switch allows Zekrom to switch out to a teammate after the opponent switches or before they attack, building momentum while simultaneously dealing damage. Draco Meteor is used primarily to hit Ground-types, most of which are physically defensive. Outrage is chosen in the last slot to clean up weakened teams late-game, though Dragon Claw can be used instead to circumvent the inability to switch caused by the use of Outrage. Sleep Talk is also an option that turns Zekrom into an ideal switch-in to Darkrai and Smeargle, granting it the ability to absorb a Dark Void or Spore and retaliate unpredictably.

Set Details
========

The given EVs and nature are fairly straightforward. Maximum Attack investment with a boosting nature enables Zekrom to hit as hard as possible with Bolt Strike and Outrage, while maximum Speed investment coupled with the boost from Choice Scarf allows Zekrom to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame bar Deoxys-A and Deoxys-S. Using a Speed-boosting nature is viable in order to outpace Deoxys-A, but doing this relinquishes Zekrom's ability to 2HKO 252 / 0 Arceus.

Usage Tips
========

Aside from functioning as a revenge killer, Zekrom should generally be switched in on one of its resistances or a predicted Thunder Wave and proceed to use Bolt Strike. Each of its other moves are useful in specific situations. Volt Switch should be used on predicted switches in order to accumulate momentum for your team, while Draco Meteor and Outrage hit nearly anything neutrally that the other two moves do not. Because there are immunities to each of Zekrom's STAB attacks, prediction is key, even when using Volt Switch.

Team Options
========

Stealth Rock support is particularly useful for this variant of Zekrom, as it turns many 2HKOs into OHKOs with Bolt Strike. Examples of this include OHKOs secured against defensive Yveltal, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Skarmory. Thus, reliable Stealth Rock setters make good teammates. Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Bronzong are particularly helpful for their ability to defeat opposing Ground-types. Support Arceus formes that can cover Zekrom's weaknesses, such as Water and Grass Arceus, can also accomplish this. Outside of providing Stealth Rock support, several other Pokemon are valuable teammates for Zekrom. Kyogre has excellent defensive synergy with Zekrom and can OHKO every single relevant Ground-type. Mega Gengar can trap and eliminate opposing Pokemon that resist Bolt Strike as well as Fairy-types, and it can also switch in on Ground-type moves before Mega Evolving thanks to Levitate. Ho-Oh threatens Ground- and Grass-types with Sacred Fire, has a useful Ground-type immunity, and can take practically any special Fairy-, Ice-, or Dragon-type move aimed at Zekrom. Skarmory can wall Ground- and Grass-types and provide entry hazard support. Finally, Genesect, Scizor, and Thundurus pair well with Zekrom thanks to U-turn and Volt Switch. The former two are also able to take Fairy-, Ice-, and Dragon-type moves.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Bolt Strike
move 2: Draco Meteor
move 3: Outrage / Dragon Claw
move 4: Tailwind / Volt Switch
ability: Teravolt
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naughty / Lonely

Moves
========

Backed by a Life Orb boost, Bolt Strike deals a tremendous amount of damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Draco Meteor complements it nicely, tearing off a hefty chunk of health from physically defensive Ground-types. Outrage is the superior physical Dragon-type STAB option for its high Base Power, but Dragon Claw carries the benefit of not locking Zekrom into one attack. Running Tailwind gives Zekrom the ability to outspeed practically everything and provides team support. However, Volt Switch can be used instead, as it allows Zekrom to switch out to a teammate while racking up damage in the process. Roost is a viable option in the last slot in order to increase Zekrom's longevity.

Set Details
========

The EVs and nature provided require little explanation. Maximizing Zekrom's Attack stat makes Bolt Strike and Outrage or Dragon Claw as strong as possible while 252 Speed EVs allow Zekrom to outrun particularly important foes that lack significant Speed investment, such as Groudon, Giratina-O, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and defensive Yveltal.

Usage Tips
========

Bolt Strike should be used whenever possible due to its tremendous power, while Draco Meteor and the physical Dragon-type move selected should only be used against Pokemon that resist Bolt Strike. Draco Meteor in particular allows Zekrom to act as a decent lure for Ground-types as it is capable of 2HKOing many of them, though entry hazard support is often needed. If Tailwind is used in the last slot, it should be set up when Zekrom can force a switch, or when it can take a hit and KO its opponent afterwards. If Volt Switch is chosen for the last slot, use it on predicted switch-ins to Pokemon that aren't immune to it.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support is invaluable to Life Orb Zekrom. As such, Pokemon that can provide this while synergizing with Zekrom defensively make great teammates. Landorus-T, Gliscor, Bronzong, Skarmory, Grass Arceus, and Water Arceus are all capable of setting up Stealth Rock and taking care of Ground-types. Kyogre and Ho-Oh have good defensive synergy with Zekrom, and both can make good use of Tailwind. Mega Gengar can trap and KO opposing Ground-, Grass-, and Fairy-types that threaten Zekrom, and it possesses Levitate before it Mega Evolves. If Volt Switch is used in the final slot, Genesect, Scizor, and Thundurus pair well with Zekrom thanks to their typing and access to U-turn or Volt Switch. Lastly, Sticky Web support is highly beneficial to Zekrom lacking Tailwind, allowing it to outspeed and OHKO faster threats such as Kyurem-W and Palkia.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Bolt Strike
move 2: Outrage
move 3: Dragon Claw
move 4: Volt Switch
ability: Teravolt
item: Choice Band
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naughty / Lonely

Moves
========

With the boost from Choice Band, Zekrom's Bolt Strike will absolutely maim anything that isn't outright immune to it. The move OHKOes a large portion of the metagame, including key threats such as offensive Xerneas and Palkia. Outrage hits anything Bolt Strike does not for an obscene amount of damage and is able to 2HKO most of Zekrom's usual checks including Groudon, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Grass Arceus, even with maximum defensive investment. Dragon Claw softens up Zekrom's checks without locking it into a move, allowing it or a teammate to come in later and finish the job. Finally, Volt Switch is used to gather momentum for Zekrom's team.

Set Details
========

Once again, the listed EV spread needs little explanation. Maximum Attack investment causes Zekrom's attacks to hit with devastating force, and 252 Speed EVs allow Zekrom to outspeed and safely 2HKO Pokemon such as Groudon and Landorus-T with Outrage on the switch. An Adamant nature can be used to keep Zekrom's defenses intact, though this weakens Volt Switch.

Usage Tips
========

Choice Band Zekrom aims to remove its usual checks through the sheer power of its attacks, paving the way for a teammate or Zekrom itself to sweep. It should therefore be played aggressively, with Bolt Strike and Outrage being selected the majority of the time. However, as an immunity to each of its STAB types exists, this Zekrom variant requires careful prediction to utilize to its fullest extent.

Team Options
========

As previously mentioned, Pokemon that appreciate the removal of opponents that can check Zekrom make great teammates. In this regard, setup sweepers such as Blaziken, Rayquaza, and Normal Arceus pair well with Choice Band Zekrom, as they often cannot get past bulky Ground-types and/or defensive Xerneas. Aside from this, Pokemon that have good defensive synergy with Zekrom are also acceptable teammates. Kyogre, Ho-Oh, Grass Arceus, and Water Arceus all share this trait. Landorus-T, Gliscor, Bronzong, and Skarmory do as well, and all of them have access to Stealth Rock. Genesect, Scizor, and Thundurus can use U-turn or Volt Switch to get Zekrom in safely and complement Zekrom's own Volt Switch nicely. Due to Zekrom's average Speed, Sticky Web support is extremely useful for this set; it enables Zekrom to 2HKO Ground and Grass Arceus on the switch without taking an Earthquake or Will-O-Wisp. It also allows Zekrom to outpace unboosted Kyurem-W and Palkia and OHKO them with a Dragon-type move.

Other Options
########

Zekrom has several other options. Fusion Bolt is a powerful STAB move that can be run alongside Bolt Strike for use in situations where Zekrom cannot afford to miss. Focus Blast hits Ferrothorn and Excadrill super effectively, though they are uncommon. Substitute eases prediction and can be used in conjunction with Hone Claws in order to set up on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Giratina-O. Thunder Wave cripples faster opponents but is not very useful as Zekrom's main switch-ins are Ground-types. Finally, Magnet Rise can be used to foil Ground-types attempting to hit Zekrom with Earthquake. However, as most of them carry Toxic, Magnet Rise does not allow Zekrom to bypass them completely.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ground-types**: These include Ground Arceus, Groudon, Gliscor, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Excadrill. However, many of them need to watch out for Draco Meteor and Choice Band Outrage. Only Ground Arceus can completely counter any Zekrom set.

**Grass-types**: These include Ferrothorn and Grass Arceus. Ferrothorn can use Leech Seed and set up entry hazards, while Grass Arceus can threaten Zekrom with a burn or a Ground-type move. Though very rare, Whimsicott also checks Zekrom by virtue of its typing.

**Fairy-types**: These are limited to Xerneas and Fairy Arceus, as most other relevant Fairy-types take too much damage from Bolt Strike. Physically defensive Xerneas can take any attack from Zekrom and strike back with Moonblast, while Choice Scarf Xerneas can outspeed and OHKO Zekrom. Neither variant can switch into a Bolt Strike from the Choice Band set, though. Fairy Arceus can survive a Bolt Strike from even the Choice Band set and use Will-O-Wisp or Judgment in return, but it is 2HKOed by Bolt Strike from the Choice Scarf set.

**Faster Dragon-types**: These include Palkia, Rayquaza, and Kyurem-W, all of which can KO Zekrom with the appropriate move. However, they will lose to the Choice Scarf set one-on-one unless they also have a Choice Scarf equipped.

**Deoxys-A**: Naive Deoxys-A outspeeds any variant of Zekrom other than the Choice Scarf set with a positive Speed nature and OHKOes with Psycho Boost or Ice Beam.

**Will-O-Wisp**: Burning Zekrom almost completely incapacitates it. The best way to accomplish this is with Will-O-Wisp from a bulky Arceus.
