Overview
########

In every generation, the introduction of new threats and mechanics causes old favorites to fall from grace, and this time, Fighting Arceus is among the losers. The newly introduced Fairy-types resist its STAB moves and threaten it with their own, and Yveltal can outlast it with Oblivion Wing. Meanwhile, its old nemeses, Ho-Oh and Mewtwo, are empowered by the new Defog mechanics and the introduction of two Mega Evolutions, respectively. However, although it has a lot of threats hampering its effectiveness, it maintains a niche. As the only bulky Fighting-type in the tier, it alone can comfortably switch into Extreme Killer Arceus and Mega Kangaskhan and threaten them with its STAB moves. By virtue of being an Arceus forme, it has access to well-distributed stats and an excellent movepool. Its weaknesses are pressing, but nonetheless Fighting Arceus can be an effective support Pokemon.

Moves
========

Fighting-type Judgment is the defining trait and raison d'Ãªtre of Fighting Arceus, heavily damaging Extreme Killer Arceus, Mega Kangaskhan, Dialga, Darkrai, and Kyurem-W. Recover allows Fighting Arceus to make the most of its substantial bulk and repeatedly check the aforementioned threats. Thunder Wave cripples many threats that otherwise switch into Fighting Arceus easily, such as Mewtwo, offensive Xerneas, and Gengar. However, Toxic can be used instead to limit activity from the likes of support Arceus and Lugia while also somewhat hampering more offensive Pokemon. Shadow Ball provides good coverage alongside Judgment, hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types super effectively, notably 2HKOing Mega Gengar. Stone Edge can be used to deal heavy damage to Ho-Oh, OHKOing it after some prior damage, but will leave Fighting Arceus unable to deal significant damage to Psychic- and Ghost-types. Fighting Arceus can also use Ice Beam to OHKO Gliscor, which otherwise counters Fighting Arceus, and Landorus-T, but the attack has few other targets as a super effective Ice Beam is no more powerful than a neutral Judgment. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple physical attackers, but Fighting Arceus already hits many of them hard with Judgment. It can also use Defog, as any support Arceus can, but this makes it more vulnerable to Ho-Oh and Yveltal.

Set Details
========

112 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Fighting Arceus to outspeed everything up to and including a positive-natured Garchomp. The HP investment gives it good mixed bulk, notably allowing it to survive any attack from Life Orb Extreme Killer Arceus after a Swords Dance and allowing it to wall Lustrous Orb Palkia in the absence of rain. The remaining EVs maximize its power, allowing it to heavily damage Normal Arceus and Mega Kangaskhan with Judgment. Alternatively, a spread of 144 HP / 252 SpA improves its damage output, but leaves it struggling to check Lustrous Orb Palkia.

Usage Tips
========

Due to its many weaknesses to prominent metagame threats, Fighting Arceus must be played with excellent prediction. Fairy-types, Ho-Oh, Gengar, and Mewtwo are likely to switch in and should be crippled with status moves or hit with an appropriate coverage move. Its weaknesses aside, Fighting Arceus can switch liberally into threats such as Palkia, Dialga, and Kyurem-W to wall or threaten them, although it must beware of status moves. It should not switch directly into full-health Mega Kangaskhan and Extreme Killer Arceus, though, as it cannot OHKO them without some prior damage.

Team Options
========

Fighting Arceus must be supported by a solid defensive backbone due to its many weaknesses. Steel-types such as Scizor, Aegislash, Bronzong, and Jirachi are crucial in order to check various Fairy-types. Landorus-T and Tyranitar can check Ho-Oh, and are especially important if Fighting Arceus lacks Stone Edge. A Fairy-type or Tyranitar is needed to check Yveltal, as although it cannot switch into Judgment easily, Yveltal easily outlasts Fighting Arceus one-on-one with Oblivion Wing. Stealth Rock is very important for Fighting Arceus, as it limits Ho-Oh considerably, guarantees a 2HKO with Judgment on Yveltal attempting to switch in, and weakens Mega Kangaskhan and Extreme Killer Arceus; Landorus-T, Tyranitar, and Dialga are good Stealth Rock users. Priority users such as Deoxys-A, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Scizor can finish off Extreme Killer Arceus if it survives against Fighting Arceus, while Giratina-O can serve as an effective secondary check while also helping to check Mewtwo.

Other Options
########

Fighting Arceus has access to Calm Mind and Swords Dance, but is outclassed as a sweeper by other Arceus formes and halted by Mewtwo. Calm Mind variants struggle to get around Fighting Arceus's usual checks, while Swords Dance variants lack a powerful STAB move to utilize the Attack boost. Fighting Arceus can use Thunder or Thunderbolt to hit Ho-Oh and Yveltal, but Shadow Ball generally has more utility. It can use Sludge Bomb to hit Fairy-types, but this leaves it easily walled by Poison-types and Aegislash. It also has access to the rare Perish Song, which can help stall teams to beat mono-attacking Calm Mind users, but has little other utility.

Checks and Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Xerneas, Fairy Arceus, and Sylveon can all easily absorb any attack from Fighting Arceus and threaten it with powerful STAB moves. Xerneas and Sylveon may also run Aromatherapy, preventing Fighting Arceus from crippling them or their teammates with status.

**Ho-Oh**: Without Stone Edge, Fighting Arceus cannot deal significant damage to Ho-Oh, which can OHKO it in return with Brave Bird. Although status limits it somewhat, Regenerator and Roost allow it to heal off most Toxic damage.

**Mega Gengar**: Mega Gengar can trap and eliminate most sets, although it is crippled by paralysis and must sacrifice itself to eliminate Fighting Arceus variants that carry Shadow Ball.

**Mewtwo**: Mewtwo and its Mega Evolutions resist Judgment, avoid 2HKOs from Shadow Ball, outspeed Fighting Arceus, and threaten it with their STAB moves. However, all Mewtwo are crippled by paralysis, and Mega Mewtwo X hates being burned.

**Yveltal**: As it is 2HKOed by Judgment, Yveltal cannot safely switch in. However, it can outlast Fighting Arceus with Oblivion Wing, as the moves deals considerable damage and heals Yveltal in the process.

**Mega Scizor**: Mega Scizor can shrug off any attacks from Fighting Arceus. It is immune to Toxic, largely unhampered by Thunder Wave due to its low Speed, has access to priority, and can stall with Toxic.

**Aegislash**: Aegislash is immune to Judgment and Toxic, is largely unhampered by Thunder Wave, and can Toxic Fighting Arceus. It also avoids a 2HKO from Shadow Ball.

**Gliscor**: Gliscor is effectively immune to status and can quite comfortably absorb neutral or resisted attacks, which are usually those which Fighting Arceus has against it. It can also cripple Fighting Arceus with Toxic.

**Status-Immune Pokemon**: Arceus formes with Calm Mind and Refresh as well as Pokemon with Rest and Sleep Talk that are not weak to Fighting-type moves can easily wall or set up on Fighting Arceus. Electric and Poison Arceus are immune to Thunder Wave and Toxic respectively and can comfortably set up against Fighting Arceus.
