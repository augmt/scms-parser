Overview
########

With access to two radically different Mega Evolutions, Mewtwo can be an offensive juggernaut either physically or specially, making it one of the most dangerous and unpredictable Pokemon in existence. Boasting a movepool with expansive coverage, setup, and support options that is supplemented by the highest Attack or Special Attack in the game and a superb base 130 Speed, the original Uber is almost impossible to check until its set is revealed. Moreover, Mewtwo has considerably better bulk than every other threat in Ubers that can outspeed Arceus, which, in conjunction with its stellar support movepool, enables it to run a highly effective defensive set. This also means that it is no glass cannon.

However, even with its astronomical offenses, Mewtwo struggles to OHKO most of the tier without the aid of super effective coverage moves. In addition, its defenses are only decent, which means that it cannot easily absorb most of the powerful attacks thrown around in Ubers without defensive investment. Its typing is also mediocre, offering it few resistances and consequently few switch-in opportunities. Nonetheless, Mewtwo's combination of power, speed, and sheer versatility makes it one of the most formidable opponents in Pokemon.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Psystrike
move 2: Taunt / Calm Mind
move 3: Fire Blast / Focus Blast
move 4: Focus Blast / Ice Beam / Shadow Ball
ability: Pressure
item: Mewtwonite Y / Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Mewtwo's signature move, Psystrike, is its most powerful STAB option and allows it to hit specially defensive opponents very hard. Taunt gives Mewtwo an excellent utility move that prevents foes from using support moves. Mewtwo can instead opt for Calm Mind, which allows it to become far more offensively potent and makes it difficult for special attackers to revenge kill. Fire Blast provides good neutral coverage alongside Psystrike and hits most Steel-types very hard, especially in sunlight. Focus Blast is unaffected by weather and smashes Steel-types as well, while also dealing super effective damage to Dark-types. Ice Beam is super effective against Flying-types, most notably Yveltal, as well as Ground-, Dragon-, and Grass-types. Shadow Ball, on the other hand, provides coverage against Psychic- and Ghost-types, which are some of Mewtwo's best checks. Ice Beam is best paired with Fire Blast for coverage, while Shadow Ball is best paired with Focus Blast.

There are a few other moves that Mewtwo can use on this set. Grass Knot is a powerful coverage option against Ground-, Water-, and Rock-types. With a Hasty nature, Low Kick can be used in place of Focus Blast, as it is far more reliable and still fairly powerful when uninvested. Aura Sphere is also usable, but its average Base Power is disappointing. Recover can be used with Calm Mind to capitalize on Special Defense boosts, though the loss of coverage leaves Mewtwo more easily walled. Fire Blast is the best choice for a coverage move when Recover is used.

Set Details
========

With 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature, Mewtwo reaches an elite Speed tier that is second only to Deoxys formes among the unboosted metagame, though it is still slower than common Choice Scarf users. 252 Special Attack EVs allow Mewtwo to hit as hard as possible. Mewtwonite Y is the preferred item; although Mega Mewtwo Y is marginally less powerful than Life Orb Mewtwo, it has significantly better longevity because it does not take Life Orb recoil, and its specially oriented bulk generally has more utility than the mixed bulk of Life Orb Mewtwo. With Mewtwonite Y, an EV spread with only 192 Speed EVs can be used, as the only Speed benchmark lost is against opposing Mega Mewtwo Y. However, it should be noted that if such an EV spread is used, Mewtwo will be outsped by opposing Mewtwo, Mega Gengar, Shaymin-S, and Darkrai prior to Mega Evolving.

Usage Tips
========

A good understanding of the power of this set is very helpful for effective usage; Mewtwo will rarely OHKO opposing Pokemon without super effective coverage moves, and bulkier Pokemon such as support Arceus will survive even those. As such, Mewtwo is best used against Pokemon for which it has the appropriate coverage or against somewhat weakened Pokemon. Taunt should be used liberally against defensive and support Pokemon that cannot threaten Mewtwo offensively, as doing so prevents them from using support moves, healing themselves, or crippling Mewtwo with status. Mewtwo should be switched in conservatively, as it is quickly worn down due to its average bulk and lack of many resistances. Mega Mewtwo Y can switch in somewhat more easily because of its good special bulk and the lack of Life Orb recoil, but it should still be conserved as best as possible. Strategic timing in terms of Mega Evolving Mewtwo can be important; while an early Mega Evolution is often advisable in order to avoid being outsped and to have superior special bulk with which to switch in, delaying the Mega Evolution to maintain physical bulk can be important on occasion, and doing so retains the uncertainty of Mewtwo's set.

Team Options
========

Mewtwo, especially Mega Mewtwo Y, appreciates solid tanks to absorb powerful physical attacks for it. Landorus-T is an excellent pivot that can check physical threats such as Blaziken, Zekrom, Ho-Oh, and opposing Ground-types effectively. Groudon can check Zekrom and Extreme Killer Arceus, and its Drought makes Mewtwo's Fire Blast even more threatening. These two Pokemon can also set up Stealth Rock, which allows Mewtwo to OHKO Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Defensive variants of Yveltal can check Extreme Killer Arceus, while all variants and Darkrai can check Ghost-types, some of Mewtwo's best checks. A Fairy-type to check opposing Yveltal is also important, as offensive Yveltal can threaten Mewtwo with Sucker Punch at any time. Klefki can check Yveltal and provide Spikes to support Mewtwo, while Xerneas can act as a powerful offensive teammate or as a sturdy tank that provides cleric support. Finally, Mewtwo excels on offensive teams, where a Volt Switch user such as Zekrom or Thundurus can allow it to get in safely.


Stalltwo
########
name: Stalltwo
move 1: Taunt
move 2: Will-O-Wisp
move 3: Recover
move 4: Psystrike
ability: Unnerve
item: Leftovers / Mewtwonite Y
evs: 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Stalltwo takes a very different approach from Mewtwo's other sets, eschewing all-out offense in favor of a defensive set that is made possible by Mewtwo's excellent support movepool and Speed stat. Taunt is the ultimate utility move, allowing Mewtwo to prevent the use of non-attacking moves, including status, recovery, and setup. Will-O-Wisp permanently cripples physical attackers and deals a solid amount of residual damage. Recover keeps Mewtwo healthy, which lets it wall weaker attackers and spread burns continuously. Psystrike rounds out the set as a powerful STAB move even without offensive investment and a reliable method of dealing direct damage. Notably, it OHKOes Mega Gengar, a threat that support Pokemon often struggle against.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP investment gives Mewtwo a large amount of overall bulk and optimizes Leftovers recovery, and 176 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow it to outspeed everything up to and including Arceus. The remaining EVs are placed in Defense to give Mewtwo a slightly easier time against physical attackers. It might be tempting to run Pressure on this set, but Unnerve is mandatory as it prevents setup sweepers that often carry Lum Berry, such as Groudon and Extreme Killer Arceus, from curing themselves of a burn. Mewtwonite Y and Mewtwonite X are both viable item options with unique advantages, although passive recovery and permanent access to Unnerve will be sorely missed when using them. Mewtwonite Y is the better of the two: at the cost of Unnerve and some Defense, Mewtwo receives a boost to its special stats and the ability to outspeed Shaymin-S, Mega Gengar, and opposing Mewtwo. With Mewtwonite Y, 192 Speed EVs should be used to allow Mewtwo to outspeed neutral-natured Deoxys-A.

Usage Tips
========

In comparison to Mewtwo's other sets, Stalltwo has a great deal of freedom in terms of both switching in and using Taunt, as it has Recover and a great deal of bulk. It follows that Taunt should be used without restraint; Stalltwo can easily take attacks from any defensive Pokemon without a super effective STAB move and Recover off the damage, making it an incredible asset against defensively oriented teams. However, as always, it is extremely important to avoid switching Mewtwo into Toxic or Thunder Wave. Aside from stallbreaking, the goal of this set is to spread burns, though it is worth noting that some Pokemon are better off badly poisoned than burned. Finally, understanding the limits of this set is important&mdash;Stalltwo is very bulky, but it is still unable to withstand extremely powerful attacks such as Choice Scarf Kyogre's Water Spout.

Team Options
========

This variant of Mewtwo provides support rather than seeking it, but there are still several defensive Pokemon that pair well with it. Yveltal and Ho-Oh are both massive pains for this set, so Rock Arceus is an ideal teammate. Specially defensive Kyogre is another great partner for Stalltwo, as it can deal with Darkrai and Ghost Arceus with little trouble, and the rain it brings allows Mewtwo to counter most Blaziken. Defensive Xerneas also deals with Dark-types and can cure Mewtwo of status with Aromatherapy. Yveltal and Ho-Oh are good teammates as well, as the former can take on Ghost-types for Mewtwo while the latter can offer massive special bulk and the ability to counter Genesect.


Physical Attacker
########
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Low Kick
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Zen Headbutt / Earthquake
move 4: Ice Beam / Stone Edge
ability: Pressure
item: Mewtwonite X
evs: 4 Def / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Jolly

Moves
========

Low Kick is a frighteningly powerful STAB move, especially coming off of Mega Mewtwo X's titanic base 190 Attack: the move has 120 Base Power against most Ubers, which causes it to leave a huge dent in nearly anything that doesn't resist it. Taunt allows Mewtwo to circumvent Will-O-Wisp users and prevent the use of non-attacking moves such as Recover and Defog. Zen Headbutt is a decent secondary STAB move that provides good neutral coverage alongside Low Kick, but Earthquake can be used instead to 2HKO Aegislash and OHKO Klefki. Ice Beam is preferred in the last slot for its ability to OHKO Landorus-T and Gliscor, but Stone Edge is an option to OHKO Ho-Oh and heavily damage other Flying-types, such as Lugia. Rock Slide is a suitable replacement for Stone Edge, trading power for accuracy and a flinch chance. Poison Jab and Iron Tail are also options on this set to hit Fairy-types super effectively, but their overall coverage is poor.

Set Details
========

A Speed-boosting nature and 252 Speed EVs allow Mewtwo to outpace key threats, such as Arceus, Darkrai, and Shaymin-S, and maximum Attack investment makes the most of the highest Attack stat in the game. A Naive nature should be used if Mewtwo runs Ice Beam, while a Jolly nature should be used without it. 200 HP / 56 Atk / 252 Spe is a bulkier EV spread that notably allows Mewtwo to usually survive a +2 Extreme Speed from Extreme Killer Arceus after Stealth Rock and OHKO Arceus in return with Low Kick.

Usage Tips
========

Taunt is one of Mewtwo's greatest assets as an offensive Pokemon, so it should be used as needed against defensive Pokemon in order to prevent them from healing or using status moves. Otherwise, Low Kick is generally Mewtwo's best option due to its insane power, although it cannot OHKO most Pokemon outright. As this set lacks a recovery move, Mewtwo should be switched in conservatively. Mewtwo can throw off several opponents as a result of the typing change that occurs when it Mega Evolves; Pokemon that rely on Dark-type moves to damage regular Mewtwo and Mega Mewtwo Y, such as Deoxys-A, Yveltal, and Dark Arceus, can often be met with a surprise KO. That said, when using Taunt or Ice Beam first, delaying the Mega Evolution is often advisable in order to maintain Mewtwo's unpredictability.

Team Options
========

A good check to Fairy-types is a must, as they switch into Mega Mewtwo X with ease if it lacks Poison Jab or Iron Tail. Aegislash, Scizor, Bronzong, and Jirachi can handle Fairy-types reliably, and the latter two can also set up Stealth Rock, which helps against Ho-Oh and Aeroblast Lugia. Ho-Oh is also a good answer to Fairy-types, and it can switch in for free on Will-O-Wisp. Dark-types such as Yveltal and Darkrai are excellent teammates as they can deal with Ghost- and Psychic-types, which are some of the best answers to this set. Otherwise, Mega Mewtwo X performs well on offensive teams in general. Examples of Pokemon commonly seen on offensive teams that work well with Mega Mewtwo X include Deoxys-S, which sets up entry hazards that Mewtwo's Taunt prevents the removal of, and Thundurus, which serves as an emergency response to faster Pokemon and can bring Mewtwo in safely with Volt Switch.


Bulk Up
########
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Drain Punch / Low Kick
move 3: Zen Headbutt / Rock Slide
move 4: Taunt / Rock Slide
ability: Pressure
item: Mewtwonite X
evs: 4 Def / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Bulk Up raises Mewtwo's Attack and cushions its Defense, which makes it very difficult for priority users and physically based Choice Scarf users to take out. Drain Punch complements Bulk Up nicely due to the recovery it provides, and after a boost, it becomes almost as strong as a full-power Low Kick. Low Kick can be used instead of Drain Punch if power is preferred over the ability to heal, but this leaves Mewtwo vulnerable to lighter Pokemon such as Klefki. Zen Headbutt is an acceptable secondary STAB move that grants Mewtwo good neutral coverage, and Taunt allows Mewtwo to set up on support Pokemon and is a good utility move in general. Rock Slide is an option over either Zen Headbutt or Taunt to hit Flying-types such as Lugia and Ho-Oh super effectively. Stone Edge is also an option for more power, but Rock Slide is usually strong enough after a Bulk Up.

Set Details
========

Any offensive Mewtwo set needs all the power and speed it can get, and this one is no different. Maximum Attack investment capitalizes on Mega Mewtwo X's base 190 Attack stat, and maximizing Mewtwo's Speed stat allows it to outrun several important threats, including Arceus, Darkrai, and Shaymin-S.

Usage Tips
========

One of the defining characteristics of Bulk Up Mewtwo is its unexpectedness: it can easily force a switch and get in a free Bulk Up by bluffing a different set before it Mega Evolves. However, as with all setup sweepers, Mewtwo should not attempt a sweep until its checks and counters have been removed. It also goes without saying that Mewtwo will be much easier for the opponent to deal with once its set has been revealed. If an opportunity to set up cannot easily be found, Drain Punch is a good move to throw out in most situations due to the recovery it affords.

Team Options
========

Dark-types such as Yveltal, Darkrai, Dark Arceus, and Tyranitar are fantastic teammates for Bulk Up Mewtwo, as they can KO the Ghost- and Psychic-types that counter it. Mega Mewtwo X in general is troubled by Fairy-types, so checks to them, such as Aegislash, Scizor, Bronzong, and Jirachi, are also good teammates for Bulk Up Mewtwo. The latter two can also set up Stealth Rock, which lets Mewtwo OHKO Ho-Oh with Zen Headbutt after a boost and helps it against Aeroblast Lugia. Ho-Oh can handle Fairy-types for Mewtwo, while Mewtwo can handle Rock-types in return.


Other Options
########

Substitute eases prediction, but it comes at the cost of HP and is inferior to Taunt overall. However, it can be used by Mega Mewtwo X alongside Focus Punch. Thunder and Hurricane are both strong special attacking options, but their coverage is unnecessary and their accuracy is awful outside of rain. Mewtwo has an enormous movepool, so specific coverage moves such as the elemental punches are also usable if deemed necessary.

Other than moves, Mewtwo has many other options in terms of general sets. For example, a dual screens set can work thanks to Mewtwo's very fast Taunt, and dual screens Mewtwo sets itself apart from Deoxys-S with Self-Destruct. A bulky Calm Mind set with Leftovers or Mewtwonite Y is also an option.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ghost Arceus**: Ghost Arceus is the only Pokemon with reliable recovery that can switch into and threaten almost any Mewtwo set without fearing a 2HKO. However, if Stealth Rock is up, Mega Mewtwo Y and Life Orb Mewtwo are easily capable of 2HKOing Ghost Arceus with Psystrike or Shadow Ball. In addition, Ghost Arceus cannot OHKO Mega Mewtwo Y without offensive investment or a physical move.

**Giratina-O**: Giratina-O can quite comfortably tank all but super effective coverage moves from Mewtwo and retaliate with its STAB moves, but it is easily worn down as it lacks reliable recovery.

**Aegislash**: Aegislash takes little from Mewtwo's STAB moves and threatens Mewtwo with Gyro Ball, Shadow Ball, Shadow Sneak, or Pursuit. However, it needs to watch out for Fire Blast, Shadow Ball, Earthquake, and Will-O-Wisp.

**Sableye**: Sableye is immune to Mewtwo's Psychic- and Fighting-type moves and can cripple Mewtwo with Will-O-Wisp or deal massive damage to it with Foul Play. It also defeats Stalltwo one-on-one thanks to Prankster Taunt. However, due to its low stats, Sableye will be hit very hard by coverage moves from Mega Mewtwo Y and Life Orb Mewtwo.

**Yveltal**: Yveltal can switch into any attack from Mega Mewtwo Y or regular Mewtwo and threaten an OHKO with Sucker Punch, although Ice Beam can OHKO it after Stealth Rock damage. Yveltal can't switch into Mega Mewtwo X but can survive any attack from it and threaten an OHKO with Oblivion Wing.

**Dark Arceus**: Dark Arceus can deal with Mega Mewtwo Y and regular Mewtwo as long as it does not switch into a Fighting-type move.

**Psychic Arceus**: Psychic Arceus easily takes any of Mewtwo's attacks other than Shadow Ball with ease and threatens Mewtwo with Payback or Judgment. Stalltwo can give Psychic Arceus trouble if it lacks Magic Coat, however.

**Deoxys-D**: Deoxys-D takes little from Mewtwo's attacks other than Shadow Ball and can damage it with Toxic, Knock Off, or Night Shade. However, Deoxys-D is vulnerable to Taunt, especially from Stalltwo.

**Wobbuffet**: Wobbuffet loses to Stalltwo, but it beats offensive Mewtwo variants with Counter or Mirror Coat provided it doesn't switch into Shadow Ball.

**Tanks and Mixed Walls**: Lugia, Giratina, and Ho-Oh are all good initial switch-ins to Mewtwo while its set is unknown. Lugia can shrug off most moves from Mega Mewtwo X and 2HKO it with Aeroblast, while Giratina can phaze it out or burn it. When healthy, Ho-Oh can survive any one attack from Mewtwo other than Rock Slide or Stone Edge, and it threatens Mewtwo immensely with its STAB moves. Physically defensive Ho-Oh is especially effective against Mewtwo, as it handles Psystrike well and is not OHKOed by Rock Slide.

**Bulky Fairy-types**: Fairy Arceus and defensive Xerneas can switch into any Mega Mewtwo X that lacks Iron Tail and Poison Jab and threaten it with their STAB moves. Klefki can also threaten any Mewtwo that lacks Fire Blast, Earthquake, and Drain Punch.

**Revenge Killers**: Many Choice Scarf users, including Kyogre and Xerneas, can outspeed and OHKO most or all variants of Mewtwo; Genesect is especially notable for its ability to force out Mega Mewtwo Y and regular Mewtwo with U-turn. Priority users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Rayquaza can also reliably pick off a weakened Mewtwo. However, special attackers and physical attackers will struggle against Calm Mind and Bulk Up variants, respectively.
