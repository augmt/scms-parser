Overview
########
Mawile is characterized by its outstanding typing, as well as its decent defensive stats and an obscene Attack stat when Mega Evolved. Its Steel / Fairy typing allows it to check 3 of the most dangerous Pokemon in Ubers: Xerneas, Yveltal, and Darkrai. Its movepool complements it well, with access to Swords Dance to bolster its already high Attack stat, strong priority in Sucker Punch that allows it to force quite a few switches, and several coverage options to surprise its would-be checks and counters. What its movepool lacks is reliable recovery which, when combined with its slightly disappointing special bulk, means it needs to invest heavily in Special Defense instead of Attack. Being a grounded Pokemon with this flaw also makes Spikes one of its worst enemies, especially because Mega Mawile cannot hold Leftovers. Mawile and its Mega forme both have a terrible Speed stat which makes them over-reliant on Sucker Punch. Will-O-Wisp is the bane of Mawile, especially because there are many fast users of the move in Ubers. Lastly, Mawile has poor bulk before Mega Evolving, although it can force the switches it needs to Mega Evolve safely.

Moves
========
Iron Head is Mawile's STAB attack that allows it to OHKO or 2HKO Fairy-types, including the extremely dangerous Geomancy Xerneas, with hardly any Attack investment whatsoever. Play Rough is Mawile's secondary STAB move, and although it is more powerful than Iron Head, it does have a 10% chance to miss. It OHKOes Yveltal, Darkrai, and heavily damages all of the common Dragon-types in Ubers, while having a 93% chance to OHKO standard Dark Arceus after Stealth Rock. Sucker Punch is Mawile's way of bypassing its terrible Speed stat and OHKOes offensive Mewtwo and Mega Mewtwo Y as well as many other offensive threats with some prior damage. Pain Split is Mawile's only usable form of recovery, and given Mawile's low HP stat when compared to its switch-ins', it will usually regain a sizable chunk of HP when the move is used. Swords Dance gives Mawile a very high chance to OHKO offensive Kyogre and Palkia after Stealth Rock, and forces Lugia to phaze it out. It also allows Mawile to dent support Arceus formes, with the boost from Swords Dance making up for the Attack lost to the burn from Arceus.

Set Details
========
The Special Defense and HP EVs allow Mawile to take any move from +2 Geomancy Xerneas after Stealth Rock damage, and gives it favorable odds should a layer of Spikes be up on its side of the field instead. It also allows it to switch into Yveltal with Spikes on the field. 16 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature give Mawile an almost perfect chance to OHKO offensive Palkia and Kyogre after Stealth Rock damage and a Swords Dance boost with Sucker Punch while not taking too many EVs away from its special bulk. Intimidate gives Mawile utility before it Mega Evolves.

Usage Tips
========
Do not play recklessly with Mawile. The threats it is catered to deal with are all extremely powerful, so it needs to be healthy in order to check them properly. Mega Evolve Mawile as soon as possible in order to patch up its Special Defense. If Mega Mawile is not needed, then keeping Mawile around in its base forme for Intimidate could also be helpful. Be careful when using Sucker Punch. It is a move that forces a lot of mind games, so try your best to maximize the odds in your favor or at least be prepared to play some mind games.

Team Options
========
Kyogre is an almost mandatory teammate, as the rain Drizzle brings weakens Geomancy Xerneas's Hidden Power Fire. Specially defensive Kyogre with Roar can also be a secondary check to Geomancy Xerneas. It and Mawile complement each other so well that specially defensive Kyogre should always be considered first when choosing Mawile's teammates. With Landorus-T and Groudon being thorns in Mawile's side, both Yveltal and Giratina-O are excellent partners for it. Giratina-O can also provide Defog support to remove Spikes. Bulky checks to Steel-types, such as Ho-Oh and Groudon, are also welcome teammates, as Mawile has issues touching bulky Steel-types. Landorus-T checks both Ground-types and Steel-types well and can also set up Stealth Rock to help Mawile net KOs with Sucker Punch. Wish and cleric support make Mawile's job a whole lot easier, and clerics also allow Swords Dance Mawile to take a burn from support Arceus formes and not be useless for the rest of the battle. Healing Wish support from Choice Scarf Shaymin-S performs both roles at once. Paralysis and Trick Room support help Mawile with its Speed problem and can allow it to use its ridiculously powerful STAB moves to their fullest potential. Defog or Rapid Spin support is mandatory because of how badly Spikes hurt Mawile's checking abilities. Scolipede's own Spikes can put a lot of Pokemon into Mawile's Sucker Punch range.


Other Options
########
Taunt stops many of Mawile's switch-ins from using Will-O-Wisp if you can catch them on the switch, allowing Mawile to take them on if need be. Rock Slide OHKOes Ho-Oh on the switch, although +2 Sucker Punch can also KO Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock damage. Baton Pass can help Mawile get rid of support Arceus formes with Gothitelle as a partner. Fire Fang fries Scizor on the switch, which otherwise walls Mawile. Lastly, Knock Off can harass a few of Mawile's switch-ins.


Checks & Counters
########

**Spikes**: Spikes are Mawile's number one enemy. They cut a deep gash into its checking abilities, especially after 2 or more switch-ins.

**Bulky Steel-types**: Scizor, Heatran, and any Steel-type viable in Ubers other than Klefki have a good odds of beating Mawile one-on-one.

**Bulky Ground-types**: Groudon, Landorus-T, and Ground Arceus all OHKO Mawile with Earthquake and are bulky enough to not be 2HKOed by Play Rough plus Sucker Punch.

**Fire-types**: Heatran, Blaziken, and Ho-Oh can all beat Mawile one on one easily. Ho-Oh must watch out for +2 Sucker Punch if it takes Stealth Rock damage, however.

**Will-O-Wisp Users**: Support Arceus formes, Calm Mind Ghost Arceus and Poison Arceus, and Stalltwo can all beat Mawile one-on-one, although no Arceus will like the encounter with Mawile if it carries Swords Dance.
