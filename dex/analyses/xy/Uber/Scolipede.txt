Overview
########

Scolipede manages to secure a support niche in Ubers due to several factors. Scolipede has access to one of the best offensive abilities in the game, Speed Boost, allowing for lightning fast movement. This ability is complemented by a unique 112 base Speed, which allows Scolipede to outpace every unboosted threat in Ubers when it is at +1. Scolipede has a quite useful movepool as well, having access to the coveted Toxic Spikes as well as being able to effectively abuse moves such as Endeavor and Baton Pass. The multi-hitting Pin Missile also allows Scolipede to anti-lead against foes such as Deoxys which rely on a Focus Sash. Despite these advantages, Scolipede suffers to some extent as it is a predictable lead due to how specialized it is. This is further compounded by the fact that Scolipede is not very bulky and suffers from a weakness to Stealth Rock which can sometimes make getting it back into battle difficult. Scolipede can also struggle against sand leads, priority, and bulky offense in general due to the common use of support Arceus on bulky offense teams. Despite these flaws, Scolipede remains one of the best anti-leads and preforms excellently on hyper offensive teams.


Anti-Lead
########
name: Anti-Lead
move 1: Pin Missile
move 2: Spikes / Toxic Spikes
move 3: Protect / Toxic
move 4: Endeavor
item: Focus Sash
ability: Speed Boost
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly


Moves
========

Pin Missile is Scolipede's offensive move of choice and provides a solution to common Focus Sash leads in addition to dealing decent damage; however, it is reliant on luck when used against Deoxys-S, which needs at least three hits to be KOed, while Darkrai needs four. Although Scolipede can run both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, it is generally better to choose one or the other. Spikes are generally superior as they are less risky and can be stacked further. Toxic Spikes is a unique option when compared to other leads; however, setting up a single layer can be dangerous, as it will not badly poison support Arceus that may come in to use Defog. Protect is handy for general utility but mainly it is for accumulating +1 Speed and blocking Fake Out from Mega Kangaskhan. Toxic is another option instead of Protect which can be used to punish switch-ins that attempt to eliminate Scolipede's entry hazards. In the final slot, Endeavor is used, as when combined with a Focus Sash and Speed Boost, it can take foes to 1 HP just before Scolipede faints. Although it is not slashed, Earthquake can be used as a decent option to hit Mega Gengar, which can otherwise easily remove Scolipede.


Set Details
========

Scolipede's EVs are quite basic. Max Speed investment is needed to outspeed Deoxys-S and all unboosted threats when Scolipede is at +1. The Attack investment is critical to helping Scolipede OHKO threats such as Darkrai and Deoxys-S, which have decent bulk when compared to Scolipede's mediocre Attack. Focus Sash is Scolipede's best item choice to help it obtain two chances to attack.


Usage Tips
========

Typically, Scolipede likes to use Protect turn one. However, when against threats such as Deoxys which set entry hazards it is better to attack, as if the opponent switches this can lead to free hazards or status. Early predictions are important and it must be decided if your opponent will attack or switch as this will affect your best move. Although Scolipede is primarily a lead, if your opponent has anti-leads such as Thundurus and Mega Gengar, Scolipede is best saved for later. Scolipede's tendency to lead can also become an advantage as you can bank on your opponent's assumptions to become more unpredictable as Scolipede does not necessarily have to lead to effectively set hazards.


Team Options
========

Due to Scolipede's better momentum generation when compared to many other hazard leads and its access to Toxic Spikes, it works best on a hyper offensive team. Ghost-types are good partners for Scolipede as they are immune to common Normal-type priority moves and block the few users of Rapid Spin which can immediately eliminate Scolipede's entry hazards. Calm Mind Arceus-Ghost is an excellent partner as it can beat Gengar one-on-one before Gengar Mega Evolves and threaten Defog users in general. Scolipede also needs Pokemon that appreciate the hazards that it lays such as Mega Kangaskhan, Shaymin-Sky, offensive Mewtwo, Choice Scarf Kyogre, Rayquaza, and offensive Palkia. Lastly, Scolipede needs teammates that can lead in place of it when the opponent has leads that can threaten Scolipede.



Baton Pass Lead
########
name: Baton Pass Lead
move 1: Protect
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Swords Dance / Substitute
move 4: Pin Missile
item: Focus Sash / Black Sludge
ability: Speed Boost
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly


Moves
========

Protect allows Scolipede to accumulate Speed boosts for it to pass and prevents Fake Out use from Mega Kangaskhan. Baton Pass is mandatory for a passing set. Swords Dance allows Scolipede to deal respectable damage with Pin Missile at +2; however, it is mainly for passing the boosts to receivers. Alternatively, Substitute can be used over Swords Dance as when paired with Protect, Scolipede accumulates more Speed. Pin Missile is Scolipede's only attacking move and still allows for anti-leading against certain common leads.


Set Details
========

Max Speed investment allows Scolipede to outspeed Deoxys-S and the entire unboosted tier when it is at +1. Attack investment allows Pin Missile to deal enough damage to anti-lead threats such as Deoxys-S. A Focus Sash maximizes Scolipede's chances of passing after boosting. A possible alternative to a Focus Sash is Black Sludge, which should only be run with Substitute and heals enough HP to allow Scolipede to survive longer by stalling with Protect and Substitute.


Usage Tips
========

As this Scolipede is primarily for passing, Taunt will prevent it from doing its job entirely. Protect should be used against Deoxys leads that may carry Taunt so that Scolipede can outspeed and OHKO them with Pin Missile next turn. Scolipede is quite fragile and at great risk of being KOed by priority, so it should Baton Pass as soon as possible. Because Scolipede is quite identifiable as a lead, it tends to draw out anti-leads. This can be planned for and capitalized upon while Scolipede is saved for later use.


Team Options
========

Once Scolipede has accumulated stat boosts it will need teammates to receive them. Such receivers should have good bulk and offensive power that can be hindered to some extent by their lower speeds. Groudon, Arceus, and Kyogre are some of the many examples. Ghost-types such as Arceus-Ghost and Giratina formes provide a solution to Mega Kangaskhan while also providing Defog support which can be useful when saving Scolipede for later use.


Other Options
########

A more offensive Baton Pass Scolipede set is possible with Earthquake or Rock Slide as coverage, Earthquake beating threats such as Mega Gengar and Dialga leads and Rock Slide hitting Flying-types that resists Pin Missile. Aqua Tail is also usable as it hits Excadrill leads and deals chip damage to Landorus-T to place it in the KO range of other physical sweepers such as Mega Blaziken.


Checks and Counters
########

**Mega Kangaskhan**: Due to the multi-hit nature of attack affected by Parental Bond, Mega Kangaskhan can bypass Scolipede's Focus Sash and OHKO it.

**Prankster Anti-Leads**: Pokemon Such as Thundurus, Sableye, and Whimsicott bypass Scolipede's Speed Boost, so they will likely move first. They all have access to Taunt, so they will stop both of Scolipede's sets entirely.

**Ho-Oh**: When against Scolipede, Ho-Oh can use Sacred Fire which can effectively OHKO Scolipede with a burn, thereby limiting it to a single layer of entry hazards or preventing a Baton Pass.

**Mega Gengar**: Taunt shuts down Anti-Lead Scolipede and Shadow Tag traps it while Pin Missile does nothing, thereby limiting it to a single layer of entry hazards.

**Priority Moves**: As priority moves ignore Speed Boost, users of them can limit Scolipede to a single layer of entry hazards or KO it before it can Baton Pass. Typical priority users include Swords Dance Arceus, Rayquaza, Mega Scizor, Giratina-O, and Aegislash.

**Weather Leads**: Sandstorm damage from Tyranitar's or Hippowdon's Sand Stream can potentially limit Scolipede to a single layer of entry hazards or stop the Baton Pass set before a pass.

**Defog / Rapid Spin Leads**: These Pokemon undo Anti-Lead Scolipede's entry hazards. Support Arceus with Will-O-Wisp can stall out Scolipede and continue to Defog thereby stopping any entry hazards from every staying on the field.

**Phazing Leads**: Phazing leads can phaze out Baton Pass Scolipede before or after it passes. The most common Pokemon with phazing moves are Groudon, Dialga, Kyogre, and Lugia.
