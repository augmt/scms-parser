Overview
########

Smeargle has been one of the most feared Pokemon to face since the ruleset was first announced, as it was allowed to use one of the best (and arguably overpowered) moves on the doubles scene: Dark Void. This 80% accurate move puts both foes to sleep when it is used, and it is a powerful asset for Smeargle. This is backed up by a literally endless support movepool courtesy of Sketch. Add onto this its decent, albeit middling, Speed, and you have one of the best supporters in the format. However, Smeargle's bulk is nonexistent, and it lacks any offensive presence, making it complete Taunt bait. Additionally, its Speed is still middling, meaning that it can be outpaced by every common Taunt user while being too fast to be good under Trick Room. Finally, it faces stiff competition from Amoonguss and Pachirisu as a user of redirection moves.

Moves
========

Dark Void is hands down the best move in the format. The ability to put both targets to sleep with a move that is relatively accurate is great utility. This constant threat of putting both of your opponent's Pokemon to sleep is the closest thing Smeargle has to offensive presence, and it is a great tool for Smeargle to use. This in conjunction with Follow Me makes Smeargle really disruptive to the opposing team; with the ability to redirect attacks away from its partner, it can aid setup or give a free turn to attack. Follow Me is a rare move in the format due to its poor distribution, with the only other Pokemon with access to the move being Lucario, Furret, and Pachirisu. This gives Smeargle a niche in being the only attack redirector that can put its targets to sleep without being ignored by Grass-types and Safety Goggles Rotom-H.

Your choice for what to use in the last two moveslots comes down to the needs of your team. Fake Out is useful to flinch, immobilizing the target Pokemon and giving Smeargle another way of providing a free turn for its partner, as well as breaking Focus Sashes. However, Encore is a great way to lock opposing Pokemon into setup moves, letting Smeargle check Pokemon like Substitute Aegislash, Swords Dance Scizor, and Dragon Dance variants of Gyarados and Tyranitar. Additionally, it can be used to lock slower Pokemon into Protect, forcing them to switch out and waste a valuable turn in the fast-paced metagame. Spiky Shield is literally a better Protect, blocking all moves, getting chip damage when Smeargle is contacted, and being nigh impossible to lock with Imprison because of its low distribution. However, King's Shield lets Smeargle check physical attackers that commonly use contact moves, such as Kangaskhan, Garchomp, and Talonflame, as well as physically oriented Fake Out users like Mienshao and the aforementioned Kangaskhan. This, however, comes at the cost of the ability to block status moves, most notably Taunt. Also, it is important to note that Bisharp isn't affected by the Attack drop due to Defiant.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is chosen to maximize Smeargle's Speed while minimizing the damage Smeargle takes from Foul Play. Affecting Fake Out's power isn't important due to its low power regardless. The rest of the EVs are allocated in such a way as to maximize Smeargle's overall bulk. Focus Sash is the item of choice due to Smeargle's nonexistent bulk making the use of any other item unfeasible. Moody is the ability of choice because it can very easily make Smeargle a monster to face in just a few turns. However, it is a double-edged sword, as Smeargle can get accuracy, evasion, and Speed drops. Own Tempo could be used if you don't like this unpredictability, but confusion-inducing moves are incredibly rare, and the chance to make Smeargle monstrous is almost always worth the tradeoff.

Usage Tips
========

Spamming Dark Void is counterproductive because it fails when used on already sleeping Pokemon, and the threat that Smeargle could use it creates mindgames that are removed if it only uses said move. Follow Me needs to be used with the same level of care as Dark Void, as the combination of said moves is what makes Smeargle so disruptive. Smeargle's support options allow it to give its partners free turns to set up or a free turn, so make the most of all the options Smeargle has. Finally, don't be afraid to use Spiky Shield if you are unsure about what to do. It is a great way to scout and see what your opponent's strategy is, and protection is all the more valuable on a Pokemon as frail as Smeargle. Spiky Shield also adds to the mindgames that Smeargle can play.

Team Options
========

Smeargle is a valuable asset to more offensively oriented teams. However, it also needs support to come in safely due to its immense frailty, making Pokemon that are solid switch-ins or switch-outs such as Amoonguss, Garchomp, and Talonflame solid teammates. Smeargle's middling Speed stat means that it benefits greatly from Tailwind support, making users such as Aerodactyl, Noivern, and the aforementioned Talonflame solid partners. Common users of setup moves, such as Tyranitar, Scizor, and the previously mentioned Aegislash, benefit from Follow Me, Fake Out, Dark Void, Encore, and King's Shield aiding their setup. Similarly, frail attackers like Mega Lucario and Mega Aerodactyl benefit from Smeargle's ability to redirect attacks away from them.

As for support that Smeargle itself benefits from, users of Quick Guard, such as Mienshao and Talonflame, are great partners to prevent the use of moves like Fake Out, Sucker Punch, and Gale Wings Brave Bird; similarly, Wide Guard from Pokemon like Aegislash and Machamp makes the mindgames that Smeargle can already create even more potent, and allows it to be less reliant on Follow Me. Pokemon with access to Drought or Drizzle, i.e. Politoed and Mega Charizard Y, respectively, are great partners for their ability to clear hail and sandstorm. Aromatisse's Aroma Veil is a great way of preventing Smeargle from being on the wrong end of a Taunt. Finally, other users of Fake Out provide lots of opportunities for Smeargle to use Dark Void, making users such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mienshao, and Mega Blastoise great allies, with the latter also benefiting from the Follow Me support keeping Water Spout at maximum power. This opportunity creation concept also applies to Amoonguss as it can redirect attacks away from Smeargle to fire off a Dark Void, as well as helping to preserve Smeargle's Focus Sash.

Other Options
########

Smeargle has access to every released move in the game outside of Chatter, but it struggles to use the vast majority of them effectively. Transform can make it scary, allowing for the possibility of double-Mega Kangaskhan, among other threats, as well as allowing Smeargle to absorb Spores, Sleep Powders, and Stun Spores from Amoonguss and Venusaur or scout for movesets. However, it is unreliable and it removes Moody boosts, meaning that it isn't usually worth it unless Smeargle has crippling stat drops, in which case Smeargle either is better off switching out or has probably fainted already. Wide Guard is an option, although Smeargle is generally outclassed by Machamp, Mienshao, and Aegislash as a user of the move. Sunny Day and Rain Dance could work to preserve Smeargle's Focus Sash and support Pokemon like Venusaur and Ludicolo, but Smeargle struggles to fit either onto its moveset, and the concept requires such a high level of prediction that it usually isn't worth it. Safeguard is an option for teams that are susceptible to Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, as well as ones which struggle versus Amoonguss and opposing Smeargle, but Meowstic and Klefki outclass Smeargle in said role. Smeargle has a large range of Speed control options in Thunder Wave, Nuzzle, Glaciate, Icy Wind, Bulldoze, Rock Tomb, Electroweb, Tailwind, Sticky Web, and Trick Room, but there are better Pokemon for speed control strategies, such as Talonflame, Aromatisse, Reuniclus, and Pachirisu. Smeargle has a variety of other support options, such as Helping Hand to power up its partner's attacks, Feint and Shadow Force to negate Protect, Magic Coat to reflect status moves (most notably Taunt), Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers, and Snarl to weaken special attackers like Aegislash, but Smeargle usually has better things to do, making these options inferior.

As for alternate sets, Smeargle could use a Choice Scarf set to take advantage of a super-speedy Dark Void, but this is usually counterproductive due to Smeargle sacrificing all of its supportive potential and losing the element of mindgames. Mental Herb is an option if you're particularly afraid of Taunt, but Smeargle is far too frail to forgo Focus Sash. Finally, you could run a FEARgle set, which is a level 1 Smeargle with Trick Room, Dark Void, Endeavor, and either Dragon Rage or Extreme Speed, to weaken non-Ghost-types beyond repair, but it requires huge amounts of support and is ruined by an untimely Dark Void miss, as well as dying if something wakes up quickly and being walled by Ghost-types.

Checks and Counters
########

**Taunt**: Taunt is Smeargle's greatest enemy. It completely neuters Smeargle, forcing it to struggle or switch out. Therefore, users of the move like Aerodactyl and Gyarados counter Smeargle well.

**Priority**: Priority attacks stop Smeargle in its tracks, as they can take it down with ease after its Focus Sash has been broken; this makes Scizor, Talonflame, and Conkeldurr good stops to Smeargle. In addition, Fake Out is especially potent as it breaks Smeargle's Focus Sash and forces Smeargle to flinch. Therefore, Mega Kangaskhan and Mienshao counter Smeargle.

**Moderately Powerful Attacks**: Pretty much any moderately powerful attack can bring Smeargle down to its Focus Sash. Therefore, every viable attacking move in the metagame aside from those that deal static damage checks Smeargle.

**Sleep Immunities**: Insomnia and Sweet Veil prevent the effects of Dark Void or remove its effects completely when its user is active, respectively. Therefore, Pokemon such as Slurpuff, Gourgeist, and Banette are checks to Smeargle. Additionally, Lum Berry and Chesto Berry allow their holders to wake up immediately and retaliate with an attacking move.

 **Safeguard**: Safeguard protects its entire team from the effects of Dark Void, making common users such as Klefki and Meowstic good stops to Smeargle.

 **Substitute**: Substitute blocks Dark Void, meaning that Substitute Aegislash is a good stop to Smeargle, although it requires a fair amount of prediction due to its low Speed.

**Sand Stream and Snow Warning**: Sand Stream and Snow Warning activate damaging weather, breaking Smeargle's Focus Sash and allowing it to be OHKOed. Therefore, Tyranitar, Abomasnow, and their respective Mega Evolutions stop Smeargle in its tracks.

**Multi-Hit Attacks**: Any attack that hits more than once defeats Smeargle. Therefore, Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Heracross, and Icicle Spear Mamoswine counter Smeargle effectively.

**Sleep Talk**: Sleep Talk allows its user to attack through Dark Void. However, it is incredibly rare because its only notable user is Talonflame.
