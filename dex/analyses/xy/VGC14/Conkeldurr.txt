Overview
########

The transition to Generation VI was not too kind to Conkeldurr. With the addition of Fairy-types, Conkeldurr now has another obstacle that it has to overcome. If that wasn't enough, Conkeldurr is not allowed to have the elemental punches due to this season's ruleset. And if all Conkeldurr hadn't been cowering in fear already, they now are with the introduction of Talonflame. Despite all of this, Conkeldurr did gain a nice item in Assault Vest, helping to remedy Conkeldurr's mediocre Special Defense. Conkeldurr does still have many strong points that make it a fearsome sweeper. Base 140 Attack is nothing to overlook and when paired with 105 / 95 / 65 bulk, priority in Mach Punch, two great abilities suiting Conkeldurr's movepool, and reliable recovery in Drain Punch, Conkeldurr will get the job done. When all is taken into account, Conkeldurr is an offensive powerhouse in VGC.

Standard
########
name: Standard
move 1: Mach Punch
move 2: Drain Punch
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Detect / Wide Guard
ability: Guts
item: Leftovers / Persim Berry
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

This set is almost identical from last season, except Rock Slide is used for coverage instead of Ice Punch. With Rock Slide, Conkeldurr can now take out Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, if it can tank a hit from them. Mach Punch is used as a strong priority STAB move. Drain Punch is another strong STAB move that allows Conkeldurr to heal itself. Detect can be used to stall a turn out, a standard move in VGC. If you do not wish to go for Detect, you can also opt for Wide Guard in order to block the ever-so-common spread moves.

Set Details
========

Conkeldurr has two options for the item slot this season. A Persim Berry will deal with any Swagger users that might be running amok, while Leftovers is a solid item for recovery each turn. The chosen ability is Guts because Will-O-Wisp now has a higher accuracy and is more commonly seen. Because of this, opponents will think twice before using it on Conkeldurr. This EV spread is used to maximize damage output while increasing overall bulk. Therefore, full investment in Attack and HP is chosen, with the last 4 points going into Special Defense. Lastly, Adamant is the nature of choice as it increases Attack.

Usage Tips
========

Conkeldurr is relatively straightforward in how it is to be played. First, make sure counters such as Talonflame are out of the way. After that, Conkeldurr should be free to go in thanks to its bulk and ability to regain health with Drain Punch. With Mach Punch, Conkeldurr is able to clean up or even completely take out Pokemon before they get the chance to attack. The only thing to really be wary of is Conkeldurr being double targeted.

Team Options
========

This standard set has a few team options that stand out. Scizor is a fantastic teammate for Conkeldurr because when two immensely strong priority moves are put together, the rate at which damage is coming out will be high. Another good teammate for Conkeldurr is Bisharp, as Conkeldurr doesn't have a way to deal with Intimidate. In addition to that, Bisharp has a nice STAB priority move in Sucker Punch. Lastly, Conkeldurr benefits from Rage Powder support given by Amoonguss. One Rage Powder can give Conkeldurr the chance to take out Talonflame.

Trick Room Attacker
########
name: Trick Room Attacker
move 1: Mach Punch
move 2: Hammer Arm / Drain Punch
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Poison Jab / Detect
ability: Iron Fist
item: Life Orb / Assault Vest
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Brave

Moves
========

This set is based around Conkeldurr having extremely low Speed. Mach Punch is still needed as STAB priority. Drain Punch is still an option but Hammer Arm fits better in a Trick Room set because it has a higher Base Power, is still boosted by Iron Fist, and lowers Speed even more. Drain Punch is still a good choice because it is a reliable form of recovery. Rock Slide is used for coverage against Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y and other Flying-types. The last slot has two viable options. Poison Jab can help take care of Fairy-types while Detect is still a good move to stall turns out, which is useful when Trick Room needs to be set up.

Set Details
========

There are two great item choices for this set. Life Orb increases damage output while Assault Vest can add survivability on the special side. Iron Fist is the chosen ability in order to boost Mach Punch as well as Drain Punch. However, this does make burns more of a worry. The EVs give Conkeldurr maximized Attack as well as added bulk. A Brave nature boosts Attack while lowering Speed, which is ideal for a Trick Room. 0 IVs in Speed will lower Speed even more.

Usage Tips
========

Conkeldurr is a great revenge killer thanks to Mach Punch, so take advantage of that. Because its low Speed makes it move first, Conkeldurr becomes a fearsome sweeper, so make sure that when Trick Room is up, Conkeldurr will keep on attacking. The turn you set up Trick Room, make sure Conkeldurr uses Detect, granted you choose to run it. Make sure that Conkeldurr's counters are out of the way before bringing it in.

Team Options
========

Due to the fact that Trick Room is a huge part of this set, Conkeldurr's list of team options increases. Slowking is great as it can take care of Talonflame and set up Trick Room. Escavalier is another good Trick Room sweeper. Bisharp can keep Psychic-types at bay and has a STAB priority move. Amoonguss brings Rage Powder support and also benefits from the effects of Trick Room. Lastly, Aromatisse is a tanky Fairy-type that brings Trick Room and can support with Heal Pulse.

Other Options
########

A Coba Berry can be used to allow Conkeldurr to survive a Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird at full health, but due to double targeting, this is not a popular choice. Brick Break can be used as it gains the STAB boost and breaks Reflect and Light Screen, but generally isn't used due to having a lower Base Power than other choices. Earthquake can be used as a spread move to take care of Pokemon like Aegislash, but due to Conkeldurr's high Attack, its teammate would take high damage. A Black Belt can be used to boost Fighting-type moves without losing health. Payback can be used as Conkeldurr is likely to move last, but it isn't worth the moveslot.

Checks & Counters
########

**Talonflame**: Talonflame OHKOes Conkeldurr with Brave Bird unless the held item is a Coba Berry, which is unlikely.

**Intimidate**: Like most physical attackers, the drop in Attack that Intimidate carries can be the difference between an OHKO or 2HKO.

**Gardevoir**: Gardevoir does not fear anything that Conkeldurr can throw at it, bar the occasional Posion Jab, and can OHKO back with either a Fairy-type or Psychic-type STAB attack.

**Aegislash**: The only real worry is that Conkeldurr has Payback, but this can be easily avoided with King's Shield. Although this is less likely, Aegislash might have to be wary of Earthquake.
