Overview
########

In Shield forme, Aegislash has outstanding 60 / 150 / 150 defensive stats, allowing it to take many hits and proceed to retaliate powerfully in Blade forme. On top of its natural bulk, Aegislash has a great Steel / Ghost defensive typing, and although Steel-types no longer resist Dark- and Ghost-type moves, Aegislash resists nine types and is immune to three. Thanks to its Ghost typing, it doesn't have to worry about Fake Out, thus easing prediction on your behalf. King's Shield, Aegislash's signature move, acts like Protect by blocking attacking moves, but lets through status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Taunt. King's Shield also halves an attacker's Attack stat when Aegislash is hit by a contact move. Aegislash has a STAB priority move in Shadow Sneak, which is beneficial in a metagame focused on Speed. Because it is so bulky, Aegislash is an ideal user of Weakness Policy, which allows it to double both its attacking stats when hit by a super effective move.

Outside of switching out, King's Shield is the only way that Aegislash can change back to its bulkier Shield forme. However, the move is quite predictable and can set your other Pokemon up to be double-targeted. Furthermore, it lets status moves through, making Aegislash vulnerable to Will-O-Wisp and Taunt. The former weakens Aegislash's physical attacks and saps its HP, while the latter completely shuts it down, forcing it to switch or be KOed. Aegislash's viable movepool is small and this makes it quite predictable. A bad prediction can leave Aegislash in its frailer Blade forme, setting it up to be KOed by super effective moves, such as Fire- and Ground-type moves. Due to Aegislash's highly temperamental ability, it faces stiff competition for the role of the offensive Steel-type from Ferrothorn, Mawile, and Scizor.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: King's Shield
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Flash Cannon
move 4: Substitute
item: Leftovers / Weakness Policy
evs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD
nature: Quiet
ivs: 0 Spe

Moves
========

This is Aegislash's most common set, and for good reason, as it isn't completely dependent on using King's Shield every other turn. When behind a Substitute, Aegislash can attack on multiple turns in succession, and by correctly using King's Shield, it can maintain Substitute due to its great natural bulk. The attacking moves on this set are Aegislash's two main special STAB options. Running a fully special set might be advisable due to the omnipresence of Will-O-Wisp and Intimidate to check many of this generation's biggest threats, thereby limiting their impact on Aegislash.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment in HP allows Aegislash in Shield forme to take just about any move other than a STAB super effective hit, while the Special Attack EVs grant it more power. A Quiet nature boosts the strength of Aegislash's special moves and lowers its Speed, allowing it to attack after the opponent and tank hits in Shield forme. Leftovers improves Aegislash's longevity and can potentially allow it to get more than four Substitutes or stop it being 2HKOed. However, Aegislash can also run Weakness Policy to pick up extra KOs at +2.

Usage Tips
========

This set plays best towards the end of the match, as once Aegislash's checks and counters are removed, it can win matches by itself thanks to its great natural bulk. An ideal point to set up a Substitute is when facing Pokemon whose only means to hit Aegislash is with Sucker Punch, as this means it can get up a free Substitute unhindered. When Aegislash is behind a Substitute, King's Shield should still be used to weaken physical attackers and maintain the Substitute when appropriate, though it cannot be used twice in a row.

Team Options
========

Aegislash's main weaknesses to Fire- and Ground-type attacks are well covered by Garchomp and Rotom-W. Garchomp is better at clearing the field for Aegislash to come in later, as using Earthquake is counterproductive due to Aegislash's Steel typing. However, Rock Slide is very useful when it comes to removing Charizard from the field. Rotom-W supports Aegislash by weakening physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp and taking on many of its checks and counters with Hydro Pump and Thunderbolt. Dual screens support makes this set very hard to take down, as few attacks can break Aegislash's Substitute when it is in Shield forme. Dual screens also help to turn attacks from OHKOs and 2HKOs into 2HKOs or 3HKOs, respectively. Mega Kangaskhan has good offensive synergy with Aegislash, and can use Fake Out to help it set up a Substitute with greater ease.

Mixed Attacker
########
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: King's Shield
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Flash Cannon
move 4: Shadow Sneak / Sacred Sword
item: Weakness Policy
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpA
nature: Quiet
ivs: 0 Spe

Moves
========

King's Shield is a must on all sets to allow Aegislash to capitalize on both its offensive and defensive stats. The move also allows Aegislash to halve an opponent's Attack when it is hit by a contact move. Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon are this set's main attacking moves. Shadow Sneak allows Aegislash to finish off faster weakened opponents, though the move is risky as it changes Aegislash into Blade forme at the start of the turn. Aegislash can run Sacred Sword instead, allowing it to attain perfect coverage in tandem with its Ghost-type moves.

Set Details
========

A Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs ensure that Aegislash will usually move last, allowing it to tank an attack in Shield forme. Maximum investment in HP and Special Attack allows Aegislash to take many of the common super effective hits in the format and hit back hard with a boosted move. For example, Aegislash can survive a Sucker Punch from both Mega Mawile and Mega Kangaskhan as well as a Crunch or Dark Pulse from Tyranitar. After Weakness Policy is activated, Aegislash can utilize a +2 Flash Cannon or Shadow Ball to take down many of the most common Pokemon in the format and finish off weakened threats with Shadow Sneak. On the other hand, Lum Berry can be run to shield Aegislash from a status move, giving it slightly more room for error with King's Shield.

Usage Tips
========

Aegislash is effective in all stages of the game due to its huge bulk and high offensive stats. This being said, Aegislash should not be brought in prematurely, as although it is bulky, it cannot shrug off multiple super effective or boosted hits. Once certain threats have been taken care of, Aegislash can run rampant through the opposing team. As a result, you will often find that Aegislash is most useful late in the game. However, if you think that the opposing team cannot deal with Aegislash, it can function as a devastating lead, severely denting opposing Pokemon and allowing the rest of your team to clean up later.

Team Options
========

Aegislash needs Fire- and Ground-types to be taken down before it can function successfully. Because of this, Rotom-W, Tyranitar, and Garchomp are very good partners, as they all have good bulk and can take down the Pokemon that threaten it. Fighting-types such as Scrafty, Mienshao, and Conkeldurr are also good partners that can take on Dark-types.

Other Options
########

An alternative STAB option for Aegislash is Gyro Ball, which can be very strong against faster opponents. However, it is generally worse than Iron Head and Flash Cannon due to its inconsistent damage output. Rock Slide can be used, but it comes at the cost of coverage or priority, and tempts you to act recklessly against Fire-types, which hinders Aegislash's survivability. Aegislash gets Wide Guard and Destiny Bond, both of which are interesting support options. Wide Guard was buffed greatly this generation, as it no longer fails when used in succession. Wide Guard blocks Heat Wave and Earthquake, two of the most threatening moves to Aegislash, whereas Destiny Bond can be used to take down an opposing Pokemon. However, this may be difficult given Aegislash's low Speed stat. Head Smash is a powerful single-target move that provides additional coverage, but induces heavy recoil and suffers from the same problems as Rock Slide does. Hidden Power Ice can be used as well, but the move is very situational and is most likely a waste of a moveslot due to its low Base Power. Minimum Speed isn't a requirement, and with some investment, Aegislash can outspeed Mawile and Azumarill. However, Speed investment can be risky as it means that Aegislash might need to tank an attack in Blade forme.

Checks and Counters
########

**Strong Super Effective Moves**: Super effective hits from Fire-, Ground-, and Dark-type Pokemon will either 2HKO or OHKO Aegislash in Shield forme, and definitely OHKO it in Blade forme. Mega Charizard Y can OHKO Aegislash with a sun-boosted Overheat, and with some bulk investment, doesn't take too much damage from Shadow Ball.

**Taunt**: Taunt renders King's Shield unusable, forcing Aegislash to switch out or tank attacks in Blade forme.

**Assault Vest**: Equipped with an Assault Vest, Pokemon such as Ludicolo and Clawitzer can comfortably take Aegislash's special moves. Clawitzer can 2HKO Aegislash with a Mega Launcher-boosted Dark Pulse.
