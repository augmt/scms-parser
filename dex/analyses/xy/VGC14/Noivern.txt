Overview
########

Noivern is a very interesting and useful newcomer to VGC 2014. It is the fastest unboosted Dragon-type in the format, which makes it an excellent check to non-Choice Scarf Salamence, Hydreigon, and, most importantly, Garchomp. Unlike other Dragon-type Pokemon, Noivern's movepool gives it the ability to use a full support set successfully. Its ability, Frisk, is a very helpful ability to have in VGC so you don't get surprised by niche held items. Noivern's ability to support a VGC team and check other Dragon-types well is where it carves its niche, despite its sub-standard Special Attack when compared to other Dragon-types of the format. Noivern's bulk is also sub-standard, so it will usually have to rely on Focus Sash or heavy bulk investment in order to function properly. On top of this, Noivern also faces competition from Aerodactyl as a speedy support Pokemon and Salamence as a Dragon-type check. Despite this, Noivern does have a very distinct place in the VGC format. Its ability to check dangerous Dragon-types and provide speedy support is something no other Pokemon in the format can do.

Moves
========

Tailwind is one of the best speed control moves in the game. It gives Noivern the niche of a supportive Pokemon and should be used no matter what. Draco Meteor allows Noivern to check Dragon-types, some of the biggest threats in VGC 2014. Despite Noivern's mediocre Special Attack, Draco Meteor is still a 130 Base Power move boosted by STAB and can be used to dent any Pokemon that lacks resistance or immunity to it. Super Fang is an excellent option to run alongside Draco Meteor, as its ability to halve an opponent's HP puts a lot of Pokemon into Draco Meteor KO range and it isn't affected by Draco Meteor's Special Attack-lowering side effect. It can also be used to set up KOs for Noivern's partner. Protect is almost a given on any VGC Pokemon that isn't carrying a Choice item, as it allows Noivern to block Fake Out so its Focus Sash isn't broken before it can even move. Taunt is used to shut down Trick Room setters other than Aromatisse, and can also be used to cripple Smeargle and other pure support Pokemon.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment gives Noivern the ability to outrun everything up to and including Greninja while still having Draco Meteor do as much damage as possible. Focus Sash helps Noivern set up Tailwind, despite its subpar bulk, and allows it to check Choice Scarf Dragon-types as long as Noivern hasn't taken prior damage. A bulkier spread of 156 HP / 252 SpA / 96 Spe with a Timid nature still allows Noivern to outpace Garchomp and forgo a Focus Sash if the item is needed elsewhere, but the main spread is otherwise better.

Usage Tips
========

Always Protect against Fake Out users the first turn they are on the field. This guarantees that Noivern's Focus Sash will not be broken just for Noivern to flinch or fall to a double target. If you suspect your opponent has a Choice Scarf Salamence or Hydreigon, keeping Noivern's Focus Sash intact gives you another check to them. Set up Tailwind only when needed, as the move only lasts four turns in total, and two turns if your opponent has dual Protect users. Tailwind also allows Noivern to check the Scarf Dragon-types listed above even if its Focus Sash has been broken. Use Super Fang to bring Pokemon into the KO range of Noivern's partner or Noivern's own Draco Meteor. Using Taunt on Trick Room users is always a good idea. If you suspect a Fake Out and Trick Room lead from your opponent, Noivern should not be one of the four Pokemon you choose to bring.

Team Options
========

Pokemon with very strong offensive presences are some of the best partners Noivern can have. Strong attackers that can flatten key Pokemon in a single turn, such as Mega Mawile and Choice Specs Gardevoir, discourage and punish the opponent for double targeting Noivern in order to KO it through its Focus Sash. These Pokemon also benefit greatly from Noivern's Tailwind. Mega Kangaskhan deserves its own mention, as it has a ridiculous offensive presence from the moment it is sent out and can punish a double target on Noivern even greater than most with Parental Bond Power-Up Punch. Mega Kangaskhan also appreciates Noivern's ability to KO Garchomp and Tailwind doubling its Speed. Rotom-H loves having Dragon-types removed, especially Garchomp.

Other Options
########

Dragon Pulse is a 100% accurate alternative to Draco Meteor that doesn't have any negative after effects. However, it is pathetically weak when compared to Draco Meteor, and with Noivern's mediocre Special Attack and access to Super Fang, Draco Meteor is better. Flamethrower can be used to fry Ferrothorn and Scizor and do good damage to Bisharp and Mega Mawile, and it can be used to wear down Aegislash behind its Substitute when used alongside Infiltrator. Hurricane is a strong STAB option that most notably takes care of Amoonguss. It works best when used on a Rain Dance team due to Hurricane's bad 70% accuracy outside of rain and crippling 50% accuracy in sun. Roost gives Noivern a recovery option and gives it the excellent pure Dragon typing for a turn. Only use it on the bulky EV spread because otherwise it isn't worth the moveslot. Telepathy is almost entirely inferior to Frisk or Infiltrator, but can be used on Discharge teams if need be.

Checks & Counters
########

**Tyranitar**: Tyranitar limits Noivern to only one move by having Rock Slide or Ice Beam bring Noivern down to its Focus Sash and then having sandstorm finish it off. The best thing Noivern can do is use Super Fang on Tyranitar.

**Mamoswine**: Mamoswine limits Noivern to one turn with its priority Ice Shard or Icicle Spear. It will get severely crippled by Draco Meteor should Noivern attack it, though.

**Talonflame**: Talonflame limits Noivern to one move by 2HKOing it with priority Brave Bird. It does not like taking a Draco Meteor, though.

**Aerodactyl**: Aerodactyl outspeeds Noivern and threatens to 2HKO with Rock Slide as well as potentially flinching Noivern and its partner. Noivern can set up Tailwind if Aerodactyl isn't carrying Taunt to make use of two turns as a result, if it doesn't flinch. If Aerodactyl carries Taunt, then it can stop Noivern from using Tailwind altogether.

**Paralysis**: Having Noivern's partner paralyzed is a major problem, as it makes Noivern's Tailwind useless. Prankster Thunder Wave users are particularly annoying, especially Klefki, which is immune to Draco Meteor.
