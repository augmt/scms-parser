Overview
########

Thanks to Aegislash and Tyranitar's prominence, Reuniclus's life in VGC14 is definitely not easy. Reuniclus can be compared to Aromatisse; they have similar bulk, and both are Trick Room setters. However, Aromatisse was blessed with two gifts in the form of its Fairy typing, an incredible defensive typing in this metagame, and Aroma Veil, which protects its allies from being Taunted or Encored. However, Reuniclus has its advantages over Aromatisse: namely, its greater raw power and Magic Guard. With Magic Guard, Reuniclus can use Life Orb without losing HP, as it becomes immune to any form of residual damage. Reuniclus has a ton of utility options as well, such as Helping Hand, Thunder Wave, Reflect, Light Screen, and some useful coverage moves such as Energy Ball and Shadow Ball. However, while Reuniclus's power is nothing to laugh at, it can sometimes miss out on some important OHKOs and 2HKOs, and it has a disappointing typing, both offensively and defensively. Reuniclus also lacks spread and priority moves. While it does have decent bulk, it can't take most STAB or super effective moves very well. Finally, it can be Taunted or Encored, unlike Aromatisse, and its poor Speed stat has no real use outside of Trick Room.

Offensive Trick Room
########
name: Offensive Trick Room
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Psychic / Psyshock
move 3: Shadow Ball / Hidden Power Fire / Energy Ball
move 4: Protect
item: Life Orb
ability: Magic Guard / Overcoat
evs: 172 HP / 28 Def / 252 SpA / 56 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Quiet

Moves
==========

Trick Room allows Reuniclus to outspeed most threats while active. It can also benefit a slow ally. Psychic is the main STAB move because it has higher power than Psyshock and hits both Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur hard. Psyshock, however, hits special walls such as Goodra and Florges harder, while dealing more damage to Amoonguss than Psychic. Shadow Ball offers good neutral coverage and hits Aegislash and Gardevoir. Hidden Power Fire hits Ferrothorn and Bisharp most notably, which resist Reuniclus's other attacks. Energy Ball hits Rotom-W, Azumarill, and Tyranitar, though Reuniclus is usually going to lose to the latter. Protect fills in the last moveslot because it's simply a great asset in VGC, as it helps scout the opponent as well as protect Reuniclus from any attack.

Set Details
==========

The given EV spread gives more balance to Reuniclus's overall bulk than 252 HP EVs could. The remaining EVs are used to maximize Reuniclus's power. Life Orb increases its damage output even further, while Magic Guard negates Life Orb recoil and any other residual damage, such as that inflicted by sandstorm, whereas Overcoat still avoids sandstorm damage while making Amoonguss's Spore and Venusaur's Sleep Powder useless. The given nature and IVs guarantee that Reuniclus is as slow as possible.

Usage Tips
==========

As Trick Room is the most important aspect of this set, use it as soon as Reuniclus gets into battle. This Reuniclus is designed to wallbreak; it's not a sweeper, so don't let it take unnecessary hits and get KOed. This set requires team support to work well, as many common threats in VGC14 easily deal with Reuniclus. You can also send Reuniclus into battle after all Taunt users have been KOed or put under too much pressure to use it. Also, when needed, use Protect on the first turn so Reuniclus won't be hit by Fake Out. Switch Reuniclus in against moves such as Leech Seed, as switching Reuniclus in is simply too difficult otherwise.

Team Options
========

The first thing you should think of when considering a teammate for Reuniclus is a slow Pokemon, such as Amoonguss, Azumarill, or Mega Mawile. Fighting-types such as Scrafty are great teammates because they threaten the Dark-types that threaten Reuniclus. Scrafty also has Intimidate and Quick Guard, so it can lessen the damage output of Fake Out, or totally stop it, and Scrafty itself has Fake Out as well, stopping any potential Taunt user from hindering Reuniclus. Azumarill and Mega Mawile can also beat Dark-types. Another Trick Room setter is a good idea for a partner; Aromatisse is a good option, as its Aroma Veil prevents Reuniclus from being Taunted.

Bulky Trick Room
########
name: Bulky Trick Room
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Psychic / Psyshock
move 3: Helping Hand
move 4: Shadow Ball / Reflect / Light Screen
item: Sitrus Berry / Mental Herb
ability: Overcoat / Magic Guard
evs: 252 HP / 140 Def / 70 SpA / 48 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Relaxed

Moves
==========

Trick Room allows Reuniclus and other slow teammates to move first in most situations. Psychic is preferred for its higher power, while Psyshock can be used to hit special walls much harder. Helping Hand is a support move that increases the power of an ally's move by 50%. The last moveslot can be used for more coverage in the form of Shadow Ball or for one of the screen moves, which help Reuniclus and allies take hits better. The choice of screen depends on your team's needs.

Set Details
==========

The given EV spread balances Reuniclus's defenses so it can survive common attacks such as Tyranitar's Crunch and Aegislash's Shadow Ball and proceed to set up Trick Room. Sitrus Berry is the common choice for a recovery item in a fast-paced metagame such as VGC. Mental Herb can be used to stop moves such as Taunt and Encore and guarantee that Trick Room will be set up. Magic Guard keeps Reuniclus safe from any residual damage while Overcoat keeps it safe from Amoonguss's Spore and Venusaur's Sleep Powder.

Usage Tips
==========

Remember that Helping Hand has increased priority; it doesn't need Trick Room to go up first. Also, if Reuniclus is running Reflect or Light Screen, set up Trick Room before either of those; in most circumstances, Reuniclus's partner probably will benefit more from Trick Room than they would from a screen whose duration is not boosted by Light Clay.

Team Options
==========

Any slow Pokemon can benefit from Reuniclus's Trick Room. Frailer Pokemon could be used as teammates, as a screen helps mitigate their frailty. A teammate that can take care of Dark-types, such as Scrafty or Azumarill, is a necessity. Aromatisse is a good teammate, as its ability protects Reuniclus from Taunt and it takes advantage of Trick Room's effects.

Other Options
########

Reuniclus's movepool hasn't really got many other options. Snatch can be used to steal the effect of an opposing Pokemon's move. Focus Blast is a powerful option for the Life Orb set, but Reuniclus definitely doesn't like its low accuracy, as VGC is just too fast-paced to afford a miss. Additionally, the only notable target that is hit by Focus Blast is Tyranitar; almost everything else could be hit by Shadow Ball, Energy Ball, or Hidden Power Fire. Recover is an option, but in this fast-paced metagame Reuniclus will rarely be able to use it. Trick + Flame Orb is an interesting option that cripples a physical attacker and protects Reuniclus from status. Finally, Thunder is an option when Reuniclus is paired up with Politoed.

Checks and Counters
########

**Taunt and Encore**: Most Taunt and Encore users are faster than Reuniclus, so they can easily prevent it from setting up Trick Room.

**Steel-types**: Aegislash is a notable Steel-type to really watch out for. If Reuniclus uses Shadow Ball on it, it may activate its Weakness Policy, which boosts Aegislash's offensive stats to insane levels. Aegislash can also make the most of Trick Room because it's quite slow. Other Steel-types that threaten Reuniclus include Bisharp and Scizor.

**Dark-types**: Tyranitar and Hydreigon are immune to Reuniclus's STAB attacks and have powerful super effective moves to KO it with.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types, such as Aegislash and Gengar, have very powerful super effective moves to use against Reuniclus, but most of them, bar Aegislash, are frail and can't tank a Shadow Ball.

**Priority**: Priority attacks such as Fake Out and Sucker Punch negate Trick Room, leaving it without effect.
