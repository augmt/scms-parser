Overview
########

Greninja has an incredible base 122 Speed, which makes it capable of outspeeding nearly every viable Pokemon in the VGC metagame. Protean is one of the best abilities in the game as well, giving Greninja STAB on all of its attacks. On top of that, Greninja has a diverse movepool which allows it to hit most threats for super effective damage. However, Greninja is very frail, which means many things can OHKO it; it also loses easily to priority. While Greninja is definitely a fun Pokemon to use, it should fill an important role if it is used.

Standard
########
name: Standard
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Rock Slide / Dark Pulse
move 4: Protect
ability: Protean
item: Life Orb / Focus Sash
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Hydro Pump is necessary over Scald because Greninja needs Hydro Pump's power to guarantee OHKOs on Gengar, Lucario, and 252 HP / 116 SpD Rotom-H. Hydro Pump also nets several additional KOs when paired with Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out including Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y with a very small chance to KO uninvested Mega Kangaskhan. Ice Beam hits Venusaur and Amoonguss super effectively, and it is Greninja's strongest option on this set for Ferrothorn. Rock Slide OHKOs both Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, while Dark Pulse hits Aegislash and Reuniclus extremely hard. Protect is necessary so Greninja's partner can KO a threat without Greninja being harmed. It is not worth replacing Protect with an additional coverage move because Greninja would become too exposed.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Greninja's damage output and Speed. A Timid nature allows Greninja to outspeed almost every viable VGC Pokemon without a Choice Scarf. Life Orb is nice for power, but Focus Sash is usable for longevity. However, Focus Sash is almost always outclassed by Life Orb because of Tyranitar's popularity and its ability, Sand Stream.

Usage Tips
========

One needs to make sure that Greninja is not targeted by enemy attacks that will likely KO it. Greninja has great utility as a lead because it can scout for Choice Scarf users, though it generally needs to Protect turn one to protect itself against Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out. In addition, Protecting helps to find specific Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Salamence, which will help the Greninja player throughout the duration of the game. Greninja can also be used regularly if opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon have been eliminated.

Team Options
========

Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Mawile, or Choice Band Talonflame are all great partners, as they can protect Greninja from getting KOed by slower Pokemon, as well as provide offensive pressure. Mega Kangaskhan is an especially good partner because it can Fake Out opposing Choice Scarf users that would otherwise outspeed Greninja. Greninja can also be used in hail teams by replacing Ice Beam with Blizzard, which has more power and perfect accuracy in hail, and Greninja can KO Pokemon that resist Blizzard, such as Aegislash, with Dark Pulse.

Other Options
########

Mat Block only works the first turn Greninja is on the field, and it protects one's team from all non-status moves that turn. However, unlike Protect, it does not have priority. Taunt is an option to stop moves such as Spore, Will-O-Wisp, and Trick Room, which can really help out Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan. Hidden Power Fire hits Ferrothorn, Hidden Power Grass hits Azumarill and Rotom-W, and Extrasensory hits Conkeldurr. Choice Specs is an option to hit very hard, but Greninja then cannot take as much advantage of its fantastic ability, Protean.

Checks & Counters
########

**Rotom-W**: Rotom-W takes neutral damage from all of Greninja's standard moves in VGC. It can then retaliate with a STAB Thunderbolt, or burn any of Greninja's teammates that switch in.

**Talonflame**: Choice Band Talonflame always OHKOs Greninja with Brave Bird. However, Focus Sash Greninja easily KOes Talonflame in return with Hydro Pump.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr, Scrafty, and even Lucario check Greninja well. They can usually take a hit and retaliate back with a KO or threaten it with priority.

**Mega Mawile**: Mega Mawile hard counters Greninja because of its typing and bulk. Its Play Rough OHKOes Greninja, and Sucker Punch easily KOes Greninja after any bit of chip damage.

**Rage Powder and Follow Me Users**: Greninja cannot do anything against Pokemon that use Rage Powder and Follow Me. They can generally sponge a hit, leaving Greninja exposed to powerful attacks.
