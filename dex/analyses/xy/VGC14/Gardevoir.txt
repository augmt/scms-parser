Overview
########

Gardevoir has carved a solid niche in the metagame as a specially attacking Fairy-type due to the relative lack of ones that are legal. This makes it a great Dragon-type check, most notably being able to beat the common 'double dragon' core of Garchomp and Salamence. Add on to this its overdose of supportive options and access to two great abilities in Trace and Telepathy, along with just enough special bulk to switch into special hits once or twice, and you have a one of the best Pokemon in the format. However, its lackluster physical bulk means that it struggles to take moderately powerful physical hits while also being unable to handle any common priority move outside of Mach Punch, and it is weak to one of the more common of said moves in the format, Bullet Punch, meaning that it really struggles versus Scizor and Mega Lucario. In addition to its nonexistent physical bulk, Gardevoir's stats are overall middling, with a high Special Attack, moderately high Special Defense, and rather low numbers in the rest of its stats, most notably its underwhelming base 80 Speed for an offensive Pokemon.

Choice Attacker
########
name: Choice Attacker
move 1: Moonblast
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Dazzling Gleam
move 4: Thunderbolt / Shadow Ball
ability: Trace / Telepathy
item: Choice Scarf / Choice Specs
evs: 116 HP / 52 Def / 144 SpA / 4 SpD / 192 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Moonblast is the main STAB move that Gardevoir will be spamming, with a high Base Power, great typing, and a nasty 30% chance to lower its target's Special Attack stat. Gardevoir doesn't usually use its other attacks because Moonblast is so good, but it has a few other moves it can run to increase its overall utility and coverage. Psychic fixes its coverage versus Fire- and Poison-types, hitting the former neutrally and the latter super effectively. This is used over Psyshock due to a combination of Gardevoir needing all the power it can get and the relatively physically defensive nature of the metagame. Dazzling Gleam is nice to take out weakened opponents, as it gets chip damage on the partner of the Pokemon that is being KOed, and it is always nice to have when there are two weakened Pokemon on the field that are in range of being KOed. Additionally, Dazzling Gleam is great for breaking the Focus Sashes of Pokemon like Smeargle, and it OHKOes double dragons 100% of the time after a little prior damage when Gardevoir holds a Choice Scarf, while guaranteeing it without any prior damage with the boost from Choice Specs with the given EV spread. The last moveslot is entirely team-reliant: Thunderbolt hits Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y harder than Gardevoir's other options, although you must be cautious of the former's Brave Bird, while Shadow Ball allows Gardevoir to get around Aegislash and opposing Gardevoir effectively, although an Iron Head or Flash Cannon from the former is going to hurt a lot.

Set Details
========

There are lots of possible EV spreads that Gardevoir can run, and the ones listed here are only a small number of the viable ones. The EVs that are on the main set allow Gardevoir to survive a Bullet Punch from Mega Lucario when at full health while outpacing all Mega Tyranitar variants either before or after a boost, depending on its item. If Gardevoir is holding a Choice Scarf, a spread of 140 Def / 140 SpA / 228 Spe can be used to outpace Noivern while always OHKOing Garchomp with Moonblast; a more powerful version of this spread (28 Def / 252 SpA / 228 Spe) can be used if you feel that bulk is not an issue, although Talonflame's Brave Bird will score a guaranteed OHKO. Gardevoir can run 84 Def / 252 SpA / 172 Spe with a Timid nature to outpace Adamant Gyarados before or after a Dragon Dance, depending on its item, although Talonflame will once again guarantee an OHKO with Brave Bird while Garchomp has a 12% chance to survive Moonblast from full health. When running Choice Scarf, a spread of 12 HP / 92 Def / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 148 Spe allows Gardevoir to outpace max Speed base 110s while having a 50% chance of surviving Adamant Life Orb Talonflame's Brave Bird from full health. As for Gardevoir's ability, Telepathy should be used if you are going to be using Gardevoir in a core with a user of Earthquake, Surf, or Discharge, but Trace should always be used otherwise due to its nifty, albeit situational, utility in giving Gardevoir the chance to copy powerful abilities like Parental Bond or the rare Competitive.

Usage Tips
========

If possible, avoid switching Gardevoir in on anything aside from resisted attacks and weak or middling neutral special attacks. Use Gardevoir to threaten and KO Dragon- and Dark-types; mostly spam Moonblast unless the situation demands otherwise or it will give you an advantage in the long term to do something else.

Team Options
========

Pokemon with Intimidate are great, as they allow Gardevoir to take physical hits better, making Salamence and Scrafty good partners. Anything that is capable of beating Steel- or Fire-types such the aforementioned duo and Krookodile makes Gardevoir's life a little easier. Powerful attackers like Mega Charizard Y help Gardevoir break down bulky opponents more effectively due to its generally middling power. Ghost-, Fighting-, and Dark-types such as Aegislash, Scrafty, Lucario, and Tyranitar have good natural synergy with Gardevoir, as they break down the things that Gardevoir can't, while it beats the Pokemon that they struggle to beat with its STAB attacks. Mawile is a great teammate, as it allows you to bring in a Fairy-type when the matchup is out of Gardevoir's favor. Finally, if Gardevoir has Telepathy, users of attacks like Earthquake, such as Garchomp, are good partners to take advantage of it.

Bulky Support
########
name: Bulky Support
move 1: Dazzling Gleam / Moonblast
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Will-O-Wisp / Protect
move 4: Trick Room / Taunt / Protect
ability: Trace / Telepathy
item: Sitrus Berry / Safety Goggles
evs: 252 HP / 124 Def / 108 SpA / 20 SpD / 4 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks have great neutral coverage together due to Psychic hitting the Poison- and Fire-types that resist Fairy while your choice of Fairy-type move hits Dark-types, which are immune to Psychic, super effectively. Dazzling Gleam is recommended as Gardevoir's Fairy-type STAB move as it hits Dragon-types on the switch regardless of which side of the field gets switched out, 2HKOing the common double dragons. This makes it more of a support move due to it easing prediction for Gardevoir immensely. However, Moonblast is also an option, as it is far more spammable than Dazzling Gleam due to its higher Base Power, while the high chance to lower its target's Special Attack is also a factor because it helps out teammates with low Special Defense stats. Psychic is chosen over Psyshock due to the physically defensive nature of the metagame. Will-O-Wisp is a great supportive option, as it gives Gardevoir a better way of dealing with Dragon-types when they are already in. Additionally, the utility of burning physical attackers is huge. Trick Room is a nice option to counter Trick Room teams if your team is particularly weak to them, or to set it up for teams that utilize it. On the other hand, Taunt can be used on fast teams that enjoy its ability to block the use of Rage Powder, Spore, Dark Void, Thunder Wave, and Swagger, although you must remember that it doesn't block Pachirisu's Nuzzle. Protect can be used over either of these moves, or it can be used over Will-O-Wisp if the team desperately needs either Trick Room or Taunt support.

Set Details
========

The listed EV spread allows Gardevoir to always survive Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird and fully invested Aegislash's Shadow Ball or Flash Cannon from full health, OHKOing 4 HP variants of the former after the recoil from Brave Bird 91% of the time. Additionally, it allows Gardevoir to always survive Mega Kangaskhan's Return from full health if it is holding a Sitrus Berry. Trace is usually preferred due to its great supportive utility, although Telepathy can be used if your team utilizes Earthquake. Sitrus Berry is the recommended item, as it allows Gardevoir to survive Mega Kangaskhan's Return, although Safety Goggles is also an option if you want to block Amoonguss's Spore and Rage Powder to cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp or Taunt opposing supporters.

Usage Tips
========

This set focuses less on trying to OHKO things with Moonblast and more on supporting the team and checking Dragon-types defensively, although it is still a nice perk if you do choose to run Moonblast. Burn physically attacking non-Fire-types whenever possible, and Taunt particularly disruptive Pokemon like Amoonguss, Smeargle, and Pachirisu as quickly as you can. Finally, aim to bring Gardevoir in on Dragon-type attacks if you can due to how well Gardevoir checks them.

Team Options
========

Pokemon which benefit from Will-O-Wisp support, such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, are good teammates for Gardevoir due to its ability to cripple physical attackers like Garchomp, as well as weaken Tyranitar's Rock Slides. Fighting-, Ghost-, and Dark-types have very good synergy with Gardevoir, making Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Lucario, Aegislash, and Scrafty good teammates. Pokemon that benefit from Trick Room or its reversal enjoy Gardevoir's presence, making Ferrothorn, Mawile, Garchomp, and Salamence good teammates. Speaking of Garchomp and Salamence, Dragon-types in general have very good synergy with Gardevoir due to how Dragon- and Fairy-types cover a lot of each other's weaknesses. Additionally, Pokemon that benefit from Dragon-types being eliminated, such as bulky Rotom-A and Talonflame, are good teammates. Finally, if Gardevoir has Telepathy, users of Earthquake like Garchomp are great teammates for obvious reasons.

Other Options
########

Gardevoir has a wide movepool, giving it a variety of other options that it can use. However, many of them are outclassed by the options listed or other Pokemon. You can use an Assault Vest set to reasonable effect, boosting Gardevoir's already good special bulk to very high levels while working well in conjunction with Gardevoir's high Special Attack stat. However, Gardevoir's inability to use its wide range of supportive options, lack of recovery, and lackluster Speed stat mean that this set isn't usually worthwhile. Thunder Wave can be used over Taunt, Trick Room, or Will-O-Wisp, but you are generally better off using Pokemon like Meowstic and Ferrothorn for Thunder Wave support. Ally Switch is a nice surprise if you want a psuedo-Follow Me, although the inability to spam it and how easy it is to play around makes it a relatively poor option. Babiri Berry is an option to allow Gardevoir to take Steel-type attacks from Pokemon such as Scizor, Mega Lucario, and Aegislash better once&mdash;as well as being a great option to get around Item Clause if both Sitrus Berry and Safety Goggles are needed on other Pokemon&mdash;but Gardevoir has better uses of its item slot, and its effect is extremely niche on a Pokemon like Gardevoir.

A Mega Gardevoir set with Round in conjunction with faster users of the move like Pyroar allow immense single-target power, but it is extremely team- and matchup-reliant, meaning that it isn't usually worth it. Other supportive options like dual screens and Heal Pulse can be used, but Rotom-W and Meowstic-M are better users of the former, while Clawitzer and Lucario are better users of the latter. Finally, Focus Blast or Hidden Power Fire can be used on the 'Choice Attacker' set to catch Steel-types, with the former also OHKOing 4 HP or 252 HP variants of Mega Kangaskhan, depending on what item it holds, but they are poor moves to be locked into due to the former's low accuracy and the latter's low Base Power, especially on a Pokemon as physically frail as Gardevoir.

Checks and Counters
########

**Priority**: Users of Bullet Punch such as Mega Lucario and Scizor can deal serious damage to Gardevoir. Similarly, Talonflame's 120 Base Power priority means that it can very easily dent Gardevoir sufficiently.

*Physical Attackers**: Physical attackers can take advantage of Gardevoir's nonexistent physical bulk, making Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Gyarados good counters.

**Specially Bulky Pokemon**: Pokemon like Rotom-W and Mega Charizard Y have little difficulty coming in on Gardevoir due to their high special bulk.

**Fake Out**: Fake Out can very easily stop Gardevoir in its tracks and cause it to faint prematurely, making common users such as Meowstic and Kangaskhan good checks.

**Protect Mega Gengar**: Gengar can use Protect on the turn it Mega Evolves and then outpace and OHKO Gardevoir with Sludge Bomb.

**Aegislash**: Aegislash can easily take any hit aside from Shadow Ball and deal heavy damage back with any STAB attack.

**Ferrothorn**: Ferrothorn walls Gardevoir outside of a rouge Hidden Power Fire or Focus Blast and can OHKO back with Gyro Ball.
