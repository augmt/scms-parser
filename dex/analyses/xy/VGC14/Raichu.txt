Overview
########

Raichu is probably one of the best Fake Out users in the game. Raichu was one of those lucky ones that got a boost to one of their stats in XY, and for Raichu, it was given to Speed. Its new base 110 Speed allows it to outspeed most of the common Pokemon in the base 100 Speed tier and provides it with one of the fastest unboosted Fake Outs in VGC, though still slower than Pokemon like Weavile. Raichu also has access to Encore, which can lock your opponent into an unfavorable move, as well as other support moves like Nuzzle and Charm. Lightning Rod makes your team immune to single-target Electric-type moves, such as Thunderbolt and, most importantly, Thunder Wave. With Encore, Raichu can also lock its opponent into boosting its Special Attack via Lightning Rod. Furthermore, it has access to some decent attacking options, such as Hidden Power Ice, Thunderbolt, and Volt Switch, coming off its decent base 90 Special Attack.

However, it misses vital KOs, particularly on Garchomp with Hidden Power Ice, and it is pretty frail, so it is probably going to go down to one or two strong hits. It also really relies on its Speed to support allies, so if it drops due to Trick Room, Tailwind, Icy Wind, or something similar, it can't function as well. It also faces stiff competition from Pachirisu, which has access to Follow Me to redirect most hits and has better overall bulk, and Manectric, which can actually do something with the redirected Electric-type moves and, with its higher Special Attack stat, actually has a chance to KO Garchomp. Also, Liepard can steal its thunder with access to priority Encore, limiting the list of Pokemon that can outspeed it to just Talonflame.

Moves
========

The main niche with Raichu is that its blinding base 110 Speed lets it use Fake Out before most other common Fake Out users. With its fast Fake Out, it can force the opponent into a hard decision, because a Fake Out lets Raichu's ally use an attack that could threaten your opponent. Thunderbolt is a strong STAB move that makes use of those Lightning Rod boosts, while Volt Switch gives a bit of flow to your team, allowing you to shuffle around and switch your Pokemon with ease, all while keeping your momentum. If Raichu is on a weather-based team, Volt Switch should be your main choice, as your weather could be cancelled while your setter and Raichu are out: in this case, just switch your setter out and Volt Switch it back in again to bring your weather back. This can catch opponents off-guard: for example, bringing back rain while a Mega Charizard Y is on the field severely reduces its power. The final move is a toss-up. Protect stalls out a weather or Perish Song turn or lets your ally clear out a threat. Hidden Power Ice gives Raichu the amazing BoltBeam coverage, letting it 2HKO Garchomp and hit other Ground-types hard.

Set Details
========

The EV spread is simple. 28 HP EVs and 4 Def EVs allow Raichu to survive Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch, while maximum Speed investment is used to fire off Raichu's attacks as quickly as possible. The remaining EVs are put in Special Attack in order to maximize damage output, as Raichu will most likely run a Focus Sash and isn't really bothered by most strong attacks. The Focus Sash can let Raichu survive moves such as Garchomp's Earthquake, allowing it to KO the opponent next turn. Lightning Rod is the best ability by far, letting Raichu redirect all Electric-type moves and gain a Special Attack boost. When coupled with a fast Encore, this can make Raichu difficult for enemy Rotom-A and Zapdos to deal with. On a side note, if you use Hidden Power Ice, use the 31/0/30/31/31/31 IV spread, as this lets Raichu keep its Speed at the highest level.

Usage Tips
========

A very aggressive playstyle best fits Raichu's role. You have to keep up the pressure on your opponent; if an opening is available, take it. Otherwise, it can lose games for you. For example: if your opponent threatens to use an Electric-type move, switch Raichu in safely; if a Garchomp uses Substitute, Encore it. With high pressure tactics, you keep your opponent on their feet, and you can control the game.

Team Options
========

Perish Trap Mega Gengar is a brilliant partner when Raichu carries Volt Switch. If Gengar uses Perish Song and proceeds to switch out, Raichu can use Volt Switch to bring Gengar back in. You can also run Raichu with a Disable user. This, in conjunction with Raichu's Encore, causes your opponent to Struggle and lose 25% of its HP per turn if they hit. Again, Mega Gengar is a suitable user of this move due to its Speed and ability Shadow Tag. Even if Raichu just Encores an opponent into using Electric-type moves, Mega Gengar traps it, forcing it to continue boosting Raichu's Special Attack stat. It can be one of the most destructive combinations out there. In addition, rain teams love Raichu around, because you can lead with it and another ally and proceed to Volt Switch into Politoed to set up rain. In addition, Electric-type moves can be redirected to Raichu, meaning that Water-types such as Azumarill won't have to fear those.

Other Options
#########

Nuzzle can be used on a more supportive set to spread paralysis; however, Pokemon such as Pachirisu are better at this. Thunder Wave is an alternative to this, as Nuzzle can break Raichu's own Focus Sash when hitting Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Rocky Helmet users. Fling can be used in tandem with King's Rock to get an extra flinch; Raichu's base 110 Speed allows it to hit most Pokemon before they attack, making it act like a second Fake Out. However, you then sacrifice your Focus Sash for the extra flinch. Feint is a nice support move that lets Raichu break Protect so an ally can hit and KO an opponent. It can also finish off an opponent with low HP and even make it so that an opposing Pokemon that Protects itself from its ally's spread move is still hit; an example is Garchomp using Earthquake alongside a Tyranitar. Charm lets Raichu soften physical hits and can let Raichu's allies set up and cause havoc. Tickle is like Charm, but it lowers the opponent's Defense too, allowing your physical attackers to do more damage. Safety Goggles can let Raichu hit around Rage Powder with Thunderbolt and Encore. This is useful for attacking Pokemon such as Azumarill, which often hide behind Amoonguss.

Checks & Counters
########

**Speed**: Pokemon that can naturally outspeed Raichu are probably the best at countering it, Aerodactyl being the best in this regard. It can use Protect against Fake Out, and proceed to use Rock Slide without having to worry about Encore. Even some Aerodactyl run Taunt, so they can shut Raichu down.

**Ground-types**: Ground-types are large threats to Raichu, and without Hidden Power Ice, Raichu is helpless. Garchomp and Mamoswine are the best Ground-types used to tackle Raichu because of their high stats. Marowak gets an honorable mention due to its ability to redirect Raichu's Electric-type moves with its own Lightning Rod and use Bonemerang to KO Raichu even through its Focus Sash.

**Pokemon Immune to Electric-type moves**: Pokemon with an Electric-type immunity completely defeat Raichu. Volt Absorb and Lightning Rod users, such as Manectric and Pachirisu, can break Raichu's momentum and cause havoc, and in Pachirisu's case, even redirect Encore. Even if Manectric Mega Evolves, it will still beat Raichu one-on-one, despite being unable to freely use its STAB moves.

**Taunt**: Taunt is a key threat, as it shuts down Raichu's main support moves, making it so Raichu loses its momentum and either needs to switch or attack. Be wary of Volt Switch, however, which allows Raichu to quickly and seamlessly escape without losing momentum.
