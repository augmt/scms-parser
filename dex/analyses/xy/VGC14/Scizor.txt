Overview
########

Scizor, the Bullet Punching battle bug, is back for another round. With eight resistances, one immunity, and only one weakness, it can take many hits and retaliate with great power. Scizor has a few more obstacles in its path, though. Scizor now faces competition from Bisharp and Mega Mawile, both of which have more freedom to utilize their priority Sucker Punch as Steel-types no longer resists Dark-type moves. Scizor has the downside of being completely crippled by burns, which have become a more common method of stopping physical sweepers. Furthermore, Intimidate is more common as well, and even though it can be avoided, it is another obstacle Scizor needs to play around. In addition to these setbacks, Scizor is missing some of its stronger moves due to the VGC' 14 rule set. On the bright side, Scizor made the cut and received a Mega Evolution; Mega Scizor has better bulk and an extra 20 points in its base Attack stat, which strengthens its signature Technician-boosted STAB Bullet Punch. Despite some setbacks and obstacles, Scizor is still a premier Pokemon that can tear through opposing Pokemon before they even get a chance to attack.

Moves
========

Scizor has fewer options this time around, but it's still great at what it does. Bullet Punch is the go-to attack for Scizor, as it has 90 Base Power after the boosts from STAB and Technician, making it an even stronger priority move than Extreme Speed. Due to its power, even Pokemon that resist Steel-type moves will take a good chunk of damage from it. As Bug Bite, Scizor's Bug-type STAB move of choice, is unavailable this season, Scizor must be content with using X-Scissor. Thanks to its typing, Scizor usually has no issue setting up with Swords Dance, which increases the power of its attacking moves greatly. The boost from Swords Dance can also be used to overcome any drops incurred from opposing Pokemon with Intimidate. For the last slot, Scizor has two good choices: Protect and Roost. Protect, a general VGC move, can be used to keep Scizor out of harm's way while a teammate deals with a certain threat. On the other hand, Roost heals Scizor and prolongs its time on the battlefield.

Set Details
========

Scizor has two item options for this set. Considering that the sets for Mega Scizor and standard Scizor are currently identical, you can run Scizorite for the boosts that it provides. If you already have a Mega Evolution on your team, you can opt to run a Lum Berry instead, which can protect Scizor if a burn comes its way. Regular Scizor has good stats, so Mega Evolving it is not a necessity. If you decide to just stick with regular Scizor, it must run Technician as its ability. There is no reason to use either of the other abilities: Swarm is pointless as Bullet Punch is the main attack whereas Light Metal does not help Scizor in any notable way.

252 HP EVs increase Scizor's bulk, allowing it to better tank attacks, while 252 Attack EVs along with and Adamant nature allow Scizor to deal as much damage as possible with its attacking moves. Running Jolly does not allow Scizor to outspeed anything noticeable, and is not worth the decrease in power.

Usage Tips
========

Scizor should be used either as a lead or a late-game cleaner. If it is partnered with a Pokemon that can take care of its checks and counters, Scizor can make for a good lead, as it can possibly set up and wreak havoc early on. On the other hand, after the Pokemon that can stop it have been sufficiently weakened or KOed, Scizor can be a great late-game cleaner with its incredibly strong Bullet Punch. Regarding Mega Evolution, there is no reason to wait unless you are attempting to bluff having another Mega Pokemon. Scizor gets some nice boosts from its Mega Evolution and so should be Mega Evolved as soon as possible.

Team Options
========

Mega Tyranitar and regular Tyranitar make great teammates for Scizor and Mega Scizor, respectively. The sandstorm Tyranitar summons does not harm Scizor, can help wear down opposing Pokemon, and can be used to win the weather war. Tyranitar can also take care of the Fire-types that threaten Scizor. Water-types pair well with Scizor as they have decent defensive synergy with it. Rotom-W and Scizor cover each other's weaknesses nicely; one can deal with what threatens the other. Politoed makes a good partner as the rain it brings halves the damage done to Scizor by Fire-type moves. Another great partner for Scizor is Chandelure, as it can take care of opposing Steel-types with its Fire-type STAB moves. Also, with Flash Fire, it can discourage the opponent from using Heat Wave, as the move will give Chandelure a free boost to its Fire-type moves. Salamence makes a good teammate for Scizor as well, as it can take care of Steel-type Pokemon with either Flamethrower or Fire Blast. Furthermore, it has Intimidate to help prolong Scizor's time on the field.

Other Options
########

Scizor has a few other options in addition to what is listed on the set. As the Item Clause can be a pain, Scizor has three other viable item choices. Iron Plate can be used to bluff another item and it increases the power of Bullet Punch. Life Orb provides a boost to all of Scizor's moves, but cannot be used to bluff another item due to the recoil damage it causes with each attack. Lastly, Scizor can hold an Occa Berry, but it will still be KOed by most Fire-type moves unless it is in rain. Feint can break through Protect and deal some damage thanks to the Technician boost, but Scizor is better off utilizing stronger moves. As Superpower is not available, Brick Break can be used as an alternative coverage option, but it lacks power. Thief becomes a 90 Base Power attack after the Technician boost but once again does not make use of Scizor's offensive potential. Quick Guard can deal with priority moves but is not really worth a moveslot, especially on an offensive Pokemon like Scizor.

Checks & Counters
########

**Will-O-Wisp**: Burning Scizor is usually the best way to stop it, as it cannot recover from the setback. However, Lum Berry can alleviate the status condition once.

**Intimidate**: Intimidate reduces Scizor's offensive prowess, though differs from Will-O-Wisp in that Scizor can overcome the Attack drop with Swords Dance, which takes up a turn.

**Gyarados**: Gyarados has Intimidate and resists both of Scizor's STAB moves when not Mega-Evolved.

**Fire-types**: Fire-type attacks are the most reliable in taking Scizor down. Due to its crippling 4x weakness to Fire, Scizor is likely to be KOed by any Fire-type attack, even if it holds an Occa Berry. Fire-types in general are also great at countering Scizor. Talonflame, Charizard, and Talonflame resist both of Scizor's STAB moves and can OHKO it with their respective attacks.

**Manectric**: Mega Manectric has Intimidate to weaken Scizor's attacks, resists Bullet Punch, and can OHKO it with Flamethrower.

**Rotom-W**: Rotom-W takes little damage from Bullet Punch and can burn Scizor with Will-O-Wisp or deal damage with Hydro Pump.

**Rotom-H**: Rotom-H does not fear either of Scizor's STAB moves and can burn or OHKO Scizor with a STAB Fire-type move.
