Overview
########

This season, Manectric has proven itself to be a top tier threat. Not much has changed for regular Manectric, but its Mega Evolution is an entirely different story. After Mega Evolving, Manectric becomes the fastest Pokemon in the tier with access to both Intimidate as well as a switching move in Volt Switch. Having decent 70 / 80 / 80 defensive stats (a slight boost from regular Manectric's stats) and only one weakness, Mega Manectric is able to take hits as well as dish them out. This season, being a special attacker is a gift due to the increased usage of Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp, and Mega Manectric's base 135 Special Attack makes it a force to be reckoned with. However, Garchomp, which also received a Mega Evolution, is prominent in the VGC '14 season in both its regular and its Mega Evolved forms. Its STAB Earthquake, especially with a Sand Force boost, makes it a big obstacle that Manectric has to deal with quite often. Furthermore, Manectric has a poor movepool, and usually has to choose from less than ten moves. Despite these drawbacks, Mega Manectric can wreak havoc to both unprepared and prepared teams.

Moves
========

Although Manectric's movepool is small, the moves that it has access to are quite varied in typing. Thunderbolt is the main choice for Manectric as it is a strong Electric-type STAB move. Volt Switch is another option that allows Manectric to deal a good chunk of damage due to its high base Special Attack, and then switch out so it can reactivate Intimidate when brought back in. Manectric has two options for the next moveslot: Overheat and Flamethrower. Flamethrower is a strong Fire-type move that deals a lot damage without any drawbacks. Overheat, on the other hand, is stronger, but lowers Manectric's Special Attack, which is a price that it may be unwilling to pay. The third slot is dependent on personal preference. Hidden Power Ice is the main choice as it can remove Ground-types that usually wall Manectric, and comes in handy when dealing with Garchomp. Manectric can try Snarl, which deals damage and cripples opposing special attackers. For the last slot, Protect is a must as it provides all the useful utilities that come with it in double battles.

Set Details
========

Most of the set is quite standard. Since this set is meant for Mega Manectric, Manectite is obviously the item of choice. The ability Manectric has prior to Mega Evolution should be Lightningrod, as it allows Manectric to take advantage of Electric-type attacks. The other abilities are not useful, as Static is based on chance and relies on Manectric being attacked to activate, and Minus is completely useless.

The EV spread is standard for special attackers and sweepers. 252 EVs in Special Attack are used to maximize Manectric's Special Attack, while the 252 EVs in Speed help to boost up its Speed. Lastly, both Timid and Modest natures are good on Mega Manectric. A Modest nature maximizes its Special Attack and is viable as Manectric already has a high base Speed, while a Timid nature helps it outspeed certain Pokemon prior to Mega Evolution, mainly Garchomp and Charizard.

Usage Tips
========

Manectric works nicely as a lead and can also keep momentum going with Volt Switch. If they have several physical attackers, it's recommended you lead off with Manectric and activate Intimidate. This is useful as after Manectric has Mega-Evolved, Intimidate will reactivate every time it is brought back into play. Using this, you can completely cripple opposing physical sweepers and render them useless. If your opponent's Pokemon are likely to fire off Electric-type moves, you should hold off on Mega Evolving since Manectric can take advantage of them with Lightningrod.

Team Options
========

Manectric has some really good teammates that can compliment its versatility. Gyarados works very well with Manectric, as it can take care of Ground-type Pokemon that normally scare Manectric. In addition, they both have Intimidate, and a double Intimidate core severely hampers Pokemon that depend on physical moves. Another good teammate for Manectric is Amoonguss, as it does not fear Pokemon that normally target Manectric and can offer good support thanks to its access to Rage Powder and Spore. Ground-types are nice teammates and allow Manectric to spam Discharge, as they do not take any damage due to their immunity to Electric-type moves. Lastly, Politoed works nicely due to Drizzle, which overrides other weather conditions and raises Thunder's accuracy to 100%.

Other Options
########

Despite its scarce movepool, Manectric has a few other options. First off, Manectric can opt to run Discharge if it is partnered with a Ground-type, but this is usually unadvised as Manectric cannot participate as part of a DisQuake combo. Manectric can run Thunder, but the move is only viable in rain, as its shaky accuracy is not worth the risk otherwise. Lastly, Manectric has the option to run Hidden Power Grass instead of Hidden Power Ice, but the list of what it hits harder is slim.

Checks & Counters
########

**Rotom-H**: Rotom-H resists every move that Manectric can throw at it and is able to KO Manectric before Manectric KOes it.

**Ground-types**: Manectric is not that bulky and will most likely fall to Ground-type moves like Earthquake. However, Manectric may be able to survive if its opponent is weakened by Intimidate. As a general rule, if Manectric cannot OHKO its opponent, it will be KOed in return.

**Dragon-types**: Like Ground-types, Dragon-types can be a pain to deal with. Unless Manectric carries Hidden Power Ice, Dragon-types resist any move it can throw at them, and can KO it with their naturally powerful attacks. Even if Manectric carries Hidden Power Ice, Goodra can take the hits due to its insanely high special bulk.
