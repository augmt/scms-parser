Overview
########

Amoonguss is a great support Pokemon due to its access to Rage Powder, which directs all foes' attacks at itself, and Spore, which puts the target to sleep. Amoonguss is able to shut down some of the best Pokemon in the tier, such as Rotom-W. However, many Pokemon in the tier can destroy Amoonguss, such as Rotom-H, Charizard, and Talonflame. Amoonguss has a weak offensive presence and multiple effects were added in XY that weaken Amoonguss's effectiveness, such as Grass-types' immunity to Spore and the introduction of Safety Goggles, which prevent the holder from being affected by powder moves and weather.

move 1: Spore
move 2: Rage Powder

move 4: Protect
ability: Regenerator / Effect Spore

evs: 252 HP / 180 Def / 76 SpD
nature: Calm / Sassy

Moves
========

Spore puts the target to sleep and gives Amoonguss's ally leeway to set up or attack. Rage Powder redirects foes' attacks towards Amoonguss so its ally can attack or set up without getting hit unless it is a multi-hit attack. Giga Drain is a reliable STAB move which inflicts direct damage and helps against Water-types such as Rotom-W and Politoed. Protect keeps Amoonguss safe from its ally's spread attacks, buys time for Amoonguss to gain back some recovery from Black Sludge, and scouts attacks.

Set Details
========

Regenerator allows Amoonguss to heal back damage taken from attacks after using Rage Powder when it switches out, allowing it to switch in again later to rinse and repeat. Effect Spore is also an option if Amoonguss is primarily focusing on taking advantage of Rage Powder thereby giving Amoonguss's ally freedom to attack. However, Effect Spore is risky if Amoonguss goes for Spore a lot, as it could waste a turn if the foe gets paralyzed or poisoned because of it on the turn Amoonguss uses Spore. The given EVs allow for maximum overall bulk and a Calm nature allows Amoonguss to outspeed Pokemon that are equipped to operate in Trick Room while still being slow at the same time. A Sassy nature can be used instead, as it allows Amoonguss to minimize its Speed and therefore to go first against almost everything under Trick Room.

Usage Tips
========

Amoonguss is very useful early-game when it can switch in and out to regain health with Regenerator. If Amoonguss's ally is a Fake Out user, the procedure is to have it use Fake Out, have Amoonguss use Spore on the foe which wasn't hit by Fake Out, and have Amoonguss use Spore on the other foe the next turn. Rage Powder should be used when the ally wants to either set up or to receive protection from moves such as Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave. Effect Spore helps with Mega Kangaskhan, whose ability, Parental Bond, gives it double the chance of getting statused.

Team Options
========

Amoonguss works well with multiple Pokemon; however, it should avoid having an ally that is weak to Fire-type moves, such as Heat Wave. Kangaskhan is an amazing ally for Amoonguss, as its Fake Out lets Amoonguss use Spore with great comfort and Rage Powder prevents Fighting-type attacks, which Amoonguss resists, from hitting Mega Kangaskhan as it uses Power-Up Punch to raise its Attack by two stages. Rotom-W and Talonflame appreciate Amoonguss's ability to take Grass-, Electric-, and Water-type attacks for them. Trick Room users such as Aromatisse allow Amoonguss to go first and work even more effectively. Amoonguss's ally should make up for Amoonguss's lack of offensive presence.

Other Options
########

There are multiple other options that Amoonguss can use, such as Sludge Bomb, a reliable Poison-type STAB move which hits Grass-types and has a 30% chance to poison the target. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Steel-types such as Ferrothorn. Rest lets Amoonguss recover HP and rid itself of unwanted status. Coba and Occa Berry can be used to lessen the damage of Flying- and Fire-type attacks, respectively, which threaten Amoonguss. Synthesis provides a means of gaining back HP without having to switch out and can be useful in conjunction with Rage Powder when Amoonguss is continually taking hits. Energy Ball hits harder than Giga Drain and has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense; however, it does not heal Amoonguss. Hidden Power Ice hits Dragon-types harder than Amoonguss's other moves. Lastly, Clear Smog can prevent foes from setting up against Amoonguss, as it resets the target's stat boosts.

Checks & Counters
########

**Safety Goggles**: Safety Goggles prevents the holder from being affected by Spore and Rage Powder, therefore allowing them to attack freely. This can cause problems for Amoonguss, as any Pokemon can run this item, and it can waste a turn when you don't expect a foe to be running it.

**Taunt**: Taunt prevents Amoonguss from using Rage Powder, Spore, and Protect, locking it into only Giga Drain or forcing it to switch out. This prevents Amoonguss from supporting its allies.

**Lum Berry**: Lum Berry lets foes take a Spore, giving the opponent one more free turn which it can use to hit Amoonguss or its ally.

**Super Effective Attacks**: Super effective attacks from Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Rotom-H hit Amoonguss hard and perhaps even OHKO it.
