Overview
########

Kricketune seems unviable at first glance, as its bad base stats leave much to be desired, but it has a solid niche as a Sticky Web setter that can also run utility moves such as Knock Off and Taunt. Many slow heavy hitters in RU, such as Clawitzer, Exploud, and Choice Band Tyrantrum, benefit greatly from Sticky Web support against faster offensive teams. Kricketune's horrible defenses work in its favor, as with Endeavor, it can potentially cripple many opponents, though it has nothing else to offer offensively. Kricketune's bad Speed means it can be prevented from setting up Sticky Web by a faster Taunt, however, and it also has poor matchups versus common leads such as Taunt Cobalion, Taunt Archeops, and Crustle. Kricketune can still put in work against the common bulky teams in RU, as it can provide valuable utility with Knock Off and Taunt.


Sticky Web
########
name: Sticky Web
move 1: Sticky Web
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Endeavor / Bug Bite
ability: Technician
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Sticky Web provides valuable speed control against offensive teams, letting Kricketune's teammates KO frail Pokemon that would normally be faster. Knock Off is used to cripple foes that rely on their item, such as Golbat and Piloswine, and neutralize threats with items such as Choice Scarf. Endeavor can bring foes down to 1 HP after Kricketune survives an attack with Focus Sash. Bug Bite hits harder than Knock Off and OHKOes Defog Shiftry, which can otherwise prevent Sticky Web from being set up. Taunt prevents Defog and opposing setup, all of which can be problematic.

Set Details
========

252 Attack EVs give Kricketune as much power as possible, and 252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature maximize Speed; it is pointless to invest in bulk, as Kricketune wants to get brought down to 1 HP. Technician powers up Bug Bite, and a Focus Sash ensures that Kricketune can survive any one hit and set up Sticky Web.

Usage Tips
========

Kricketune should usually be used in the lead position, as it won't get many chances to set up Sticky Web otherwise. Sticky Web is the top priority against offensive teams and certain balanced teams, but it may be helpful to save Kricketune for later against stall, as it can still support the team with Knock Off and Taunt. Knock Off should be used against Pokemon that rely on their items, such as Golbat, or against Choice Scarf users, as the item negates the effect of Sticky Web. Endeavor should be used after Kricketune is brought down to its Focus Sash, although you should keep in mind that Sticky Web is the top priority. Against stall teams, Knock Off can be helpful to remove Leftovers and Eviolites. Taunt should be used against most Defoggers, setup sweepers, and entry hazard users, unless Kricketune can OHKO them anyway. In the unlikely case that Sticky Web is up and Kricketune's Focus Sash is not broken, you can predict an attack and use Endeavor against faster foes. Use Taunt against setup sweepers that may be a threat, such as Huntail, and also against other entry hazard setters such as Omastar. In some cases, Kricketune should not lead, especially if the opponent has potential Taunt-carrying leads such as Archeops and Cobalion. It is possible to try to save Kricketune for later against more bulky teams to cripple a member with Endeavor before it faints.


Team Options
========

Pokemon that don't lack power but are crippled by below average Speed, such as Emboar, Exploud, Choice Band Tyrantrum, and Clawitzer, make for good partners. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Meloetta and Mega Glalie appreciate the speed control Kricketune provides. Rapid Spin users such as Hitmonlee are good partners, as they can remove entry hazards without getting rid of Sticky Web. Other entry hazard setters such as Druddigon and Sandslash can further support the team with the chip damage provided by their entry hazards. Spinblockers such as Doublade and Spiritomb are good teammates to prevent the removal of Sticky Web via Rapid Spin. Braviary makes for a good partner, as it can take advantage of Defog to get a free Defiant boost. A fast safety net can act as an insurance against Flying-types or if Sticky Web is removed; Pokemon such as Jolteon and Sneasel can perform this job well. A priority user such as the aforementioned Mega Glalie can pick off Pokemon weakened by Endeavor.



Other Options
########

Toxic can be used to cripple other leads, but all of Kricketune's other moves are more useful in most situations. X-Scissor with Swarm can also be used, as it hits harder at 1 HP than Technician Bug Bite.


Checks & Counters
########

**Taunt**: Kricketune is countered by almost everything, but preventing Sticky Web from staying up and avoiding being crippled by Endeavor is what counts. Taunt users that outspeed Kricketune, such as Archeops, Cobalion, and Mismagius, basically shut it down completely, although if for some reason they are switching in they have to watch out for Taunt as well.

**Multi-Hit Attackers**: Multi-hit attackers such as Cinccino, Rhyperior, and Crustle can take Kricketune out despite its Focus Sash, limiting it to Sticky Web or stopping it from accomplishing anything at all.

**Non-Grounded Pokemon**: Pokemon such as Braviary and Rotom-C can inflict heavy damage on Kricketune's team thanks to their immunity to Sticky Web, as they're likely to be faster than most of Kricketune's teammates.

**Entry Hazard Removers**: Rapid Spin users such as Hitmonlee can remove Sticky Web later in the game and cannot be stopped from doing so by Taunt, although they can be spinblocked. Defog users such as Skuntank and Shiftry can do the same, although the latter has to watch out for Bug Bite.
