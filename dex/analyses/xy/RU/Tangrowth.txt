Overview
########

Tangrowth had quite the showing for itself in the BW RU metagame, and it returns in XY to show everyone just why it's one of the top choices for a physical wall. With a great Defense stat, solid support movepool, and a great ability in Regenerator, Tangrowth is a very resilient Pokemon that is not easy to take down. However, being a defensive wall isn't the only thing Tangrowth has up its vines. With solid mixed offenses and a good offensive movepool, Tangrowth has the capability to pull out a full offensive set and even an Assault Vest set as well. However, Tangrowth has fairly low Speed and a lackluster Special Defense stat that leaves it vulnerable to numerous special attackers, such as Moltres, Yanmega, and Delphox. Tangrowth is a great Pokemon in its own right, but it faces serious competition from Amoonguss, a defensive Grass-type with much better mixed defenses, a 100% accurate Sleep move, and Regenerator. Tangrowth is a solid Pokemon for many teams, but be sure to take care of its common weaknesses and ensure that it won't be outclassed by Amoonguss on your team.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Giga Drain / Power Whip
move 3: Hidden Power Fire / Knock Off
move 4: Leech Seed / Synthesis
ability: Regenerator
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Bold / Relaxed

Moves
======

This is the Tangrowth set you will see most often in the RU metagame. Sleep Powder is a fantastic move that can shut down would-be offensive counters to Tangrowth, such as Moltres and Braviary. Giga Drain is the primary choice for a STAB move to smash the likes of Rhyperior, Alomomola, and Kabutops on top of recovering health. If Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Gallade are of more concern, you can opt for Power Whip, as it hits them much harder. Hidden Power Fire provides necessary coverage to hit most Steel-types in the tier, most notably Cobalion, which is a key physical threat Tangrowth has no issues with coming in on. Meanwhile, Knock Off can remove items from the opposing Pokemon, potentially ruining their strategies for the rest of the match, but it can also keep the likes of Hitmonlee from getting that stronger hit that they need to push through a defensive check. Leech Seed is preferred in the last slot, as it allows Tangrowth to force switches and give itself and its teammates some passive healing. Synthesis is another healing option for Tangrowth that provides instant recovery. However, it's nerfed by Snow Warning and can be rather redundant if Tangrowth is using Giga Drain for its STAB move of choice. There are a couple of options to consider if neither healing option appeals to you. Stun Spore can paralyze some would-be sleep absorbers, but fails against many of the same Pokemon Sleep Powder does.

Set Details
======

The given EV spread maximizes Tangrowth's physical bulk while rounding down passive damage from Spikes or status damage. The STAB move you choose determines the nature Tangrowth should have. When using Giga Drain, a Bold nature should be used, while the use of Power Whip means Relaxed is the superior option. Leftovers is the best item option for Tangrowth, as it gives Tangrowth some extra recovery. If running Giga Drain, however, Rocky Helmet can be considered as a way to punish physical attackers that attempt to break through Tangrowth. Regenerator should always be Tangrowth's ability thanks to the passive healing it provides whenever Tangrowth switches out.

Usage Tips
======

Tangrowth can easily be brought in against most physical attackers that can't hit it for super effective damage, such as Cobalion, Rhyperior, and Kabutops. While it may be tempting to bring it in on Sharpedo, it's best to first scout for Ice Beam before doing this as quite a few Sharpedo run the move to surprise Tangrowth. While Sleep Powder is a fantastic support move, there are quite a few Pokemon in RU that are immune to it. If you predict one of these immunities coming in, try to hit it with the appropriate attack, such as using Leech Seed on Escavalier to wear it down or Focus Blast on Virizion to get some chip damage. Do not stay in on an offensive special attacker unless you plan on sacrificing Tangrowth to set your win condition up.

Team Options
======

Tangrowth may be a great physical wall, but it still has no chance against Escavalier. Moltres and Emboar are fine offensive responses to it, and both of them appreciate Tangrowth's ability to handle bulky Water-types for them. Alternatively, Qwilfish makes for a good defensive check thanks to Intimidate, and it can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Just be wary of Toxic Spikes conflicting with Sleep Powder. Tangrowth has a serious issue with most Fire-types, especially Moltres and Delphox. Slowking forms a great Regenerator core with Tangrowth and happily takes on most Fire-types. Alomomola is another alternative, but it can struggle a bit more with Moltres and Calm Mind Delphox. Braviary can pose quite an issue for Tangrowth, so checks to that are appreciated. Despite the shared Fire-type weakness, Registeel can keep Braviary from mindlessly spamming Brave Bird. Rhyperior is another much more reliable answer to Braviary thanks to Solid Rock and higher physical bulk.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Leaf Storm
move 2: Focus Blast
move 3: Ancient Power / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Sleep Powder / Giga Drain
ability: Regenerator
item: Choice Specs / Life Orb
evs: 132 HP / 252 SpA / 124 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
======

With a solid base 110 Special Attack stat, Tangrowth has no problems with using a special attacking set. Leaf Storm is the main move for this set. With high Base Power and a boosting item, most opposing Pokemon without a resistance take major damage from it. As Grass-type moves are resisted by many other types, Tangrowth's other moves are designed to take care of them. Focus Blast is a necessity to hammer Steel-types, such as Registeel, Cobalion, and Bronzong. Ancient Power is generally the best option in the next slot for its ability to smack opposing Fire- and Flying-types, such as Braviary and Moltres. Hidden Power Fire is a nice alternative if your team struggles with Escavalier and Doublade. Sleep Powder gets the nod in the last slot, as putting an offensive check or counter to sleep can be a game changer. Giga Drain is an alternative, as it provides Tangrowth with a reliable STAB move with no drawbacks, which can be helpful for when the opponent has dangerous setup sweepers left on their team.

Set Details
======

The EV spread focuses on Tangrowth's solid Special Attack, while also letting it outspeed Alomomola before it can use a support move such as Toxic or Wish. Do note that you will need to move 4 HP EVs over to Speed if you use Hidden Power Fire as that requires an imperfect Speed IV. Choice Specs is the primary option, as Tangrowth benefits from switching out a lot thanks to Regenerator. Life Orb is certainly an option, as it allows Tangrowth the freedom to switch moves and use Sleep Powder more reliably.

Usage Tips
======

This Tangrowth thrives on switching into weak or resisted physical attacks and unleashing powerful attacks itself. As strong as Leaf Storm is, be cautious when using it. Moltres, Braviary, and Delphox are very dangerous setup sweepers that will jump at the chance to set up on a -2 Tangrowth. If you decide to use Sleep Powder on Tangrowth, saving it until after your opponent realizes you are equipped with Choice Specs or Life Orb is generally the best way to use it, as they'll be less wary of it after that. Try to stay away from Knock Off. While Tangrowth generally has no problems being able to tank the move, it sorely misses the power boost provided by Choice Specs or Life Orb.

Team Options
======

Tangrowth is a fantastic offensive pivot and greatly appreciates entry hazard support to wear down typical responses to it. Stealth Rock is key, as many Pokemon that resist Grass-type attacks are weak to Stealth Rock. Cobalion, Rhyperior, and Druddigon are all reliable Stealth Rock users to use with Tangrowth. Spikes can help wear down the likes of Amoonguss, Registeel, and Aromatisse very quickly. Accelgor, Qwilfish, and Omastar can all utilize Spikes effectively. If you opt not to run Hidden Power Fire, you will need an Escavalier check. Moltres is the most reliable offensive check to it, but Emboar can work as well, so long as you avoid Drill Run. If Tangrowth lacks AncientPower, you will need checks to Moltres. Assault Vest Slowking is a fantastic counter to Moltres and forms a very sturdy Regenerator core with Tangrowth that is difficult to set up on. Registeel can reliably set up Stealth Rock which can help Tangrowth immensely. As this Tangrowth can punch holes in opposing defensive cores, having cleaners or Choice Scarf users to clean up late-game is a good idea. Jolteon, Rotom-C, Emboar, and Sharpedo can all fill this role effectively.

########
name: alexwolf's waifu (Assault Vest)
move 1: Giga Drain / Leaf Storm
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Earthquake / Rock Slide
ability: Regenerator
item: Assault Vest
evs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpD
nature: Quiet

Moves
======

One of Tangrowth's biggest problems is its lackluster Special Defense. However, this set attempts to fix this issue by giving a boost to Tangrowth's Special Defense in the form of an Assault Vest, so it can take better advantage of its Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type resistances. Giga Drain is the primary STAB move, as it provides reliable healing and deals with the likes of Rhyperior, Alomomola, and Kabutops. Leaf Storm is an alternative for a much stronger option. While the stat drops are annoying, they aren't detrimental, as Tangrowth has Regenerator to benefit from switching out. Knock Off is able to remove items and possibly ruin strategies, making it a very good move to use early on. Hidden Power Fire catches Steel- and Grass-types for reliable damage. It can also defeat Escavalier should Tangrowth catch it with Knock Off on the switch. Earthquake is the primary option in the final slot to nail incoming Fire- and Poison-types hoping to switch into a Grass-type move with relative impunity. However, Rock Slide is an option for Flying-types, mainly Moltres. Poison Jab is usable to nail Aromatisse and fellow Grass-types, but Tangrowth has a hard time finding room for it on this set.

Set Details
======

The EV spread maximizes Tangrowth's Special Attack and HP while rounding down passive damage. Assault Vest is used to bolster Tangrowth's Special Defense to respectable levels while a Quiet nature is recommended so Tangrowth's physical attacks don't get powered down.

Usage Tips
======

Tangrowth still prefers to come in on weak or resisted physical attacks, so as to not blow the cover of Assault Vest immediately. While the bolstered special bulk is nice, don't try testing your luck against the likes of Moltres or Delphox, as Tangrowth still doesn't stand a chance against them. Avoid Knock Off like it's the plague. Tangrowth can take it without suffering too much damage, but losing the special bulk provided by Assault Vest is highly detrimental to this set.

Team Options
======

This Tangrowth is more of a mixed tank, so it appreciates teammates that can take on its weaknesses from both sides of the spectrum. Alomomola is capable of handling most physical attackers that Tangrowth can't while also spreading burns with Scald. Slowking is generally the same, but from the special side instead of the physical side. Both form sturdy Regenerator cores with Tangrowth that can be difficult to break apart. Registeel is able to set up Stealth Rock which can help Tangrowth as it can force many switches. Qwilfish can check Escavalier and Durant while setting up Spikes and Toxic Spikes to support Tangrowth. Aromatisse is able to reliably check most Fighting-types, while absorbing Knock Off with relative ease. It can also provide Cleric support in the event that Tangrowth gets burned or poisoned. Offensive teammates, such as Moltres, Jolteon, Cobalion, and Kabutops, appreciate Tangrowth's ability to switch in on their weaknesses without giving up a lot of momentum, while most can also find opportunities to switch in on various attacks aimed at Tangrowth.

Other Options
########

Perhaps the easiest additional set to make for Tangrowth is a set that abuses Chlorophyll. With Sunny Day support and Growth, Tangrowth can make for a solid Chlorophyll abuser. However, this is generally done better by the likes of Victreebel and Shiftry. A Choice Band set is possible with Tangrowth's colorful physical movepool, but such a set has severe issues because of the fact it can no longer switch into bulky Water-types reliably due to the threat of a Scald burn. Swords Dance can boost Tangrowth's physical attack to very high levels, but it is generally outclassed by Virizion, which has higher Speed and a Fighting-type STAB typing to break through Steel-types more easily. Seed Bomb is a physical Grass-type STAB move that can be used if the accuracy of Power Whip is a turn-off. Toxic and Infestation are support-based options that can wear down opponents, but Tangrowth has a hard time making room for them on its defensive set.

Checks and Counters
########

**Escavalier**: With an immunity to Sleep Powder, the ability to tank a Hidden Power Fire if needed, and a powerful STAB Megahorn to break through Tangrowth, Escavalier is arguably the safest answer to Tangrowth.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types are immune to Sleep Powder and Leech Seed, and they resist Tangrowth's STAB moves as well, making most of them solid defensive checks to Tangrowth. Virizion can even use Tangrowth as setup fodder if it lacks Hidden Power Fire.

**Moltres**: Once Sleep Clause is active, Moltres only fear AncientPower and Rock Slide. If it gets in safely, it can easily dispatch Tangrowth with its STAB moves.

**Flying-types**: Most Flying-types only have to worry about AncientPower and Rock Slide after Sleep Clause is active, and most of them can ravage Tangrowth with their STAB moves. Braviary, Swellow, and Vivillon are all decent Flying-types for this role.

**Fire-types**: Most Fire-types only worry about coverage moves like Earthquake, AncientPower, and Rock Slide once Sleep Clause is active. Delphox and Emboar are key Fire-types here.

**Steel-types**: They have to be wary of Focus Blast, Hidden Power Fire, and Earthquake, but they are reliable checks to Tangrowth once Sleep Clause is active due to their Grass-type resistance. Registeel, Durant, and Bronzong are noteworthy Steel-types.

**Special Attackers**: While they falter against the Assault Vest set, powerful special attackers such as Jolteon, Magneton, and special or mixed Sharpedo can, at worst, 2HKO Tangrowth with relative ease.
