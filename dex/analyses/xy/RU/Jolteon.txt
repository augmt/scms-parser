Overview
########

Say hello to the best offensive Electric-type in the RU metagame. Sporting a phenomenal base 130 Speed stat that far surpasses the gold-standard Speed tiers, Jolteon outpaces the vast majority of the unboosted metagame, which in tandem with its excellent base 110 Special Attack stat, makes it a great revenge killer, late-game cleaner, and powerful tool against and for offensive teams. Jolteon isn't a one-trick pony, however, as it can make use of its unique SubPass set to act as an incredible offensive supporter that is capable of exploiting its own counters in a way that no other Pokemon in RU can do. Jolteon also boasts access to Volt Absorb, which lets it sponge Choice-locked Volt Switches; as such, it is great at disrupting the opposing team's offensive momentum and in general, makes the opponent wary of using Choice-locked Electric-type attacks just by seeing Jolteon in team preview. Unfortunately, Jolteon lacks the raw power to break through dedicated special walls such as Registeel and Aromatisse, and its miniscule bulk makes it susceptible to priority and limits potential switch-in opportunities. Overall, Jolteon is the type of Pokemon that instigates pressure just by being spotted, as its power, Speed, and unique offensive supporting capabilities all help in making it a mainstay and one of the most potent offensive threats in the XY RU metagame.

SubPass
########
name: SubPass
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Wish / Hidden Power Grass
ability: Volt Absorb
item: Leftovers
evs: 68 HP / 252 SpA / 188 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Substitute capitalizes on forced switches and allows Jolteon to dodge powerful Sucker Punches from Mega Banette. Baton Pass gives Jolteon the capability to escape from Focus Sash Dugtrio, but more importantly, allows Jolteon to safely bring in its teammate with or without a Substitute intact and/or with some healing from Wish. Thunderbolt is Jolteon's compulsory STAB move, and even though this Jolteon set functions more as a supporter, it can still snipe troublesome threats such as Gorebyss and Braviary if need be, as well as pick off weakened Pokemon late-game. In the last slot, Wish is the preferred move, as it allows Jolteon to function as an offensive Wish passer. The entire appeal towards using the move is that typical Wish passers lack offensive presence, so they tend to drag down momentum; unlike more conventional Wish passers, such a thing couldn't be any further from the truth when it comes to describing Jolteon. However, if your team is weak to Rhyperior and Gastrodon, then Hidden Power Grass is a good option too; Hidden Power Grass is also good by allowing Jolteon to at least take out weakened Electric-types, such as opposing Jolteon, Heliolisk, and Lanturn instead of being completely helpless when up against such threats. Jolteon may also opt for one other alternative move: Yawn, as it is useful in forcing a switch or temporarily subduing a threat so that Jolteon can get off a free Substitute and pass to its teammate in succession.

Set Details
========

Running max Speed on this Jolteon isn't necessary, seeing as how without any sort of boost and a coverage move above 60 BP, it has very little chance to defeat opposing Jolteon before they take it out first. The EV spread, however, outspeeds Choice Scarf Emboar as well as max Speed Dugtrio, allowing Jolteon to Baton Pass away from Dugtrio before it has to take a STAB Earthquake to the face. Furthermore, the 68 HP EVs conveniently allow Jolteon to withstand Adamant Drapion's Knock Off as well as guarantee that it avoids the KO from Fletchinder's +2 Acrobatics after Stealth Rock, while allowing giving Jolteon's Substitute a bit more durability and its Wish more meat. Additionally, it gives Jolteon a Leftovers number. Leftovers is the preferred item as it gives Jolteon the potential to set up more Substitutes while also preventing it from being worn down as quickly from entry hazards and Substitute-induced recoil.

As stated before, maximum Speed EVs are far from necessary, in fact, they are more of a waste; however, Jolteon can opt to run slightly more Speed, specifically to outspeed Swellow and other Base 125s by extension before they can outspeed and KO Jolteon. A spread consisting of 40 HP / 252 SpA / 216 Spe with a Timid nature does just that, although Swellow and other base 125s aren't exactly the most relevant threats, at least in comparison to Dugtrio, but this spread can find use on teams in need of a spare Swellow check or on teams that are simply weak to the threat in question.

Usage Tips
========

This set functions primarily for offensive teams, and to lesser extent, balanced teams as a way for them to acquire much-needed setup opportunities to break through stall, bulkier defensive builds, or in general, a way to apply immense pressure against opposing offense. By taking advantage of switches it forces with its innate offensive presence and type advantage against the likes of Alomomola, Moltres, and the like, Jolteon can easily find the opportunity to set up a Substitute. Once a switch is forced and a Substitute is made, then comes decision time. In this instance, Jolteon should pass to its teammate that can maintain the Substitute against its given switch-in. For instance, should Tangrowth switch into Jolteon as Jolteon forces out a Water-type, then one teammate that is appropriate to pass to is Virizion, as it can easily withstand Tangrowth's STAB attacks and even certain coverage moves, thus allowing it to set up with an intact Substitute.

With Wish, Jolteon plays a very unique role exclusive to it and it alone: an offensive Wish passer. Typical offensive threats such as Escavalier and Doublade do not use Leftovers and have no means to replenish their own health; thus, they are prone to being worn down very quickly. Normally, a Wish passer such as Alomomola or Aromatisse would suffice, the problem with those two, however, is that they anchor down offensive momentum as a result of their passive nature. Unlike those two, Jolteon has no trouble keeping momentum flowing, and conveniently, it has good synergy with many offensive Pokemon that get worn down, allowing it to Wish pass to them rather easily. When using Wish, try to do so when Jolteon is in front of a weak wall that can't break its Substitute, such as Alomomola, or simply use Wish instead of Substitute should the given situation be more favorable. Take note that if Jolteon is passing either a Substitute or a Wish, it should be wary of phazers forcing it out. Roar Rhyperior and Whirlwind Drapion are rather notable. So, in order for Jolteon to not simply be forced out and accomplish nothing that turn, it's good to attack those two threats in question in order to keep them from repeatedly putting Jolteon in an unfavorable position. This is where the allure towards Hidden Power Grass comes in, as it is Jolteon's only way of hurting Rhyperior, but it does suffice in that it is able to 2HKO most variants rather easily.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that exploit Jolteon's counters and can take advantage of its Substitute and/or Wish passing capabilities make for the best partners. Typically, Jolteon's counters tend to be certain Ground-types such as Gligar, bulky Grass-types, and special walls, so it's good to keep this in mind when selecting appropriate teammates. Also make sure that the teammates can maintain the Substitute when passed against the given threat; otherwise, it just doesn't accomplish all that much.

Teammates that can exploit bulky Grass-types and passive special walls include Escavalier, Doublade, Cobalion, Delphox, and Druddigon. All of these Pokemon can solidly switch in on the appropriate move from Roselia, Amoonguss, or Tangrowth, and then proceed to either setup or simply start ramming through the opposing team with their powerful STABs. By convenience, all of these Pokemon appreciate Jolteon's ability to pass Wishes as a result of their lack of reliable recovery and weakness to Stealth Rock in the case of Delphox. Pokemon that can take advantage of Ground-types include Braviary and Virizion. All of these Pokemon can maintain a Substitute against the likes of Gligar, whereas Virizion, in particular, is a huge nuisance to Gastrodon and Rhyperior. It should also be noted that some of these Pokemon share checks with Jolteon. For instance, Jolteon is checked by Gastrodon and Rhyperior, as is Doublade. So if your Jolteon is carrying Hidden Power Grass, it can be of great use to Doublade by luring out those two threats and 2HKOing them accordingly.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Signal Beam
move 3: Hidden Power Water
move 4: Volt Switch
ability: Volt Absorb
item: Life Orb / Choice Specs
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

As Jolteon's primary STAB, Thunderbolt works well by destroying the likes of Moltres, Slowking, as well as worn out attackers such as Drapion; Thunderbolt's solid Base Power and accuracy is what allows Jolteon to clean up rather well late-game. Signal Beam is essential in order for Jolteon to slice through most Grass-types such as Mega Abomasnow, Tangrowth, Sceptile, Rotom-C, as well as allow Jolteon to deal respectable damage to opposing Jolteon and Heliolisk. The other coverage move, Hidden Power Water, sends Rhyperior in addition to Gligar packing, making it the best Hidden Power for Jolteon. In the final slot, Volt Switch allows Jolteon to wear down many of its checks such as Registeel and Bronzong, whilst also allowing it to switch out the same turn in order for its teammates to deal with its given check; hence, the move helps enforce offensive momentum very well.

Hidden Power Grass may be used to also hit Rhyperior as well as Gastrodon if your team is more weak to it than Gligar; Hidden Power Grass is also Jolteon's best bet when it comes to dealing with Lanturn. With the aid of Choice Specs, Shadow Ball is also a good move by allowing Jolteon to snipe Mismagius and Delphox after Stealth Rock. Shadow ball also deals a considerable amount of damage to Bronzong, Gallade, Doublade, and the Gourgeist formes. Lastly, Baton Pass may be used over Volt Switch on Choice Specs variants, as it allows Jolteon to maintain momentum should a Ground-type, Volt Absorb, or Lightning Rod user attempt to switch in; Baton Pass also finds use by allowing Jolteon to escape from Focus Sash Dugtrio, which will be guaranteed to survive one of Jolteon's attacks and KO back with Earthquake.

Set Details
========

Life Orb is generally more useful despite the induced recoil, as Jolteon prefers to alternate between its coverage attacks in order to minimize switch in opportunities from the opposing team, and there's the fact that Jolteon's paltry bulk means that the costs of using Life Orb are hardly severe. On the other hand, Choice Specs gives Jolteon more immediate power, which in conjunction with Stealth Rock damage, allows Jolteon to guarantee the OHKO on Sceptile with Signal Beam, Rhyperior via Hidden Power Water, as well as offensive Drapion with Thunderbolt. Also take note that maximum Speed is necessary on this Jolteon, as it actually has a decent chance to take out other weakened Jolteon with Signal Beam.

Usage Tips
========

Jolteon is best used as a late-game sweeper or revenge killer. Thanks to its great Speed, Jolteon can be used to revenge kill many troublesome threats for slower teams such as Choice Band Braviary, Moltres, and a weakened Emboar, and Jolteon can also take advantage of its great Speed and solid coverage to sweep the opposing team late-game. Should the opponent have a Choiced Electric-type, do try to take advantage of that by having Jolteon come in and block their Electric-type moves, though do be warned that Jolteon's general frailty makes it difficult for it tank opposing Electric-types coverage and/or secondary STABs such as Rotom-C's Leaf Storm and Magneton's Flash Cannon, so it's good to have a contingency plan by having a teammate that can stomach such attacks; this help to put the opposition's Choice-locked Electric-types in a checkmate position. Jolteon may also be used for its capability to bring a teammate in safely with Volt Switch. For instance, Jolteon can typically force out the likes of Slowking and use Volt Switch as a proper response is sent in for it, such as Tangrowth; in this instance, it allows Jolteon to bring in its teammates to deal with the opposing team's check to Jolteon, such as Delphox, without having to be wary of switching in on a coverage attack or status move.

Team Options
========

Given that this set functions best when the opposing team is weakened, a few things are needed in order to make Jolteon truly shine: Stealth Rock support and powerful wallbreakers that synergize well with it. As for Stealth Rock users, Druddigon makes a very good partner, as it can deal with Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth whilst also being able to weaken specially defensive Steel-types such as Registeel and Bronzong with Fire Punch. In return, Jolteon can easily break through the physical walls that harry Druddigon such as Qwilfish and Alomomola while also weakening the likes of Rhyperior and Gligar with Hidden Power Water. A good wallbreaker that works well with Jolteon is Calm Mind Delphox. Delphox uses many of Jolteon's checks as setup bait, such as defensive Grass-types, specially defensive Aromatisse, and many more. Once Delphox breaks down the opposing team's defensive cores, Jolteon can then come in and snipe all the weakened threats one by one. VoltTurn cores consisting of Jolteon and a powerful U-turn user can be an especially frustrating combination for the opposing team to deal with. Choice Band Braviary, in particular, deals with just about every single one of Jolteon's checks and vice versa, making them an especially good pairing. Offensive Xatu also works for similar reasons, and its Magic Bounce ability can work well in keeping entry hazards off the field, thus keeping it and Jolteon from being worn down too quickly.

Other Options
########

Jolteon can be used on rain teams by utilizing the move Rain Dance to functions as a solid offensive supporter. Rain also benefits Jolteon by allowing it to use Thunder and boosting its Hidden Power Water. Speaking of alternate offensive moves, Hidden Power Ice may be used to OHKO Gligar from the get-go, as well as allow Jolteon to dent Amoonguss, Druddigon, Whimsicott, and Virizion, although Jolteon would much rather prefer Hidden Power Water or even Hidden Power Grass, as getting past Rhyperior is far too important. Toxic is an interesting option by allowing Jolteon to cripple many defensive responses that it has no chance of breaking with its standard sets, such Tangrowth, Gastrodon, and Cresselia, though the option is more of a gimmick at best and useless should Jolteon be up against a purely offensive team.

In regards to the SubPass set, there are many other options that can be used, which include Work Up, Charge Beam, Agility, and Heal Bell. Work Up can be useful by allowing Jolteon to pass Attack and Special Attack boosts to threatening mixed sweepers or wallbreakers such as Mega Abomasnow and Braviary; Charge Beam can be used over Thunderbolt as the main STAB move so that Jolteon can pass a Special Attack boost, although it makes it difficult for Jolteon to revenge kill just about anything without Thunderbolt; Agility may be used so that Jolteon can pass some useful Speed boosts to slower wallbreakers such as Exploud and Emboar; and Heal Bell works well by allowing Jolteon to rid its teammates of burns and paralysis, allowing them to play more recklessly or be used to patch up status weaknesses for various defensive cores.

Checks & Counters
########

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Pokemon with raw special bulk or Pokemon that invest highly in their Special Defense stat can all be used to take on Jolteon. These Pokemon include Aromatisse, Bronzong, Registeel, Miltank, Lickilicky, Assault Vest Escavalier, Cresselia, Meloetta, and defensive Druddigon. Take note, however, that many of these Pokemon lack reliable recovery; as such, they are prone to being worn down by repeated exposure to Volt Switches and entry hazard damage.

**Pokemon That Resist Jolteon's Moves**: Any Pokemon that has a fair amount of bulk that resists or is immune to Jolteon's primary STAB and can take either a Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Water makes for a good answer to the threat. Roselia, Amoonguss, Assault Vest Tangrowth, Dragalge, Gastrodon, Seismitoad, Lanturn, Whimiscott, and Gligar are just some of these Pokemon. Keep in mind though, that both Gastrodon and Gligar must be wary of Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Water, respectively.

**Powerful Choice Scarf, Speed Boost, and Priority Users**: Due to Jolteon's frailty and henceforth its susceptibility to priority and faster attackers, it can be KOed rather easily through a variety of methods. Choice Scarf users such as Delphox, Braviary, and Meloetta can all revenge kill Jolteon after it's been slightly weakened; Mega Banette can pick off Jolteon with Sucker Punch; Sharpedo can easily outspeed and KO Jolteon +1.
