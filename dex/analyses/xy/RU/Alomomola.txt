Overview
########

Alomomola is one of the best physical walls in the tier due to its monstrous HP, high Defense, and great defensive typing. It stands out from other walls in the tier because of its access to Regenerator and Wish, allowing it to heal itself and its teammates with ease. However, there are a lot of things keeping it from dominating the tier. Due to its horrendous attacking stats, it becomes a set-up fodder for many sweepers and hazard setters. It also has to compete with walls such as Slowking and Gastrodon because they have much more offensive presence than Alomomola. It also has a terrible Special Defense, leaving it to be destroyed by common special attackers like Jolteon and Reuniclus. All in all, however, Alomomola is one of the best support Pokemon in the tier, and should not be overlooked.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Scald
move 2: Wish
move 3: Protect
move 4: Toxic
ability: Regenerator
item: Leftovers
evs: 120 HP / 136 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Scald is a reliable, yet pitifully weak STAB move that Alomomola can use to burn physical attackers such as Doublade, Escavalier, and Rhyperior and to hit common switch ins like Amoonguss that, while taking next to no damage from the move itself, don't like the residual damage. Wish is a must on this set, letting Alomomola heal itself as well as its teammates with relative ease. Protect is used to turn Wish into reliable recovery, as well as racking up Toxic damage, scouting Choice-locked opponents, and gaining residual recovery from Leftovers. Toxic is recommended in the last slot as it puts setup sweepers such as Meloetta and Gallade on a timer, as well as letting Alomomola have a much easier time winning stall wars.

Set Details
========

The EVs increase Alomomola's overall bulk, lets it reach a Leftovers number, and turns Grass Knot from Life Orb Delphox into a 3HKO. However, a spread of 104 HP / 252 Def / 156 SpD with a Bold nature can be used to check offensive threats such as Life Orb Druddigon much better. Leftovers gives Alomomola residual recovery, which is useful when coupled with Wish and Protect. Regenerator is used to recover HP when switching and passing off Wish recovery, letting it focus less on healing itself over the course of the match. A Calm nature is used to bolster Alomomola's Special Defense as much as possible.

Usage Tips
========

Alomomola should generally be used as a physical wall, while at the same time providing Wish support to other teammates that lack reliable recovery. It also should focus on wearing down the opponent with status. It should either be trying to burn or poison the opponent, depending on whether the opponent is physically or specially oriented. The great overall bulk of Alomomola in conjunction with Regenerator means that it can switch into a lot of attackers, scout their set, and can then switch out relatively unscathed. Note that Alomomola generally kills momentum, and as such, should not be used on mainly offensive teams; it fits better on balanced or stall teams.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can take on Electric- and Grass-types are generally great teammates for Alomomola; such Pokemon include Amoonguss or Roselia, the former creating a nasty Regenerator core with Alomomola, while in return Alomomola can take on Fire- and Flying-types. The latter can use most common switch-ins to Alomomola as Spikes fodder. Pokemon such as Escavalier or Druddigon can also defeat the Pokemon that trouble Alomomola, while also providing offensive pressure due to their sheer power and good bulk. These Pokemon also appreciate Alomomola's Wish support, as they can get worn down quickly. Clerics such as Aromatisse generally go well with Alomomola to remove status with relative ease. Registeel, which forms a nice defensive core with Alomomola, counters a good portion of Grass- and Electric-types, barring Virizion, while letting Alomomola take on Fire-types trying to switch in and force Registeel out.

Other Options
########

Waterfall can be used over Scald for a bit more power, but it is generally not worth it over Scald's burn chance, despite Alomomola having a higher Attack stat. Mirror Coat can be used to hurt special attackers that can KO it. Magic Coat can be used to deflect status moves and entry hazards, and can give Alomomola an extra turn of Leftovers recovery. Healing Wish can be used on offensive teams if you need to recover win conditions or if you don't want to lose momentum while retaining its role as a defensive pivot.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Amoonguss and Roselia take minimal damage from Scald and are immune to Toxic. The latter can also shrug off a burn simply by switching out, thanks to Natural Cure. These Pokemon can threaten Alomomola in return with a super effective STAB move or, in Roselia's case, use the free turns to set up Spikes.

**Electric-types**: Heliolisk, Jolteon, and Rotom-Mow don't care about Alomomola's attacks and can set up Substitutes or simply OHKO Alomomola with their STAB moves.

**Reuniclus**: Reuniclus takes next to no damage from Scald, is immune to Toxic thanks to Magic Guard, and can set up with Calm Mind.

**Substitute**: Setup sweepers such as Substitute + Swords Dance Cobalion and Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary can set up on Alomomola as it can not inflict status on them behind Substitutes, and Alomomola is also too weak to break their Substitutes.

**Status**: Toxic cripples Alomomola, reducing its longevity and its ability to Toxic stall opponents, forcing it to either switch out frequently or rely on a cleric.
