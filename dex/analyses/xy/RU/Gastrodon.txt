Overview
########

Gastrodon is a bulky and proficient physical wall. It has a great defensive typing, leaving it with a plethora of resistances and one weakness. It has a fantastic ability in Storm Drain, giving it an immunity to Water-type moves and a Special Attack boost if hit by one. It also has access to Recover, which allows it to stay healthy throughout the match. However, Gastrodon is extremely slow and is very prone to status.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Scald
move 2: Recover
move 3: Toxic / Clear Smog / Ice Beam
move 4: Earth Power
ability: Storm Drain
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 244 Def / 12 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Scald is the STAB move of choice, and its high chance to burn allows Gastrodon to handle many physical attackers. Recover lets Gastrodon heal the HP lost from entry hazards, or status, such as poison and burn, and improves its longevity. The third move is a toss up. Toxic is the preferred choice, putting a timer on deadly walls and sweepers. Clear Smog allows Gastrodon to check many setup sweepers in the tier such as Calm Mind Reuniclus, Belly Drum Slurpuff, and Nasty Plot Cofagrigus. Ice Beam, however, lets Gastrodon hit Grass-types such as Rotom-C, Amoonguss, and Virizion super effectively. Earth Power is the secondary STAB move of choice, as its power can be boosted thanks to Storm Drain.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread with a Bold nature aims to maximize Gastrodon's physical bulk, allowing it to take on the majority of physical attackers in the tier, as well as allowing it to outspeed minimum Speed Rhyperior so it can KO with Scald or Recover before it attacks. Leftovers gives Gastrodon a way to heal passively, and can let it stall out poisoned or burned foes.

Usage Tips
========

Do not stay in Grass-types, because they will usually OHKO Gastrodon. Try not to get Gastrodon inflicted with status such as poison and burn as it has no way of curing it. Predict well, as Gastrodon is extremely slow, and it will usually move last. In addition, switch into Water-type moves to get the Storm Drain boost. Use Toxic often to cripple opponents. Likewise, use Scald often to cripple the physical attackers in the tier. Also switch into Pokemon that Gastrodon can check or counter such as Magneton, Drapion, Cobalion, Sharpedo, and Jolteon lacking Hidden Power Grass. Bear in mind that Gastrodon is somewhat weak, and it will be dealing only decent damage at best.

Team Options
========

Gastrodon fits easily onto stall and defensive teams, and because of this, bulky Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Roselia make excellent partners, taking the Grass-types aimed at it, and in return, Gastrodon can switch in on the Fire-type moves directed at them. Since Gastrodon is uninvested in Special Defense, specially defensive Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Lickilicky make excellent partners. Both of them can Wish pass, and they can also remove status that troubles Gastrodon with Aromatherapy and Heal Bell, respectively.

Other Options
########

A specially defensive EV spread can be used to let Gastrodon to check many of the special attackers in the tier such as Moltres and Yanmega lacking Giga Drain. An offensive set can also be used, but is generally outclassed by other Water-types such as Slowking and Clawitzer. Yawn can be a nice choice to force switches, though Toxic has more utility. Memento can also be used, but Gastrodon is too slow to utilize this effectively. Stockpile can be used to make Gastrodon really bulky, but it is redundant and Gastrodon is still KOed by Grass-type moves. Lastly, Mirror Coat and Counter can be used to surprise special and physical attackers, respectively.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Since Gastrodon is 4x weak to Grass-type attacks, Grass-types such as Sceptile and Amoonguss can easily KO Gastrodon with their STAB moves.

**Status**: Status such as burn and poison wear down Gastrodon out very easily as it has no way of curing it.

**Special Walls**: Special walls such as Aromatisse and Lickilicky take pitiful damage from Gastrodon's moves and can Wish pass or cure status with Aromatherapy and Heal Bell, respectively.

**Strong Special Attackers**: Strong special attackers such as Meloetta and Delphox can take advantage of Gastrodon's uninvested special bulk and KO with their powerful attacks.
