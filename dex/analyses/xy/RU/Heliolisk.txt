Overview
########
With high Speed and Special Attack stats, Heliolisk is definitely capable of hitting hard and fast. It can use Volt Switch to effectively keep up offensive momentum and is capable of revenge killing a multitude of threats. Immunities to Ghost and Water-type moves (the latter thanks to Dry Skin) mean that Heliolisk has some handy switch-in opportunities. In addition, an immunity to paralysis is wonderful for a fast and frail attacker like Heliolisk. Useful coverage moves in its arsenal such as Grass Knot mean that Heliolisk has an easier time dispatching opponents. However, Heliolisk is not without its issues - it is frail, especially on the physical side, and it faces stiff competition from Jolteon who sports greater Speed. Heliolisk's niche over Jolteon is the ability to dispatch Gastrodon, Rhyperior, and Gligar with greater ease, though aside from this, it is usually outclassed by Jolteon.

move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Grass Knot
move 4: Hidden Power Ice
ability: Dry Skin
item: Choice Specs / Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Volt Switch is a STAB attack that deals decent damage when boosted by Choice Specs and allows Heliolisk to effectively keep up or gain offensive momentum. Thunderbolt is a powerful STAB attack which can be used when it wants the extra power for a KO or doesn't want to switch out. Hidden Power Ice forms a pseudo-BoltBeam combination that lets Heliolisk hit the vast majority of Pokemon for at least neutral damage, while also nabbing damage on the Grass-types that wall its Electric-type moves. Grass Knot smacks Ground-types like Gastrodon that might try to come in on Heliolisk's Electric-type attacks.

Set Details
========
Maximum Special Attack EVs ensure optimum offensive capability, and maximum Speed investment lets Heliolisk outrun as many threats as possible. A Timid nature is preferred since Choice Specs already boosts Heliolisk's Special Attack, and Heliolisk wants all the Speed it can get. If you opt for Choice Specs, it won't take recoil damage, but you risk momentum loss if you predict incorrectly, especially if the opponent has a Ground-type. With Life Orb, this will not be as much of an issue, but it will get worn down fairly quickly, especially when Heliolisk will constantly be using Volt Switch and potentially taking damage from entry hazards each time it comes in.

Usage Tips
========
Bring Heliolisk in after a team mate has been KOed, or if you predict a Water- or Ghost-type attack. Volt Switch is going to be Heliolisk's primary choice of move, and it should be used to gain momentum whenever it is appropriate. If you predict a Ground-type switch-in, use the appropriate coverage move.

Team Options
========
Ground-types which come in on Choice-locked Volt Switches are Heliolisk's bane. Therefore, Heliolisk wants partners that can deal with said Ground-types. Pokemon such as Virizion and Bronzong can come in and threaten Ground-types like Rhyperior. Pokemon which can set up entry hazards work well in conjunction with Heliolisk, since entry hazard support helps Heliolisk attain KOs with greater ease. The aforementioned Bronzong is not only a good switch-in to Ground-type foes, but it also doubles as a user of Stealth Rock. Offensive Fire-types like Delphox are able to deal with many Pokemon that check Heliolisk, like bulky Grass-types, specially defensive Aromatisse, Bronzong, and Registeel.

Other Options
########
Focus Blast is certainly a viable coverage option that can replace Hidden Power Ice, should you wish to nail the likes of Registeel and Cobalion. Although weak, if you really dislike the idea of a Ground-type coming in and ruining your fun, U-turn could be an option solely for momentum gain. Dark Pulse could see use for hitting Pokemon such as Bronzong for super effective damage, and it has great neutral coverage alongside Focus Blast. A Choice Scarf set could see use for outpacing things that Heliolisk could not usually, though Heliolisk prefers an item that boosts its damage output. Thunder could see use for its greater damage output if a teammate provides rain support. Surf is a viable coverage option for use against Ground-types as well as for hitting Pokemon such as Delphox and Emboar super effectively.

Checks and Counters
########

**Dugtrio**: Dugtrio spells Heliolisk's doom; it outspeeds Heliolisk, is immune to Volt Switch, traps Heliolisk with Arena Trap, and can swiftly KO it with Earthquake.

**Specially Defensive Pokemon**: Specially defensive variants of Cresselia, Aromatisse, Bronzong, and Registeel fear little from Heliolisk, though the last two must be wary of Dark Pulse and Focus Blast, respectively.

**Bulky Grass-types**: Bulky Grass-types like Roselia and Amoonguss can easily take any hit from Heliolisk, even the super effective Hidden Power Ice. Also, Mega Abomasnow fears nothing from Heliolisk, save Focus Blast, and Assault Vest variants of Tangrowth have their Special Defense patched up sufficiently to take Heliolisk's attacks and retaliate with Earthquake. In addition, Virizion can take anything that Heliolisk throws at it and quickly dispose of Heliolisk with a Fighting-type STAB attack.

**Dragalge**: Dragalge's great Special Defense means it will be able to take any of Heliolisk's attacks, and it even resists all of Heliolisk's moves except for Hidden Power Ice.

**Assault Vest Escavalier**: When equipped with an Assault Vest, Escavalier will be able to tank hits from Heliolisk and can retaliate with Megahorn or Drill Run.
