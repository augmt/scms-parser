Overview
########

It's no surprise that Spiritomb finds itself back in RU after a generation thanks to its unique typing and versatility. Spiritomb's strengths lie within its resilient defenses and its above average offenses that allow it to perform many different roles. Spiritomb also has access to a wide movepool which makes it even more dangerous, and Infiltrator, which allows it to pass through Substitute. Spiritomb's typing not only resists Poison-types, but also makes it immune to Normal-, Fighting-, and Psychic-type attacks; however, Spiritomb is now weak to Fairy-types. It also suffers from having a low HP stat and crippling Speed, making it susceptible to Taunt and status. Spiritomb also lacks strong moves, having to rely heavily on Dark-type moves such as Dark Pulse and Sucker Punch to deal significant damage. Other than Nasty Plot and Calm Mind, Spiritomb does not have many useful setup moves to sweep the opponent.

Offensive Support
########
name: Offensive Support
move 1: Sucker Punch
move 2: Pursuit
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Foul Play / Taunt
ability: Infiltrator
item: BlackGlasses / Leftovers
evs: 212 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Sucker Punch is Spiritomb's strongest physical Dark STAB move that uses its Attack stat, and gives it priority to help mitigate its low Speed. Pursuit is an amazing move on Spiritomb, as it lets Spiritomb trap Psychic-types such as Meloetta, which Spiritomb can easily switch in on by virtue of its typing. Will-O-Wisp is a handy move to cripple physical attackers such as Hitmonlee and Rhyperior. Foul Play does good damage to physical attackers such as Hitmonlee, Durant, Druddigon, and Escavalier, and OHKOes +2 Doublade as well. Taunt is another option for the last slot, as Spiritomb needs it in order to have a chance at Pursuit trapping Cresselia and Calm Mind Reuniclus. It also prevents the likes of Rhyperior and Bronzong from setting up Stealth Rock.

Set Details
========

The EVs make sure that Spiritomb hits as hard as it can and has as much bulk as possible, while outspeeding uninvested Rhyperior. Black Glasses boost the power of Spiritomb's Dark-type attacks, though Leftovers is a nice option on less offensive teams to provide more longevity. Infiltrator allows Spiritomb to burn Substitute boosting Pokemon such as Braviary, Gallade, and Cobalion, as well as SubSeed Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL behind their Substitutes. Infiltrator also helps if your opponent tries to avoid Sucker Punch with Substitute.


Usage Tips
========

Spiritomb's good bulk and great typing allow it to switch in on Psychic-types, such as Meloetta and Slowking, and proceed to Pursuit trap them. Cresselia can potentially be Pursuit trapped, but Taunt is mandatory to do so. Spiritomb is able to switch into Hitmonlee rather easily and can do a nice chunk back with Foul Play or burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Spiritomb's natural bulk and typing allow it to be a great spinblocker. Should your opponent have a Pokemon that resists Dark-type moves, such as Cobalion, Drapion, or Aromatisse, using Will-O-Wisp is never a bad play since burning Pokemon such as Cobalion and Drapion is always helpful, and Aromatisse doesn't enjoy having to waste a turn to use Aromatherapy. Spiritomb can't do much to Aromatisse anyway.

Team Options
========

Aromatisse is a big threat to Spiritomb, so Poison-types such as Weezing, Roselia, and Amoonguss or Steel-types such as Escavalier make good teammates. Hone Claws Durant gets a special mention for being able to turn Aromatisse into a liability for teams by setting up on it. Hazard leads such as Cobalion, Accelgor, and Omastar appreciate Spiritomb's ability to spinblock on offensive teams. Life Orb Moltres also handles this set rather well, taking less than half from a Sucker Punch and being able to Roost off damage. As such, bulky Pokemon such as Slowking or Cresselia or fast Pokemon such as Jolteon, Sharpedo, and Heliolisk make for good teammates, as they can all take Moltres on. In return, Heliolisk and Sharpedo enjoy Spiritomb's ability to switch in to Hitmonlee. Pokemon that love Pursuit support and Doublade being dealt with make good teammates. Moltres, Delphox, and Sigilyph appreciate Psychic-types being trapped,and Swords Dance Cobalion loves Slowking and Doublade gone. The aforementioned Durant also appreciates Spiritomb's ability to deal with Doublade. In return, Cobalion can deal with Aromatisse with their Steel-type STAB moves. Choice Scarf Moltres gets a special mention, as it can U-turn on a Slowking switch-in for Spiritomb to Pursuit trap it.

Calm Mind RestTalk
########
name: Calm Mind RestTalk
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
ability: Infiltrator
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Spiritomb can take foes out easily with this RestTalk set. With Calm Mind, it can increase its Special Attack and Special Defense, boosting its offensive and defensive capabilities and enabling Spiritomb to tank hits and strike back hard. STAB Dark Pulse is used to take out enemies, and with a few Calm Minds up, it will be doing huge amounts of damage, even on resisted hits. Rest restores Spiritomb's health while it's setting up to prevent it from fainting or succumbing to status. Lastly, Sleep Talk provides Spiritomb with options while its sleeping.

Set Details
========

Spiritomb maximizes its Defense and HP to increase its longevity, and a Bold nature provides Spiritomb with a boost in Defense. Leftovers are necessary to keep Spiritomb healthy, as extra HP each turn is very valuable.

Usage Tips
========

Spiritomb plays a pivotal role as a setup sweeper. Roar, Dragon Tail, Taunt, and Trick effectively ruin this, so be sure to have teammates that can take out Pokemon that use these moves. Switch out Spiritomb in case it gets stuck against these opponents to ensure it remains intact. It's crucial to also know when to Sleep Talk to prevent losing a turn when waking up. Spiritomb needs to be able to make every move count. It is best to have a hazard setter set up Toxic Spikes to help stall out threats while setting up.

Team Options
========

Doublade, Weezing, and even Registeel make great partners to provide Spiritomb with coverage against Fairy-types. Teammates such as Dugtrio are also very useful for taking out Pokemon that may ruin the setup sweep. Dugtrio is particularly useful to thwart Cobalion from switching into Spiritomb. Clerics such as Aromatisse are heavily needed to wake Spiritomb up in case a forced switch occurs. Aromatisse is also immune to Dragon Tail and Taunt, but has a hard time against Taunt users. Aromatisse can weaken Dark- and Fighting-types as well. If Aromatisse canâ€™t be used, Special Defense Meloetta and Lickilicky can also be used for cleric support. Hazard setters are very useful as well; Roselia and Qwilfish are effective setters of them, as both resist Fairy-type moves and can lay Toxic Spikes which can stall out threats while Spiritomb sets up, allowing Spiritomb to have an easier time sweeping. Dual screen setters make setting up much easier; teammates such as Uxie and Bronzong can set up screens and then avoid damage from Dark-types by switching to Spiritomb.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Will-O-Wisp
move 2: Foul Play
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
ability: Infiltrator
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Spiritomb compensates for its lack of Attack by weakening its opponents with Will-O-Wisp, giving them burn damage and lowering their Attack. Foul Play punishes Attack boosters, effectively shutting them down. Spiritomb can use Rest to regain its health making even harder to knock out, and Sleep Talk is used to allow Spiritomb to attack even while sleeping.

Set Details
========

The nature and EV spread allows Spiritomb to maximize its HP and Defenses. Leftovers is crucial for providing Spiritomb with extra HP when it's asleep to help keep it in for as long as possible. Alternatively, a EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD can also be run with a Careful nature depending on whether you want to run a special or physical wall, though be wary that Spiritomb's resistances generally work better for physical walls.

Usage Tips
========

Spiritomb is meant to flat out annoy opponents and shield weaker teammates from hard hits. It's best to use it for getting in and out of tricky situations. For example, having Hitmonlee in a match up against a Slowking is disadvantageous; however, switching out to Spiritomb saves Hitmonlee and gives Spiritomb a chance to KO an enemy. Spiritomb is a great answer to most Fighting-types with Foul Play and Will-O-Wisp. Spiritomb's typing allows it to take a Knock Off and gives it immunity to Psychic- and Fighting-type moves, making it useful against Pokemon like Gallade.

Team Options
========

Hitmonlee is a great partner because of its strong Attack but relatively low defenses. Doublade is a strong attacker as well, but is damaged easily by a Knock Off or any Dark-type move. Spiritomb can damage and weaken many enemies, allowing its teammates to sweep. Clerics such as Aromatisse and Lickilicky are, again, valuable for passing Wishes and keeping Spiritomb alive and free of status afflictions. Roselia is also a great teammate to have because of its access to Spikes, which provides even more residual damage in addition to the damage Spiritomb causes with Will-O-Wisp.

Other Options
########

Infestation can be used in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp, or even Toxic, to quickly rack up incredible amounts of passive damage. Pursuit can then be used to punish switches caused by inflicting status ailments. Protect can also status stall in conjunction with Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. Memento can be used to give a teammate a near guaranteed setup opportunity at the cost of Spiritomb's life. Curse and Confuse Ray work in a similar vein, but aren't as reliable due to the lack of Attack and Special Attack drops that accompany the previous choices. Pain Split is a recovery move, albeit a fairly unreliable one. Psychic also works as an alternative choice for CroTomb for taking out Hitmonlee, Emboar, Spikers such as Qwilfish, and Weezing. Spite can be used in conjunction with Pressure on the defensive set to PP stall opponents. Hypnosis, despite its terrible accuracy, can also be used to stop opponents in their tracks, allowing Spiritomb to punish them with Pursuit.

Checks &amp; Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Emboar and Moltres have little problems dealing with Spiritomb, as they are immune to Will-O-Wisp and are stronger and faster than Spiritomb. Emboar can deal huge amounts of damage to Spiritomb with Flare Blitz, while Moltres can stall Spiritomb with Toxic and Roost, bypassing Sucker Punch and leaving Spiritomb trapped.

**Exploud**: Thanks to Scrappy, Exploud can strike Spritomb with Focus Blast and Boomburst easily.

**Fast Dark-type Taunters**: Drapion, Skuntank, and even Sharpedo can easily outspeed and Taunt Spiritomb. This limits Spiritomb, leaving it open to attacks and open to status inflictions.

**Fairy-types**: Aromatisse, Granbull, Slurpuff, and Whimsicott all can cause great harm to Spiritomb. Granbull works well against Spiritomb, Whimsicott can outspeed Spiritomb with Taunt or Encore, causing it to become stuck on one move. Slurpuff can set up on Spiritomb with relative ease and take it out. Aromatisse not only is immune to Taunt, but it can also wall Spiritomb without any effort, letting it revive damaged teammates unscathed.
