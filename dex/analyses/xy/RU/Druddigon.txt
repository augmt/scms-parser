Overview
########

Druddigon is an exceptional Pokemon with few, if any, real flaws. A very palpable offensive presence, a good defensive typing with resistances to several common types, respectable natural bulk, and access to support moves such Stealth Rock and Glare allow it to excel in multiple roles. That being said, it does possess a low base 48 Speed and lacks a reliable recovery move. It is also susceptible to all kinds of entry hazards. Druddigon's offensive capabilities might be formidable, but it does have some checks, although they must be wary of its coverage moves. The presence of Fairy-types impairs the effectiveness of simply spamming its powerful Outrage. All in all, Druddigon is a dominating force in RU. Note that even its aforementioned poor Speed can be bypassed with a decently powerful priority move in Sucker Punch or used to its advantage with Trick Room support.

name: BROKEN (All-Out-Attacker)
move 1: Outrage / Dragon Claw
move 2: Sucker Punch / Dragon Claw
move 3: Fire Punch
move 4: Gunk Shot
ability: Sheer Force
item: Life Orb / Choice Band
evs: 236 HP / 252 Atk / 20 Spe

Moves
========

A Life Orb or Choice Band-boosted Outrage hits like a truck, OHKOing pretty much any Pokemon that doesn't resist Dragon. Sucker Punch bypasses Druddigon's low Speed and picks off weakened or frail opponents. It is a great option on Life Orb sets, as Druddigon then does not suffer the inconvenience of being locked into Sucker Punch. If Druddigon is holding a Choice Band, Dragon Claw is the preferred option, allowing Druddigon to hit hard with a STAB move that does not prevent it from switching moves. Fire Punch is a necessary coverage move, hitting Steel- and Grass-types super effectively. Gunk Shot hits Fairy-types and is Druddigon's best option against Tangrowth. Stealth Rock can be used in the fourth moveslot if your team is hard-pressed to fit another user of the move; Druddigon's sizable offensive presence tends to give it free turns to set the entry hazard. Iron Tail can also be used here to smack Rhyperior without resorting to Outrage, while retaining super effective coverage on Aromatisse, but it has shaky accuracy and the loss in power versus Tangrowth is disappointing. It is worth noting that Life Orb Druddigon excels at using powerful coverage moves to pummel would-be checks; as such, Dragon Claw can be used over Outrage in the first moveslot, as it lets Druddigon switch moves while still being decently powerful. For example, Druddigon can freely throw out a Dragon Claw (instead of Outrage) without worrying about a possible Escavalier switch-in; if it does switch in, Druddigon can simply outspeed it and go for the OHKO with Fire Punch.

Set Details
========

252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature let Druddigon hit as hard as possible. 20 Speed EVs let Druddigon outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Registeel and Tangrowth. The remaining 236 EVs are put in HP to make the best of Druddigon's good natural bulk. The HP investment goes a long way in letting Druddigon stomach powerful neutral hits. A Life Orb powers up Druddigon's attacks while giving it the flexibility to switch moves. Sheer Force gives Druddigon's coverage moves a further 1.3x power boost, making them very difficult to switch into, and it even negates their Life Orb recoil. A Choice Band can also be equipped to give Druddigon's Outrage maximum wallbreaking power, letting it cleanly 2HKO even the bulkiest of Pokemon that do not resist it, such as Rhyperior and Alomomola.

EVs can be siphoned from HP into Speed to allow Druddigon to outspeed specific Pokemon depending on team needs. For example, 100 Speed EVs allow Druddigon to outspeed uninvested Jellicent and hit it before it attempts to land a burn with Will-O-Wisp. A Brave nature with 0 Speed EVs and IVs can be used for optimal performance under Trick Room.

Usage Tips
========

Life Orb Druddigon is a wallbreaker rather than a late-game sweeper. Maximize its utility early- to mid-game by making predictions with your coverage moves, taking note of the fact that Sheer Force makes them extra hard to switch into. Also, making trades is instrumental to effective usage. If Druddigon can put a key threat out of commission at its own expense, do not hesitate to do so, if this would facilitate a sweep by a relevant teammate later on. Do not reveal Sucker Punch from the get-go â€” try to preserve the element of surprise when using it, such as when Druddigon has KOed something and the opponent hastily sends in a weakened Pokemon to revenge kill it.

As with Life Orb Druddigon, but perhaps even more so due to its inability to switch moves, making trades with Outrage is the key to using Choice Band Druddigon effectively. If Outrage can KO a wall that inhibits a teammate from sweeping later in the game, by all means use it. On the other hand, do not spam Outrage blindly; for example, when the opponent has a healthy Steel-type such as Registeel, which is merely 4HKOed factoring in Leftovers recovery, using Outrage is ill-advised. In such cases, it would be wiser to throw out a coverage move on the predicted switch. Whatever the item held, capitalize on Druddigon's good defensive typing and natural bulk by pivoting into resisted or weaker moves. For example, Adamant Choice Scarf Emboar's Flare Blitz does a manageable 32-38% damage to Druddigon, while Choice Specs Jolteon's Thunderbolt caps out at 36% damage. This gives Druddigon more opportunities to fire off its powerful moves, paving the way for its teammates to clean up.

Team Options
========

This set is at home on more offensive builds. Escavalier has good defensive synergy with Druddigon, as it resists both Ice- and Dragon-type attacks, while Druddigon resists its one huge weakness to Fire. Also, Escavalier checks Fairy-types solidly and can use Knock Off to cripple physical walls such as Gligar, allowing Druddigon to overwhelm them later on. Powerful special attackers such as Choice Specs Moltres and Swords Dance Drapion can put the pressure on Pokemon such as Gligar and Alomomola, forming a powerful wallbreaking duo with Druddigon. With these walls gone, they can also pull off a sweep late-game. Dedicated late-game sweepers such as Sharpedo can clean up weakened teams.

Volt Switch and U-turn users are good teammates to bring Druddigon in safely. The aforementioned Moltres is again an excellent teammate in this regard, as are other wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Meloetta. Jolteon is another good partner, as Druddigon pressures many of its checks, such as Rotom-C, Amoonguss, and Lanturn. It can even use a Substitute + Baton Pass set to bring Druddigon in completely unscathed and shield it from status. Wish support from Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Alomomola is also useful to alleviate Druddigon's lack of reliable recovery. Trick Room support is very beneficial to Druddigon, turning its poor Speed into an asset. Slowking, Reuniclus, and Banette can all use the move and synergize decently with Druddigon, especially the former two. Offensive Rapid Spin users such as Kabutops and Hitmonlee give Druddigon and its teammates more flexibility in switching. On more balanced teams, Gligar is a stellar Defog user.

BROKEN ITEM x BROKEN MON (Assault Vest)
########
name: BROKEN ITEM x BROKEN MON (Assault Vest)
move 1: Dragon Claw / Outrage
move 2: Sucker Punch
move 3: Fire Punch
move 4: Gunk Shot
ability: Sheer Force
item: Assault Vest
evs: 236 HP / 252 Atk / 20 Spe

Moves
========

Dragon Claw is favored over Outrage, as it lets Druddigon switch moves while still being decently powerful. For example, Druddigon can freely throw out a Dragon Claw without worrying about a possible Escavalier switch-in; if it does switch in, Druddigon can simply outspeed it and go for the Fire Punch. Sucker Punch bypasses Druddigon's low Speed and picks off weakened or frail opponents. It is a great option on this set, as Druddigon is free to switch moves, meaning it need not suffer the inconvenience of being locked into the move, as with a Choice Band set. Fire Punch is a necessary coverage move, hitting Steel- and Grass-types super effectively. Gunk Shot hits Fairy-types and is Druddigon's best option against Tangrowth. Iron Tail can also be used here to smack Rhyperior without resorting to Outrage, but it has shaky accuracy and the loss in power versus Tangrowth is disappointing. Dragon Tail is a viable option for phazing non-Fairy-type checks and works particularly well with entry hazard support. Note that it should be used over a coverage move depending on team requirements, as having Druddigon's only STAB move be one with negative priority is an unwise choice.

Set Details
========

252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature let Druddigon hit as hard as possible. 20 Speed EVs let Druddigon outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Registeel and Tangrowth. The remaining 236 EVs are put in HP to make the best of Druddigon's good natural bulk, which goes a long way in letting Druddigon stomach powerful neutral hits. An Assault Vest makes Druddigon very bulky specially. Sheer Force gives Druddigon's coverage moves a 1.3x power boost, making them very difficult to switch into.

Usage Tips
========

Use this set as an all-out-attacker, but keep in mind that it has significantly enhanced special bulk. For example, Life Orb Jolteon's Thunderbolt does a measly 20.6% to Druddigon, while Modest Choice Specs Meloetta caps out at 53% damage with Hyper Voice. Of course, this comes at the cost of wallbreaking power, which translates mainly to Druddigon's STAB moves not packing relatively little oomph.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard removal is much appreciated; Rapid Spin users such as Kabutops and Hitmonlee can clear the field of hazards, letting Druddigon make the most of its bulk and resistances. Assault Vest Druddigon should be used on more balanced teams, making Gligar a stellar teammate. These teams are also more likely to be able to fit a Wish passer, which lets Druddigon switch in to wreak havoc multiple times during a match. Alomomola and Aromatisse are prime candidates for the role.

OVERPOWERED Rocks (Stealth Rock)
########
name: OVERPOWERED Rocks (Stealth Rock)
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Dragon Claw
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Fire Punch
ability: Rough Skin
item: Leftovers
evs: 236 HP / 252 Atk / 20 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

With its natural bulk and formidable offensive presence, Druddigon is an effective Stealth Rock setter and is often able to set the entry hazard more than once in a match. Dragon Claw is a reliable, moderately powerful STAB move, doing respectable damage to most neutrally hit targets. It is chosen over the stronger Outrage because this set is not meant to wallbreak, and Outrage's lock-in effect is more often undesirable than not. Sucker Punch is a useful move to bypass Druddigon's poor Speed, picking off frail or weakened opponents looking to finish it off. Fire Punch is a necessary coverage move that hits Steel- and Grass-types super effectively. Gunk Shot can also be used in this slot to maim the obnoxiously common Aromatisse, but this makes Druddigon near complete setup fodder for Doublade. If your team has another Stealth Rock user, a couple of other viable options can be used: Glare to cripple faster foes or Toxic to wear down bulky switch-ins. Two especially notable targets of Toxic are Alomomola and Gligar.

Set Details
========

252 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature let Druddigon hit as hard as possible. 20 Speed EVs let Druddigon outspeed uninvested base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Registeel and Tangrowth. The remaining 236 EVs are put in HP to make the best of Druddigon's good natural bulk. The HP investment goes a long way in letting Druddigon stomach powerful neutral hits. Leftovers provides useful passive healing; it is a good item choice given Druddigon's natural bulk and lack of reliable recovery. Rough Skin provides useful chip damage on a number of physical attackers. Sheer Force can also be used, especially if you opt to carry Gunk Shot over Sucker Punch.

Usage Tips
========

Lead with Druddigon, or bring it in via double switching or on weaker hits. Oftentimes you will need to set Stealth Rock up multiple times in a match and Druddigon has to be healthy to do so.

Team Options
========

Offensive Steel-types such as Escavalier and Durant have good defensive synergy with Druddigon and fit with the offensive motif of the teams this set is at home on. Fire-types such as Moltres and Emboar pressure the bulky Steel-types that Druddigon is unable to break. Offensive Rapid Spin users such as Kabutops and Hitmonlee give Druddigon and its teammates more flexibility in switching. If your team can fit it, a Wish passer can let Druddigon switch in to set Stealth Rock multiple times throughout a match. Alomomola and Aromatisse are prime candidates for the role, but note that they compromise your offensive momentum and should not be used on fully offensive builds.

TOUCHING IT WILL KILL YOU (Defensive)
########
name: TOUCHING IT WILL KILL YOU (Defensive)
move 1: Glare
move 2: Dragon Tail / Dragon Claw
move 3: Rest / Stealth Rock
move 4: Sleep Talk / Fire Punch
ability: Rough Skin
item: Leftovers / Rocky Helmet
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

The newly-buffed Glare is now a fully accurate paralysis move that Druddigon is fortunate enough to receive. In conjunction with Druddigon's bulk and access to Dragon Tail, it often allows Druddigon to paralyze multiple opponents. Dragon Tail is a decently powerful STAB move that also phazes the opponent, racking up residual damage quickly, especially if backed up by entry hazard support. Dragon Claw can also be used if you feel that Glare is counterintuitive with Dragon Tail's negative priority. Rest makes up for Druddigon's lack of reliable recovery. Paired with a cleric, it increases Druddigon's longevity hugely. Sleep Talk should always be used with Rest; it allows Druddigon to spread paralysis and phaze even while asleep. Alternatively, Stealth Rock is a viable option if your team cannot fit it elsewhere; this Druddigon is a very sturdy user of the move. Fire Punch can also be used to nail Escavalier and hit other Steel-types that take a pittance from Dragon Tail. Earthquake is yet another usable coverage move that hits Magneton harder than Fire Punch, but it misses out on Escavalier and Durant.

Set Details
========

252 EVs are placed in both HP and Special Defense with a Careful nature in order to take advantage of Druddigon's resistances to specially based attacking types such as Fire and Electric. However, a physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with an Impish nature is equally viable, especially if used with a Rocky Helmet. This spread allows Druddigon to stand up to the tier's most powerful physical attackers: Adamant Reckless Life Orb Hitmonlee fails to KO Druddigon with High Jump Kick even after it has taken Stealth Rock damage! Leftovers provides useful passive healing; it is a good item choice given Druddigon's natural bulk and lack of reliable recovery. A Rocky Helmet is another viable option to punish physical attackers. Rough Skin provides useful chip damage on a number of physical attackers and works brilliantly in tandem with Rocky Helmet. Opponents will lose a cumulative 29% of their HP simply by hitting Druddigon with a contact move such as Rapid Spin, U-turn, or Knock Off. Note that these effects do not apply to physical non-contact moves such as Earthquake.

Usage Tips
========

Spread paralysis and phaze opponents, but do not be excessive in doing so. Keep Druddigon healthy; do not let it get weakened to the point where it is unable to switch in later in the match. This set is a good check to special attackers such as Moltres and Delphox at any point in the game, so long as it is reasonably healthy. It is also a great switch-in to most Grass-types in the tier, such as Amoonguss and Rotom-C, as RestTalk renders it effectively immune to status ailments.

Team Options
========

Cleric support from Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Roselia is very useful for awakening a Resting Druddigon. Entry hazard support is necessary to complement Druddigon's parashuffling shenanigans. In addition to Stealth Rock, Spikes support from Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Ferroseed, and the aforementioned Roselia is highly recommended. Wish support is highly recommended to alleviate Druddigon's lack of reliable recovery if it is not carrying Rest. Aromatisse and Alomomola are good users of the move. It is advised to pack a hard-hitting teammate or two that can take advantage of the paralysis support Druddigon provides. Choice Band Rhyperior, Escavalier, and Swords Dance Drapion are excellent examples of such Pokemon. A teammate that can stomach Ice-type moves that Druddigon dislikes is welcome. Slowking is an excellent partner that can also phaze opponents with Dragon Tail. Just note that Druddigon's paralysis spreading can clash with Scald's burn chance, and that Mega Abomasnow, the most common and threatening user of Ice-type moves, beats bulky Water-types one-on-one. Teammates such as Cobalion and Moltres fare well against Mega Abomasnow's STAB moves, even if the former must watch out for Earthquake and the latter despises Stealth Rock.

Other Options
########

Druddigon can opt to use a couple of alternative coverage moves. On the Choice Band, Life Orb, and Assault Vest sets, Aqua Tail can be used if Rhyperior is an issue. Crunch provides Druddigon with a more reliable way of hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types, although in most cases, Sucker Punch's priority proves more useful. Substitute can be used on the Life Orb set to ease prediction, but it comes at the cost of valuable coverage.

Checks & Counters
########

**Gligar**: Gligar possesses reliable recovery in Roost and is not 2HKOed by Choice Band-boosted Outrage provided Stealth Rock is not up. Be wary of Knock Off from Druddigon's teammates though, as a Gligar without its Eviolite is 2HKOed by Outrage from even the Life Orb set.

**Revenge Killing**: While this is not a "check" by definition, Druddigon is very susceptible to being revenge killed due to its low Speed and tendency to be locked into Outrage. It can bypass its Speed issues to an extent with Sucker Punch, but any reasonably healthy offensive threat that isn't weak to Dark can pick off offensive Druddigon sets from over 50% health.

**Fairy-types**: Granbull, Aromatisse, Slurpuff, and Togetic are immune to Dragon-type moves and beat all Druddigon sets without Gunk Shot.

**Steel-types**: Registeel, Doublade, Escavalier, and Bronzong resist Druddigon's STAB moves, but they must watch out for Fire Punch or Earthquake from Life Orb sets.

**Bulky Water-types**: With Wish, Protect, and a superior Speed tier, Alomomola beats all Druddigon sets one-on-one, although it barely avoids the 2HKO from Choice Band Druddigon's Outrage. Jellicent and Gastrodon are other bulky Water-types with reliable recovery and can check Druddigon not carrying Outrage.

**Cresselia**: Cresselia beats most sets but is 2HKOed by Choice Band-boosted Outrage.

**Weezing**: Will-O-Wisp allows Weezing to check offensive sets, but it cannot switch in on Outrage at all.
