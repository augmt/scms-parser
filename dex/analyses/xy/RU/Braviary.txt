Overview
########

With its good Attack and solid coverage against the RU metagame, Braviary is one of the strongest physical Flying-types in RU. Its wide movepool, consisting of moves such as Brave Bird, Superpower, Roost, and Bulk Up, along with its decent bulk allows it to run several sets effectively, such as All-out Attacker sets and Substitute + Bulk UP. Defiant also allows it to take advantage of Defog and Intimidate, making it a good choice for Sticky Web and other entry hazard-reliant teams. However, Braviary has lackluster Speed, causing it to get outsped by most offensive Pokemon. It also has trouble handling prominent Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhyperior, Steelix, and Doublade.

Physical Attacker
########
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Return
move 3: Superpower
move 4: U-turn / Roost
ability: Defiant
item: Choice Band / Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Brave Bird is Braviary's most reliable STAB move, having good coverage on the RU metagame. Return is a solid secondary STAB move that covers Electric-types and can be used when you can't afford to take recoil from Brave Bird. Superpower is a decent coverage move for Rock- and Steel-types. It doesn't do much damage to most Rock- and Steel-types outside of Kabutops and Aurorus, but it still helps wear them down. U-turn is great for grabbing momentum as well as bringing in frail sweepers safely. It also helps Braviary wear down and switch out of checks such as Steelix and Rhyperior. Roost is a decent option if you opt for Life Orb, as it heals off damage taken from Brave Bird, Life Orb, Stealth Rock, and weaker attacks. However, Braviary won't get many opportunities to heal up in a heated match. Shadow Claw hits Bronzong and Doublade harder than any other move on this set; however, it's usually better to U-turn out and let Braviary's teammates deal with Doublade.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment in Attack and Speed allows Braviary to hit as hard and fast as possible. An Adamant nature gives it the power needed to break down walls. Choice Band has no recoil and almost guarantees a 2HKO on Alomomola after Stealth Rock damage. However, Life Orb allows Braviary to switch moves while still getting KOs on less defensive Pokemon; it is also the better option if you are using Braviary on a Sticky Web team.

Usage Tips
========

This set is used to break down walls and balanced teams. It is best to remove Stealth Rock from the field before sending in Braviary. U-turn should be used to wear down Braviary's checks and gain momentum. Superpower should only be used on predicted switches and weakened Rock- and Steel-types. Once all Pokemon that resist Flying on the opposing team are gone, feel free to spam Brave Bird.

Team Options
========

Dugtrio makes for an excellent partner, as Braviary can U-turn into Dugtrio on the switch and trap Braviary's checks, such as Registeel and Cobalion. Sticky Web support from Kricketune is very useful, mitigating Braviary's lackluster Speed and opening up sweeping possibilities against more offensive teams. In return, Braviary can deter Defoggers with Defiant. Entry hazard users such as Mesprit, Qwilfish, Omastar, and Crustle also partner well with Braviary. Stealth Rock and Spikes, along with U-turn, can really rack up damage on Braviary's counters. Spinners and Defoggers can remove Stealth Rock for Braviary. Hitmonlee and Hitmontop are good examples, as they can take care of most of Braviary's counters. Togetic can also remove entry hazards while providing cleric support. Other Flying-types such as Fletchinder and Swellow can weaken counters for Braviary to sweep, or vice versa. Grass-types such as offensive Tangrowth and defensive Rotom-C handle Rhyperior and Steelix well. Torterra is a more niche option, but it works well against Doublade. Meloetta and Exploud can lure in checks such as Rhyperior and Registeel and weaken or KO them with their respective coverage moves. Pokemon such as Meloetta, Heliolisk, Jolteon, Cobalion, and Rotom-C can bring Braviary in safely with U-turn or Volt Switch; they also make a great VoltTurn core with Braviary. Finally, Seismitoad can switch into most of Braviary's checks thanks to its great bulk and proceed to burn or KO them.

Substitute + Bulk Up
########
name: Substitute + Bulk Up
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Bulk Up
move 3: Roost
move 4: Brave Bird
ability: Defiant
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 212 SpD / 44 Spe
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Substitute protects Braviary from status and eases prediction. Bulk Up boosts Attack and Defense, making Braviary harder to break while preparing it for a sweep. Roost is reliable, mandatory recovery, healing off damage taken from Substitute, Brave Bird, and opposing attacks. Brave Bird is a strong, reliable STAB move with good coverage in the metagame; also, no Pokemon is immune to it, unlike Return.

Set Details
========

Leftovers lets Braviary recover a bit of health every turn and makes up for the HP lost from making Substitutes. Maximum HP investment is used so that Registeel can't break Braviary's Substitute with Seismic Toss. 44 Speed EVs let Braviary outspeed and set up on Cresselia. The remaining EVs go in Special Defense alongside a Careful nature, allowing Braviary to set up on weaker special attackers such as Amoonguss, Aromatisse, and Seismitoad. Special Defense is invested in instead of Defense because Bulk Up already patches up Braviary's Defense. Running 160 Speed EVs is an option if you want to get the jump on Exploud.

Usage Tips
========

Watch out for phazers such as Rhyperior and Steelix. Try to keep Braviary away from sound moves from Pokemon such as Exploud, Meloetta, and Aurorus. It's a good idea to remove Stealth Rock before attempting a sweep. Try not to directly switch into defensive Pokemon carrying status moves, such as Cresselia and Registeel. Rock-, Electric-, and Ice-types, as well as phazers, should be gone or severely weakened before attempting a sweep.

Team Options
========

Clerics such as Audino and Aromatisse make for great partners, as they can give Braviary a second chance to sweep if it gets statused. Toxic Spikes support from Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Omastar is great, as it helps weaken Pokemon in preparation for a sweep and allows Braviary to stall out the opponent's team with the combination of Substitute and Roost. Rapid Spin and Defog support from Pokemon such as Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, and Togetic is great to have, as Braviary doesn't appreciate Stealth Rock. Rhyperior checks most Rock- and Electric-types, scares away most defensive Steel-types with STAB Earthquake, and can set up Stealth Rock for the team. Meloetta and Exploud can weaken or KO most Rock- and Steel-types with their coverage moves. Seismitoad makes for a great partner thanks to its ability to burn or KO most of Braviary's checks. Finally, Grass-types such as Rotom-C and offensive Tangrowth can take care of Rhyperior and Steelix.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Brave Bird
move 2: Return
move 3: Superpower
move 4: U-turn
ability: Defiant
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Brave Bird is Braviary's strongest STAB move and has good coverage on the metagame. Return is a reliable secondary STAB move that covers Electric-types and doesn't make Braviary take recoil damage, unlike Brave Bird. Superpower helps weaken Rock- and Steel-types. U-turn wears down checks and helps gain momentum.

Set Details
========

The EVs are self-explanatory. Choice Scarf turns Braviary into a good revenge killer and gives it a much-needed Speed boost. A Jolly nature allows it to outspeed and revenge kill Jolteon.

Usage Tips
========

This set is used to revenge kill weakened Pokemon as well as frailer offensive Pokemon. This set can also sweep the opponent's team late-game. Try to keep Stealth Rock off the field during the match, as it can hinder Braviary greatly. Use U-turn to gain momentum and wear down Braviary's checks. Don't attempt to revenge kill healthy Pokemon, as Braviary isn't very strong without a boost and thus won't be able to KO sometimes. Try not to switch into Scald if possible; however, you can play recklessly with Braviary if you have a cleric.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Mesprit, Qwilfish, Omastar, and Crustle is especially important for this set, as it helps get crucial residual damage that can mean the difference between an OHKO and a 2HKO. Bulky Fighting-, Water-, and Ground-types can take on most of Braviary's checks. Examples include Hitmontop and Alomomola, the latter of which can also provide Wish support, and Seismitoad, which is also a great check to most Rock- and Steel-types, switching in with little to fear and threatening to burn or KO. Grass-type Pokemon such as defensive Rotom-C and offensive Tangrowth can take care of Rhyperior and Steelix. Wallbreakers such as Meloetta, Emboar, and Exploud can weaken Braviary's checks to pave the way for a late-game sweep. Rapid Spin or Defog support is appreciated to remove Stealth Rock from the field. Examples of Pokemon that can provide this support include Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, and Togetic.

Other Options
########

Defog is a great support option, but Braviary just can't find a place for it on one of its sets. An offensive SubRoost set is somewhat viable, allowing it to PP stall and heal itself while maintaining offensive pressure. Toxic allows Braviary to cripple and wear down defensive Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Alomomola. Finally, a mixed set with Sheer Force and Heat Wave has a chance of 2HKOing Doublade, but otherwise, it is outclassed by Braviary's other sets.

Checks & Counters
########

**Doublade**: Braviary can't do anything to Doublade outside of using Shadow Claw, which still does little damage. In return, Doublade can threaten with set up and easily defeat Braviary, especially if it's using Sacred Sword. 

**Rock- and Steel-types**: Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhyperior, Tyrantrum, Steelix, Registeel, and Bronzong can take most hits from Braviary and either set up Stealth Rock, status it, or hit it hard. However, the latter two are setup bait for the Substitute + Bulk Up set, and all of them should be wary of U-turn.

**Electric-types**: Jolteon and Rotom-C can outspeed and OHKO non-Choice Scarf Braviary with their respective STAB moves. Choice Scarf Rotom-C can still outspeed Choice Scarf Braviary.

**Unaware Quagsire**: Quagsire can take hits from most of Braviary's sets and retaliate with Scald or set up with Curse. However, the Choice Band set can break through it, and Quagsire only manages to PP stall the Substitute + Bulk Up set if it doesn't carry Curse.

**Infiltrator Users**: Pokemon with Infiltrator such as Golbat and Spiritomb bypass Braviary's Substitute, can inflict status on it, and don't take much damage from Brave Bird. However, they must be switched in before Braviary attains too many boosts.
