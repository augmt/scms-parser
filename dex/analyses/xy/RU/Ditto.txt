Overview
########

Ditto is one of the most versatile Pokemon in RU, being able to hold its own against all kinds of Pokemon. With its signature ability, Imposter, Ditto can transform into any Pokemon. It copies the opposing Pokemon's stats, EVs, typing, ability, and appearance when switching in, making it a deadly copy of the opponent, although Ditto will retain its own HP stat. Ditto's main function is to be an effective stop to setup sweepers. With its ability and Choice Scarf, Ditto can copy boosts from sweepers and outspeed them to take them out. Imposter also serves as a way to help scout the opposing team's Pokemon. This is important when dealing with unpredictable Pokemon such as Meloetta and Whimsicott, which have a variety of movesets. Imposter also allows Ditto to provide utility to its team by either becoming a hazard setter or a Heal Bell user. However, even with Ditto's amazing ability, it still has its flaws. If Ditto switches in after the opposing Pokemon has set up a Substitute, Ditto is completely shut down as Imposter fails to activate. Therefore, Substitute sweepers have no problem taking out Ditto. Ditto also has a hard time dealing with bulky set up sweepers such as Calm Mind Reuniclus and Curse Registeel. Furthermore, Ditto gains no boosts from abilities such as Unburden, and as Ditto uses Choice Scarf, an opposing Pokemon with Unburden activated will outspeed it. That being said, these tiny setbacks aren't enough to stop this imperfect clone from giving the real deal a run for its money.

Imposter
########
name: Imposter
move 1: Transform
ability: Imposter
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Relaxed

Moves
========

Transform is the only move Ditto learns, but this move is useless since its ability will automatically transform Ditto into the opposing Pokemon.

Set Details
========

It's best to run Ditto with a spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SDef; this is to ensure that in the unlikely case that Ditto is either against another Ditto or a Substitute, it can sustain itself for a bit. The HP EVs also maximize Ditto's HP while putting it at an odd number, allowing it one extra switch in against entry hazards if Ditto is left unscathed from other damage. Choice Scarf is important for Ditto's success as it allows Ditto to outspeed almost any Pokemon and lets it revenge kill sweepers easily. A Relaxed nature is needed in the event that Ditto cannot transform because of a Substitute or it encounters another untransformed Ditto. The boost in Defense helps improve survivability slightly if Ditto can't transform, and the decrease in Speed will allow it to win a stall war against other Ditto. Ditto can also run various IV spreads to maximize its damage for Hidden Powers. Hidden Power Fire is great for taking out Durant, Escavalier, and even Doublade. Hidden Power Water is great because it has wide coverage against Rhyperior, Dugtrio, and Gligar as well. Additionally, Hidden Power Grass can also be used to take out foes like Gastrodon that only have one weakness. 

Usage Tips
========

It's best to use Ditto as a revenge killer and to let it take advantage of Pokemon that have set up. It can also become a counter sweeper if it copies a set up sweeper. It's also a given that players need to be careful when switching in Ditto. If Ditto were to switch into a Tyrantrum and get attacked by the opposing Tyrantrum's Dragon-type STAB move, Ditto would faint easily. However, if the Ditto player has a Magmortar against a Jellicent, Ditto can come in, become Jellicent, and take any Water-type move from Jellicent if it runs Water Absorb. Another example is having a Flying-type switch to Ditto against a Stone Edge, and resisting it if the opposing Pokemon is resistant to Rock-type moves, like Cobalion. When transformed, Choice Scarf Ditto is limited to one move with lowered PP; once Ditto uses all these PP, Ditto will be forced to use Struggle and take heavy recoil damage, while the opposing Pokemon will have access to a full moveset. Having said that, switching out is key when low on PP. The most important rule when using Ditto is to never send it out on a Substitute, unless you're using it as death fodder. Ditto can also be useful when it transforms into a Pokemon with a support move, allowing it to act as an entry hazard setter, Heal Bell cleric, spinner, or Defogger, depending on the opposing Pokemon.

Team Options
========

Almost any Pokemon can be a teammate to Ditto, especially heavily offensive teammates that can pressure opponents enough that they won't set up Substitutes. Pokemon such as Exploud and Meloetta do not care about Substitutes at all. Moves like Boomburst and Hyper Voice make the opponent want to switch out as even if they use a Substitute, they're still going to get damaged. Bulky Poison-type teammates such as Amoonguss and Skuntank work well as they can get rid of Toxic Spikes and allow Ditto to switch out if it's in danger of getting poisoned. Additional teammates such as Mega Banette or other Prankster users can help stop Substitute, but may stop set ups which benefit Ditto.

Other Options
########

There are few options that Ditto can effectively utilize. Choice Scarf and Imposter are really the only way to run Ditto well. Changing Ditto's IVs allows you to maximize the the damage for Hidden Powers. Alternatively, if Ditto is to use a Focus Sash, there needs to be heavy emphasis on having anti-hazard Pokemon on your team; this is to ensure that Ditto's health remains intact and to ensure Ditto can switch in and counter sweep. Focus Sash allows Ditto to survive one hit and it frees Ditto to use all of the opponent's moves, rather than being restricted to one move because of Choice Scarf's effect.

Checks & Counters
########

**Substitute**: Substitute will stop Ditto in its tracks as it makes sure Ditto can't turn into another Pokemon.

**Hazards**: Toxic Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Spikes can all chip away at Ditto, which might need to come in and out repeatedly due to its Choice Scarf.

**Bulky Setup Sweepers**: Pokemon such as Calm Mind Reuniclus and Unburden Slurpuff give Ditto a run for its money. Reuniclus can take lots of hits and fire back with more moves than Ditto can, while Unburden allows Slurpuff to outspeed Ditto once it's activated.

**Trick Room**: In Trick Room, Ditto will have a hard time as its Choice Scarf will cause it to move slower than the opponent, which is troublesome since Ditto usually needs to be faster than its foes to take them out.
