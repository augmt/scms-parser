Overview
########

Ditto can automatically transform into the opposing Pokemon upon switching in, copying their moves, nature, EVs, and any stat boosts. However, Ditto does not copy their HP, meaning that it has to live with a horrible base 48 HP. Ditto also can't transform into Pokemon behind Substitutes. However, the main draw of using Ditto is that it can transform into an opposing sweeper and take their boosts to turn the situation against the opponent, a strategy that appreciates Choice Scarf, which can make sure that Ditto outspeeds its foe. Ditto still loses to most Calm Mind or Bulk Up sweepers, as they can beat Ditto one on one with their higher HP stat. Ditto is almost completely useless against stall teams besides sometimes using utility moves such as Defog or Heal Bell. Another problem Ditto faces is that the moves it copies only have 5 PP, meaning it can be PP stalled, especially as it almost always holds a Choice Scarf.

Imposter
########
name: Imposter
move 1: Transform
move 2:
move 3:
move 4:
ability: Imposter
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 Def
nature: Relaxed

Moves
========

Transform is literally the only move Ditto learns, but it is also useless because Imposter does everything it does except automatically, making it just filler.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs give Ditto an entry hazard damage number, and investing in HP is important, as HP is the only stat Ditto keeps when it transforms. 252 Defense EVs and a Relaxed nature make sure that Ditto will underspeed other Dittos in a stall war and take less damage from their Struggle. Choice Scarf allows Ditto to outspeed non-Choice Scarf opponents after transforming into them. Ditto's IVs can be tweaked for certain Hidden Powers, such as 30 Defense IVs, 30 Special Defense IVs, and 1 Speed IV for Hidden Power Rock to hit Moltres and Fletchinder, or 30 Defense IVs, 30 Special Attack IVs, and 1 Speed IV for Hidden Power Grass to hit Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Rhyperior.

Usage Tips
========

Never send in Ditto against a Pokemon behind a Substitute unless you are using it as fodder because it cannot do anything back. Be cautious of switching Ditto into Pokemon that can potentially hit hard, either because of a super-effective move in the case of transforming into Druddigon or having high offenses versus low defenses in Dugtrio's case. Use Ditto to revenge kill dangerous set up sweepers, although Ditto's presence can act as a deterrent from attempts at setting up. Ditto should not be used to revenge kill bulky sweepers such as Calm Mind Spiritomb or Reuniclus because defensive boosts mean that Ditto will lose, as it only has base 48 HP. Ditto can have some utility against more defensive teams by coming in and setting or removing entry hazards or by acting as a cleric. Remember that Ditto can be used to scout opposing movesets on more versatile Pokemon, although Ditto should not be switching in purely to scout for moves.

Team Options
========

Ditto is best used as a glue and it can work on many teams, but is best used with offensive teammates that also have problems with set up sweepers. Ditto appreciates entry hazard removal to increase its longevity, as it is susceptible to all entry hazards, and it also appreciates the setting of entry hazards to help it if it ever attempts to counter sweep. Partners that can annoy Substitute sweepers, such as Golbat or Exploud, are good partners as Ditto cannot get past Substitute alone. Partners such as Pangoro and Exploud work well with Ditto because they can wallbreak against stall, an archetype Ditto is not very useful against.


Other Options
########

Focus Sash gives Ditto the option of counter sweeping while also being able to switch moves, but it requires entry hazard removal as a result and can stll potentially lose to priority users. Other Hidden Power types can also be used, such as Hidden Power Fire for Escavalier and Abomasnow, Hidden Power Ground, for Magneton and Jolteon, and Hidden Power Flying for Virizion.

Checks & Counters
########

**Defensive Pokemon**: Pokemon such as Slowking, Amoonguss, and Aromatisse won't mind their own attacks much and can easily stall Ditto out of its 5 PP with their recovery moves.

**Bulky Setup Sweepers**: Bulky setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Meloetta, Virizion, and Curse Registeel can tank Ditto's attacks thanks to their boosted defenses, and then hit Ditto back hard by virtue of its base 48 HP and inability to change moves while holding Choice Scarf.

**Substitute**: Ditto cannot transform into Pokemon behind a Substitute, so as long as the opposing Pokemon is behind a Substitute, Ditto is rendered useless.
