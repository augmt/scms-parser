Overview
########

Despite its NU status, Seismitoad is still a solid choice in RU. Between Seismitoad's excellent Water / Ground typing, its only weakness being Grass, and its decent 105 / 75 / 75 bulk, Seismitoad is very capable of taking hits. Seismitoad's bulk is bolstered by its ability, Water Absorb, which grants it an immunity to Water-type moves, as well as healing it by 25% when it is hit by one. With Seismitoadâ€™s good bulk and ability, it is able to effectively check common Pokemon, such as Kabutops and Doublade. While Gastrodon has identical typing, similar bulk, ability, and access to Recover, Seismitoad has something Gastrodon does not: access to the ever-important Stealth Rock. Offensively, Seismitoad isn't to be sniffed at, as its STAB moves in conjunction with Sludge Bomb give it near-perfect coverage.

While Seismitoad may only have one weakness, it is 4x weak to it, and this is only made worse as Grass-types resist Seismitoad's STAB types and are fairly common in RU. Seismtoad's base Attack is higher than its Special Attack, yet Seismitoad lacks any physical Water-type STAB moves to make use of this. This forces offensive Seismitoad to utilize its weaker Special Attack. However, Seismitoad's special movepool isn't perfect either, as it misses out on Ice Beam and has to use Sludge Bomb in order to hit Grass-types. Seismitoad also has no access to reliable recovery, leaving it prone to being worn down by status and entry hazards damage.

Offensive Stealth Rock
########
name: Offensive Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Hydro Pump / Scald
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Sludge Bomb
ability: Water Absorb
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
evs: 164 HP / 252 SpA / 92 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Stealth Rock provides the utility of wearing down the opponent each time they switch in. Hydro Pump is used as a strong STAB Water-type attack. Scald can be used, as even though it is weaker, it has no chance to miss and a high chance to burn. Earth Power is a secondary STAB attack that OHKOes Doublade. Sludge Bomb provides coverage against Grass- and Fairy-types such as Virizion and Aromatisse. Knock Off is a viable replacement for Sludge Bomb, as it has the utility of removing the opponents' items.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature allows Seismitoad to hit as hard as possible. 92 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Gligar, and the rest of the EVs are put in HP to add bulk. A Life Orb adds to Seismitoad's damage output, while Leftovers can be used for passive recovery. If Knock Off is used, it is still recommended to use a Modest nature so that neither Seismitoad's bulk nor its Speed is decreased. Water Absorb is the ability of choice, as it grants Seismitoad an immunity to Water-type attacks.

Usage Tips
========

Seismitoad works well as a pivot into Water-type attacks, due to its ability to regain health with Water Absorb. Seismitoad can also switch in on Choice-locked Pokemon such as Delphox and Pyroar and set up Stealth Rock for free by forcing a switch.

Team Options
========

Pokemon such as Delphox and Escavalier that can provide coverage against Grass-types are great partners, as they have good type synergy with Seismitoad. Moltres, in particular, is a good partner as it has good offensive synergy with Seismitoad. Doublade and Spiritomb can spinblock Rapid Spin users, such as Hitmonlee. Braviary can switch in on Defog and get a boost from Defiant.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Scald
move 3: Earth Power / Earthquake
move 4: Toxic / Knock Off
ability: Water Absorb
item: Leftovers
evs: 216 HP / 200 Def / 92 Spe
nature: Bold / Relaxed

Moves
========

Stealth Rock wears down the opponent each time they switch in, making it a good utility move. Scald has a chance to burn and is a good STAB move. Earthquake hits special walls a lot harder than Earth Power, but it can't 2HKO Doublade without the use of Knock Off. Toxic catches Seismitoad's checks and counters on the switch and cripples them. Knock Off can also be used, as it gets rid of the foe's item.

Set Details
========

Water Absorb is the chosen ability as it grants Seismitoad an immunity to Water-type attacks while regenerating its health, which is ideal for a defensive Pokemon. Leftovers provide passive recovery. 92 Speed EVs allow Seismitoad to outspeed minimum Speed base 85 Speed Pokemon, allowing it to better check Gligar as well as use Toxic on Cresselia before Cresselia can use Substitute. 216 HP EVs add on to Seismitoad's bulk, and the rest are added into Defense to allow Seismitoad to take physical hits as well as possible. A Bold nature boosts Defense, but a Relaxed nature should be used with Earthquake.

Usage Tips
========

This set's main objective is to set up Stealth Rock. Toxic should be used to cripple potential switch-ins, and Seismitoad should try to spread burns with Scald and check Pokemon such as Doublade. Seismitoad should be kept healthy throughout the match and not be used as a suicide lead.

Team Options
========

Amoonguss is a good partner, as it can easily switch into Grass-types, while Seismitoad can take Fire-type attacks in return. Pokemon like Delphox and Escavalier that can beat Grass-types, as well as defensive Pokemon such as Aromatisse that provide cleric and Wish support, are advised as they can increase Seismitoad's longevity. Roselia is a good partner as it can stack Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which puts huge pressure on the opponent.

Swift Swim
########
name: Swift Swim
move 1: Hydro Pump / Scald
move 2: Earth Power
move 3: Sludge Wave
move 4: Rain Dance
ability: Swift Swim
item: Life Orb / Damp Rock
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Hydro Pump is a STAB attack that hits ridiculously hard in rain. Scald is an option if Hydro Pump's accuracy is a concern; however, the power difference is very noticeable. Earth Power is a secondary STAB move that provides good coverage. Sludge Wave is used for coverage against Grass-types such as Virizion. Rain Dance sets up rain and activates Swift Swim. Stealth Rock is an option if your team does not already has a Stealth Rock setter, but Rain Dance is generally more useful.

Set Details
========

A Life Orb is used to increase the damage output of Seismitoad's attacks; however, a Damp Rock can be used to increase the duration of Rain Dance. Swift Swim doubles Seismitoad's Speed in rain, and 252 Speed EVs allow Seismitoad to outspeed the entire unboosted tier in rain. 252 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature maximize Seismitoad's Special Attack, allowing it to hit as hard as possible.

Usage Tips
========

Seismitoad should not be sent out to sweep until most of its checks and counters, such as Amoonguss and Slowking, are fainted or weakened to the point where Seismitoad can finish them off, as they can easily tank a hit from Seismitoad and retaliate. As soon as Rain Dance has been set up by a teammate, Seismitoad should be switched in, preferably with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. Seismitoad should be used as a late-game cleaner, as it is not a smart idea to start off the match with Seismitoad.

Team Options
========

Rain Dance setters such as Prankster Liepard and Uxie make for good partners. Uxie can use a slow U-turn to get Seismitoad in safely and Yawn to force a switch. Other Swift Swim users such as Omastar can benefit from the rain. Amoonguss can hit Grass-types for Seismitoad and enjoys the rain as it weakens Fire-type attacks. Flying-types, such as Moltres and Fletchinder, can also get rid of Grass-types, while Seismitoad can cover Rock-types in return. Moltres can abuse Hurricane in the rain, while Jolteon, Heliolisk, and Rotom-C can use Thunder in the rain.

Other Options
########

Grass Knot is an option to hit Slowking harder, but it can only 3HKO non-Assault Vest variants, and it doesn't hit bulky Water-types such as Alomomola harder than Earth Power. A Substitute + Toxic set is viable, but the defensive set already performs this role better. Seismitoad's wide physical movepool with moves such as Earthquake, Ice Punch, Knock Off, and Drain Punch allow it to run a physical set; however, the lack of a physical Water STAB move stops such a set from being effective. Refresh is useful to remove status, but it takes up a valuable moveslot.

Checks and Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Grass-types resist Seismitoad's dual STAB moves and threaten it in return. Amoonguss doesn't resist Earth Power, but it will never be 2HKOed by it regardless of investment, and it resists Seismitoad's Water-type STAB moves and is immune to Toxic. Tangrowth, especially Assault Vest variants, can take any of Seismitoad's moves, OHKO it with its Grass-type STAB moves, and take advantage of Regenerator to mitigate Toxic damage. Virizion can set up on or OHKO Seismitoad. Rotom-C is immune to Earth Power and resists Sesmitoad's Water-type STAB moves, but it must be wary of Sludge Bomb. Pokemon with Grass-type coverage moves also check Seismitoad.

**Special Walls**: Assault Vest Slowking can take any move and OHKO any variant of Seismitoad with Grass Knot or 2HKO the Swift Swim set with Scald in rain, while Regenerator lessens the effects of Toxic. Aromatisse can't be Toxic stalled as it has Aromatherapy and Wish to heal off any damage.

**Passive Damage**: Passive damage such as Toxic will easily wear down Seismitoad as it has no reliable recovery. This applies to the Swift Swim and defensive sets, in particular.
