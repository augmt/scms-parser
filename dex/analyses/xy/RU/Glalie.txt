Overview
########

In the transition to ORAS, Glalie gained a Mega Evolution, transforming it from a useless Pokemon in the RarelyUsed metagame to one of the strongest Pokemon in the tier. Its Refrigerate-boosted attacks, solid Speed tier after Mega Evolving, and great mixed attacking stats make it a good choice for offensively oriented teams. Unfortunately for Glalie, it still suffers from mediocre defensive stats and terrible defensive typing, which makes getting Glalie onto the battlefield and Mega Evolving it a challenge. It is important to note that regular Glalie should never be used in the RarelyUsed tier, as it has no niche.

Mixed Mega Attacker
########
name: Mixed Mega Attacker
move 1: Double-Edge / Return
move 2: Freeze-Dry
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Ice Shard / Explosion
ability: Refrigerate
item: Glalite
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive

Moves
========

Thanks to Refrigerate, Double-Edge is Mega Glalie's STAB move of choice, as it deals a lot of damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist Ice-type attacks. Return is an option over Double-Edge for a recoil-free attack; however, the damage output is noticeably lower. Freeze Dry allows Mega Glalie to get around certain bulky Water-types such as Quagsire and physically defensive Alomomola, which would otherwise completely wall Mega Glalie. Earthquake punishes Steel-types that like to switch into Mega Glalie's Ice-type moves, and it has the additional benefit of OHKOing opposing Magneton. Ice Shard allows Mega Glalie to pick off Pokemon that are incredibly difficult for offensive teams to deal with, such as weakened Mega Pidgeot and Mega Sceptile. If priority is not necessary for your team, Explosion can be used, allowing Mega Glalie to take out or heavily damage even the sturdiest of Pokemon that resist Ice. Super Fang is another option for Mega Glalie, wearing down common switch-ins such as Doublade and Bronzong.

Set Details
========

Glalitite is the item of choice, as it is the only thing that makes Glalie viable in the RarelyUsed metagame. Maximum Speed investment and a Naive nature allow Mega Glalie to Speed tie positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon such as opposing Mega Glalie. Attack is also maximized, as Mega Glalie will be spamming Double-Edge the majority of the time. The last 4 EVs are placed into Special Attack to power up Freeze-Dry.

Usage Tips
========

Because Glalie has poor defensive typing and mediocre bulk, it is important that you Mega Evolve it against a Pokemon that is slower than Mega Glalie and is incapable of taking a Refrigerate boosted Double-Edge. Freeze-Dry should be used on predicted switches into Alomomola or Clawitzer, as it is capable of 2HKOing physically defensive variants of Alomomola and common Clawitzer sets. Earthquake should be used on predicted switches into Steel-types, most notably Cobalion, Doublade, and Registeel, which are common switch-ins that hate taking multiple Earthquakes. Ice Shard should be used against weakened Pokemon that outspeed Mega Glalie; it can also gives Glalie some opportunities to Mega Evolve. In most cases spamming Double-Edge is the best play for Mega Glalie.

Team Options
========

Mega Glalie is easily worn down due to the nature of Double Edge and its susceptibility to all forms of entry hazards. Hitmonlee is a good partner for Mega Glalie, as it can use Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock and wear down opposing Doublade with Knock Off. Pokemon that can get Mega Glalie in for free with a slow Volt Switch or U-turn can really help to increase its effectiveness. Assault Vest Eelektross provides a slow Volt Switch while also checking threats such as Doublade, Moltres, and Delphox, which can annoy Mega Glalie. Choice Scarf Moltres takes advantage of Mega Glalie luring and weakening the opponent's Water-types, and it is a very good at cleaning up the opponent's team after Mega Glalie has weakened it. Stealth Rock helps guarantee many OHKOs against offensive Pokemon, including Mega Abomasnow. Rhyperior provides Stealth Rock support for Mega Glalie and can switch into the Fire-type moves that are often aimed at Mega Glalie.

Mega Spiker
########
name: Mega Spiker
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Double-Edge
move 3: Explosion
move 4: Ice Shard
ability: Refrigerate
item: Glalite
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Spikes is the main draw of this set, and Mega Glalie forces many switches, allowing it many opportunities to set them up. Double-Edge is Mega Glalie's main STAB move, which is capable of dealing heavy damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Explosion is capable of preventing both Rapid Spin and Defog while inflicting an insane amount of damage on the opposing Pokemon. Ice Shard is useful in the last slot for picking off weakened threats, as well as checking Pokemon such as Mega Pidgeot and Mega Sceptile. Ice Shard can also create opportunities for Glalie to Mega Evolve.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed and a Jolly nature allow Glalie to Speed tie other positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon before it Mega Evolves, as well as opposing Mega Glalie after it Mega Evolves. Attack is maximized so that Mega Glalie hits as hard as possible. Glalitite is necessary for Glalie to Mega Evolve.

Usage Tips
========

You should use the many switches that Mega Glalie forces with its offensive prowess to set up Spikes. If the opponent sends in a Defogger such as Gligar or Shiftry, Double-Edge can prevent them from using Defog; it also prevents Golbat from using Defog after Stealth Rock damage. Explosion prevents Pokemon that can take a Double-Edge, such as Hitmontop and Kabutops, from using Rapid Spin. Against certain teams, setting up Spikes is not that important, but Mega Glalie will still be useful by spamming Double-Edge.

Team Options
========

Doublade makes for a pretty good partner for Mega Glalie, as it is capable of acting as a spinblocker and enjoys the Spikes support provided by Mega Glalie. Choice Specs Meloetta is a good partner for Mega Glalie, as its best switch-ins are grounded and worn down by Spikes, making it a more effective wallbreaker. Choice Scarf Meloetta also appreciates the Spikes support, as it makes cleaning easier. Choice Scarf Moltres is another good cleaner to pair with Mega Glalie, as it heavily punishes switch-ins with Spikes and U-turn.

Other Options
########

Taunt is an option for preventing Defog. However, Mega Glalie defeats most Defoggers anyway, and Explosion can prevent foes from using both Defog and Rapid Spin in a pinch. Dark Pulse is an option for hitting Doublade on the switch, while Crunch is useful for hitting Bronzong. Body Slam can replace Double-Edge as Glalie's main STAB move to spread paralysis and prevent recoil, but the damage output is disappointing and it misses out on many OHKOs and 2HKOs. Substitute seems like a decent option to take advantage of forced switches, but it just wears down Mega Glalie more quickly.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Steel-types such as Bronzong, Cobalion, Doublade, and Registeel are all capable of tanking hits from Mega Glalie and hitting it back with a super effective STAB move or crippling it with Thunder Wave in Registeel's case. Doublade, Cobalion, and Registeel must be careful about taking too many Earthquakes, though.

**Water-types**: Slowking and Alomomola can switch in on most of Mega Glalie's moves with ease, but Alomomola is setup bait for the Spikes set. Other Water-types are 2HKOed by Freeze-Dry on the switch.

**Stealth Rock**: Mega Glalie is very easy to wear down, and Stealth Rock only exacerbates this issue.

**Choice Scarf Users**: Choice Scarf Moltres and Choice Scarf Hitmonlee are both capable of OHKOing Mega Glalie. Choice Scarf Meloetta does heavy damage to Mega Glalie, but needs some prior damage to secure the KO.

**Cofagrigus**: While it can't switch into Explosion and doesn't really like taking any of Mega Glalie's attacks, the ability Mummy removes Refrigerate, which allows Cofagrigus to burn Mega Glalie with Will-O-Wisp.
