Overview
########

Tauros is a dangerous physical attacker in the RU metagame. Its base 110 Speed lets it outpace the majority of the unboosted metagame, leaving it outsped only by Jolteon and Cinccino. Tauros is also very powerful thanks to its ability, Sheer Force, which strengthens moves such as Rock Climb and lets it avoid Life Orb recoil; Sheer Force also allows Tauros to use moves like Fire Blast and Ice Beam that let it beat conventional checks to physical attackers, such as Doublade and Gligar. However, Tauros has some flaws, such as having to use low accuracy moves, that make it somewhat unreliable as a late-game cleaner. Also, Tauros cannot touch Ghost-types other than Doublade, thus requiring Pursuit support. Tauros also struggles to find chances to switch in because of its Normal typing.

Life Orb Attacker
########
name: Life Orb Attacker
move 1: Rock Climb / Double-Edge
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Zen Headbutt
move 4: Fire Blast
ability: Sheer Force
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive

Moves
========

Rock Climb is Tauros's strongest STAB move and 2HKOes, at worst, every offensive Pokemon that doesn't resist it. It is preferred over Double-Edge, as Rock Climb lacks recoil, increasing Tauros's lifespan considerably; however, Double-Edge can still be used for the increased power and accuracy. Earthquake is used to hit Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon which resist Rock Climb. Zen Headbutt hits Ghost-types other than Doublade harder than any other move on this set, OHKOing frailer ones with some prior damage; it also hits Fighting-types, such as Virizion and Hitmontop, a bit harder, allowing Tauros to revenge kill. Zen Headbutt is also a more accurate against weakened targets where you can't afford to miss. Fire Blast roasts Steel-types that have lower Special Defense, such as Doublade, and deals more damage to Tangrowth, Steelix, and Cobalion than any other move on Tauros's set. It OHKOes Durant and 2HKOes Escavalier.

Set Details
========

Sheer Force boosts the power of Tauros's special attacks, allowing it to 2HKO Gligar and Doublade with Ice Beam and Fire Blast, respectively. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are used to take maximum advantage of Tauros's physical bulk; a Naive nature is used to preserve Tauros's physical bulk and let it take priority attacks better.

Usage Tips
========

Tauros works as a revenge killer and late-game sweeper if physical walls are removed, and can lure and KO troublesome Pokemon like Doublade and Gligar to help a teammate early-game. Note that the special moves cannot KO their their intended target without prior damage. Rock Climb is a spammable move, as it OHKOes most offensive Pokemon that are not immune or resistant to it, and 2HKOes Pokemon that do not heavily invest in Defense, such as Slowking. You should double switch to your Pursuit user if you see a Ghost-type other than Doublade, as Tauros cannot touch most Ghost-types.

Team Options
========

Pursuit users such as Sneasel and Spiritomb are really useful to remove or weaken Ghost-types and Cresselia, which trouble Tauros. Pokemon that can easily switch into and threaten Alomomola, such as Substitute + Baton Pass Jolteon, Heliolisk, and Virizion, make for good partners, as Tauros is forced out by Alomomola. They can also weaken or set up on Rhyperior. Entry hazard setters are good partners, as Tauros is able to take advantage of entry hazards, being able to force switches.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Double-Edge
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Zen Headbutt
move 4: Flamethrower
ability: Intimidate / Sheer Force
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Double-Edge hits pretty hard thanks to its high Base Power, dealing heavy damage to any Pokemon that doesn't resist it; it is used over Rock Climb as reliability is preferred on a revenge killer, and gives Tauros the freedom to run Intimidate. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-types, which sponge Double-Edge, and allows Tauros to revenge kill weakened Cobalion; however, Earthquake is not a great move to be locked into. Zen Headbutt allows Tauros to revenge kill Virizion with only a bit of prior damage, and is the best move to hit frailer Ghost-types, such as Mismagius. Flamethrower OHKOes Durant if Sheer Force is used; Intimidate Tauros can also OHKO Durant with some prior damage. Rock Slide is a decent option to OHKO Moltres without Stealth Rock damage.

Set Details
========

Intimidate lets Tauros take priority moves better, and allows it to pivot into coverage moves such as Virizion's Stone Edge and Durant's Crunch with relative ease. Sheer Force can be used to have boost the power of Zen Headbutt and to OHKO Durant with Flamethrower without any prior damage. An Adamant nature is used along with maximum Attack and Speed investment, as Tauros does not outspeed anything relevant with a Jolly nature.

Usage Tips
========

This Tauros is more of a revenge killer, but it can also act as an offensive pivot, as it can take two Waterfalls from Sharpedo if Stealth Rock is off the field. Tauros can also survive a +2 Acrobatics from Fletchinder and OHKO back and tank a Life Orb-boosted Mach Punch from Hitmonlee. You can also use Tauros to lure and take out some problematic offensive Pokemon, such as Cinccino and Jolteon. It should be noted that you need some prior damage to revenge kill bulkier sweepers like Cobalion and Virizion.

Team Options
========

Strong Fighting- and Ground- types such as Hitmonlee, Gallade, and Choice Band Rhyperior break through the Rock- and Steel-types that wall Tauros; as such, they make for good partners. Entry hazards guarantee some OHKOs on offensive Pokemon, and Tauros can take advantage of them, as it forces quite a lot of switches, so entry hazard setters are good partners.

Other Options
########

Return or Frustration can be used as a compromise between lack of recoil and accuracy, but they are considerably less powerful and mostly outclassed by Rock Climb and Double -Edge. Choice Band can be used, but Life Orb is usually better, as it lets Tauros switch moves to beat its switch-ins. Toxic is an interesting option to hit Alomomola, Cresselia, and Spiritomb on the switch, but Tauros struggles to find a moveslot for it. A Substitute + Endeavor set can be used to beat Bronzong and can weaken most Steel-types other than Doublade. Thunder can be used to potentially 2HKO Alomomola, but is very inaccurate and most Alomomola run a lot of Special Defense investment, anyway.


Checks &amp; Counters
########

**Ghost -types**: Spiritomb takes nothing from Tauros's moves, and can wear it down with Will-O-Wisp or Pursuit. Cofagrigus takes even less damage from Tauros, and removes Sheer Force with Mummy, weakening Tauros and forcing it to take Life Orb recoil; it can also burn it or set up Toxic Spikes.

**Alomomola**: Alomomola can take any hit from Tauros, only fearing the rare Thunder and Toxic, and can recover the lost health with Regenerator.

**Bulky Rock- and Steel-types**: Rhyperior stomachs almost anything that Tauros throws at it, only fearing repeated Ice Beams and Earthquakes, and can hit back with Earthquake and set up Stealth Rock. Registeel and Bronzong are in a similar boat, and can set up Stealth Rock and then status Tauros.

**Faster Attackers**: Jolteon and Cinccino outspeed Tauros and can heavily damage or outright OHKO Tauros, but they can't switch into any move bar Fire Blast, and are destroyed by Choice Scarf sets.
