Overview
########

Cradily has access to Stealth Rock, good special bulk, and reliable recovery, allowing it to switch in and set up the entry hazard throughout the course of the match and act as a proficient special wall. Cradily can find opportunities to switch in on Water-types, as its ability Storm Drain lets it switch in for free. Furthermore, its unique typing lets it check many dangerous special attackers such as Exploud, Heliolisk, Slowking, and non-Nasty Plot Houndoom. However, Cradily also has some common weaknesses in Steel, Fighting, and Ice and little resistances to boot. It has little offensive presence, making it very passive. This is made even worse by its bad Speed, meaning it usually has to take a hit before it can even move.

Moves
========

Stealth Rock wears down opposing Pokemon, and Cradily can usually get many opportunities to set it up. Rock Slide hits dangerous targets such as Moltres and Fletchinder for significant damage. Recover is mandatory to keep Cradily healthy throughout the match, and it sets Cradily apart from its competition. Toxic can hit some Pokemon Cradily has trouble hurting through Rock Slide, such as Alomomola, Gastrodon, and Tangrowth. It also provides helpful residual damage to force switches and weaken foes. On the other hand, Giga Drain can hit select targets such as Kabutops, Gastrodon, and Rhyperior while also giving Cradily another healing option. However, it is weak uninvested and cannot really hurt Steel-types, which like to switch in against Cradily. If Cradily gains a Storm Drain boost, though, it can become more dangerous.

Set Details
========

Max Special Defensive investment is used so that Cradily can more comfortably wall the Pokemon it's supposed to, such as Exploud. Leftovers provides helpful passive recovery, which Cradily appreciates. A Sassy nature should be used if running Giga Drain, as it does not lower Special Attack, but if you are using Toxic a Careful nature is better in order to not decrease Cradily's Speed.

Usage Tips
========

Try to bring Cradily in on predicted Water-type moves from the likes of Slowking and Gastrodon and then set up Stealth Rock or use Toxic. Cradily also can come in on Pokemon it can check by virtue of its typing, such as Cinccino, Exploud, and Heliolisk. Cradily is vulnerable to status, especially Toxic, so do not recklessly switch it in on Pokemon that commonly carry it such as Alomomola. Switch out immediately if the opponent sends in a Steel- or Fighting-type, as Cradily is weak to their STAB moves and cannot hurt them with Rock Slide. Do not overestimate Cradily's defensive capabilities, as it has problems with strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Tangrowth and Clawitzer. Hitting switch-ins with Toxic on the switch can be very helpful for the rest of your team, so if you can predict a switch, it is generally a good move to use.

Team Options
========

Fire-types such as Moltres, Emboar, and Delphox are good partners, as they can force out Steel-types and some Fighting-types, while Cradily can switch into Water-type moves and provide Stealth Rock support to help wear down their checks. Doublade and Spiritomb are good spinblockers and good checks to physical attackers, especially Fighting-types, if Spiritomb is using a defensive set. Aromatisse can deal with Fighting-type attacks while also getting rid of any status conditions inflicted on Cradily. Be mindful of their shared weakness to Steel, though. Qwilfish can remove Toxic Spikes, which can neuter Cradily, and has good synergy with Cradily while also being able to set up Spikes to wear down the opposing team along with Cradily's Stealth Rock. Cleric support from partners such as Lanturn is important, as Cradily hates Toxic.

Other Options
########

A Rocky Helmet can be used to annoy physical attackers such as Cinccino, but Cradily appreciates Leftovers more and generally should not be staying in on most physical attackers anyway. Pain Split is effective against foes with high HP such as Cresselia and Alomomola, but it is extremely unreliable compared to Recover. Mirror Coat is an option to surprise some attackers trying to wear Cradily down, but it takes up an important moveslot that should be left to something else. A RestTalk Curse set could be used, but Cradily still has problems with strong attackers while setting up, and this role is better left to Pokemon such as Mega Steelix.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel- and Fighting-types**: Steel-types have an easy time coming in on Cradily, as they don't particularly mind any of its moves. Most of them, such as Escavalier, Durant, and Doublade, can hit back with a strong STAB Iron Head. Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Medicham are in the same boat, although they need to be more wary of Giga Drain and Toxic.

**Setup Sweepers**: Cradily has problems with certain setup sweepers such as Curse Registeel, Calm Mind Cresselia, Spiritomb, and Reuniclus, as it cannot force them out with Toxic and is too weak to hurt them.

**Strong Special Attackers**: Strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Reuniclus and Tangrowth can generally break through Cradily due to the sheer power behind their attacks.
