Overview
########

Boasting a fantastic Grass / Electric typing which gives it a good STAB combination along with nice resistances, the mowing machine is by no means a faulty one. Along with its good typing, it also has Levitate, which gives it immunity to Ground-type moves and therefore lets it check notable Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Gastrodon. It also gives it immunity to all entry hazards bar Stealth Rock, making Rotom-C a good answer to Sticky Web and hazard-stacking teams if played correctly. Additionally, it has good overall stats, with good Special Attack, Speed, and defensive stats. Sadly, Rotom-C is still outsped by faster threats such as Hitmonlee, Moltres, Drapion, and Delphox. It also suffers a bit from four-moveslot syndrome, as it wants to run Volt Switch, Thunderbolt, Will-O-Wisp, Leaf Storm, and Trick altogether on a Choice set but can't.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Leaf Storm
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Trick
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Leaf Storm is a strong STAB move that severely hurts everything weak to it, especially Pokemon like Rhyperior and Gastrodon, while also being able to damage many Pokemon that aren't weak to it. Volt Switch is this set's main move, as it allows Rotom-C to gain momentum, while still hitting hard thanks to it being a STAB move. Thunderbolt is the secondary STAB move and lets Rotom-C clean late-game thanks to its reliability. Finally, Trick can cripple some common switch-ins to Rotom-C, such as Registeel and Amoonguss, for the rest of the match. Will-O-Wisp can be used along with Trick to effectively spread burns after tricking the Choice Scarf away, but isn't preferred because it removes Rotom-C's ability to clean late-game with Thunderbolt, the only reliable STAB move Rotom-C has.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed along with maximum Special Attack allows Rotom-C to be as fast as possible to outspeed slower threats such as Gallade, Braviary, and Tyrantrum, while also hitting as hard as possible. The choice between Timid and Modest comes down to whether you want it to hit harder or outspeed positive-natured Choice Scarf base 80 Pokemon such as Braviary and Adamant Hitmonlee. Choice Scarf allows Rotom-C to act as a late-game cleaner that can revenge kill threats such as Hitmonlee, Moltres, Delphox, Cobalion, and Durant, among others.

Usage Tips
========

This particular set allows Rotom-C to act as a late-game cleaner and revenge killer that can be used early-game to grab momentum with Volt Switch. If the opponent's team lacks a Ground-type or a Pokemon that is immune to Electric-type moves such as Jolteon, then feel free to use Volt Switch early-game as much as possible to gain momentum. If a Pokemon that is immune to Electric-type moves is on the opponent's team, then use it carefully, and some prediction with Leaf Storm must be done. Leaf Storm's Special Attack drop can also cause Rotom-C to be setup fodder for Pokemon such as Braviary, Gallade, Delphox, and Moltres, so use it sparingly. Using Trick against some common switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Registeel will cripple them for the rest of the match, but think twice before using Trick against an offensive team, as it can backfire if you give the wrong Pokemon a Choice Scarf.

Team Options
========

Wallbreakers generally work well with Rotom-C because of their ability to weaken teams so that Rotom-C can easily clean up late-game. For that reason, offensive Druddigon, Delphox, Exploud, Escavalier, and Moltres are good teammates. Additionally, Pokemon with Volt Switch or U-turn make good teammates because they create a VoltTurn core along with Rotom-C. Braviary, Swellow, Moltres, and Jolteon are good options, especially the former three, because they can lure Rhyperior and Alomomola for Rotom-C to easily get rid of.

Fire-types, specifically Moltres, make good partners for Rotom-C because of their ability to easily KO Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Registeel, all of which Rotom-C has trouble against. Entry hazard support is also something it appreciates, and Pokemon such as Druddigon, Rhyperior, and Cobalion can provide Stealth Rock while Accelgor and Qwilfish provide Spikes.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Leaf Storm
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Trick
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Specs
evs: 48 HP / 252 SpA / 208 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========

Leaf Storm is the strongest move Rotom-C has access to and allows it to act as a wallbreaker with Choice Specs, hitting anything that doesn't resist it ridiculously hard at the cost of lowering Rotom-C's Special Attack by two stages. Volt Switch is a STAB move that hits decently hard while also increasing momentum, and Thunderbolt is used as a reliable STAB attack without any drawbacks. Trick is to cripple common switch-ins such as Amoonguss, Registeel, and Tangrowth and make them useless for the rest of the match. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Pokemon like Amoonguss, Virizion, Tangrowth, Registeel, and Escavalier harder, while Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Druddigon and Gligar for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

The EVs allow Rotom-C to outspeed neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Braviary and Kabutops, while also providing maximum Special Attack with the rest dumped in HP for better bulk and an easier time switching into Pokemon it's supposed to check. The choice between Modest and Timid comes down to whether power or Speed is more important, as Modest lets Rotom-C break walls more easily and do more damage in general, while Timid allows it to outspeed positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Gallade and Braviary. Choice Specs allows Rotom-C to act as a wallbreaker with Leaf Storm and Thunderbolt and gain momentum while doing damage with Volt Switch. Expert Belt can be used, especially because Rotom-C enforces a lot of mindgames when facing Ground-types such as Rhyperior or Gastrodon, and can sometimes lure them into expecting a Volt Switch or a Thunderbolt and hit them afterwards with a Leaf Storm. In this case, it can also bluff a Choice item effectively, if it does not give away the facade by switching moves. Expert Belt is an especially good choice if Rotom-C is using Hidden Power along with hazards support.

Usage Tips
========

Rotom-C is better sent out early-game to use Volt Switch and gain momentum, especially if the opponent's team lacks an Electric-type immunity such as a Ground-type or Jolteon. If that's the case, then prediction is necessary, and using Leaf Storm in the right moment can be crucial to hurt the Electric-type immunities on the switch, but be careful of the Special Attack drop, as it can make Rotom-C setup fodder for Pokemon such as Braviary, Gallade, and Delphox. Unlike the Choice Scarf set, this set aims to be more of a wallbreaker rather than a sweeper, so using it early- and mid-game to weaken teams for other sweepers to clean up is ideal.

Team Options
========

Strong Fire-types such as Delphox and Moltres can form an effective offensive core with Rotom-C because they beat Grass-types easily, while Rotom-C beats bulky Water-types for them. Moltres, in particular, is a good teammate because it also has access to U-turn and can form a VoltTurn core. Fletchinder can beat Grass-types as well, and it also has priority Acrobatics that can sweep weakened teams late-game. Entry hazards work well with Rotom-C, making Druddigon, Cobalion, and Rhyperior good options to set up Stealth Rock while Accelgor and Qwilfish can set up Spikes, with the latter being able to set up Toxic Spikes as well. As this particular set likes to switch into bulky Water-types and Rhyperior, using it alongside a cleric such as Aromatisse for Wish support and status recovery is useful; Alomomola can also switch into Fire-type moves aimed at Rotom-C while also providing useful Wish support.

Choice Specs Rotom-C plays as a wallbreaker first and foremost, and for this reason, pairing it up with sweepers and late-game cleaners is ideal. Pokemon like Swellow and Choice Scarf Braviary can be good teammates, because they have access to U-turn and can lure in Rhyperior early-game for Rotom-C to kill, and they form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-C which helps gain momentum early-game. In general, Choice Scarf users are good for their ability to clean up and sweep late-game and for that reason, Pokemon like Delphox and Emboar work well. Pokemon such as Sharpedo and Jolteon can also clean up late-game and sweep.

Other Options
########

Rotom-C doesn't have many other options, but its typing is unique and having access to a good ability in Levitate allows it to effectively run a bulky set with Rest, Will-O-Wisp, Volt Switch, and Leaf Storm with Chesto Berry, but it's unreliable due to the fact that it has no reliable STAB move and only a one-time recovery move. A SubSplit set with Substitute, Pain Split, Will-O-Wisp, and Thunderbolt can be utilized, but it's outclassed by SubSeed users such as Gourgeist-S. Thunder Wave can be used on any set instead of Will-O-Wisp if paralysis support is needed, but Will-O-Wisp is usually better thanks to the fact that it deals indirect damage and halves Attack. Finally, a set with Rain Dance and Damp Rock along with Thunder can be a useful tool for rain teams.

Checks &amp; Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Virizion can switch in relatively easily because they resist both of Rotom-C's STAB moves. However, the former two don't like being tricked a Choice item.

**Pokemon That Resist Its Moves**: Druddigon can switch into any move and threaten Rotom-C with a strong STAB attack, Fire Punch, or Gunk Shot. Registeel can use Toxic on Rotom-C and wear it down with Seismic Toss without much trouble, although it is greatly hindered by a Choice item being tricked onto it.

**Faster Pokemon**: Pokemon like Delphox, Moltres, and Hitmonlee have no problem taking down Rotom-C, but they must watch out for the Choice Scarf set, although the former two can outspeed even Choice Scarf Rotom-C and KO it. Jolteon is immune to Electric-type attacks, but takes a hefty amount of damage from Leaf Storm.
