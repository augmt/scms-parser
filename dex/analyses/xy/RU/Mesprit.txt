Overview
########

Mesprit serves two distinct roles on hyper offensive teams: the first is to set up Stealth Rock, and the second is to keep the opposing team from removing them, both of which it does very well. With access to STAB Psychic and a good coverage move in Ice Beam, Mesprit has the capability to KO, or at worst, pressure every relevant Defog and Rapid Spin user in the RU tier. This is further complimented by Mesprit's solid offenses, which allow it to carry its weight on these very same teams outside of beating entry hazard removers. In addition, Mesprit has access to the coveted Healing Wish and is quite possibly one of the only good users of the move in RU. Outside of these roles, however, Mesprit is strictly outclassed by other Psychic-types, which makes it rather predictable. Furthermore, Mesprit only functions under certain builds, thus making it difficult to fit on less offensive teams and limiting its presence to very specific archetypes.

Offensive Support

move 3: Stealth Rock
move 4: Healing Wish
item: Colbur Berry / Life Orb

nature: Timid

Moves
========

Psychic is preferred as the STAB move over Psyshock because it deals much more damage to Taunt Cobalion, which makes it difficult for Cobalion switch in on Mesprit more than once and prevent Mesprit from using support moves. Ice Beam is the coverage move of choice in order to smash Gligar and Shiftry, two prominent Defog users that need to remain subdued for Spikes-stacking teams to function. With both STAB Psychic and Ice Beam in its arsenal, Mesprit makes for a very proficient Stealth Rock user that is able to prevent opposing forms of entry hazard removal. Lastly, Healing Wish adds another form of support to Mesprit's team and can be an incredibly game-changing move mid-game. Hidden Power Ground and Dazzling Gleam, two coverage moves, may be used over Healing Wish to allow Mesprit to pressure Skuntank and Doublade and OHKO the very prominent Pangoro, respectively.

Set Details
========

With Life Orb, Mesprit is able to OHKO Hitmontop and Dragalge with Psychic and specially defensive Gligar after Stealth Rock with Ice Beam. Life Orb also gives Mesprit the power to 2HKO support Cobalion with Psychic. On the other hand, Colbur Berry makes it easier for Mesprit to deal with both Shiftry and Hitmonlee, as it has a much easier time tanking their Dark-type attacks and can then KO them in order to prevent them from removing entry hazards from your side of the field. In addition, Colbur Berry allows Mesprit to withstand one hit from Houndoom in dire situations and set up Stealth Rock if need be.

Usage Tips
========

Mesprit can be brought in at the start of the match to set up Stealth Rock should you anticipate it receiving a good lead matchup, although Mesprit should preferably take the time to set up Stealth Rock by forcing out Pokemon such as Dragalge or on passive walls. Do try to preserve Mesprit even after it sets up Stealth Rock, as its mid-game utility in Healing Wish can be game-changing. If Mesprit is up against a Defog or a Rapid Spin user, then it should use Ice Beam or Psychic to KO the foe; if neither attack can bring down the foe, then Healing Wish can prevent the use of Rapid Spin or Defog for one turn, though this should only be used as a last resort.

Team Options
========

Mesprit functions very well with Spikes-stackers due to its ability to provide Stealth Rock support and prevent the removal of entry hazards. Of the viable Spikes-stackers, Qwilfish and Accelgor make for good partners, as they are the two most proficient Spikes users in RU. Due to the nature of teams Mesprit works on, Pokemon that can spinblock make for good partners; Doublade and Spiritomb in particular can deal with the boosting Psychic-types that can set up on Mesprit. Mega Glalie also makes for a good partner, as it too can provide Spikes support and appreciates Healing Wish support due to the way it plays when it uses Double-Edge. Other Pokemon that appreciate Healing Wish support due to how recklessly they play or how easily they get worn down include Swords Dance Pangoro, Swords Dance Mega Sceptile, Mega Abomasnow, and Escavalier.

Other Options
########

A Choice Scarf set with three attacks and Healing Wish is viable, although Mesprit has difficulty revenge killing many offensive threats and is very easy to exploit when locked into a STAB or a weak coverage move. Shadow Ball can be used to smash Doublade and deal a considerable amount of damage to Bronzong and other Psychic-types. Thunderbolt is also a viable option, as it has superb coverage alongside Psychic; however, unlike Ice Beam, Thunderbolt can't KO very many Defog and Rapid Spin users. Energy Ball is an option to OHKO Kabutops, Quagsire, and Rhyperior and makes for quite the good lure. Similarly, Hidden Power Fire can lure Escavalier, and finally, Knock Off can make Mesprit more useful against stall outside of setting up Stealth Rock.

Checks & Counters
########

**Kabutops and Skuntank**: Assault Vest Kabutops and Skuntank are the only two entry hazard removers that don't mind taking either a Psychic or an Ice Beam and can consistently keep Stealth Rock off the field.

**Houndoom and Durant**: Houndoom is immune to Psychic, resists Ice Beam, and is faster than Mesprit, making it one of the only Pokemon that can completely prevent Mesprit from setting up Stealth Rock, especially if it carries Taunt. Durant is also one of the few Pokemon that can outspeed and KO Mesprit from the get-go.
