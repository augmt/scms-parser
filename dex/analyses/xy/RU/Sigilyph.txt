Overview
########
Sigilyph possesses the amazing Magic Guard ability, and it possesses enough Speed to outrun almost every defensively inclined Pokemon in the tier and some offensive ones, giving it a solid niche over Reuniclus. Sigilyph's combination of usable bulk, reliable recovery, and immunity to residual damage makes it a huge pain for defensive teams to take down. It has a movepool wide enough to have varying checks and counters to each of its sets, which can make it tricky to handle. However, Sigilyph faces stiff competition from the numerous other Psychic-types that reside in the tier. Delphox shares much of Sigilyph's movepool but has superior offensive stats and stronger typing, while Cresselia and Reuniclus possess vastly superior bulk, with Cresselia sharing Sigilyph's respectable Speed and Reuniclus also having Magic Guard. However, Sigilyph has its collective advantages over all of them that warrants its use, and is a powerful standalone threat in its own right.

Moves
========
Psyshock is a STAB move that lets Sigilyph hit specially defensive Pokemon such as Gallade, Delphox, and Cryogonal harder, while also guaranteeing the OHKO on Virizion. Psychic can be used instead if physically bulky Pokemon such as Druddigon and Gligar are of greater concern. Heat Wave roasts Steel-types such as Escavalier, Registeel, and Doublade, and can deal respectable amounts of damage against Dark-types such as Drapion and Shiftry. Energy Ball hits physically bulky Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Omastar, and Alomomola which tank Psyshock well, or specially defensive Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Slowking, and Jellicent harder. Dark Pulse is a perfectly viable alternative as it 2HKOes Delphox and Reuniclus and does decent damage to Meloetta while still hitting Slowking and Jellicent, but it misses out on Sharpedo. Roost keeps Sigilyph healthy, letting it survive against defensive teams for much longer.


Set Details
========
Life Orb induces no recoil thanks to Magic Guard, effectively providing Sigilyph a free boost in power. Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment helps to maximize Sigilyph's sweeping potential. Immunity to Stealth Rock means Sigilyph does not have to care about Stealth Rock numbers, so the remaining EVs can be placed anywhere.

Usage Tips
========
Sigilyph can be a royal pain for offensive teams to deal with due to its limited switch-ins and wide coverage. It's very simple to use: get in, then hit everything as hard as it can with its strong coverage without any Life Orb recoil. Those switches can be obtained with ease from the opponent's defensive Pokemon, but remember that Sigilyph is only unfazed by damaging status; Thunder Wave and Spore still affect it. This Sigilyph can threaten almost everything slower than it, which makes Sticky Web support an appealing choice, with the nature accordingly changed to Modest. Sigilyph can afford to play a bit recklessly as staying healthy usually isn't Sigilyph's main concern, thanks to its immunity to passive damage.

Team Options
========
Sigilyph can have issues against the likes of Cresselia and Reuniclus, making teammates such as Escavalier and Drapion solid partners to dispose of the bulky Psychic-types that trouble Sigilyph. Sigilyph has some problematic weaknesses, most notably to Electric and Dark, both of which are resisted by Virizion, Shiftry, and Whimsicott, the former two providing strong offensive support while the latter can generate momentum for Sigilyph with Encore and U-turn. Other Pokemon that resist Sigilyph's weaknesses make good partners as well, including Exploud with its Ghost immunity, Doublade with its Ice and Rock resistances, and Drapion with its Dark resistance. Sticky Web can benefit Sigilyph greatly, as it renders many offensive checks to Sigilyph much less potent. Any user of Sticky Web can do the trick and offer other forms of support: Leavanny has decent offensive presence due to high Speed and decent dual STABs, Ariados has Toxic Spikes, Kricketune has Knock Off, and Masquerain has QuiverPass.

Other Options
########
Sigilyph seems to be able to wield Choice items effectively, given its access to Trick and Magic Guard giving it free room for repeated switches regardless of entry hazards. However, Magic Guard Life Orb already outclasses Choice Specs as it provides a similiar boost for free, while Choice Scarf Sigilyph has no way to boost its power of its attacks, its best STAB only topping 90 BP, leaving it rather weak. Tinted Lens looks appealing, but giving up Magic Guard is painful (especially when Stealth Rock is concerned) and its Psychic STAB has an immunity making it a mediocre option. Sigilyph has some other attacking options at its disposal. Ice Beam is nice for neutral coverage and hits Druddigon, but Sigilyph already has the coverage options to hit what it needs to, making Ice Beam unnecessary. Dazzling Gleam lets Sigilyph hits Spiritomb for good damage, but most other Dark-types are either faster or aren't weak to it, lessening its value. Finally, there is the infamous Cosmic Power and Stored Power combination, also known as the combination that tarnished the Flame Orb set's reputation and potential. The combo is frowned upon as it is criminally weak during the first few turns and is forced out incredibly easily, pretty much throwing away Sigilyph's best traits.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dark-types**: Being immune to Sigilyph's strongest STAB moves, Dark-types make for powerful responses against it. The problem is that a good majority of Dark-types detest being burned or are too frail to repeatedly switch into Sigilyph, if at all. However, Knock Off removes Flame Orb indefinitely, so Dark-types with cleric support can shut down the Flame Orb set as well. RestTalk + Calm Mind Spiritomb does not fear Sigilyph at all for the most part, easily setting up on it. Sneasel and +1 Sharpedo are faster than Sigilyph, meaning they can go for the KO outright without risking the burn, but cannot safely make a direct switch-in.

**Psychic-types**: Versatility in movesets makes Sigilyph tricky to counter, but Psychic-types tend to be a thorn by Sigilyph's side. Delphox resists most of Sigilyph's attacks and is immune to burn, while also outspeeding Sigilyph and packs a solid punch; Shadow Ball hurts but only knocks Delphox into Blaze range. Slowking has the bulk to shrug off unboosted super effective attacks, and can use Dragon Tail to prevent Calm Mind Sigilyph from turning the tables on it. Reuniclus is also powerful and immune to burn, while being bulky enough to shrug off repeated assaults and even beats Sigilyph in Calm Mind wars, although switching directly into Life Orb Shadow Ball usually means it loses. Cresselia either annoys Sigilyph with Thunder Wave or Ice Beam, or beats Sigilyph in a Calm Mind war, although Cresselia is annoyed by burn. Lastly, Meloetta has excellent special bulk to take any hit Sigilyph can throw at it, can set up with it with Calm Mind, and can KO Sigilyph in return with either Shadow Ball or Thunderbolt. Defensive varients of Meloetta can use Perish Song to force Sigilyph out.

**Faster Pokemon**: While defensive Pokemon are at an inherent disadvantage against Sigilpyh, speedy offensive Pokemon have considerably less trouble with it, as their strong attacks pressure Sigilyph to choose between attacking or healing. Those with super effective attacks, such as Jolteon, Sharpedo, and Cincinno, fare even better against Sigilyph, retaliating for a swift KO. Keep in mind that most faster attackers are greatly hindered by Sticky Web, and special attackers risk being unable to revenge Calm Mind Sigilyph should it have gained boosts and kept its health high.
