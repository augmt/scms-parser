Overview
########

Feraligatr is a powerful setup sweeper, with Dragon Dance increasing the power of its moves to immense levels and boosting its Speed. Another option Feraligatr has is Swords Dance, which bolsters Feraligatr's Attack even more than Dragon Dance does. Feraligatr's STAB moves, Waterfall and Aqua Jet, are insanely powerful when Feraligatr dips into Torrent range as well. Its typing is good in general, giving it many resistances and only two weaknesses. Feraligatr's movepool is quite large, with access to moves such as Ice Punch and Earthquake; this adds a level of versatility and unpredictability to Feraligatr. Feraligatr really shines as a wallbreaker against stall teams thanks to its impressive power that enables it to break through many common defensive threats, such as Audino and Aromatisse. However, Feraligatr has a mediocre Speed stat which leaves a lot to be desired. Feraligatr's bulk is passable, but it really isn't that fantastic. Feraligatr tends to attract status, especially Will-O-Wisp, which completely cripples it, cutting its Attack stat in half. Sheer Force, Feraligatr's Hidden Ability, is still unreleased, forcing Feraligatr to run Torrent.

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Ice Punch / Crunch
move 4: Earthquake / Crunch
ability: Torrent
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Dragon Dance boosts Feraligatr's Attack and Speed, transforming it into a powerful and fast threat. Waterfall is the STAB move of choice thanks to its reliability and power; it has great coverage all on its own and hits prominent stall threats such as Meloetta and Aromatisse quite hard. Both of these aforementioned Pokemon also have a lower Defense stat, which Feraligatr can prey on. Ice Punch hits Grass-types, such as Amoonguss and Virizion, which resist Feraligatr's STAB moves. Earthquake nets nice coverage, hitting Electric-type switch-ins, and is also a very reliable move with a high Base Power. Another viable option is Crunch, as it allows Feraligatr to break through Jellicent and Slowking, which otherwise wall Feraligatr. Finally, Return can be used, as it also hits Slowking, along with other bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Qwilfish, although the latter is hit hard by Earthquake anyway.

Set Details
========

The listed EVs aim to make Feraligatr as fast and as powerful as it can possibly be. A bulkier spread could be run to ease setup, but this is not recommended because Dragon Dance Feraligatr should focus more on power and Speed instead of bulk. 4 Defense EVs allow Feraligatr to take minimum entry hazard damage. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed Jolteon at +1, which Feraligatr fails to do if running an Adamant nature. An Adamant nature could be used if paired with Dugtrio to eliminate Jolteon, but it's generally advised to run Jolly for the extra Speed. Lum Berry is the preferred item, as it saves Feraligatr from a status affliction once. This is extremely useful against bulkier Pokemon that often spread status, such as Aromatisse, to enable Feraligatr to set up with ease. Lum Berry also shields Feraligatr from two common status moves, Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, which completely cripple Feraligatr otherwise. A Life Orb is also viable because of its increased damage output, but Lum Berry is often more beneficial in the long run.

Usage Tips
========

Feraligatr is best saved until later in the match when all possible revenge killers are taken out or weakened, or when Feraligatr has enough HP to stomach a hit from revenge killers. A general rule of thumb is to never set up until later in the match, as Feraligatr is quite strong even without boosts. Just attacking lets Feraligatr fake a Swords Dance set. Another thing to be careful about is the setting up itself. Setting up at inopportune times can create free turns for the opponent. Perhaps the most important thing when setting up is to never be greedy. Getting up one Dragon Dance is often enough, and while trying to set up more, Feraligatr could be KOed.

Team Options
========

Knock Off support is useful, as it removes Choice Scarf from any Pokemon that might be carrying it and weakens Pokemon in the process; it also removes Leftovers, many bulky Pokemon's form of recovery, making it easier for Feraligatr to sweep. Some Pokemon that can provide Knock Off support include Hitmonlee and Mega Banette. Rotom-C has nice synergy and cripples bulkier Pokemon by Tricking them a Choice Scarf and removing their Leftovers. Rotom-C is also a good partner because it can bring in Feraligatr with a safe Volt Switch, which also has an added benefit of hurting Water-types. Entry hazard support from Omastar is useful to wear down bulkier Pokemon as they switch in. Registeel is another hazard setter that works well, being able to spread Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats.

Bulky Swords Dance
########
name: Bulky Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Aqua Jet
move 4: Return / Ice Punch
ability: Torrent
item: Leftovers / Lum Berry / Mystic Water
evs: 196 HP / 252 Atk / 60 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Swords Dance boosts Feraligatr's Attack. With this boost, it can utilize Waterfall, a very powerful and reliable STAB move with a chance to flinch, to great effect. Aqua Jet is a priority move which allows Feraligatr to hit faster Pokemon and pick off weakened opponents. Return is a powerful and reliable move, and gets great coverage all around, hitting Water- and Grass-types that resist Feraligatr's Water-type STAB moves. Ice Punch is another viable coverage option to hits Grass- and Dragon-types for super effective damage. Ice Punch does have a notable power difference from Return, however. Finally, Crunch is a viable option in the last moveslot, hitting Jellicent and Slowking especially hard and coming with a neat chance to lower Defense.

Set Details
========

This set takes a bulkier approach to Feraligatr to aid in setup and allows it to take some hits in the process. Running max Attack and an Adamant nature is necessary to increase Feraligatr's power. 60 Speed EVs enable Feraligatr to outspeed a Gligar lacking Speed investment and hit it before Gligar can land a Toxic. The rest of the EVs are invested into HP for greatest all-around bulk. There are many items that are viable and work well, but the one that stands out is Leftovers, as it provides passive healing which helps Feraligatr set up. It also allows Feraligatr to recover health from hits it might have previously taken in hopes of gaining another chance to set up. Lum Berry is also a viable option thanks to its ability to save Feraligatr from status, but it can only be used once. Finally, Mystic Water is a viable option, boosting Feraligatr's Water-type STAB moves without causing recoil. Speaking of recoil, it is not advised to run Life Orb, as it really compromises Feraligatr's bulk.

Usage Tips
========

This set is best used on bulky offense or stall teams, as Swords Dance provides sheer wallbreaking power. It allows Feraligatr to break down bulkier threats such as Aromatisse and Bronzong. When using Leftovers, try to avoid status as best you can. Toxic sets Feraligatr's lifespan on a timer, while Will-O-Wisp completely neuters its attacks; however, if Lum Berry is run, Feraligatr can be more fearless in the face of potential status moves. Do keep in mind, however, that Lum Berry can only be used once, so do not waste it. It's important to note that Feraligatr can set up on Alomomola, which Feraligatr can break through at +4 with Return. It isn't exactly hard to get to +4 versus Alomomola, and being able to break such a wall is useful for many teams. Prediction is key when it comes to Aqua Jet. Some faster foes might expect Aqua Jet and try to tank it; using Waterfall in this situation is often more beneficial.

Team Options
========

Feraligatr works well with partners that appreciate its wallbreaking capacity; this includes Pokemon like Jolteon that are strong but just not quite strong enough to break through some bulkier Pokemon. Fletchinder has decent synergy with Feraligatr and also enjoys bulkier Pokemon being weakened a bit. Fletchinder also resists Grass-type attacks and beats all relevant Grass-types; however, Fletchinder and Feraligatr do share an Electric-type weakness. Amoonguss resists both of Feraligatr's weaknesses and also provides Spore support, which gives Feraligatr a much easier time in setting up. Entry hazards further wear down bulkier Pokemon for Feraligatr and its teammates. Cobalion is a neat partner in this regard thanks to its ability to set Stealth Rock and also take advantage of bulkier foes being worn down by Feraligatr. Omastar is useful for setting Spikes, but it shares weaknesses with Feraligatr.

Other Options
########

Agility can be used to patch up Feraligatr's subpar Speed stat, but it's not very strong or reliable, and Dragon Dance outclasses it for the most part. Superpower can be used to break through Lickilicky and Audino more easily, but coverage-wise, Earthquake hits most relevant threats harder and Waterfall breaks through Normal-types quite easily. Substitute is useful to block status and ease set up, but this limits coverage severely and Feraligatr will get worn down too quickly. Dragon Tail is a neat option to force switches, but Feraligatr cannot properly utilize it because it's not bulky enough. Dragon Tail does have a unique niche in that it forces any unfavorable switch-ins out, but it's not reliable. Iron Tail is an option to smack Granbull and Aromatisse, but its accuracy isn't great and Waterfall does well enough anyways. Block is a very interesting option to trap Pokemon that have an unfavorable matchup and set up in their face. Ice Beam could be used to smack physically defensive Grass-types, but it's fairly weak coming off Feraligatr's measly 79 Special Attack stat. Aerial Ace is an usable option thanks to its coverage against Grass- and Fighting-types such as Virizion and Abomasnow; however, it's fairly weak otherwise. Finally, Toxic can wear down Alomomola quickly and catch most things off guard.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass- & Electric-types**: Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon such as Virizion and Jolteon have super effective attacks to dispose of Feraligatr. The aforementioned Pokemon are both faster than Feraligatr as well, meaning they can revenge kill it. Some frailer Electric-types, such as Jolteon, do have to watch out for +2 Aqua Jet.

**Status**: All forms of status are a huge detriment to Feraligatr, especially Will-O-Wisp. Will-O-Wisp neuters Feraligatr's Attack stat, while Toxic halts Feraligatr's sweep by setting its life on a timer. Thunder Wave is a bother, as the Speed drop and full paralysis chance can leave Feraligatr very vulnerable. Lum Berry is Feraligatr's one-time ticket to safety when hit with a status move, but it leaves Feraligatr without an item and can only be used once.

**Water-types**: Water-types resist Feraligatr's STAB attacks, and many have the bulk to sponge Feraligatr's coverage. Jellicent, in particular, is completely immune to Waterfall and is not hit hard by any of Feraligatr's coverage, bar Crunch. On top of this, Jellicent can burn Feraligatr, neutering its Attack. Some other bulky Water-types that trouble Feraligatr include Alomomola, Gastrodon, and Slowking, although the latter can also be handled through Crunch.

**Heliolisk**: Heliolisk gets a special mention because it's a great check to Swords Dance sets and unboosted Dragon Dance sets. Thanks to its ability, Dry Skin, Heliolisk is completely immune to Feraligatr's Water-type STAB moves and can massively dent Feraligatr with Thunderbolt. Heliolisk can even use Feraligatr to gain momentum through Volt Switch, but bulky Feraligatr can survive the hit.
