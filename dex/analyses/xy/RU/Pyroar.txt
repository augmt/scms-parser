Overview
########

With its unique typing, Pyroar manages to find itself a niche in the RU metagame as a strong offensive Doublade check, as it is immune to Ghost-type moves. This, coupled with strong STAB moves and great Speed, makes Pyroar a good offensive Pokemon. However, it faces competition from other Fire-types such as Delphox and Moltres, which have much more utility. Pyroar also has a very limited movepool, a weakness to Stealth Rock, and quite shocking frailty.

Moves
========

Fire Blast is the STAB move of choice for hitting Steel-types, most notably Doublade, while also hitting Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth extremely hard. Hyper Voice is a reliable secondary STAB move that is also able to go through Substitutes. Dark Pulse is a decently powered coverage move to hit the likes of Slowking and Jellicent. Lastly, Hidden Power Grass rounds off Pyroar's coverage by hitting its most notable weaknesses, including Gastrodon, Rhyperior, Omastar, and Kabutops.

Set Details
========

252 EVs are placed into Speed and Special Attack, Pyroar's most prominent stats, while 4 Defense EVs are used to minimize Stealth Rock damage. A Timid nature is used to keep Pyroar's great Speed tier. Use any ability besides Rivalry, as it is extremely luck-based and could lose you many valuable KOs. Unnerve is a good choice to block Berry use, such as Slurpuff's Sitrus Berry. Choice Specs is the item of choice to allow Pyroar to hit very hard. Life Orb can be used to hit almost as hard, while allowing Pyroar to change moves at the price of a bit of HP.

Usage Tips
========

Pyroar's main niche is being a great offensive check to Doublade, so switch it into Doublade when it's setting up or is an immediate threat to your team. Pyroar has the right moves to beat most things, but it needs some prediction. Use super effective moves on predicted switch-ins. Try to switch Pyroar in as little as possible, as it really doesn't appreciate residual damage. You can use Pyroar as a really strong revenge killer if you have already gotten rid of Doublade, so don't just sacrifice it, as it has a few other uses.

Team Options
========

Psychic-types such as Meloetta and Cresselia appreciate Pyroar's ability to get rid of Doublade with relative ease. Rapid Spinners and Defoggers such as Hitmontop, Golbat, and Gligar make good teammates, as Pyroar does not like entry hazards. Water-types make very good teammates, as they cover Pyroar's Rock and Ground weaknesses while Pyroar can cover their Grass weakness. Alomomola makes a good teammate, as it can provide Wish support and can wear down walls with Toxic. Omastar makes for another good teammate because it can provide hazards for Pyroar and the rest of the team, making picking off weakened Pokemon a little easier. Stealth Rock setters such as Rhyperior, Druddigon, and Cobalion can also help, as they allow Pyroar to get some valuable 2HKOs, such as on Slowking with Dark Pulse.

Other Options
########

Pyroar has a very barren movepool, with very few other options that it can utilize. Flame Charge can be used on a physical set, as it boosts Pyroar's Speed, guaranteeing that it can outspeed any relevant Choice Scarf users. Taunt is an option to allow Pyroar to break walls more effectively, but Pyroar really needs its coverage. Will-O-Wisp can be used, but Pyroar is outclassed as a status spreader by the likes of Mega Banette. Pyroar has a decent physical movepool, so a physically based set with Moxie, Bulldoze, Crunch, Return, and Wild Charge can work, but is generally outclassed. A Substitute + Endeavor set can be used to effectively break down Water-types such as Alomomola and Gastrodon. Lastly, a Choice Scarf set is a possibility, but Pyroar is already fast, so it does not need the boost.

Checks & Counters
########

**Bulky Special Walls**: Cresselia, Meloetta, Jellicent, Slowking, and Moltres can all tank any hit from Pyroar. Cresselia and Meloetta can set up on Pyroar, Slowking can KO it with Scald, and Moltres and Jellicent can take any hit and stall Pyroar out with their respective recovery moves.

**Dugtrio**: Dugtrio is a huge threat to Pyroar, as it can outspeed, trap, and OHKO Pyroar with a STAB Earthquake.

**Priority**: Mach Punch, Aqua Jet, Sucker Punch, and Fletchinder's Acrobatics are all good ways of disposing of Pyroar, due to its frailty.

**Faster Pokemon**: Cinccino, Heliolisk, Cobalion, and Virizion can all outrun and beat Pyroar with their super effective coverage or STAB moves.

**Entry Hazards**: Spikes and Stealth Rock really lower Pyroar's effectiveness, as it does not like residual damage. Sticky Web also hampers Pyroar's ability to beat faster threats, further lowering its effectiveness.
