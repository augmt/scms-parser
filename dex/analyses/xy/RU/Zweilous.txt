Overview
########

Zweilous is one of the few Dragon-types that are viable in RU. Its great typing gives it an immunity to Psychic-type attacks as well as key resistances to Ghost-, Fire-, Electric-, Grass-, and Water-type attacks. This, alongside its solid bulk provided by Eviolite, allows it to effectively take on many top-tier threats, including Delphox, Reuniclus, Sharpedo, Moltres, Meloetta, Magneton, and Doublade. Zweilous's Dark typing and greater bulk lets it stand out from other Dragon-types, such as Druddigon and Dragalge. Hustle also gives Zweilous some nice firepower. However, Hustle's accuracy drop means Zweilous's ability to check certain Pokemon is unreliable, which is a huge letdown. Furthermore, it lacks reliable recovery, forcing it to have to use RestTalk to stay healthy. Its typing leaves it unfortunately weak to the common Fighting-type attacks in the tier, and its reliance on Eviolite for bulk leaves it vulnerable to the common Knock Off. Zweilous also despises Aromatisse, a very common defensive Pokemon in RU, as Zweilous cannot heavily damage it, while Aromatisse can prey on its 4x weakness to Fairy.

RestTalk
########
name: RestTalk
move 1: Crunch
move 2: Dragon Tail
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
ability: Hustle
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Crunch is Zweilous's main STAB move, hitting Psychic-types, which Zweilous is meant to check. Dragon Tail provides a Dragon-type STAB move that phazes out the foe, though Hustle turns Dragon Tail into an unreliable 72% accurate attack. The combination of Rest and Sleep Talk gives Zweilous a semi-reliable way of recovering. Roar can be used if you desire a perfectly accurate phazing move.

Set Details
========

This set functions as a nice glue for stall teams, providing firepower, phazing, and something that beats most Psychic-types. Eviolite increases Zweilous's bulk, boosting its unimpressive 72 / 70 / 70 bulk to good levels. The EVs alongside a Careful nature amplify Zweilous's special bulk, allowing it to take on many threats, (comma) such as Delphox and Reuniclus. A more offensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD with an Adamant nature can be used with Outrage should more power be desired. However, Zweilous can't take on Electric-types or Choice Specs Meloetta as well as it usually would with that EV spread.

Usage Tips
========

This set should be played defensively. Zweilous is a great switch-in to every Psychic-type in the tier barring Cresselia and the rare Jynx. It also takes on the many Electric-types in the tier, though it should avoid switching into Analytic Choice Specs Magneton's Flash Cannon. Zweilous can also check many Water-types, such as Sharpedo and Slowking. Do not let Zweilous get hit by Knock Off, as the loss of Eviolite significantly lowers its bulk. Dragon Tail should be used to shuffle around the opposing team, racking up chip damage on the opposing Pokemon. Rest should be used when your health is getting low, as it allows Zweilous to continuously check the aforementioned Pokemon.

Team Options
========

Weezing, Doublade, and Amoonguss make for great partners to Zweilous, as they can take on Aromatisse and Fighting-types, which threaten Zweilous. In return, Weezing is able to set up Toxic Spikes, which pairs well with Zweilous's Dragon Tail by allowing Zweilous to spread poison through the opposing team, while Doublade can set up on Aromatisse and Cresselia. Aromatisse also checks Fighting-types and provides cleric support, lifting pressure to Rest from some pressure on Zweilous to Rest and waking up Zweilous up with Aromatherapy. Zweilous benefits from entry hazards, as it can wear down the opposing team with the combination of Dragon Tail and entry hazards. Registeel and Rhyperior are good Stealth Rock setters, and Roselia and Qwilfish make for good Spikes users. Qwilfish has near-perfect synergy with Zweilous as well, with Qwilfish resisting Fairy, Fighting, Ice, and Bug and Zweilous resisting Electric and being immune to Psychic. The aforementioned Weezing makes for a good Toxic Spikes setter, allowing Zweilous to spread poison on the opposing team when phazing with Dragon Tail. Ghost-types such as the aforementioned Doublade make good teammates for Zweilous, as they are immune to Fighting-type attacks and block Rapid Spin.

Other Options
########

A Choice Band set can be used on Zweilous, as Zweilous's Outrage rivals the power of the mighty Kyurem-B. However, such a set is inconsistent due to either not having enough power to KO certain Pokemon or the lowered accuracy from Hustle. It also faces competition with Druddigon, which has a way to hit Fairy-types for super effective damage, which Zweilous lacks. A Substitute + 3 attacks set can be used with Crunch, Outrage, and Superpower. This turns Zweilous into a wallbreaker that can avoid priority and status with Substitute. Zweilous has some utility options available, such as Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Taunt. Superpower can be used to hit Steel-types, such as Cobalion and Registeel, super effectively. Ice Fang can hit Gligar harder than any other move that Zweilous can use, and Fire Fang nails Abomasnow, Durant, and Escavalier.

Checks &amp; Counters
########
**Fairy-types**: Aromatisse, Granbull, and Whimsicott can easily switch into Zweilous, as they are immune to Dragon Tail and resist Crunch, and retaliate back with their Fairy-type STAB moves. Aromatisse can also use Zweilous as an opportunity to use Wish or Aromatherapy.

**Fighting-types**: Cobalion resists Crunch and Dragon Tail, and it can use Zweilous as an opportunity to set Stealth Rock, set up as it switches out, or hit Zweilous with a STAB Close Combat. Virizion and Hitmonlee can threaten Zweilous out with their STAB Fighting-type attacks. Cobalion and Virizion also get an Attack boost if they switch into Crunch thanks to their ability, Justified.

**Steel / Bug Pokemon**: Escavalier and Durant can all take two Crunches from Zweilous, resist Dragon Tail, and are able to retaliate with Megahorn and Superpower, respectively.

**Mega Abomasnow**: Mega Abomasnow can take several Crunches thanks to its natural bulk, and proceed to threaten Zweilous out and either fire off a powerful STAB Blizzard or set up a Swords Dance.

**Knock Off**: While Zweilous resists Knock Off, the move removes its Eviolite, significantly lowering Zweilous's bulk.
