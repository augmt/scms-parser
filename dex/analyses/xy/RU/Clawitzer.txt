Overview
########

Clawitzer is an excellent wallbreaker, thanks to fantastic coverage options and a great base 120 Special Attack. Clawitzer also has the ability Mega Launcher, boosting the power of pulse and aura moves by 50%. This means that Clawitzer has access to two 120 Base Power Dark- and Fighting-type moves in Dark Pulse and Aura Sphere, respectively. Clawitzer also has respectable mixed bulk for a wallbreaker, having 71 / 88 / 89 defenses. Clawitzer faces competition from Slowking, who is much bulkier and has access to Regenerator and STAB Psychic. However, Slowking is much less powerful and can't wallbreak as well as Clawitzer. The biggest problem for Clawitzer is its terrible base 59 Speed, which means that it can be easily outpaced and revenge killed.

Wallbreaker
########
name: Wallbreaker
move 1: Scald
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Aura Sphere / U-turn
ability: Mega Launcher
item: Life Orb / Choice Specs
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Scald is the Water-type STAB move of choice, as it not only has a similar Base Power to Water Pulse, but it also has a 30% chance of burning the opponent. Dark Pulse is a useful coverage move that allows Clawitzer to hit common threats it would barely be able to touch otherwise, such as Slowking, Cresselia, and Jellicent. Ice Beam hits Grass- and Dragon-types, namely Amoonguss, Druddigon, and Virizion, for super effective damage. Aura Sphere 2HKOes specially defensive Registeel, and it OHKOes Cobalion and Mega Abomasnow. U-turn is a nice pivot move that gets Clawitzer out of unfavorable situations. With Clawitzer's low base 59 Speed, it also can take a weaker hit and safely bring in another Pokemon.

Set Details
========

Life Orb significantly improves Clawitzer's wallbreaking power, allowing it to hit hard and switch moves. Choice Specs allows Clawitzer to hit much harder, but it comes with the drawback of being locked into one move. Maximum Special Attack investment along with a Modest nature ensures maximum wallbreaking potential. 252 Speed EVs allow Clawitzer to outspeed threats such as Golbat without Speed investment, which is nice because Clawitzer is able to 2HKO Golbat with Ice Beam, stopping it from using Toxic or Defog if hitting it on the switch. The remaining 4 EVs are used in Special Defense so Clawitzer can keep an optimal HP stat for miminizing Stealth Rock damage.

Usage Tips
========

Clawitzer is able to 2HKO most special walls thanks to its great coverage and is therefore extremely helpful against stall teams. There are a number of common Pokemon used on stall teams, such as Alomomola, Aromatisse, Slowking, Cresselia, Jellicent, and Registeel, that allow easy switch-ins for Clawitzer. A downside of using Clawitzer as a wallbreaker is that it is worn down very quickly by Stealth Rock, Life Orb, and Spikes damage. Wish support and hazard control are important so that Clawitzer can be used to its fullest potential. If the opposing team has multiple Clawitzer checks and Stealth Rock is set up on their side, U-turn is a great move that can force a switch, racking up hazard damage.

Team Options
========

As mentioned earlier, Wish support is very helpful for Clawitzer, as Clawitzer can be worn down very quickly without it, especially with Life Orb recoil. Aromatisse is a great partner for Clawitzer, not only restoring its HP by passing Wishes, but also getting rid of any status ailments on the team thanks to Aromatherapy. Druddigon is also a decent partner, as it sets up Stealth Rock and has a nice typing synergy with Clawitzer. Clawitzer also really enjoys Sticky Web support so that it's not useless against fast, offensive teams. Trick Room support from partners such as Bronzong or Aromatisse also helps, as Clawitzer is pretty slow; however, Trick Room only lasts 4 turns, and the setter must switch out and get Clawitzer in safely.

Other Options
########

Assault Vest can be helpful for Clawitzer to be of more use against more balanced and offensive teams. However, the power from Choice Specs or Life Orb will be greatly missed and an Assault Vest also makes Clawitzer a much worse wallbreaker. Expert Belt can be used on the set, but while it may have no recoil, it is also a lot weaker against neutral targets. Hidden Power Grass is another option that can work for Clawitzer to deal with Gastrodon, one of the only things that can effectively wall Clawitzer. Choice Scarf can be a huge surprise to opponents, getting a free KO due to its rarity. However, it can't wallbreak nearly as well, so a fellow wallbreaker is required. Although Water Pulse is boosted by Mega Launcher, Scald is only slightly weaker and has a much more useful side effect in a burn chance. Dragon Pulse helps Life Orb Clawitzer OHKO Druddigon, something Ice Beam doesn't have a chance to do without Stealth Rock. Dragon Pulse also has a chance to OHKO defensive Dragalge after Stealth Rock with Choice Specs equipped. However, it brings no other coverage and a Choice Specs Ice Beam can also OHKO Druddigon after Stealth Rock.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Teams**: Clawitzer often does poorly against more offensive teams, as it is slow even with Speed investment.

**Status and Entry Hazards**: Hazards and status, along with Life Orb recoil, will often wear down Clawitzer before it can do much in the match.

**Grass- and Electric-types**: Grass-types such as Virizion, Tangrowth, Roselia, and Amoonguss hate Ice Beam, but they can switch into just about any other move and deal considerable damage back. Heliolisk can switch into Scald and OHKO Clawitzer back with a STAB attack. Jolteon is not able to switch in, but it can easily revenge kill Clawitzer.

**Escavalier**: Assault Vest Escavalier can easily take a hit from Clawitzer and hit hard back with Knock Off and STAB Megahorn. However, Escavalier hates burns from Scald.
