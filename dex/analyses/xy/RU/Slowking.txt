Overview
########

Thanks to its great special bulk, usable physical bulk, and a typing that gives it useful resistances to common attacking types such as Water, Fighting, and Fire, Slowking is one of the best bulky Water-types in the RU metagame. It is one of the few checks to threatening special attackers such as Moltres and Delphox that can't hope to break it down thanks to its access to Regenerator. Unlike most of the other bulky Water-types in the tier, Slowking is very versatile thanks to its good Special Attack stat and colorful movepool with unique moves for a Water-type such as Fire Blast that make it one of the best Assault Vest users in the tier and one of the best bulky offensive Pokemon. However, Slowking's physical bulk is not the greatest and its typing gives it some annoying weaknesses to common attacking types, which, due to the boost Knock Off has received, make it prone to Pokemon such as Hitmonlee and Gallade.


Special Tank
########
name: Special Tank
move 1: Scald
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Dragon Tail / Grass Knot
ability: Regenerator
item: Assault Vest
evs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpD
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Scald is Slowking's main STAB move, as it has decent Base Power and a burn chance that discourages physical attackers from coming in. It also hits Pokemon that Slowking checks such as Emboar and Moltres for super effective damage. In the second slot, Psyshock is Slowking's secondary STAB move and hits Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Roselia, which resist its other STAB moves, pretty hard. Fire Blast rounds off Slowking's coverage and usually OHKOes Escavalier and Doublade after Stealth Rock and does heavy damage to Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangrowth that are not weak to Psyshock. Dragon Tail is the primary option for the last slot as it is useful to phaze Calm Mind Delphox and Reuniclus before they become too much of a threat to your team, though Grass Knot can be used to hit Water-type Pokemon harder than Slowking's other moves.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs give Slowking a Stealth Rock number and decent all-around bulk thanks to Assault Vest and max Special Attack along with a Modest nature, which is used to let Slowking hit decently hard and take advantage of its great coverage. The leftover EVs are placed in Special Defense to amplify the Assault Vest boost.

Usage Tips
========

You should use Regenerator and Slowking's resistances to keep it healthy and let it act as an offensive pivot, especially against Choice-locked special attackers. However, remember that this Slowking has no Defense investment, so be careful of Pursuit, Knock Off, and physical attackers that have a neutral STAB move, as they can deal a large amount of damage or outright OHKO Slowking; it should only be used to check Pokemon such as Emboar that can't touch it with their main STAB moves.


Team Options
========

This Slowking set is best used in balanced and offensive teams in need of an offensive pivot so Choiced attackers that need something to fall back on when they have to switch out such as Braviary and Delphox are good partners. Entry hazard setters such as Rhyperior for Stealth Rock and Roselia for Spikes have nice synergy with Slowking and are very helpful, as it forces a lot of switches and uses Dragon Tail. On more balanced teams, Aromatisse, which takes Dark- and Bug-type attacks and can get rid of status with Aromatherapy, makes a strong core with Slowking. Drapion and Skuntank are also good partners as they help with Cresselia and Reuniclus which can set up on Slowking if Cresselia or Reuniclus are the last Pokemon or if Slowking lacks Dragon Tail. Gligar appreciates having its Water and Ice weakness covered and can wall physical threats while providing useful Defog support, as multiple layers of Spikes can nullify Regenerator. Amoonguss resists some of Slowking's weaknesses and can form a Regenerator core that is very hard to take down.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Scald
move 2: Psyshock / Fire Blast
move 3: Thunder Wave / Toxic
move 4: Slack Off
ability: Regenerator
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 76 Def / 184 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Scald is Slowking's best STAB move, as it has decent power and its burn chance discourages physical attackers from coming in. It also hits Pokemon that Slowking checks such as Emboar and Moltres for super effective damage. Psyshock is its secondary STAB move and hits Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Roselia, which resist its other STAB move, pretty hard, though Fire Blast can be used instead to get a stronger hit on Escavalier and Grass-type switch-ins. Thunder Wave cripples fast attackers on the switch and Toxic helps with bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Alomomola, but most switch-ins are crippled more by the paralysis from Thunder Wave and the burn from Scald, so it is usually inferior. Slack Off gives Slowking reliable recovery and keeps Slowking healthy when it can't afford to switch out. It also helps to stall if you are running Toxic. Dragon Tail is useful to beat most Calm Mind sweepers such as Reuniclus.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs give Slowking a Stealth Rock number that minimizes residual damage. 184 EVs in Special Defense let Slowking avoid the 2HKO from Timid Life Orb Moltres's Hurricane. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense to let Slowking take a Knock Off from Adamant Life Orb Hitmonlee and OHKO back with Psyshock.

Usage Tips
========

This Slowking is more of a defensive pivot and thus is best fit on balanced and stall teams that need a reliable answer to Fire-type Pokemon such as Moltres. Abuse Regenerator to keep Slowking healthy and spread status without being worn down. Scald is usually the best move to go for on predicted switches as neither of Slowking's checks, such as Drapion or Skuntank, appreciate a burn too much. This Slowking can take some physical hits thanks to its investment in Defense, but strong physical attacks will leave a big dent in Slowking, so switching out in front of strong physical attackers is usually the best option.


Team Options
========
Aromatisse, which takes Dark- and Bug-type attacks and can get rid of status with Aromatherapy, is a very good partner and makes a strong core with Slowking. Registeel can set up Stealth Rock and walls most special attackers Slowking can't deal with very well such as Exploud while appreciating Slowking's ability to wall Fire-types. Weezing can set up Toxic Spikes, freeing a slot for an additional attack or Dragon Tail, and takes most of the physical hits that trouble Slowking really well thanks to its stellar physical bulk. Drapion can set up Toxic Spikes too and can help with Psychic-type Pokemon such as Cresselia and Reuniclus, as it can phaze them if they try to set up on Slowking or hit them hard with STAB Knock Off. Gligar and Golbat, which appreciate having some of their weaknesses covered and can wall physical threats, are also good partners and the Defog support they provide is also useful as multiple layers of Spikes can nullify Regenerator. Finally, Amoonguss and Roselia resist Slowking's Electric and Grass weaknesses and the former can form a Regenerator core that is very hard to take down while the latter can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Scald
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Calm Mind
move 4: Slack Off
ability: Regenerator
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Scald is Slowking's main STAB move, as it has decent Base Power and a burn chance that discourages physical attackers from coming in , thus helping the process of setting up Calm Mind. Psyshock is a reliable secondary STAB move and hits Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Roselia resist Slowking's other STAB move while helping in winning Calm Mind wars. However, Fire Blast can be used for a stronger hit on Escavalier and Grass-type switch-ins. Calm Mind gives Slowking sweeping potential, giving it much-needed power and making it nearly unbreakable on the special side. Slack Off gives Slowking reliable recovery and keeps Slowking healthy while it sets up.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs give Slowking a Stealth Rock number that minimizes the residual damage it takes. Max Defense investment with a Bold nature is used to take physical attacks well while setting up with Calm Mind. Leftovers is the item of choice, letting Slowking heal some damage without having to use Slack Off too frequently.

Usage Tips
========

This Slowking can still take most special hits decently thanks to its natural bulk and can shrug them off with Calm Mind, so you can use it early- or mid-game as a pivot because Regenerator will keep it healthy. You should set up late-game when Dark-type Pokemon and strong physical attackers are gone, as they can easily overpower Slowking while it sets up. This set also hates Toxic, so you should be careful against Alomomola and Bronzong, which commonly use the move.

Team Options
========

This Slowking works well as a win condition in stall teams but it is a nice fit on balanced teams too thanks to its good mixed bulk and ability to form defensive cores with a lot of Pokemon. Physically defensive Aromatisse can take Dark- and Bug-type attacks well and cure Slowking from Toxic with Aromatherapy. Other physical walls such as Gligar are also useful to take on the physical attackers that threaten Slowking, namely Hitmonlee, Drapion, Skuntank, and Doublade. Toxic Spikes support is incredibly useful for Slowking to outlast other Calm Mind sweepers and walls. Roselia and Drapion are good users of the move and can also absorb Toxic Spikes on entry. The first can also use Aromatherapy and the latter can phaze and threaten Psychic-types.

Trick Room
########
name: Trick Room
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Scald
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Psyshock
ability: Regenerator
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Quiet

Moves
========

Trick Room turns Slowking's abysmal Speed into an asset, making it the "fastest" Pokemon in the tier. Scald is Slowking's main STAB move, as it has decent power and a burn chance that can help getting chip damage on Slowking's checks and potentially crippling switch-ins. Slowking doesn't get Hydro Pump, but Surf is an acceptable alternative as it has a bit more Base Power than Scald. Fire Blast OHKOes Escavalier after Stealth Rock damage and does a lot of damage to Grass-type Pokemon that usually wall Slowking. Psyshock is used for additional STAB coverage and to OHKO most Fighting-type Pokemon that have lower Defense than Special Defense, although Nasty Plot can be used as it gives Slowking sweeping potential and the ability to overpower walls. Slack Off can be used to reliably set up Trick Room throughout the game. Slowking should use a 248 HP / 76 Def / 184 SpD spread with a Sassy nature to take hits from a variety of Pokemon and be very reliable during the game. However, this spread can lead to a loss of momentum as it can't hit very hard and gives a free switch to a lot of Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Reuniclus who can start setting up or heal your opponent's team.

Set Details
========

Minimum Speed IVs and a Quiet nature give Slowking 58 Speed, allowing to outspeed everything in the tier. Max Special Attack is to hit hard and soften walls before other Trick Room sweepers come in. Leftovers is chosen for longevity, but Life Orb can be used as Slowking can heal the residual damage with Regenerator.

Usage Tips
========

Setting up Trick Room is the priority to support Slowking and its partners. You should try to switch into your sweeper immediately after setting up Trick Room to give them more turns to wreck your opponent's team.


Team Options
========

Aromatisse can take Dark-type attacks and set up Trick Room reliably thanks to its ability, Aroma Veil, which gives it an immunity to Taunt. Bronzong, Cofagrigus, and Reuniclus are also good setters of Trick Room, but they share weaknesses with Slowking. Choice Band Escavalier and Rhyperior are the fastest Pokemon in the tier with Trick Room up and can decimate most offensive teams while being almost impossible to switch into for balanced ones. Exploud has just enough Speed to work well in Trick Room and can decimate everything with STAB Boomburst. Druddigon can hit really hard with STAB Outrage and has really nice synergy with Slowking. Mega Abomasnow has STAB Blizzard and the coverage to destroy defensive cores. It also has amazing synergy with Slowking.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Trick
move 2: Scald
move 3: Psyshock / Psychic
move 4: Fire Blast
ability: Regenerator
item: Choice Specs
evs: 172 HP / 252 SpA / 84 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Trick is the most important move as it cripples switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Cresselia, limiting their effectiveness. Scald is Slowking's main STAB move, as it has decent power and a burn chance that discourages physical attackers from coming in, but Surf is usable to hit slightly harder. Psyshock is Slowking's secondary STAB move and hits Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Roselia, which resist its other STAB move, but Psychic is an option as it can be used to break Alomomola. In the last slot, Fire Blast OHKOes Escavalier and Tangrowth.

Set Details
========

84 Speed EVs let Slowking outspeed uninvested Rhyperior to OHKO with Scald, but if it is not a concern for your team, you can run 44 EVs to get the jump on uninvested Doublade.
Max Special Attack is used to hit as hard as possible and along with Choice Specs, Slowking has enough power to OHKO some of its offensive switch-ins such as Drapion.

Usage Tips
========

This Slowking can tank resisted attacks and hit back hard. It doesn't really have the investment to stand up to physical and special attacks as well as the other sets, so be careful with switching it in. Regenerator can keep it healthy throughout the game to check Delphox and Fire-type Pokemon in general.


Team Options
========

Aromatisse takes Bug- and Dark-type attacks and can heal Slowking of status afflictions with Aromatherapy. It can also pass a Wish if Slowking is at low health and Regenerator is not enough to take a powerful attack. Gligar and Golbat appreciate their Ice-type weakness covered and can switch into physical attackers with ease. They can also use Defog to remove entry hazards and to make Regenerator more effective. Finally, Amoonguss and Tangrowth can form a Regenerator core and they cover Slowking's weaknesses decently.

Other Options
########

Rocky Helmet can be used on the defensive set to punish physical attackers, but Leftovers is usually better as Regenerator is not enough every time, especially with entry hazards. Slowking can also use other coverage moves such as Ice Beam, Shadow Ball, Focus Blast, Flamethrower, Power Gem, Signal Beam, and Foul Play to hit specific targets, but the moves listed on the sets are better overall. Nasty Plot can be used without Trick Room but Slowking is usually too slow and easy to revenge kill. Iron Defense is an option to patch up Slowking's average bulk, but Calm Mind is usually more effective.

Checks &amp; Counters
########

**Bulky Psychic-types**: Substitute + Calm Mind Cresselia and Meloetta can set up without fearing Dragon Tail thanks to their good physical bulk.

**Special Walls**: Specially defensive Meloetta, Aromatisse, and Lickilicky only fear Trick from Slowking as they are neutral to its STAB moves and bulky enough to take Psyshock. However, those Pokemon can lose over time if Slowking is the last Pokemon or if they don't run Toxic.

**Electric- and Grass-types**: Electric- and Grass-types such as Rotom-C, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss can take most hits from Slowking with ease and hit hard with a STAB move. However, they are shaky counters at best as Psychic, Psyshock, and Fire Blast from offensive sets can hurt them badly.

**Physical Attackers**: Most physical attackers can force Slowking out, preying on its low Defense. Good examples of this are Doublade, Escavalier, Gallade, and Hitmonlee.

**Pursuit**: Drapion, Escavalier, Skuntank, and Spiritomb can trap and leave a big dent in Slowking. They can also use another STAB move like Knock Off and Crunch if Slowking decides to stays in.
