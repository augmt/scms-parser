Overview
########

Slurpuff might appear as harmless as a sweet dessert at first, but looks can be deceiving! With access to Belly Drum and Unburden in combination with a Sitrus Berry, it's not harmless at all. Sadly, its physical movepool is terrible, consisting only of Play Rough and Return; however, its special movepool is rather colorful, comprising Thunderbolt, Flamethrower, and Surf. It has a helpful Fairy typing, but its usefulness is diminished by Slurpuff's mediocre defenses, which make it hard for the cupcake to set up safely. Additionally, Slurpuff is weak and slow without boosts and is countered by most Steel-types in the tier. However, it resists common priority moves like Mach Punch and Sucker Punch, which makes revenge killing it difficult.

Belly Drum
########
name: Belly Drum
move 1: Belly Drum
move 2: Play Rough
move 3: Return
move 4: Substitute / Aromatherapy / Wish
ability: Unburden
item: Sitrus Berry
evs: 52 HP / 252 Atk / 204 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Belly Drum lets Slurpuff's Attack reach insane levels (1136 at +6) at the cost of half its HP, giving it the opportunity to sweep. Play Rough is an obligatory Fairy-type STAB attack, and Return gives it a good way to damage Poison-types like Amoonguss and Golbat. The move in the last slot is up to you. Substitute lets Slurpuff easily set up on forced switches, while Aromatherapy cures annoying burns caused by Scald from Alomomola or Will-O-Wisp from Mega Banette. Additionally, Wish is an option that lets it recover HP after using Belly Drum while outlasting some bulky walls, though Yawn is also viable, as it can force switches and disrupt the opponent's team, giving Slurpuff an opportunity to set up.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack EVs and an Adamant nature are used to ensure maximum possible damage. 204 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Modest Choice Scarf Delphox after Unburden in addition to the rest of the metagame, bar a few faster Choice Scarf users. The rest of the EVs are dumped into HP for a little more bulk, while also giving it an even HP number so that Sitrus Berry activates after Belly Drum. Sitrus Berry is used to ensure Unburden's activation and to give it 75% HP after Belly Drum, making Slurpuff a threat.

Usage Tips
========

Slurpuff should only be sent out when Steel-types have either been severely weakened or eliminated. As it's very hard to set up, try doing so against Pokemon that can't hurt it. This includes a few weak walls such as Aromatisse, Cresselia, and Alomomola. The fourth moveslot in the set also determines what it can set up on. With Aromatherapy, it wouldn't mind being burned or poisoned as much, and thus can use Alomomola and Cresselia as setup fodder. With Wish, it can set up on almost all walls without taking much direct damage, and with Substitute it can easily set up on status moves. Yawn can force switches which creates an opportunity to set up.

Team Options
========

Since the cupcake is able to force a few switches, it appreciates the support of entry hazards. Cobalion and Rhyperior are good at setting up Stealth Rock and have access to strong STAB moves that can take out Steel-types. Pairing Slurpuff with strong wallbreakers such as Delphox, Moltres, and Druddigon works well since they can soften up walls for Slurpuff. Dugtrio is able to trap some Steel-types like Registeel and has Memento to support Slurpuff in setting up. Hitmonlee is also able to bring down Steel-types while providing Rapid Spin support, something that Slurpuff likes since it shouldn't be taking any damage from entry hazards. Meowstic-M and Cresselia have access to the ever-helpful dual screens, while Uxie has dual screens, Memento, U-turn, and Stealth Rock as additional support options.

Other Options
########

Slurpuff has a few other options, but nothing that really stands out. It has access to Calm Mind and a few special moves like Flamethrower, Dazzling Gleam, Surf, and Thunderbolt. With Red Card it can become a special sweeper, but the Belly Drum set is a lot more effective at sweeping. Flamethrower can be used on the Belly Drum set, but the options listed are better, since it won't be doing a lot of damage to Steel-types without investment or boosts anyway. A set with Cotton Guard in tandem with Calm Mind and either Red Card or Sitrus Berry can make Slurpuff very hard to take down, but it suffers from being weak without boosts, and it doesn't have enough coverage with only two moves.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Registeel, Steelix, Escavalier, Bronzong, and Doublade all laugh at Slurpuff's hits while KOing it with their STAB Iron Head. Durant can survive a hit at 100% HP and KO Slurpuff with Iron Head, but will take a big chunk of damage in the process, and the occasional Flamethrower will KO it.

**Some Physical Walls**: Physically defensive Amoonguss can take any hit from +6 Slurpuff, has Clear Smog or Sludge Bomb to either remove its boosts or KO it after Stealth Rock damage, and can use Spore. However, Amoonguss can't survive two Returns in a row. Alomomola can take a hit but can't do much back, same with Cresselia. Physically defensive Golbat with Haze can also give Slurpuff a hard time.

**Offensive Pressure**: The most effective way of countering Slurpuff is to prevent it from setting up by hitting it hard, which will usually stop a sweep. However, even with its bad defenses, Slurpuff's Fairy typing can make it difficult to hit it hard. Additionally, Knock Off removes Sitrus Berry while activating Unburden in the process, and makes it difficult for Slurpuff to set up.
