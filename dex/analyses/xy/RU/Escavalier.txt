Overview
########

Escavalier's high base Attack, great STAB combination, and good coverage make it very difficult to switch into. It can function as an effective Assault Vest tank as well as a fearsome wallbreaker with a Choice Band, while checking many top-tier threats such as Reuniclus and Meloetta. However, due to its lack of reliable recovery, Escavalier is prone to being worn down rather easily as it has to constantly switch into special attacks and entry hazards. Escavalier is also painfully slow, so it almost always has to take a hit before it makes its move.

Assault Vest
########
name: Assault Vest
move 1: Megahorn
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Drill Run / Pursuit
ability: Overcoat
item: Assault Vest
evs: 174 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Megahorn is Escavalier's strongest STAB move, and it hits very hard off of Escavalier's high Attack stat. Iron Head is its secondary STAB move and has decent coverage with Megahorn, hitting the Rock-types as well as the Fairy-types that resist Megahorn. Knock Off hits Ghost- and Psychic-types very hard and has good utility in removing the opponent's held item. Drill Run is Escavalier's only method of hitting Steel- and Fire-types hard, especially Emboar and Cobalion as they resist its STAB moves. Pursuit, on the other hand, is very useful for trapping and eliminating Ghost- and Psychic-types.

Set Details
========

An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs ensure that Escavalier hits as hard as possible. 84 Speed EVs allow Escavalier to outspeed minimum Speed base 30s such as Slowking. The remaining EVs are invested into HP to enhance Escavalier's bulk. Assault Vest turns Escavalier into a very potent special tank; with an Assault Vest, Escavalier can take a Fire Blast from maximum Special Attack Slowking from full health. Overcoat makes Escavalier immune to Spore, Sleep Powder, and other powder-based moves, as well as hail damage. A Brave nature with 0 Speed EVs and IVs should be used if Escavalier is being used on a Trick Room team.

Usage Tips
========

This set fits best on bulky offense and balanced teams that are looking for a special tank with a strong offensive presence. Bear in mind that Assault Vest Escavalier is not a wall. Use it to pivot into resisted or weak special hits and hit back hard. Escavalier should be spamming Knock Off early-game as it cripples its usual switch-ins. Speaking of Knock Off, be wary of opposing Knock Off users, as the loss of Assault Vest severely reduces Escavalier's tanking capabilities. Don't keep Escavalier on anything that could possibly burn it. Although Escavalier can take some weak non-STAB Fire-type moves, don't push your luck, as Escavalier can't take Moltres's or Delphox's Fire Blast.

Team Options
========

A teammate to take on Fire-types is a must. Bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Slowking are good options. The former can keep Escavalier healthy with Wish while the latter can set up Trick Room for Escavalier. They also appreciate the pressure Escavalier puts on opposing Grass-types. A burn is highly detrimental for Escavalier, so a cleric is also a great teammate. Aromatisse can provide Aromatherapy support and has access to Wish, while also having good synergy with Escavalier. Druddigon can threaten opposing Fire-types and can also set up Stealth Rock. In return, Escavalier can take care of Fairy- and Ice-types. Due to having to switch constantly, Escavalier can be worn down by entry hazards easily. Because of this, it appreciates teammates which can use Rapid Spin or Defog. Hitmonlee is a good option as it can also threaten Steel-types which resist Escavalier's STAB moves. In return, Escavalier can trap opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types with Pursuit so that Hitmonlee can freely use High Jump Kick. Kabutops is also a good option as it can take care of Fire-types, and in return, Escavalier can take on Grass-types. Escavalier forces a lot of switches, so Spikes users such as Omastar and defensive Qwilfish are good teammates.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Megahorn
move 2: Iron Head
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Drill Run / Pursuit
ability: Overcoat
item: Choice Band
evs: 174 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Megahorn is Escavalier's strongest STAB move. Choice Band Escavalier 2HKOes Alomomola and OHKOes Tangrowth with Megahorn. Iron Head is the secondary STAB move of choice, hitting Fairies and Rock-types very hard. Knock Off hits Jellicent and Doublade, and it has the added benefit of removing the opposing Pokemon's item. Drill Run is Escavalier's only method of hitting Emboar, Cobalion, and Registeel for heavy damage. Pursuit, on the other hand, is very useful for trapping and eliminating Ghost- and Psychic-types.

Set Details
========

252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature provide Escavalier with as much power as possible. The Speed EVs allow Escavalier to outspeed minimum Speed base 30s. The rest of the EVs are put in HP to enhance its bulk. Choice Band gives this set immense wallbreaking capabilities. Overcoat gives Escavalier an immunity to powder-based moves, allowing it to switch into Spore and Sleep Powder. A Brave nature with 0 Speed EVs and IVs should be used if Escavalier is being used on a Trick Room team.

Usage Tips
========

This Escavalier set fits on bulky offense teams which need an immensely powerful tank and wallbreaker. Use it as a hole-puncher early- to mid-game, so that one of its teammates can clean later. Bring it in on resisted attacks and use Megahorn, unless the opposing team has a bulky Pokemon resistant to Bug. Knock Off is also a very spammable move and cripples Escavalier's usual switch-ins by removing their items as well as chipping away at their health. Drill Run, although useful for hitting Steel- and Fire-types, is a bad move to be locked into, so use it sensibly. Don't let Escavalier take too much damage, or it will go down really fast. Scout for Fire-type moves on the Pokemon that can be usually countered by Escavalier such as Hidden Power Fire on Tangrowth and Amoonguss.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can take on Fire-types are good teammates for Escavalier. Bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Slowking are good options. They can also support Escavalier with Trick Room and Wish, respectively. Aromatisse can provide cleric support with Aromatherapy and also has access to Wish, as well as having good synergy with Escavalier. Escavalier appreciates teammates which can use Rapid Spin or Defog. Hitmonlee is a good option as it can also threaten Steel-types which resist Escavalier's main STAB moves. In return, Escavalier can trap opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types with Pursuit, so that Hitmonlee can freely use High Jump Kick. Kabutops is also a good option as it can take care of Fire-types, and in return, Escavalier can take on Grass-types. Escavalier forces a lot of switches, so Spikes users such as Omastar are good teammates. Escavalier can punch holes in the opposing team, allowing a teammate to sweep late-game. Sharpedo is a good option, as it appreciates the removal of Tangrowth and Alomomola.

Other Options
########

Escavalier does not have many options, other than what has already been listed. It has access to Swords Dance, but it is too slow to take advantage of the boosts. Leftovers can be used, but it will miss the tanking abilities of Assault Vest or the power of Choice Band. A defensive RestTalk set can be used; however, it is done better by Registeel due to the latter's access to Curse.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Fire-type Pokemon such as Moltres and Emboar resist both of Escavalier's STAB attacks and can annihilate it with their own STAB moves. However, Moltres is OHKOed by Choice Band Knock Off after Stealth Rock and Emboar should be wary of Drill Run. Delphox can work too, but due to a Bug neutrality, Dark weakness, and overall physical frailty, it's not as good as Moltres or Emboar.

**Physical Walls**: Gligar can take any attack from Escavalier, but it can't do much in return. Alomomola counters the Assault Vest set, but is 2HKOed by Choice Band Megahorn.

**Burn**: Cofagrigus, Spiritomb, and Fletchinder can burn Escavalier and render it useless for the remainder of the match. Cofagrigus and Fletchinder can also set up on a burned Escavalier with Nasty Plot and Swords Dance respectively.

**Repeated Attacks**: Due to Escavalier's lack of reliable recovery, it can be overwhelmed by repeated hits from strong attackers.

**Fire-type Coverage Moves**: Most Pokemon with a Fire-type coverage moves pressure Escavalier. Slowking and Zoroark are good examples of such Pokemon. Sheer Force Druddigon with Fire Punch is another deadly Escavalier lure.
