Overview
########

With its impressive Eviolite-bolstered bulk and a decent Attack stat, Gurdurr is a very effective bulky attacker. Its access to STAB Drain Punch allows Gurdurr to heal itself, and Mach Punch gives it useful priority that makes it one of the best checks to all the offensive Normal- and Dark-types like Cinccino and Sharpedo that plague RU. The Knock Off buff served it very well, as Gurdurr can now hit Ghost- and Psychic-types without relying on Payback and cripple almost anything by removing its item. However, Gurdurr still struggles with all the Psychic-types that plague the tier, as they can come in on a STAB move and prey on its mediocre Special Defense. Faster Pokemon are also a pain as they put a lot of pressure on Gurdurr, which only has Mach Punch to hit them.

Bulk Up
########
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Drain Punch
move 3: Mach Punch
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Guts
item: Eviolite
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Bulk Up increases both Gurdurr's Defense and Attack, making it progressively harder to KO, and giving it the ability to sweep. Drain Punch is Gurdurr's main STAB move, hitting the Pokemon it checks hard and providing recovery, keeping it healthy through the game. Mach Punch is a STAB boosted priority move used to pick off Pokemon like Sharpedo, Heliolisk, and Cinccino. It is also the best move Gurdurr has to take out faster Pokemon if it has gathered some boosts. Knock Off hits the Psychic- and Ghost-types which wall Gurdurr's STAB moves on the switch-in and can take them out most of the time in combination with Mach Punch. Poison Jab can be used in the last slot to hit Aromatisse, which otherwise completely walls Gurdurr.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP and Attack investment is used to make Gurdurr as bulky as possible while retaining good offensive presence. A spread of 200 HP / 244 Atk / 64 SpD Adamant retains nearly the same physical bulk and Attack, but lets Gurdurr always take a Choice Specs Boomburst from Exploud at full health; however, it is fairly specific and Gurdurr is otherwise worn down quite easily. Guts is the preferred ability for this set as it makes Gurdurr a decent status absorber and lets it take advantage of burns.

Usage Tips
========

Don't set up if bulky Pokemon that resist Fighting-type moves, such as Amoonguss, Aromatisse, and Gligar, are still around, as you can't heal enough with Drain Punch and you will lose in one-on-one situations. Don't switch Gurdurr too many times into the Pokemon it checks, as its lack of Leftovers and vulnerability to Spikes means that it is easily worn down against smarter opponents who put offensive pressure on it.

Team Options
========

Moltres and Delphox can smack common Gurdurr checks such as Amoonguss, Aromatisse, and Gligar with their Fire-type STAB moves, and appreciate Gurdurr dealing with faster Pokemon such as Sharpedo and Cinccino. Pursuit support from Spiritomb is useful to trap Psychic-types, like Meloetta and Delphox, that can easily check Gurdurr. Finally, Steel-types such as Doublade are awesome partners, as they can freely switch in and set up on Aromatisse.

Other Options
########

Gurdurr can use Iron Fist as the ability of choice, as it powers up Drain Punch and Mach Punch. If you use Iron Fist, Ice Punch becomes a good option in order to hit Amoonguss and Gligar quite hard. Rock Slide and Thunder Punch can be used as well to hit Moltres and Fletchinder on the switch. A Sheer Force set can work too, since it powers up the elemental punches, but it is outclassed by Iron Fist, which also boosts Drain Punch and Mach Punch.

Checks &amp; Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types such as Aromatisse and Granbull can take any hit from Gurdurr and 2HKO back with a STAB move.

**Psychic-types**: Psychic-types such as Delphox, Meloetta, and Sigilyph struggle to switch in because they take major damage from Knock Off, but they can easily take a Mach Punch, outspeed, and OHKO with Psychic.

**Flying-types**: Flying-types such as Moltres and Gligar hate losing their item, but can usually take repeated hits from Gurdurr and beat it 1v1 unless it's packing Ice Punch or Rock Slide.

**Offensive Pressure**: Hard hitters, especially from the special side, such as Clawitzer and Jolteon, can prey on Gurdurr's lower Special Defense and 2HKO it with their powerful STAB moves.
