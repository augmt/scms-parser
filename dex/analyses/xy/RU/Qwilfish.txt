Overview
########

Qwilfish has proves its worth as one of the best Spikers in the RU tier by checking thanks to its solid defensive typing and an excellent ability in the form of Intimidate that lets it check several common Pokemon such as Hitmonlee, Escavalier, and Emboar by virtue of its solid defensive typing and an excellent ability in Intimidate. Qwilfish also has access to disruptive options such as Taunt, which stops opponents from setting up on Qwilfish, and Thunder Wave, which cripples faster, Speed-reliant opponents. Qwilfish also has semi-reliable recovery in Pain Split. While Qwilfish’s typing gives it unique resistances, its downside is that it leaves Qwilfish vulnerable towards the somewhat common Electric-, Ground-, and Psychic-type moves. Rhyperior, Jolteon and Meloetta should be avoided as they’ll OHKO Qwilfish.

Lead
########
name: Lead
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Pain Split
move 3: Waterfall
move 4: Taunt / Thunder Wave
ability: Intimidate
item: Black Sludge
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Spikes is the most important move on Qwilfish because it racks up residual damage on the opponent's team as the match goes on, and thanks to Qwilfish's typing and ability, it gets plenty of chances to set up layers. Waterfall prevents Qwilfish from becoming setup bait due to its solid neutral coverage, backed by a solid base 95 Attack stat. Pain Split is Qwilfish's best method of recovery. Taunt denies the opposing Pokemon the opportunity to set hazards or boost itself. Alternatively, Qwilfish can use Thunder Wave to paralyze foes, heavily crippling faster, Speed-reliant, offensive Pokemon that might try to switch into Qwilfish, making them much easier to deal with later on in the match.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread allows Qwilfish to last as long as possible, maximizing its physical bulk with an Impish nature. However it can also run a EV spread of 252 HP / 212 Def / 44 Spe which allows it to outspeed and prevent Golbat and Gligar from using Defog with Taunt. Black Sludge is the only item that should be used, giving Qwilfish passive recovery, and discouraging opponents from swapping a Choice item to you by dealing damage to any non-Poison-type holder.

Usage Tips
========

Lead with Qwilfish, and start setting up Spikes. Switch Qwilfish in to trigger Intimidate for an Attack drop, and switch it out when you anticipate you will need an Attack drop later on. However, this needs to be done carefully to avoid getting it worn down too quickly through free damage from opposing hazards and enemy attacks. Switching Qwilfish in also absorbs Toxic Spikes. Use Taunt on opponents often to shut down opposing walls.

Team Options
========

Qwilfish is playing a supportive role, so it's going to need teammates that can help it survive out in the battle. Gligar, Rhyperior, Gastrodon, and Dugtrio make great partners to switch into because of their immunity to Electric-type attacks. Gligar, in particular, has excellent type synergy with Qwilfish by taking Electric- and Ground-type moves aimed at Qwilfish, and Qwilfish reciprocates by taking Ice- and Water-type moves directed at Gligar. Sharpedo, Drapion, and Pangoro also make great partners because of their immunity to Psychic-type moves.

Focus Sash
########
name: Focus Sash
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Waterfall / Toxic Spikes
move 4: Destiny Bond / Explosion
ability: Intimidate
item: Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Spikes is a great entry hazard that provides residual damage, making opponents think twice about switching in and out. It's also great for getting rid of opposing Focus Sashes. Taunt prevents an opponent from laying entry hazards down or inflicting Qwilfish with status. Waterfall gives Qwilfish coverage against Ground-types and Rock-types; it also allows Qwilfish to fend off attackers and not be setup bait. Destiny Bond is available for Qwilfish to take out leads, hazard setters, spinners, or even defoggers. Alternatively, Explosion can be used to prevent Rapid Spin users from spinning hazards away. Qwilfish can also utilize Toxic Spikes for Poison or Toxic damage.

Set Details
========

This spread is used to maximize Qwilfish's Speed and damage with a Jolly nature. This is necessary for Qwilfish to be an offensive threat. Focus Sash is used to make sure it can survive a crippling blow and manage to get an extra layer of Spikes, use Destiny Bond, or get in an extra attack.

Usage Tips
========

Qwilfish can be used as a suicide lead or a hazard setter, being able to offer support or take out a threatening lead. Switch Qwilfish out to bulkier teammates to preserve it to lay down entry hazards again in case they get removed. Qwilfish can also be used to clear the field of any Toxic Spikes, leaving your team free of instant poison and toxic damage. You can also take advantage of Destiny Bond by using it the turn your Focus Sash activates. Destiny Bond may cause the opponent to second guess whether they want to sacrifice their Pokemon or make a switch towards another Pokemon. If the opponent attempts to switch, you can throw an extra layer of Spikes down, attack them, or even use Taunt to prevent them from using any status moves.

Team Options
========

Qwilfish works well with offensive teammates such as Rhyperior and Hitmonlee, because it provides them hazards, allowing them to have less of a problem getting rid of opponents. Qwilfish also relies on teammates that are immune to its weaknesses. Rhyperior, Gastrodon, and Dugtrio are great partners for Qwilfish to switch into because of their immunity to Electric-type attacks. Dark-types like Sharpedo, Drapion, and Pangoro are immune to the Psychic-type attacks that take out Qwilfish with ease. Pangoro can also use Parting Shot, which, when coupled with Intimidate from Qwilfish, causes the opponent's Attack and Special Attack to drop significantly.

Other Options
########

Qwilfish can also run Rain Dance and a Damp Rock to give itself Speed with Swift Swim and provide other Swift Swim or Hydration Pokemon weather for support. Additionally, with Rain Dance, Qwilfish can also use Swords Dance to increase its Attack. It can use moves such as Bounce to paralyze and counter Fighting-types, Poison Jab for a great STAB attack to get rid of Fairies such as Aromatisse and Slurpuff, and Aqua Jet for priority STAB-boosted damage. Qwilfish can also catch opponents by surprise by running Scald to burn opponents while having Intimidate to cripple the opposing Pokemon's Attack significantly. Scald can cause problems for Escavalier as well, as the burn damage and Intimidate can cripple its Attack. Scald works more effectively against Rhyperior and Dugtrio, though they can still take a hit. Additionally, Hydro Pump can be used damage Rhyperior and Dugtrio, leaving them at significantly low health.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ground-types**: Rhyperior can tank Qwilfish's hits and can take out Qwilfish or damage it significantly. Dugtrio is also deadly as it can trap Qwilfish and outspeed it to KO. Gastrodon can also wall Qwilfish because of Storm Drain and its immunity to Thunder Wave.

**Strong Special Electric-types**: Heliolisk can counter and wall Qwilfish with its strong special attacks and Dry Skin. Jolteon can also counter it with its Speed, immunity to Thunder Wave, and STAB Thunderbolt or Volt Switch from its high Special Attack.

**Psychic-types**: Slowking and Meloetta both have some merit because Slowking's defenses can wall Qwilfish, while Meloetta is fast and can take Qwilfish out with its Speed and deadly Special Attack. Xatu can also cause Qwilfish problems with Magic Bounce as Qwilfish can't set entry hazards down nor can it inflict it with status.
