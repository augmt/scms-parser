Overview
########

Hitmontop stands as one of the premier defensive entry hazard removers in the tier. With access to both Rapid Spin and Foresight, Hitmontop has no trouble removing these entry hazards either, even against Ghost-types. Intimidate and good 50 / 95 / 110 bulk give it merit on defensive and balance teams alike and help it take on common Pokemon such as Drapion, Shiftry, Tyrantrum, and Kabutops. Unfortunately, a lack of recovery outside of Leftovers and only above-average bulk mean that Hitmontop can struggle to continually switch into offensive Pokemon without Wish support. Hitmontop is also very vulnerable to status, which many of the common Ghost-types Hitmontop spins against carry. This is exemplified by Toxic Spikes, as Hitmontop often has to switch into them in order to spin them away. Finally, Hitmontop faces decent competition from Golbat, Pelipper, and Togetic, all of which have reliable recovery to keep them healthy throughout the match.

Moves
======

Rapid Spin gives Hitmontop a way to remove harmful entry hazards for its team, helping many different Pokemon switch in. Close Combat provides a strong STAB move that hits decently hard and prevents Hitmontop from becoming setup fodder. Foresight allows Hitmontop to use Rapid Spin against opposing Ghost-types, guaranteeing entry hazards are removed. It can also allow Hitmontop to hit Pokemon such as Doublade with Close Combat for decent damage. Toxic is the preferred move in the fourth slot, crippling common switch-ins such as Cresselia, Whimsicott, Mega Banette, and Jellicent and putting them on a timer. Earthquake is a strong option over Toxic that can hit Garbodor and Qwilfish while also breaking Durant's and Cobalion's Substitute without having to worry about the defensive drops that come with Close Combat.

Set Details
========

Maximum HP and Defense investment with an Impish nature ensure that Hitmontop can take physical attacks, such as Knock Off and Stone Edge, as easily as possible. Intimidate also assists Hitmontop in better taking physical attacks. Leftovers provides passive recovery, which is important, as Hitmontop has no reliable recovery and will usually be switching into entry hazards to remove them.

Usage Tips
========

If your opponent has entry hazards up on your side of the field and a Ghost-type, it can be smart to use Foresight as your opponent switches so that Hitmontop can immediately Rapid Spin. Some people may even try to play around Foresight by switching in a non-Ghost-type, so it's important to play smart and continually mix your opponent up with your Foresight usage. Keep a careful watch of Hitmontop's HP at all time, and be sure Hitmontop can deal with any Pokemon it switches into. For example, don't switch Hitmontop in on a Hitmonlee not using Knock Off, or Hitmontop will get worn down quickly. While Hitmontop can Rapid Spin against Doublade, it is not advised, as Doublade can Swords Dance on the Rapid Spin and proceed to do heavy damage to your team. Finally, be wary of spamming Close Combat, as the defensive drops can allow opposing Pokemon to secure a KO.

Team Options
==========

Alomomola, Aromatisse, and Audino are some of the best Wish passers in the tier and are great at keeping Hitmontop healthy throughout the match. Status conditions, such as poison and burn, remain a constant annoyance throughout the match should Hitmontop be afflicted. This makes Aromatisse, Audino, and Lanturn good partners, as they can all utilize Heal Bell to cure Hitmontop's status conditions. Hitmontop struggles against Psychic-types, making Spiritomb, Drapion, and Escavalier good partners to deal with them. Flying-types can be troublesome for Hitmontop, making Rhyperior and Eelektross helpful teammates. Fairy-types are also a problem, especially Slurpuff, which can set up on Hitmontop for free. Doublade, Bronzong, and Mega Steelix deal with these Pokemon well, making them good partners. Pursuit users such as Spiritomb, Houndoom, and Drapion can trap Ghost-types and help Hitmontop rely less on Foresight. Houndoom is especially noteworthy, as it appreciates Hitmontop's ability to Rapid Spin away Stealth Rock. Finally, Poison-types such as Drapion, Qwilfish, and Garbodor pair extremely well with Hitmontop, as they soak up the Toxic Spikes Hitmontop hates. Hitmontop's access to Rapid Spin also makes it a much better fit for these Pokemon than a Defog user.

Other Options
##########

Protect is another option in the fourth slot in order to accumulate Leftovers recovery and scout out the foe's moveset. Sucker Punch can be used to give Hitmontop a decently powerful priority move to pick off weakened Pokemon, though it's pretty weak overall and many Pokemon have ways to get around it. Stone Edge is also an option to hit Flying-types, such as Fletchinder and Braviary, on the switch. However, many of these Pokemon can outspeed Hitmontop and Roost off the damage. Rest with or without Sleep Talk can give Hitmontop a healing option and help it rely less on Wish support, though it takes up precious moveslots that Hitmontop would rather use for other moves. Finally, an offensive Technician set with moves such as Mach Punch and Fake Out might look appealing, but it's 100% outclassed by Medicham, Sawk, and especially Hitmonlee, all of which are stronger, faster, and, in Hitmonlee's case, have access to Rapid Spin.

Checks & Counters
#############

**Psychic-types**: Reuniclus makes for a great answer to Hitmontop, as it takes no damage from Toxic due to Magic Guard and can either use Hitmontop as Calm Mind or Trick Room setup bait or just attack with a super effective Psychic. Sigilyph also has access to Magic Guard but must be wary of the rare Stone Edge. Other than that, Meloetta, Cresselia, and Slowking all have super effective attacks but hate Toxic, and Delphox can either OHKO Hitmontop or set up on it assuming it's not carrying Earthquake or Stone Edge. Hitmontop can do decent damage to some of these Pokemon with Sucker Punch, however.

**Fairy-types**: Slurpuff can use Hitmontop as setup bait and only really dislikes Toxic, which it can avoid with Substitute. Aromatisse not only hard walls Hitmontop but can also cure Toxic with Heal Bell, making it another great counter. Finally, Whimsicott can do great damage with Moonblast, Encore Hitmontop into a move such as Rapid Spin or Foresight, and even use Memento to turn Hitmontop into even greater setup bait.

**Flying-types**: Fletchinder can both burn Hitmontop and use it as setup bait as long as Hitmontop doesn't have Stone Edge. However, Fletchinder hates Toxic, and it must be careful with using Roost against Hitmontop, as unburned Hitmontop's Earthquake does a lot of damage. Golbat can wear Hitmontop down with Toxic and Super Fang, as well as hit it with a super effective Brave Bird. Both Golbat's specially and physically defensive spreads take little from Stone Edge and Earthquake, meaning Golbat can continually Roost off the damage. Finally, Braviary receives a Defiant boost from Intimidate and can OHKO Hitmontop with Brave Bird. It can also use Hitmontop as Bulk Up fodder, even if Hitmontop carries Stone Edge, and can avoid Toxic with Substitute.

**Residual Damage**: Status moves, such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, can slowly wear Hitmontop down into KO range for another Pokemon. Ghost-type Pokemon have the easiest time getting these moves off, as Hitmontop will have to stay in for two turns in order to Rapid Spin against them. While Hitmontop does resist Stealth Rock, multiple layers of Spikes and Toxic Spikes will make quick work of Hitmontop, especially if it's not given the opportunity to Rapid Spin. Otherwise, constant pressure from most offensive Pokemon will whittle down at Hitmontop's HP enough to where KOing it should be little trouble.
