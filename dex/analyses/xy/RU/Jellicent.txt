Overview
########

Jellicent boasts several uncommon qualities that, in the past, allowed it to hold its own in higher tiers. Its great Water / Ghost typing allows it to function as a spinblocker as well as a check to many common Pokemon such as Cobalion and Escavalier. Access to reliable recovery and utility moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Taunt allows Jellicent to wear down walls. Jellicent is also an excellent Moltres counter that doesn't lose to Pursuit and Arena Trap users thanks to Will-O-Wisp. However, Jellicent's typing can be readily exploited by Knock Off users, as well as common Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon. In addition, Jellicent's bulk, while decent, falls short of that of other bulky Pokemon in the tier, leading to severe competition from the likes of Slowking and Alomomola. Jellicent's role as a spinblocker is also rather shaky, as Defog is quite common.

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Scald
move 2: Will-O-Wisp
move 3: Recover
move 4: Taunt
ability: Water Absorb
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 212 SpD / 44 Spe
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Jellicent can inflict burns with both Scald and Will-O-Wisp, which which makes up for its uninvested physical bulk. Recover is mandatory to keep Jellicent's health up through the duration of the match so that it can repeatedly switch in without being worn down. Taunt is an excellent choice in the final slot, as it shuts down most defensive Pokemon such as Registeel, as well as various entry hazard setters. Jellicent's main niche is using the combination of Taunt and Will-O-Wisp to wear down bulky Pokemon. Shadow Ball can be used instead of Scald to hit the likes of Slowking relatively harder than Scald. Ice Beam is also a decent option to target Grass-types such as Virizion and Amoonguss, while Toxic can be used to cripple special attackers such as Slowking.

Set Details
========

A specially defensive EV spread with a Calm nature bolsters Jellicent's already good special bulk, making it a formidable wall. Jellicent has two excellent abilities; Water Absorb is preferred, as it provides an immunity to Water-type moves, notably Scald. Cursed Body is viable and can be particularly useful against foes that only have one move to significantly damage Jellicent with. In these situations, Jellicent can often stall with Recover until Cursed Body activates.

Usage Tips
========

This set focuses more on walling special attackers such as Moltres than on blocking Rapid Spin. Without Defense investment, Jellicent is much more vulnerable to Knock Off; however, Jellicent can still check some physical attackers such as Fletchinder and Rhyperior, due to its typing. Jellicent can be worn down quite easily, so try to keep it healthy with Recover or simply avoid trying to check too many threats at once. It is important to be wary of special attackers that can hit Jellicent's weaker defense, such as Delphox and Reuniclus with Psyshock.

Team Options
========

Jellicent works best on defensive or balanced teams that need checks to threats such as Moltres. Granbull is a good partner to absorb Knock Off and handle physical attackers, while Jellicent can switch in on Fire-types that are troublesome for Granbull. Grass-types such as Amoonguss can cover Jellicent's weakness to opposing Grass-types. Cobalion makes for a good partner to absorb Knock Off, other Dark-type moves, and physical attacks aimed at Jellicent, while in return Jellicent absorbs some Fire- and Fighting-type attacks for Cobalion. Gligar is a helpful partner to provide Defog support, as Jellicent is quickly worn down by entry hazards. Hitmontop is another good partner for the same reason, as it can provide Rapid Spin support while handling most Dark-types.

Other Options
########

Jellicent can utilize an offensive set with a Choice item and moves such as Energy Ball and Water Spout, aided by Speed support in the form of Trick Room, Tailwind, or Sticky Web. However, such a set is generally outclassed by other offensive Water-types such as Clawitzer. Jellicent can use its low Speed to its advantage by setting up Trick Room, but there are many better Trick Room setters. Magic Coat can be used to deflect status moves and entry hazards, but Jellicent has trouble fitting it into its moveset. Lastly, Trick can be used with a status Orb or Choice item to cripple a defensive Pokemon.

Checks & Counters
########

**Dark-types**: Sharpedo, Drapion, and Knock Off users in general greatly threaten Jellicent with their respective STAB moves. However, most have to watch out for Will-O-Wisp on the switch.

**Bulky Grass-types**: Amoonguss and Tangrowth come in for free on most of Jellicent's moves, and Virizion with a Lum Berry can set up without fearing status.

**Big Hitters**: Kabutops's Stone Edge can 2HKO even defensive variants, as can Druddigon's Outrage, Clawitzer's Dark Pulse, Durant's Crunch, and Emboar's Grass Knot.

**Electric-types**: Rotom-C, Jolteon, Heliolisk, and Magneton all threaten Jellicent with their STAB moves.

**Status**: Toxic quickly wears down Jellicent, while burn slowly chips away at its HP.
