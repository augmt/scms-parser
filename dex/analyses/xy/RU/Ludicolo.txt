Overview
########

While its usage in the upper tiers is fairly situational, Ludicolo's saving grace in RU is its brilliant typing, which gives it neutralities to Grass- and Electric-type moves and immunities to Spore, Sleep Powder and Stun Spore, making it a staple on rain teams. It has an amazing ability in Swift Swim, which lets it outpace every unboosted Pokemon in the tier when under the rain, as well as all Choice Scarf users barring Cinccino and Timid variants of Delphox. In conjunction with its decent Special Attack, good special bulk, and fairly wide movepool, this makes Ludicolo a powerful rain sweeper that acts a great check to defensive threats such as Gastrodon. However, our Mexican pineapple isn't without flaws. First of all, it can only stay in and KO weakened Amoonguss, which hurts one of its bigger niches on rain teams as an absorber of Spore, Sleep Powder, and Stun Spore, and it is OHKOed by unboosted Fletchinder's priority Acrobatics, meaning that Fletchinder can come in and easily revenge kill Ludicolo. Additionally, Ludicolo is weak to the ever-present U-turn and is forced out by the majority of common users of the move &mdash;a factor which makes it harder for Ludicolo to switch in repeatedly. Additionally, Ludicolo absolutely despises status as it wears it down very quickly in conjunction with Life Orb recoil or, in the case of paralysis, neuters its sweeping capabilities.

Moves
========

Hydro Pump is Ludicolo's main STAB move, OHKOing or 2HKOing almost anything that doesn't resist it in the rain. However, it is fairly inaccurate, so Surf can be used if you prefer accuracy over power. Please note, however, that Surf is more reliant on rain than Hydro Pump to deal heavy damage, and it should only be used on dedicated rain teams. Giga Drain is the Grass-type STAB move of choice, healing Ludicolo and giving it some longevity. This works well alongside Life Orb as it negates the recoil somewhat, and it also helps Ludicolo deal with poison or burn damage for a little longer before being forced out. Ice Beam is absolutely necessary for Ludicolo to deal with opposing Grass-types that resist its STAB combination, as well as Druddigon. This combination of attacks gives Ludicolo perfect neutral coverage against all relevant Pokemon. Finally, Rain Dance is a necessity for Ludicolo as it lets it set up rain and continue its sweep. You can use Focus Blast over Rain Dance for Ludicolo to hit Abomasnow and Ferroseed hard when they switch in, but those are its only targets, and it is far too inaccurate to be recommended; Ludicolo is very reliant on Rain Dance to sweep.

Set Details
========

The EVs are incredibly simple, maximizing Ludicolo's power and Speed, while giving it a Stealth Rock HP number. A Modest nature is used to maximize Ludicolo's power, as a Timid nature isn't needed to outpace anything notable outside of Choice Scarf Cinccino and Timid Choice Scarf Delphox. Life Orb is the preferred item for Ludicolo as it can't afford to be locked into a move with Choice Specs, and it needs the power boost to deal heavy damage with its coverage moves. Leftovers might look great on paper to improve Ludicolo's longevity, especially when you consider its excellent special bulk, but Ludicolo can't do without the power boost Life Orb provides due to its middling Special Attack. Similarly, Damp Rock can be used to give Ludicolo more turns to use the rain it summons, but it suffers from the same downfalls as Leftovers.

Usage Tips
========

Make sure to play Ludicolo conservatively, as it can't afford to take too many hits while switching in despite having Giga Drain and good special bulk. Try to keep it away from Toxic as it will force Ludicolo out very quickly, and in cases where Ludicolo does get hit by status, try and clear it up fairly quickly with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy. However, this shouldn't come at the cost of momentum; the additional residual damage will be worth it if Ludicolo can take down another Pokemon or two. Ludicolo is best brought in on a slow U-turn, Volt Switch, or Parting Shot or after another Pokemon on your team has fainted so as to preserve its HP as best as possible. It is also advisable to keep teammates that can set up rain healthy so that Ludicolo needn't waste a turn on Rain Dance. Furthermore, Ludicolo walls most bulky Water-types cold, so it can switch in on them to set up Rain Dance, even if it gets hit with Toxic in the process; in any case, if Ludicolo can't sweep yet, a fellow rain attacker can make use of the rain to soften up Ludicolo's counters or pull off a sweep itself.

Team Options
========

Ludicolo works well on hyper offense, bulky offensive, and balanced teams. Build around it accordingly to maximize the success that it can achieve. Pokemon that resist Flying, such as Omastar, Kabutops, and Registeel, are useful to prevent Fletchinder from taking out Ludicolo. The former two also have great synergy with Ludicolo, benefiting from the rain with their own Swift Swim and thus keeping up offensive pressure. Rain setters like Volbeat, Liepard, and Uxie are great partners for Ludicolo, with the former also being able to Baton Pass Tail Glow boosts. Speaking of Baton Pass, Gorebyss is a great Shell Smash passer, capable of boosting Ludicolo's offensive presence to terrifying levels while also getting a Swift Swim boost if the rain is up. Clerics like Lanturn and Aromatisse can keep Ludicolo free of status, ensuring that paralysis doesn't cut its sweep short. Slow users of Volt Switch, U-turn, and Parting Shot, such as Pangoro and Eelektross, and users of self-KO moves, such as Accelgor and dual screens Uxie, are great for getting Ludicolo in safely. Thunder users such as Jolteon, Heliolisk, Rotom-C, and the aforementioned Eelektross benefit from the rain, receiving 100% accuracy on said move. Finally, entry hazards are incredibly useful for Ludicolo, most notably Spikes as they can wear down grounded walls such as specially defensive Ludicolo and Roselia. This makes the aforementioned Accelgor and Omastar amazing teammates for Ludicolo.

Other Options
########

Ludicolo has a wide movepool, giving it plenty of potential roles. However, it is outclassed in the vast majority of these roles by other Pokemon. Choice Specs is a decent option to ease prediction on switches, but Ludicolo needs the ability to switch moves to reliably sweep. An Assault Vest set with Giga Drain, Scald, Ice Beam, and either Hidden Power Fire or Focus Blast might seem appealing due to Ludicolo's high Special Defense and access to STAB Giga Drain and Rain Dish for recovery. However, such a set loses out on the power of Life Orb and the utility of Swift Swim, so it is not recommended. Energy Ball is a more powerful alternative to Giga Drain, but it doesn't gain any notable KOs, and Ludicolo needs Giga Drain to maintain its longevity. A Swords Dance set can be used to catch Ludicolo's usual checks off-guard, but such a set is too reliant on a boost and its surprise value to be viable. Similarly, Ludicolo can use a mixed Hone Claws set with Hydro Pump, Seed Bomb, and one of Drain Punch, Ice Punch or Rain Dance to patch up Hydro Pump's low accuracy, but such a set is gimmicky at best and thus not recommended. A defensive SubSeed set can work as Ludicolo can recover as much as 25% of its max health every turn with Leftovers, Rain Dish, and Leech Seed recovery, but rain stall isn't a very good strategy&mdash;especially without permanent weather.

Checks and Counters
########

**Special Walls**: Amoonguss eats Ludicolo's STAB moves for breakfast and can threaten it back with a STAB Sludge Bomb or Clear Smog. Similarly, specially defensive Registeel and Roselia can wall Ludicolo's STAB moves and the former can also cripple it with Thunder Wave.

**Fletchinder**: While it can't switch into Ludicolo directly without good prediction and luring, Fletchinder can OHKO Ludicolo with an unboosted Acrobatics and ignores Swift Swim with Gale Wings.

**Abomasnow**: Abomasnow resists Ludicolo's STAB attacks and doesn't give a hoot about Ice Beam while clearing Ludicolo's rain. It can even change the weather twice in a row if it hasn't Mega Evolved yet.

**Speed Boost Yanmega**: Yanmega can outpace Ludicolo in the rain after two turns in due to Speed Boost and OHKO it with a STAB Bug Buzz.

**Paralysis**: Ludicolo despises paralysis as this quarters its speed and neuters its offensive presence. This makes Thunder Wave users, such as Registeel, problematic for it.

**Other Forms of Speed Control**: Ludicolo's main niche offensively is Swift Swim, but Trick Room from the likes of Cofagrigus and Reuniclus flips this right on its head. Sticky Web prevents Ludicolo from outpacing the Choice Scarf users that it normally can, although this isn't always an issue for Ludicolo as Sticky Web teams tend to be rather slow in general. Weather setters like Uxie and Liepard can easily stop Ludicolo from sweeping by using Sunny Day, killing Ludicolo's momentum by forcing it to use Rain Dance or switch out.

**Residual Damage**: Entry hazards and status are big issues for Ludicolo as they hurt its already average longevity by wearing it down. Burns and Toxic are nightmares for Ludicolo because of this.

**Priority**: Powerful users of priority moves, such as Zoroark and Hitmonlee, can easily cut Ludicolo's sweep short with Sucker Punch or Mach Punch, respectively.
