Overview
########

Audino's decent bulk, okay typing, ability, and wide defensive movepool allow it to fill certain roles; for example, it is able to function as an effective Wish passer. Audino faces competition from Alomomola, from whom Audino sets itself apart through its access to Heal Bell. Mega Audino can take on the role of a Calm Mind sweeper with Rest and Sleep Talk. However, Audino and Mega Audino both have little to no offensive presence and are thus extremely passive. In offensive roles, Aromatisse is a huge competitor thanks to its higher power and the fact that it doesn't need to Mega Evolve. Mega Audino trades Regenerator for Healer, which also means that it faces problems recovering health due to its lack of Leftovers. Non-Mega Audino's is blessed and cursed with a Normal typing, which provides no resistances in exchange for just one weakness. Audino suffers from a case of four-moveslot syndrome in both forms and is very easily set up on thanks to this; it is also completely shut down by Taunt.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Wish
move 2: Heal Bell
move 3: Protect
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Regenerator
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Wish keeps Audino healthy and can be passed to Audino's teammates for them to recover a large chunk of health. Heal Bell rids Audino's team of status, and is especially helpful for removing poison caused by Toxic. Protect can be useful to scout for moves but is mainly used to ensure Wish takes effect and to allow Audino to slowly recover health via Leftovers; in just two turns, Audino is able to recover 62% of its health, on top of Regenerator, making Audino able to recover 95% health in just three turns. Knock Off is extremely weak, but it is used for its utility in removing Leftovers, Eviolite, and other items. Instead of Knock Off, both Encore and Return are options. Encore prevents Audino from becoming setup fodder, while Return is a consistent and semi-powerful STAB move. However, if you choose to run Encore, Audino will be stopped by Taunt. When using Audinite, Dazzling Gleam should be run in the last slot. If another teammate is already providing Heal Bell or Aromatherapy support, then Toxic is a very useful option in this slot because it means Audino can actually cripple Pokemon it's supposed to wall.

Set Details
========

Audinite is an option because it provides Audino with a fantastic Fairy typing and much more bulk. However, Leftovers and Regenerator give it fair competition. Maximum Special Defense investment is used to better take and pivot out of special attacks from the likes Choice Scarf Moltres, Dragalage, Mega Sceptile, Choice Scarf Meloetta, and Mega Camerupt. A Careful nature is chosen to further increase Audino's bulk. Regenerator is extremely useful because it allows Audino to regain health just by switching and works well in tandem with Wish.

Usage Tips
========

Audino should be played like a typical defensive Pokemon: switch into hits it's able to take and go from there. Abusing Regenerator to the fullest is a good place to start when using Audino; it shouldn't be afraid to switch. If you fear that a setup sweeper is coming in, the best course of option is to immediately switch out to a partner. Wish can be used to recover health, but it's often going to be passed to a teammate. Heal Bell is a bit rarer because status isn't nearly as widespread, but it's useful nonetheless; just don't expect to be using it too often. Protect is useful to scout for Fighting-type coverage and ensure Wish is received, so be sure to take advantage of its uses!

Team Options
========

Steel-types, such as Registeel, Bronzong, and Mega Steelix when not running Audinite, make for good partners because of the synergy between them and Audino. Audino is best used on balanced teams for its cleric capabilities and ability to pass Wish. Amoonguss and Tangrowth both form powerful Regenerator cores that can be quite hard to take down. Alomomola can also take on this role, but it and Audino's roles are very similar and it is a bit redundant to use them together. Typical defensive Pokemon, such as Registeel, Lanturn, Bronzong, Spiritomb, and Tangrowth, that lack instant recovery are good partners as well. Not-so-defensive Pokemon that also appreciate Wish support include Kabutops, Seismitoad, Druddigon, Rhyperior, and Escavalier.

Calm Mind
########
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Rest
move 3: Sleep Talk
move 4: Dazzling Gleam
ability: Regenerator
item: Audinoite
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Calm Mind boosts Mega Audino's Special Defense to very high heights and boosts its mediocre Special Attack to a somewhat threatening level. Rest and Sleep Talk restore Mega Audino's health and remove any harmful status instantly. Sleep Talk can also pick Calm Mind while Mega Audino is asleep to continue to boost. Dazzling Gleam is Mega Audino's attacking move and is used over Hyper Voice because nothing is immune to it and Dazzling Gleam gets very good neutral coverage. Flamethrower is an option to hit Steel-types, but then Mega Audino is walled by Houndoom and gives it free setup turns, and Dazzling Gleam is more useful in general.

Set Details
========

Maximum Defense and HP investment and a Bold nature increase Mega Audino's physical bulk because Clam Mind boosts Mega Audino's Special Defense. Audinite boosts Audino's bulk all-around and gives it a useful Fairy typing. Regenerator is super useful pre-Mega Evolution because it allows Audino to shrug off damage and recover health for later in the match.

Usage Tips
========

Save Mega Evolving Audino until later in the match so it is able to take advantage of Regenerator. After Mega Evolving, Mega Audino is better equipped to take on Dragon-types so keep this in mind when choosing the specific time to Mega Evolve. Mega Audino faces massive competition from Aromatisse, which is more powerful off the bat, has a better typing, and is immune to Taunt, so Audino has to be careful to use Regenerator and its ability to Mega Evolve to the fullest or it runs the risk of being outclassed. Mega Audino's only coverage is Fairy, so don't try to set up too early or Mega Audino will be forced out. Thus, beginning to set up with Calm Mind mid- or late-game is often best so Mega Audino can attempt a sweep on weakened teams. Mega Audino should only use Rest when it is nearing a bit under 40% health if possible, as Sleep Talk can be a bit unreliable and select Rest instead of Calm Mind or Dazzling Gleam. Mega Audino can switch into Knock Off with ease, so it can also take a pivotal role pre-Mega Evolution.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that eliminate Steel-types, which resist Dazzling Gleam, such as Dugtrio and Moltres make for good partners. Other Calm Mind users such as Reuniclus work well because they can use their coverage moves to be a pain for the opposing team. Golbat takes on Fighting-types for non-Mega Audino and is a useful partner to keep entry hazards away and pivot in with U-turn. Powerful hitters such as Mega Glalie and Mega Camerupt are pains for Mega Audino, thus making defensive Pokemon such as Bronzong and Lanturn good partners. Lanturn is also able to bring in Mega Audino via Volt Switch and can use Heal Bell in case Mega Audino is forced out after using Rest.

Other Options
########

Fire Blast is useful to hit Steel-types, but once it is revealed it loses its usefulness. Healing Wish is an extremely useful move for offensive pivoting and bringing a partner with full health. Psyshock hits Poison-types and beats other Calm Mind users one-on-one but gets fairly poor coverage and lacks STAB. Reflect and Light Screen are options as a Regenerator pivot, but it's generally not that useful of a combination and better Pokemon such as Uxie can pull it off. Thunder Wave and Toxic are useful to spread status. Audino can fit on Trick Room teams, as it has access to Trick Room. Shadow Ball could be used as coverage but it's pretty average as a whole. As a weather pivot, Audino could be used, as it learns Rain Dance and Sunny Day, but it's generally mediocre in this role.

Checks & Counters
########

**Setup Pokemon**: Pokemon that are able to set up walk all over Audino because Mega Audino's offensive presence is nonexistent and thus Pokemon such as Substitute Mega Sceptile, Swords Dance Pangoro, Doublade, Swords Dance Escavalier, Nasty Plot Houndoom, and Dragon Dance Tyrantrum give it problems. Mega Sceptile, Pangoro, and Tyrantrum are all hit very hard by Dazzling Gleam from Mega Audino, so they must be wary.

**Taunt**: Dazzling Gleam and Knock Off are weak, so without boosts Audino will fail to hurt much. Taunt also prevents Audno from using Wish or Heal Bell, its main niche. Taunt could come from Pangoro, Drapion, or Golbat, though Pangoro has to watch out for Dazzling Gleam thanks to its 4x weakness.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types, such as Mega Steelix, Bronzong, Cobalion, Doublade, and Escavalier, resist Dazzling Gleam and smack Mega Audino with their STAB moves. These Pokemon are able to pivot into Dazzling Gleam and shrug it off with ease, while Cobalion and Mega Steelix easily shrug off Knock Off.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types hit non-Mega Audino for super effective damage; though they cannot easily break through Mega Audino. These Pokemon have to watch out for Dazzling Gleam, though.

**Phasing and Haze**: Getting Audino off the field will mess up its Wish chain and remove any boosts it has on the Calm Mind set. This could come from Whirlwind Drapion or Roar Rhyperior.
