Overview
########

As a guaranteed means of removing entry hazards, Defog is one of the most important moves in the RU metagame-and as a fairly bulky Pokemon with a good defensive typing and a reliable recovery move, Golbat is one of its best users. It also has serious utility with Infiltrator Toxic, which allows it to cripple threatening boosters such as SubCM Cresselia right through their Substitutes, as well as Super Fang and Taunt, which let it wear down Steel-types like few others and take on defensive Pokemon and hazards users, respectively. Although Golbat walls Grass-types quite well and takes on Fighting-types pretty well with a STAB Brave Bird, its typing unfortunately leaves it open to being hit super effectively by a whole heap of strong offensive types, specifically Electric, Ice, Rock, and Psychic. While Golbat is capable of tanking hits and Defogging away hazards, it often lets entry hazard users, especially the prominent Mega Steelix and Rhyperior, switch back in and reset their hazards, and it certainly can't come in on them to Defog; it also lets most Steel-types do whatever they will, though Taunt and Super Fang generally help in these regards. Because Golbat is weak to the Stealth Rock it is tasked with removing, and because the Fighting-types it walls often carry Knock Off to remove its Eviolite and thus slash its defenses, Golbat can be hard-pressed to stay alive and keep doing its job, but it can definitely fill the needs of your team if used correctly.

Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Defog
move 2: Roost
move 3: Brave Bird
move 4: Toxic / Super Fang / Taunt
ability: Infiltrator
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Defog gets rid of entry hazards, while Roost gets rid of incurred damage. Brave Bird prevents Golbat from being entirely Taunt bait and hits Fighting-, Bug- and Grass-types super effectively, which is convenient since Golbat also has a 4x resistance to those types. Toxic provides general wearing-down utility and specifically gives Golbat a tool to status foes behind a Substitute, ending any chance of them sweeping, while Super Fang does a lot of damage overall and gives Golbat a way to threaten Steel-types; Taunt messes with defensive Pokemon and lets Golbat defeat entry hazard users.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs and an Eviolite confer general bulk and an entry hazards number, while 252 Defense EVs along with an Impish nature crucially buff up Golbat's physical bulk. Infiltrator allows Golbat to penetrate Substitutes for the team's benefit.

Usage Tips
========

Try to Defog whenever you can, though if your opponent is likely to switch in a Stealth Rock user that beats Golbat, it may be best to just Roost and keep its health high, especially if your opponent also has a dangerous threat Golbat needs to stay alive for. In general, hitting a foe Golbat walls with Toxic and stalling it out with Roost is better than taking it out with Brave Bird, as the latter option can leave Golbat fairly low on HP, though feel free to finish it right away if Golbat has no other role to fill. If your opponent has a Fighting-type such as Hitmonlee or Sawk, Golbat will be hit by Knock Off; make peace with this, although trying to switch into Fighting-type moves is still a good idea. Watch out for coverage moves such as Stone Edge from Hitmonlee, and when faced with bulky Substitute boosters, simply hit them with Toxic and switch out to a teammate that walls them, which you should have considering the lack of power of most Substitute boosters. Golbat can take advantage of a fair few defensive Pokemon to Defog, including Amoonguss, Aromatisse, and even other Golbat, as well as Alomomola and Tangrowth, though you might want a cleric for the former and both can easily Knock Off Golbat's Eviolite.

Team Options
========

This Golbat appreciates special walls as partners, especially if they resist one of its weaknesses. Assault Vest or defensive Slowking can fill the role nicely, taking Ice- and Psychic-type attacks well, while Golbat takes on Grass-type Pokemon Slowking would rather avoid, though note the twain do share a weakness to Electric. Almost any Steel-type makes a good partner for Golbat in some fashion or another, as does any Knock Off absorber. Cobalion and Mega Steelix are both, and they are also bulky Stealth Rock setters that can come in multiple times to reset Stealth Rock while taking Rock-type attacks and warding off Steel-types. Cobalion can also take Ice-type attacks, and Mega Steelix can take general physical attacks as well as Psychic- and Electric-type attacks while thwarting Substitute boosters with Roar so Golbat can preserve its health and Toxic them only in lastmon situations or forgoing Stealth Rock entirely for a Curse set that defeats bulky boosters Golbat cannot. Some other Knock Off absorbers are Alomomola, Aromatisse, and (Mega) Audino. Alomomola can take on various special Pokemon or physical Knock Off users such as Hitmonlee and take on Clawitzer while healing Golbat with Wish, while Aromatisse can take on many Fighting-types and special attacks while healing Golbat with Aromatherapy or Wish. (Mega) Audino can do much of the same or act as a bulky win condition that works well with Super Fang Golbat; Mega Audino minds Knock Off not at all, and Audino can pass Wish and not mind thanks to Regenerator. Finally, Rhyperior can take on Rock- and Electric-types such as Tyrantrum as well as Doublade while sponging Knock Off, essentially acting as a discount Mega Steelix in this role, though it is a very viable Pokemon.

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Defog
move 2: Roost
move 3: Brave Bird
move 4: Toxic / Super Fang / Taunt
ability: Infiltrator
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 180 SpD / 80 Spe
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Defog is a stellar way of getting rid of entry hazards and Roost keeps Golbat alive so it can keep Defogging. Brave Bird smacks around Grass- and Fighting-types and ensures Golbat is not made useless by Taunt, while Toxic lets Golbat cripple a multitude of Pokemon, notably dangerous threats like SubCM Cresselia, hitting it even behind a Substitute thanks to Infiltrator, and dangerous special attackers such as Clawitzer and Houndoom. Super Fang and Taunt let Golbat heavily wear down Steel-types that normally wall it and defeat and Defog on many defensive Pokemon and hazards setters that usually defeat it, respectively.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs maximize overall bulk while hitting a Stealth Rock number, while 180 SpD EVs and a Careful nature enhance Golbat's special bulk quite emphatically; 80 Speed EVs let Golbat get the drop on Modest Exploud. Eviolite boosts Golbat's bulk by a ridiculous 50%, and Infiltrator allows it to Toxic or attack foes behind a Substitute, to your gain and your opponent's detriment. If Slurpuff is a threat to your team, 40 Defense EVs can be placed on Golbat, allowing it to take a +6 Return from Slurpuff and strike back, though any chip damage or Stealth Rock will make this a no-go and Slurpuff can tank a Brave Bird fairly easily.

Usage Tips
========

Golbat should switch in on Hitmonlee, as well as on Clawitzer and weaker special attackers that cannot hit it super effectively. Try to come in on defensive Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Amoonguss, though for sleep-inducers you may want another Pokemon to take the sleep first. Switch in on Substitute boosters such as SubCM Cresselia and SubCM Meloetta, hit them with a Toxic, then either switch out to a teammate that walls them or stay in and Roost stall if Golbat does.

Team Options
========

Physical walls like Alomomola and Aromatisse complement Golbat nicely, taking the hits it cannot and providing it with Wish support; Alomomola can more easily pass Wishes due to Regenerator, while Aromatisse can take over Fighting-type wall duty and keep Golbat status-free with Aromatherapy. Mega Steelix and Cobalion can consistently and continually set up Stealth Rock while taking Knock Off, as well as many other attacks Golbat is weak to, and checking Exploud and Steel-types. Cobalion can Taunt opposing entry hazard users, while Mega Steelix can Roar or Curse to take care of Substitute boosters to preserve Golbat's life, and Golbat in return takes on Fighting-types. Audino can form a specially defensive core with Golbat, passing Wishes to it and curing its status while sponging Volt Switch and using Knock Off on pesky Steel-types; Golbat returns these favors by stopping Fighting-types in their tracks. Reuniclus is an interesting partner, able to take on opposing Psychic-types, absorb status, and check Fighting-types, while appreciating a solid Hitmonlee check on its team.

Other Options
########

Golbat can use Haze or Whirlwind to confound setup Pokemon or Curse to become one itself. U-turn is an interesting option, but the thought of potentially taking Stealth Rock damage multiple times just to keep momentum is a bracing one. Golbat can break stall with a moveset of Taunt / Super Fang / Roost / Brave Bird, with the option to use Toxic over either attacking move, but this set ultimately either fails to stallbreak consistently or lacks a STAB move and thus is ineffective in most other situations. Hypnosis is an interesting option to inflict the prized sleep status, but its inaccuracy makes it an unappealing choice, though Doublade's No Guard means you will always hit it and Defog's evasion drops can ease accuracy concerns.

Checks & Counters
########

**Entry Hazard Setters**: Any entry hazard setter that Golbat cannot defeat annoys it; many Steel- and Rock-types, as well as Mega Glalie, fall under this aegis. Registeel, Cobalion, Bronzong, Probopass, and Mega Steelix, as well as Rhyperior and Regirock, can more or less switch in on Golbat and reset their entry hazards, though the Rock-types won't appreciate Toxic and none of them will appreciate Super Fang or to a lesser extent Taunt. Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Accelgor, and Kricketune can set up dangerous entry hazards while discouraging Golbat from coming in or stopping it from Defogging with Thunder Wave + Taunt, Final Gambit, and Knock Off + Taunt + Endeavor, respectively. However, Golbat has ways to come out on top as well, as it can Taunt Qwilfish first, Roost off much of the Final Gambit damage, and Brave Bird Kricketune to death while forcing it to choose between keeping up Sticky Web or actually damaging Golbat. 

**Braviary**: Braviary can switch in on Defog and gain a +2 Attack boost thanks to Defiant, letting it plow through Golbat and quite possibly its entire team, although Physically Defensive Golbat can simply Toxic it as it comes in, Roost away as it attacks with futility, and possibly even Defog as it switches out, a risky maneuver that can nonetheless transfer the advantage to your side, both game-wise and mentally.

**Type Advantage**: As in most aspects of Pokemon, if the foe has a super effective move, its likelihood of coming out on top against Golbat is quite high. Pokemon such as Jolteon, Tyrantrum, and Doublade can switch in on Brave Bird or even Toxic or Super Fang if necessary and proceed to force Golbat out via the threat of setup or an OHKO. Doublade in particular doesn't care about Toxic, Super Fang, or Brave Bird, but if Golbat is carrying Taunt Doublade may not have the strength to break through it. Mega Glalie, Mesprit, and Rotom-C are some examples of Pokemon that don't necessarily want to switch in but can if they must, and they can deal hefty amounts of damage to Golbat even if it has investment in the defensive stat they're striking. 

**Sheer Strength**: Despite Golbat's good bulk, powerful offensive threats can still muscle through it, with or without super effective coverage. Some examples include Clawitzer, Exploud, and Life Orb Druddigon; in some cases, these attackers may falter if Golbat has investment in the defensive stat relevant to them, but extremely strong attackers such as the aforementioned Exploud may simply punch through Golbat despite its buffed-up defense stat.

**Knock Off and Status**: As a defensive Eviolite user whose STAB attack is physical, Golbat has serious problems with both Knock Off and burn. The former irrevocably slashes its bulk by 50%, while the latter wears away at it while reducing its offensive presence quite seriously; note that a teammate with Aromatherapy or Heal Bell can cure Golbat's burn, but burn is a serious, if short-lived, problem even with one of these teammates present. Knock Off users include Eelektross, Drapion, and Escavalier; note that some Knock Off users are actually countered by Golbat, such as Tangrowth and Hitmonlee, but can of course reduce its bulk seriously nevertheless. Pokemon such as Alomomola, Clawitzer, and Mega Banette can inflict burn upon Golbat.
