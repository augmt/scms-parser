Overview
########

With great natural bulk boosted further by Eviolite, reliable recovery in Roost, STAB Brave Bird to deal decent damage, Infiltrator to bypass Substitute, and access to Defog to clear entry hazards, Golbat maintains a valuable role as a supportive Pokemon in the RU metagame. Its typing grants it a 4x resistance to Fighting-, Bug-, and Grass-type moves on top of an immunity to Ground-type moves, making it one of the few absolute checks to Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee aside from Gligar and Aromatisse. Its access to moves such as Taunt, Toxic, Super Fang, and U-turn allow it to help support its team in tandem with its base 90 Speed stat, which allows it to outpace most defensive Pokemon in the tier, even Gligar. All of these benefits allow Golbat to check a range of both offensive and defensive Pokemon in the tier with ease.

However, Golbat relies heavily on Eviolite to maintain its great bulk, which can be compromised by the use of Knock Off. Its weaknesses to Electric-, Psychic-, Ice-, and Rock-type moves also hamper it, especially given the weakness to Stealth Rock, which strips away 25% of its HP as it comes in to use Defog. Steel-types also tend to use Golbat as setup bait due to their immunity to Toxic and resistance to Brave Bird, and Golbat has four-moveslot syndrome when deciding its options for supporting moves. However, if its shortcomings can be covered by support from the right teammates, Golbat can hold its team together quite effectively.


Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Defog
move 2: Roost
move 3: Brave Bird
move 4: Taunt / Toxic / Super Fang
ability: Infiltrator
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 Def
nature: Impish

Moves
========

Defog is the main reason to use Golbat, as it allows it to remove entry hazards. Roost gives Golbat solid recovery, and Brave Bird allows it to have a bit of offensive presence. Taunt stops setup and status moves from being used and is useful because Golbat outspeeds most defensive Pokemon. In addition, Taunt also allows Golbat to fully counter Gligar, which is immune to Earthquake and Toxic, and stops it from using Stealth Rock, Defog, and Roost. Toxic wears Pokemon down, putting common switch-ins such as Rhyperior, Jolteon, and Delphox on a timer. Thanks to Infiltrator, Toxic also allows Golbat to hinder sweepers that rely on Substitute, such as Braviary, Cresselia, and Meloetta. Super Fang allows Golbat to strip up to 50% of the opposing Pokemon's HP away, hindering stall by weakening Pokemon such as Registeel and Bronzong for its teammates to finish them off more easily. U-turn lets Golbat escape as the opponent switches in a check, obtaining momentum; however, bear in mind that Golbat's weakness to Stealth Rock reduces its ability to switch in and out constantly. Haze can also be used to immediately deny boosting sweepers any stat boosts they gained, so long as Golbat is able to survive the hit before using Haze; slower boosting sweepers such as Cresselia, Doublade, Reuniclus, and Curse Registeel can be easily outsped with their stat boosts cleared, allowing one of Golbat's teammates to deal with them.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs give Golbat an odd HP number, allowing it to switch in on Stealth Rock five times, and 252 Defense EVs and an Impish nature maximize physical bulk, allowing Golbat to check Pokemon such as Ambipom, Dugtrio, and Hitmonlee easily. The remaining 8 EVs are placed into Attack for a bit more offensive presence. Eviolite raises both of Golbat's defenses by 50%, greatly improving its ability to take hits.

Usage Tips
========

It helps to use Defog whenever possible, especially if Spikes, Toxic Spikes, or Sticky Web are present. It's best to put offensive pressure on opposing Stealth Rock users so Golbat isn't worn down while it switches in over and over again to clear Stealth Rock. Conversely, it's best to hold off applying your own entry hazards if opposing entry hazard setters are still healthy, as Defog will end up clearing them from both sides. Take advantage of Golbat's incredible physical bulk, as it can easily annoy most physical attackers that lack either Knock Off or a boosted super effective move; examples being Hitmonlee, Sceptile, Virizion, Druddigon, and Tangrowth. Don't let Golbat stay in on Knock Off users; even though it can take hits without Eviolite, its bulk is noticeably reduced. Ironically, despite being a Poison-type, Golbat can't do much to Aromatisse thanks to its ability, Aroma Veil, which blocks Taunt, and its access to Wish and Aromatherapy, which allow it to reliably heal and cure itself of status, respectively.

Team Options
========

Electric-types such as Jolteon, Rotom-C, Heliolisk, Lanturn, and Magneton partner well with Golbat because of their immunities or resistances to Electric-type moves and their ability to form a potential VoltTurn core; they also check the bulky Water-types that Golbat struggles with, such as Alomomola and Slowking. Pokemon weak to Grass-, Fighting-, Bug-, and Ground-type moves, such as Cobalion, Cinccino, Clawitzer, Delphox, Reuniclus, and Rhyperior, are well-covered by Golbat thanks to its typing. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Aromatisse, Gastrodon, Jellicent, Registeel, and Slowking are able to make a defensive core with Golbat, though a few of them share common weaknesses. Pokemon such as Braviary, Fletchinder, and Moltres appreciate Golbat's Defog support, as they thrive with Stealth Rock absent from their side of the field. Pokemon who can take Knock Off for Golbat, such as Virizion, Cobalion, Alomomola, and Aromatisse, are appreciated, as Golbat doesn't have to risk losing its Eviolite by staying in on certain attackers. If Super Fang is used, wallbreakers such as Delphox, Choice Band Braviary, and Choice Band Durant are all able to deal serious blows to defensive teams with Golbat's support.


Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Defog
move 2: Roost
move 3: Brave Bird
move 4: Taunt / Toxic / Super Fang
ability: Infiltrator
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 252 SpD / 8 Spe
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Defog allows Golbat to support its team by removing entry hazards, and Roost gives it solid recovery, allowing it to stay healthy and function throughout a match. Brave Bird gives Golbat a bit of offensive presence, while the choice between Taunt, Toxic, Super Fang, is best determined by the needs of your team. Taunt hinders Pokemon from setting up or using status moves, while Toxic allows Golbat to slowly wear down both defensive and oncoming offensive Pokemon that would force it out. Super Fang strips a Pokemon of 50% of its current HP, allowing Golbat's teammates a chance to finish it off more easily. U-turn allows Golbat to gain momentum as it forces a Pokemon out; however, be mindful of Golbat's Stealth Rock weakness, as this makes it harder to frequently switch Golbat in and out. Haze can be used to remove any boosts from setup sweepers, though be sure Golbat can take a boosted hit if the sweeper in question is faster. Slower setup sweepers such as Cresselia, Doublade, Reuniclus, and Curse Registeel can be outsped and cleared of any stat boosts they've gained, allowing Golbat's teammates to deal with them more easily.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs give Golbat a Stealth Rock number, and with maximum investment in Special Defense and the remaining 8 EVs placed into Speed, Golbat can outpace max Speed Clawitzer. With a Careful nature and maximum investment in Special Defense, Golbat is able to check a new range of Pokemon that the physically defensive set couldn't, such as Clawitzer, Moltres, Mismagius, Cofagrigus, Vivillon, mixed Emboar, and mixed Sharpedo. This also allows Golbat to extend its role further than Gligar by being the only Defog user in RU capable of running a specially defensive EV spread. Eviolite boosts Golbat's defenses to greater levels, allowing it to take hits much more easily.

Usage Tips
========

This set plays identically to the physically defensive set in all regards except the Pokemon it tends to switch in on, so be mindful of the matchup Golbat is in. Even without investment in Defense, Golbat is fairly bulky on the physical side, allowing it to act as a softer check to physical attackers such as Druddigon, Dugtrio, Hitmonlee, Sharpedo, Virizion, and Swords Dance Sceptile. Because this set focuses on Special Defense, Golbat should be brought in on attackers such as Moltres, Clawitzer, Mismagius, and Emboar. While Golbat is better-suited to stand up to Psychic-types such as Meloetta, Cresselia, Delphox, Reuniclus, and Slowking, these Pokemon are still threatening enough to Golbat that they should generally be avoided unless it is absolutely possible for Golbat to safely deal with them; the same applies to Electric-types such as Rotom-C, Jolteon, Eelektross, and Heliolisk. Even though it may be able to survive a Thunderbolt from these Pokemon, do not allow it to take such a move unless it is absolutely vital.

Team Options
========

Physically defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola, Aromatisse, Tangrowth, Slowking, Gastrodon, and Spiritomb are able to form defensive cores with Golbat to check both special and physical attackers. The former three are also able to easily take Knock Off for Golbat, though the common weaknesses Golbat shares with Tangrowth and Alomomola should be addressed. Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Gastrodon, Dugtrio, Amoonguss, Lickilicky, and Registeel are able to check the Electric-types that threaten Golbat, such as Jolteon, Rotom-C, and Heliolisk. Pokemon such as Braviary, Fletchinder, and Moltres are ideal partners, as they appreciate Golbat's ability to remove entry hazards with Defog.

Other Options
########

Golbat has a number of alternative options as its disposal. Whirlwind can be used to phaze Pokemon attempting to set up on Golbat while possibly inflicting more damage through entry hazards. Hypnosis can be used to cripple a Pokemon with Sleep status, and its poor accuracy is augmented by the evasion drop caused by Defog, but Golbat ultimately loses out on one of its better support options if it runs this move. Golbat has access to Rain Dance and Sunny Day, allowing it to act as a bulky weather supporter with either move. Venom Drench is a new move it gained this generation, and can be used to harshly reduce the Attack, Special Attack, and Speed stats of any poisoned Pokemon. While this can be useful for crippling offensive Pokemon as they succumb to being poisoned, it forces Golbat to either run Toxic alongside this move or have reliable support from Toxic Spikes, generally making this move not worth it against teams with cleric and entry hazard removal support. Confuse Ray can hinder Pokemon by giving them a 50% chance to move, but this isn't as reliable or useful as its other support moves, and confusion can be easily cured by switching out. Curse allows Golbat to function as a bulky sweeper by boosting Attack and Defense at the cost of lowering Speed, though it lacks any decent coverage moves to hit the Pokemon that resist Brave Bird with. On the other hand, Nasty Plot allows Golbat to sharply boost its Special Attack, and even though it has access to moves such as Sludge Bomb, Giga Drain, and Heat Wave, its poor Special Attack leaves much to be desired, even after a boost. Mean Look prevents Pokemon from switching out and potentially allows Golbat to trap and stall certain Pokemon with a combination of Toxic and Roost, but generally isn't worth it because most Pokemon switching into Golbat even as it uses Mean Look tend to force it out immediately. Lastly, Tailwind can be used to support Golbat's teammates by boosting their Speed for 3 turns, but it is somewhat situational and one turn is wasted switching Golbat out to a Pokemon that can take advantage of the move.


Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Steel-types, such as Doublade, Bronzong, and Registeel, are hard stops to Golbat due to their resistance to Brave Bird and immunity to Toxic. Escavalier, even though it does not resist Brave Bird, can use Knock Off to remove Golbat's Eviolite, making it still a problem for Golbat to deal with.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types such as Jolteon, Rotom-C, and Heliolisk can OHKO Golbat with Thunderbolt while taking little from Brave Bird, thus easily forcing it out. They can also use Volt Switch to gain momentum safely and switch to the appropriate check to whatever you send in. However, they all have to be wary of switching in on Toxic, and Super Fang can also remove a large chunk of HP as they come in.

**Rhyperior and Tyrantrum**: Rhperior and Tyrantrum's resistance to Brave Bird allows them to come in on Golbat and threaten it with their Rock-type STAB moves. Rhyperior is able to comfortably set up Stealth Rock, as Golbat is forced out, while Tyrantrum can use Dragon Dance to get in position to sweep. Toxic and Super Fang are able to wear them down on the switch.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types may be susceptible to Toxic, but Pokemon such as Alomomola, Gastrodon, Jellicent, and Slowking threaten Golbat with Scald's chance to burn and have access to reliable recovery to heal off any damage taken before switching out. Alomomola is able to use Knock Off and remove Golbat's Eviolite, while Slowking threatens Golbat with its Psychic-type STAB moves.

**Psychic-types**: Psychic types such as Cresselia, Meloetta, Reuniclus, and Delphox threaten Golbat with their STAB moves, and Pokemon with Calm Mind can set up against it. If Golbat lacks Toxic, Cresselia and Meloetta can set up Calm Mind safely without having to worry about being put on a timer, while even if Golbat has Toxic, Reuniclus is immune to it thanks to Magic Guard.

**Stealth Rock**: Golbat's weakness to Stealth Rock strips away 25% of its HP when it switches in to use Defog, making it easier to pick off if it has already taken significant damage before coming in.

**Wallbreakers**: Even with Golbat's ability to recover HP, strong physical or special wallbreakers such as Choice Band Braviary, Choice Band Cinccino, Choice Specs Clawitzer, Choice Specs Exploud, and mixed Sharpedo have enough raw power to break through Golbat depending on which set it is running, so leave them up to teammates if the wallbreaker in question is geared towards targeting Golbat's weaker defensive stat.
