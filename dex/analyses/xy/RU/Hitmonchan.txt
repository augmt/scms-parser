Overview
########

Hitmonchan is a very mediocre Fighting-type and Rapid Spin user in the RU metagame due to its inability to handle most Ghost-types and its only average Attack stat. Hitmonchan is outclassed by almost all other Fighting-types including Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, Sawk, and Gurdurr. The first two have ways to handle Ghost-types in Knock Off and Foresight respectively, and Gurdurr has more bulk and power with the use of Eviolite. Sawk also has access to Ice Punch as well as Knock Off. Hitmonchan has a very high Special Defense stat, even higher than its Attack, but it lacks any good resistances to make use of it. However, Hitmonchan has some niches over Hitmonlee, such as its access to the elemental punches, in particular Ice Punch to hit Gligar. Iron Fist is also a pretty good ability, giving a decent boost in power to Hitmonchan's punching moves. Despite this niche, Hitmonchan is still horribly outclassed, and you should consider other options when building a team.

Moves
========

Rapid Spin is the only reason to use Hitmonchan, clearing entry hazards from your side of the field. However, Hitmonchan greatly struggles to touch most Ghost-types. Drain Punch is a decently powerful STAB move that provides recovery. Ice Punch provides great coverage, hitting Pokemon such as Gligar and Amoonguss for hefty damage. Fire Punch is used to smack Doublade, but it cannot 2HKO Doublade unless Doublade has had its Eviolite removed. Mach Punch can be used as a form of priority to hit the likes of Sharpedo and Cinccino. Thunder Punch is a decent option to target bulky Water-types such as Slowking and Alomomola.

Set Details
========

An Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment are used to hit as hard as possible. An Adamant nature is used because Hitmonchan doesn't outspeed anything significant with a Jolly nature. Maximum Speed investment is used to outspeed as much as possible. Iron Fist is Hitmonchan's best ability, giving a 20% boost to its punching moves. Life Orb is used for a significant increase in power.

Usage Tips
========

Drain Punch is generally the best move to go for, as it hits fairly hard with the Iron Fist boost, and most switch-ins to the Fighting-type are generally outsped and can be hit by the appropriate coverage move. Use Rapid Spin if entry hazards need to be cleared from the field for a Flying- or Fire-type teammate such as Fletchinder or Moltres. However, if the opponent has a Ghost-type, using Rapid Spin is a waste of time.

Team Options
========

Fire- and Flying-types such as Moltres and Braviary have good synergy with Hitmonchan and appreciate the Rapid Spin support. Steel-types such as Escavalier and Doublade are helpful to switch into Flying-, Fairy-, and Psychic-type attacks. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Rhyperior and Druddigon is useful to wear down the opponent's switch-ins. For example, Hitmonchan 2HKOes Rhyperior with Drain Punch after Stealth Rock damage. Knock Off and Pursuit support from the likes of Shiftry and Escavalier is greatly appreciated to handle the Ghost-types that Hitmonchan has trouble with.

Other Options
########

Your best other option over Hitmonchan is any other Fighting-type in the tier. Assault Vest can be used for some added Special Defense, but the lack of power is unwelcome. Close Combat is an option, but the recovery of Drain Punch is more useful. A specially based set with moves such as Focus Blast, Vacuum Wave, and Hidden Power Dark is an option. Lastly, Earthquake can be used over Fire Punch to 2HKO Doublade with some prior damage, but generally isn't worth it otherwise.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ghost-types**: Spiritomb, Banette, and Doublade can all take the majority of Hitmonchan's attacks and cripple it with a burn or KO it in return. Doublade is only 2HKOed by Fire Punch if it has lost its Eviolite.

**Bulky Water-types**: Pelipper and Alomomola are bulky enough to take Hitmonchan's hits bar Thunder Punch and stall it out with status, while Slowking can take most of its attacks and KO with Psyshock.

**Psychic-types**: Delphox, Meloetta, and Reuniclus all threaten to KO Hitmonchan with a STAB Psychic-type move.

**Faster Threats**: Meloetta, Drapion, and Durant all outspeed Hitmonchan and threaten to KO it with a powerful STAB move.

**Flying-types**: Moltres, Fletchinder, Braviary, and Golbat all resist Hitmonchan's STAB moves and threaten to KO it. However, some have to be wary of the elemental punches.
