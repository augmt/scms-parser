Overview
########
Meowstic-M is blessed with an arsenal of priority support moves thanks to Prankster and has a niche as the only Prankster screener available in RU. It can use support options that work very nicely on hyper offense teams, making it a great boon for teams of that archetype. However, one must realize that Meowstic-M is ruined by Taunt, not to mention that Defog swiftly undoes its work. In spite of its flaws, this unsociable feline can offer the team incredibly useful support that is not to be overlooked.

Moves
========
Reflect and Light Screen form the dual screens combination and provide great support to the team in lessening the damage they take, making them a boon for hyper offense teams. Thunder Wave is present on the set in order to allow Meowstic-M to halt a fast attacker in their tracks. Like dual screens, this sort of support is much appreciated by hyper offense teams, as it can mean that an opposing rampant sweeper can be stopped from taking out your team. Psychic and Psyshock are Meowstic-Mâ€™s ways of dealing direct damage when the need arises. Psychic has greater Base Power, though Psyshock is useful for hitting opponents with lower Defense than Special Defense, such as Hitmonlee. It is a matter of a personal preference which attack you opt for.

Set Details
========
Maximum HP and Defense investment and a Bold nature ensures that Meowstic-M can take physical hits as well as possible. Light Clay extends the duration of the screens to eight turns, allowing your team to take advantage of them for as long as possible. 

Usage Tips
========
Setting up screens is the utmost priority. You may want to switch Meowstic-M out once it has set up its screens in order to let its teammates take advantage of them straight away. This also means Meowstic-M will have a chance to set them up again later on.

Team Options
========
Dual screens support is appreciated by the whole team, though setup sweepers such as Gorebyss, Cobalion, Durant, and Virizion particularly benefit from them, as they make setting up a lot easier. Memento Dugtrio can be a good partner for Meowstic-M in order to help setup sweepers by giving them another chance at successfully setting up if Meowstic-M's screens run out or it didn't get an opportunity to set them up again.

Other Options
########
Toxic can replace Thunder Wave should you wish to cripple an opposing wall, though there are other Pokemon better suited to doing this. Should you desire weather support, Meowstic-M can use either Rain Dance or Sunny Day and hold a Damp Rock or Heat Rock accordingly. Bear in mind that Pokemon such as Liepard, Whimsicott, and Volbeat tend to make better weather supporters due to their access to more utility options and general team support with U-turn, Encore, Taunt, and Baton Pass. Meowstic-M could try a Substitute + Calm Mind set which benefits from Prankster priority, though there are Pokemon in RU that generally tend to work better, such as Reuniclus. Safeguard is an option for shielding the team from status, though its duration of a mere five turns means that it is probably not worth the moveslot. Trick could see use in conjunction with a detrimental item such as an Iron Ball, though Meowstic-M would rather save its item slot for an item extending the duration of whatever it is setting up or even the passive recovery of Leftovers. Finally, Yawn is a possibility to force switches. 

Checks and Counters
########
**Faster Prankster Taunt Users**: Whimsicott can outspeed Meowstic-M and hinder it from doing its jobby using Taunt. Though it is not particularly common, Liepard is an excellent answer to Meowstic-M, since its Taunt outspeeds Meowstic-M's, and Liepard has an immunity to Psychic-type moves.

**Drapion**: Drapion can catch Meowstic-M on the switch with Pursuit and is immune to Meowstic-M's STAB moves.

**Defog Users**: Defog is frustrating for Meowstic-M because it swiftly removes the screens that Meowstic-M has set up. Shiftry can use Defog and is immune to Meowstic-M's STAB attacks. Skuntank is even more nightmarish for Meowstic-M to face, as it can Defog the screens away, is immune to Meowstic-M's STAB moves, and can use Pursuit as Meowstic-M attempts to switch out.
