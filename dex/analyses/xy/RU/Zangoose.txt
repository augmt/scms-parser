Overview
########

Zangoose is nothing to overlook, as it is one of the best physical attackers in the tier. Its already impressive Attack is increased after Toxic Boost, making it hit hard. 90 Speed is decent in RU and allows Zangoose to outspeed a lot of threats. Zangoose's movepool helps greatly, allowing Zangoose to hit Pokemon that would otherwise wall it. However, Toxic Boost takes a turn to activate because of Toxic Orb, making Zangoose very vulnerable and not as powerful. Zangoose's defensive typing isn't good either since it has no resists and one immunity. Furthermore, Zangoose is very frail, which means that it gets taken out easily. Toxic Orb wears Zangoose down very quickly, making it somewhat easy to stall out Still, Zangoose is a very powerful threat in this metagame and definitely something to be careful around.

Moves
========

Facade makes Zangoose one of the hardest hitters in this meta, as poison boosts both Zangoose's Attack stat and the power of this attack. Knock Off is important on Zangoose since it hits Ghost-type Pokemon very hard and can remove items such as Eviolite and Leftovers from common switch-ins to Zangoose such as Doublade. Quick Attack is a STAB priority move, while Swords Dance allows Zangoose to set up on Pokemon that cannot do much to threaten it, or on forced switches. Quick Attack is usually more useful than Swords Dance since Zangoose very rarely needs the Attack boost and Toxic wears it down quickly. Quick Attack hits deceptively hard neutrally, and can be used to clean up late-game even against faster threats such as Jolteon and Dugtrio with some prior damage. Close Combat on Zangoose allows it to hit Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon, as they resist Zangoose's Normal-type STAB moves. 

Set Details
========

Zangoose's nature can depend on the rest of your team and what role you want it to play. An Adamant nature guarantees a 2HKO on max Defense Alomomola and Tangrowth for example, while Jolly guarantees Zangoose outspeeds all Hitmonlee and deals 62% minimum with Quick Attack for a late-game kill, while also ensuring Zangoose Speed ties with opposing Moltres and Meloetta. Just keep in mind that because of Toxic Boost, the difference in power between Adamant and Jolly is greater than that of the average physical sweeper. With Swords Dance sets, you generally want Jolly, as your Attack will be boosted regardless, while 4 attack sets can run either of the natures. Max Speed and Attack EVs are self-explanatory to maximize Zangoose's offensive stats. Toxic Orb and Toxic Boost work together to boost Zangoose's mediocre Attack stat, and doubles Facade's power.

Usage Tips
========

While using Zangoose, make sure to keep in mind that it needs a turn to get Toxic'd to be used most effectively. Good ways to do so consist of U-turning into Zangoose, finishing off weakened Pokemon, and predicting double switches. After being poisoned, Zangoose can freely switch into users of status moves. Predicting switch-ins for Zangoose is important, as Ghost-types don't take damage from either Close Combat or Facade. Zangoose's main job is to break walls, so keep it alive for as long as possible. Be careful of Registeel and Rhyperior though, as neither are OHKOed by Close Combat.

Team Options
========

Omastar is a great teammate for Zangoose; for example, with Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes Zangoose can OHKO max Defense Aromatisse. Sticky Web users such as Leavanny and Kricketune also make good teammates, as the entry hazard allows Zangoose to effectively outspeed all grounded opponents, making it that much easier to run through a team with such a powerful Facade. A strong special attacker will help Zangoose take out physical tanks that can stall it and make it take a lot of Toxic Orb damage like Doublade and Gligar, so a partner like Delphox or Moltres will work great with it. Pokemon with Volt Switch and Pokemon with U-turn such as Gligar or Rotom-C give Zangoose the momentum to come in and get itself poisoned.

Other Options
########

To set up Toxic, Protect can be used, but it is just not worth wasting a move slot. Fire Punch can be used for coverage on Zangoose, but it is outclassed by Close Combat other than for hitting Escavalier, which is KOed by Facade followed by Close Combat anyway. Taunt can be cool on Zangoose against Pokemon that like to set up, but Zangoose is way too frail to utilize it correctly. In general, keep in mind that most of Zangoose's offensive options aren't worth using over the moves listed, as the sheer power of a Toxic Boost Facade makes most of them obsolete.

Checks & Counters
########

**Doublade** Doublade tanks Zangoose's hits with its amazing bulk and takes it down with Iron Head.
**Faster Attackers** With Zangoose's low bulk, faster attackers can take out Zangoose with ease. Strong priority moves such as Mach Punch or Sucker Punch also dispatch Zangoose.
