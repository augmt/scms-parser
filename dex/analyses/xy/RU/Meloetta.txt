Overview
########

Meloetta is the most versatile Pokemon in the XY RU tier, due to having two completely different and threatening forms as well as  a very high BST. It is capable of fitting nicely on both offensive and defensive teams, capable of fulfilling roles as a wall breaker, late-game cleaner, and a specially defensive support Pokemon. Meloetta also has a very interesting typing, being a Psychic-type immune to Ghost and a Normal-type neutral to Fighting. Unfortunately for Meloetta it also has a weakness to the extremely common Knock Off. Meloetta-P is also really strong in the current metagame but requires a turn to transform.

Sub + Calm Mind
########
name: Sub + Calm Mind
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Calm Mind
move 3: Hyper Voice
move 4: Shadow Ball
ability: Serene Grace
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 188 Def / 24 SpA / 44 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Substitute is the most important move on this set, as it protects Meloetta from status moves, such as Toxic. Calm Mind boosts Meloetta's Special Attack and Special Defense, making it more threatening as well as harder to take down. Hyper Voice and Shadow Ball provide perfect neutral coverage in the tier.  Shadow Ball is very important on this set, as it allows Meloetta to counter Doublade, one of the best Pokemon in the tier. Hyper Voice has the additional benefit of allowing Meloetta to hit through an opponent's Substitute, which can be helpful if they attempt to set up at the same time as you do.

Set Details
========
The EVs give Meloetta 404 HP, allowing its Substitutes to take a Seismic Toss from Registeel, while the Defense EVs allow Meloetta's Substitute to take any hit from 0 Attack Gligar barring Knock Off. 44 Speed EVs allow Meloetta to outspeed uninvested base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Drapion. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack along with a Modest Nature, to make Meloetta as threatening as possible. Leftovers is mandatory on this set, as it is Meloetta's only form of recovery.

Usage Tips
========

Meloetta is able to scare out a lot of Pokemon with the variety of its sets, some of which can be more dangerous initially. Pokemon such as Golbat, Gligar, and Alomomola are likely to switch out when you bring Meloetta in, allowing Meloetta to set up a Substitute or a Calm Mind. You must be very careful switching Meloetta into these Pokemon, however, as a Toxic or a Scald burn makes this set much less effective. Switching into Knock Off is also a problem, as even a weak one cripples this set by removing its only form of recovery. If you use this set, Toxic Spikes is something you should really consider, as it puts a timer on your opponent, making this set even more effective at wearing down the opponent's team.

Team Options
========

A grounded Poison-type or some other entry hazard remover make a really good teammate for Meloetta, as Toxic Spikes make this set much less effective. Meloetta also has trouble getting around Registeel, so something that can deal with that is also very useful.  Hitmonlee is not only capable of removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin, but it laughs in Registeel's face. Hitmonlee also lures in set up opportunities such as Alomomola and Gligar for Meloetta. Aromatisse is another good partner for Meloetta, as it can switch into Knock Off without breaking a sweat, as well as utilize Aromatherapy to give a status-ridden Meloetta a second chance. Finally, a good Toxic Spikes setter allows Meloetta to take advantage of its natural bulk and Substitute to stall out the opponents team; both Drapion and Weezing are very adept at this role.

Meloetta-P
########
name: Meloetta-P
move 1: Relic Song
move 2: Return
move 3: Close Combat
move 4: Knock Off
ability: Serene Grace
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Relic Song is obviously the most important move on this set, allowing Meloetta to become one of the most dangerous physical threats in RU. Return and Close Combat are chosen as STAB moves for Meloetta, as they have very good neutral coverage in the tier. Knock Off rounds out Meloetta's coverage, allowing it to do heavy damage to Ghost-types. Ice Punch and Zen Headbutt are also interesting options for Meloetta, as they allow Meloetta to get through Gligar and Weezing, respectively, and thanks to Serene Grace, Zen Headbutt has a nice 40% chance to flinch. Quick Attack and Facade are also options to replace Return, providing Meloetta with priority in Quick Attack's case or allowing it to negate the Attack drop from burn with Facade.

Set Details
========

Max Speed and a Jolly nature are chosen to take advantage of Meloetta-P's high base 128 Speed, making Meloetta one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier. Maximum Attack investment and Life Orb allow Meloetta to hit as hard as possible.

Usage Tips
========

It is important to realize when playing with this set that your opponent is likely going to assume that you are using a special variant of Meloetta. It is best to send in Meloetta against a weak Pokemon that is slower than regular Meloetta and pick them off with Relic Song, which still hits pretty hard off of regular Meloetta's high Special Attack set. Meloetta-P is best used as a late-game cleaner, after the opponent's team has been worn down a little bit, but it is also a capable wallbreaker, thanks to its high Base Power STAB moves and good coverage.

Team Options
========

Spikes setters such as Qwilfish, Accelgor, and Omastar make really good teammates for Meloetta, as this set tends to force a second switch after Relic Song is revealed. Meloetta struggles to get around certain physically defensive Pokemon, such as Alomomola and Gligar, so something that can take advantage of these Pokemon make good partners. Virizion is one such Pokemon, capable of setting up on both of these Pokemon with either Calm Mind or Swords Dance.  Thanks to Knock Off, Ghost-type Pokemon don't wall this set, but they can switch into Relic Song and stop the transformation. As such, Pursuit users like Escavalier and Drapion also make good partners. Finally, because this set tends to lure in and destroy Registeel, Pokemon like Slurpuff that struggle with Registeel enjoy being paired with this set.

Specially Defensive
########
name: Specially Defensive
move 1: Perish Song
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Heal Bell / U-turn
move 4: Thunder Wave
ability: Serene Grace
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========

Perish Song is a very important move for specially defensive Meloetta, as it prevents common stallbreakers such as Substitute + Calm Mind Cresselia, Calm Mind Reuniclus, and Curse Registeel from setting up and slowly taking down your team. Knock Off hits many of the things that Meloetta wants to wall for more damage than any of its special attacks, 2HKOing Delphox after Stealth Rock. Heal Bell gives Meloetta some added utility, allowing it to cure its teammates' status ailments. U-turn is another option in this slot, however, as it allows Meloetta to gain momentum on switches forced by Perish Song. Thunder Wave is chosen for the last slot, as it can cripple Delphox and other speedy special attackers. Toxic can be used in this slot, but many common switch-ins to Meloetta are immune to Toxic, such as Registeel and Drapion.

Set Details
========

Max HP, Special Defense, and a Careful nature are necessary to check Calm Mind Delphox. Leftovers are necessary, as it is Meloetta's only form of recovery.

Usage Tips
========

If you see that your opponent has a Cresselia or Reuniclus in the team preview, it is necessary to keep Meloetta as healthy as possible, as these Pokemon can be huge threats to defensively oriented teams. While Meloetta does have impressive special bulk, its physical bulk isn't that great, so avoiding physical hits as much as possible will greatly increase Meloetta's longevity. Knock Off is especially important to avoid, as it not only hits Meloetta super effectively, it also removes Meloetta's only form of recovery. That being said, Meloetta is great at pivoting into special attackers and forcing them out.

Team Options
========

This set greatly appreciates Wish support from the likes of Alomomola and Aromatisse. Alomomola also appreciates Meloetta's cleric abilities, preventing Alomomola from being worn down by Toxic. On the other hand, Aromatisse is able to use Aromatherapy to free up a moveslot for Meloetta's U-turn. Pokemon that switch out of Psychic-type Pokemon appreciate Meloetta's ability to counter these Pokemon. Gligar and Golbat both need this type of support, and in return can provide Defog support to prevent Meloetta from being worn down by entry hazards. Finally, a good switch-in to Dark-types really helps Meloetta succeed in its roll; Hitmontop and Aromatisse are both good choices.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Hyper Voice
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: U-turn
ability: Serene Grace
item: Choice Specs
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Hyper Voice is Meloetta's best STAB move, and it is very easy to spam thanks to its good neutral coverage and the ability to hit through Substitutes. Psychic is a good secondary STAB move that allows Meloetta to deal with slower Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Gurdurr. Psyshock deserves a mention here, as it allows Meloetta to get past the likes of Audino and specially defensive Aromatisse, which Meloetta would otherwise struggle with. Shadow Ball is Meloetta's coverage move of choice, as it demolishes the Ghost-types that like to switch into Hyper Voice. Shadow Ball also makes Meloetta one of the best offensive checks to Doublade. In the final slot, U-turn is preferred because Meloetta lures in a lot of Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon, which Meloetta's partners can more easily deal with. Focus Blast is another cool coverage move that Meloetta has access to, putting a large dent into any Steel-type looking to switch into its STAB moves. Dazzling Gleam is another option on this set, but it is really only useful for luring in Spiritomb, a Pokemon that can otherwise easily deal with Meloetta. Trick is another cool option, as it is capable of crippling the defensive Steel-types that like to switch into Meloetta, but Meloetta should generally stick to using the moves listed on the set, as they form the most effective combination.

Set Details
========

Meloetta's Speed stat is maximized and a Timid nature is used to take advantage of its decent Speed tier. Its Special Attack is also maxed out so Meloetta hits as hard as possible when equipped with Choice Specs.

Usage Tips
========

When playing against defensively oriented teams, Meloetta tends to lure in Steel-types, so U-turning is a good choice in this situation, as it lets you gain a lot of momentum. While Meloetta is one of the best offensive checks to Doublade, it is important that you avoid switching directly into Iron Head more than once. Once the opponent has run out of resists to Meloetta's STAB moves or only has very frail resists remaining, spamming them is a very good option, as it is almost impossible to switch into them.

Team Options
========

Dugtrio is quite possibly the best teammate for Meloetta, as Meloetta tends to lure in Registeel and specially defensive Regirock, two Pokemon that Dugtrio is capable of trapping and disposing of. Spiritomb is another good partner for Meloetta, as it is capable of Pursuit trapping Assault Vest Slowking, and it can utilize Will-O-Wisp to help wear down Drapion, Skuntank, Registeel, and Regirock. Meloetta also appreciates Spikes support, as it forces many switches. Omastar, Accelgor, and Qwilfish are all good options for providing this support. It is very important that Meloetta is paired with a good Dark-type resist, as Meloetta lures in Knock Off and Sucker Punch users like no other. Cobalion and Virizion are both capable of switching into these moves and appreciate the Attack boost due to Justified. Cobalion is also capable of providing Stealth Rock support alongside Taunt support, which can help keep up your hazards against Defog users. Finally, since Meloetta is great at punching holes in the opposition, a good cleaner that can take advantage of a weakened team is a great choice for a teammate. Choice Scarf Rotom-C, Choice Scarf Moltres, and Life Orb Jolteon are all really good cleaners and have the additional benefit of forming a VoltTurn core with Meloetta. Fletchinder is another good choice, as it shares some common counters with Meloetta and appreciates them being worn down.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Hyper Voice
move 2: Psyshock
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: U-turn / Trick
ability: Serene Grace
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Hyper Voice is the main draw in using Choice Scarf Meloetta, as it is a powerful STAB move that allows Meloetta to revenge kill opposing Pokemon even if they are behind a Substitute. Psyshock allows Meloetta to revenge kill some key Pokemon in the tier, most notably Hitmonlee and Gallade. Shadow Ball has perfect neutral coverage with Hyper Voice and also deals with threatening Pokemon like Doublade and Delphox. The last slot is a choice between generating momentum and scouting the opponent with U-turn or crippling an opposing defensive Pokemon with Trick. Focus Blast is also an option if your team is extremely weak to Cobalion.

Set Details
========

Max Speed and a Timid nature are chosen, as this allows Meloetta to outspeed opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-C and Hitmonlee when equipped with its own Choice Scarf.  Special Attack is maximized in order to hit as hard as possible.

Usage Tips
========

Meloetta should be used to stop an opposing sweeper from running through your team after they have set up. However, try not to switch Meloetta directly into an opponent's attack after they have set up, as this could cause you to lose your only chance to revenge kill them. Trick and U-turn are capable of crippling or scouting your opponent's best response to Meloetta, respectively.

Team Options
========

Something that is capable of taking out opposing Registeel is greatly appreciated by Meloetta. Cobalion and Virizion are both good options, that can set up on or KO opposing Registeel. Pokemon that are capable of luring in and getting rid of opposing special walls such as Moltres.Hitmonlee deserves a special mention, as it deals with special walls while also providing Rapid Spin support to prevent Choice Scarf Meloetta from getting worn down by entry hazards.

Offensive Calm Mind
########
name: Offensive Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Hyper Voice
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Focus Blast
ability: Serene Grace
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Meloetta is capable of forcing a large amount of switches, and this set aims to take advantage of that with Calm Mind. Calm Mind boosts Meloetta's Special Attack and Special Defense, making it very powerful and much harder to take down. Hyper Voice and Shadow Ball have extremely good coverage in RU, and Hyper Voice is capable of hitting through opposing Substitutes. Focus Blast allows Meloetta to get around specially defensive Steel-types, such as Registeel, that don't mind Meloetta's other moves.

Set Details
========

Max Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature are used so Meloetta can hit as hard and fast as possible. A Life Orb is used to boost Meloetta's already strong attacks.

Usage Tips
========

This set tends to work best as a mid-game wallbreaker, as it is capable of punching large holes in defensive teams, allowing a teammate to clean up late-game. Calm Mind is best used on predicted switches, but against more offensive teams, Meloetta's good coverage and natural power can allow Meloetta to function well without a boost.

Team Options
========

This set works well on teams that attempt to spam special attacks in order to wear down the opponent. Pairing Meloetta with another bulkier Calm Mind user such as Reuniclus or Cresselia could work well, as this set can really damage usual Calm Mind counters such as Registeel and Drapion. Spikes users such as Accelgor and Qwilfish are also good options, as many of the best responses to Meloetta are grounded Pokemon.

Other Options
########

A Work Up set that aims to use both Meloetta formes could be used, but it struggles to find the moveslots to function. Psyshock and Thunderbolt can be used on the Calm Mind sets over Shadow Ball and Hyper Voice, but in general the coverage provided by Shadow Ball and Hyper Voice is more valuable in the RU metagame. Meloetta is also a decent user of Assault Vest, as it has some nice utility with Knock Off and U-turn and power with its special STAB moves, but it is easily worn down and needs Perish Song to do its job as a special wall. Energy Ball is a pretty cool option if your team is extremely weak to Rhyperior. Meloetta is also capable of running an all-out attacker set, utilizing its good coverage to demolish the opponents, but in general the sets listed are better.

Checks & Counters
########

Because of its versatility and dual formes, its checks and counters really depend on the set.

**Bulky Steel-types**: The best counters to Meloetta are Steel-types that aren't weak to Ghost attacks. Registeel especially, as it can take any attack from all except the physical, Choice Specs, and offensive Calm Mind sets, Registeel doesn't like getting tricked a Choice Specs or Scarf though.

**Drapion**: Drapion is a decent check to Meloetta, taking on most special sets with ease and using Knock Off and Toxic Spikes to make Meloetta much less effective, but it must be careful when facing Meloetta-P.

**Aromatisse**: Aromatisse can generally take any one of Meloetta's attacks and can scout the set but it is setup bait for the Substitute + Calm Mind set.

**Spiritomb**: Spiritomb is the only thing that can switch into all of these sets, can utilize its Dark-type STAB to take care of Meloetta, and is capable of preventing Meloetta's transformation to Meloetta-P.

**Fast Revenge Killers**: Many Pokemon can outspeed and heavily damage or OHKO Meloetta in Aria forme, Cinccino, and Durant, but must be careful for the Piroutte forme or the Choice Scarf set, Jolly Choice Scarf Braviary is probably the best at this role, as it can take out both forms with ease.

**Granbull**: Granbull is an extremely solid response to Meloetta-P, but doesn't do very well against special variants.
