Overview
########

Dragalge's Poison / Dragon typing gives it notable resistances to Fighting-, Grass-, Electric-, Fire-, and Bug-type moves, all of which are rather common in RU. Dragalge also has access to Toxic Spikes and Dragon Tail, which when combined with its Poison Touch ability makes it quite easy to spread poison throughout the opponent's team. Thanks to a decent Special Attack stat, powerful STAB moves in Draco Meteor and Sludge Bomb, and great coverage moves in Scald, Hidden Power Fire, and Shadow Ball, Dragalge is no slouch offensively. However, Dragalge's offensive capabilities are held back by its Special Attack stat, which is not amazing in a tier where numerous Pokemon have base 110 Special Attack or higher, along with a lack of access to its Hidden Ability, Adaptability. Dragalge is also quite slow, needing investment just to outpace the likes of Druddigon and Registeel. Dragalge has decent Defense, but will need heavy investment to take advantage of that Fighting-type resistance with hard hitters such as Hitmonlee and Virizion in the tier. Perhaps the two biggest issues facing Dragalge are other Toxic Spikes users, as well as its lack of reliable recovery. While Dragalge has its own redeeming qualities, that doesn't change the fact that Weezing, Drapion, and Roselia all give it stiff competition as bulky Toxic Spikes users in RU. Dragalge isn't for every team, but its unique set of resistances, solid defenses, and access to Dragon Tail ensures its niche in RU.

Toxic Spikes
########
name: Toxic Spikes
move 1: Toxic Spikes
move 2: Dragon Tail / Protect
move 3: Sludge Bomb
move 4: Scald
ability: Poison Touch
item: Black Sludge
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
======

Dragalge's best set capitalizes on its defensive typing which allows it to deal with troublesome Pokemon, such as Hitmonlee, Virizion, and Rotom-C, quite easily. Toxic Spikes helps to wear down any grounded Pokemon that isn't a Poison- or Steel-type. Dragon Tail shuffles in new Pokemon to be poisoned, and possibly poisons Flying-types and Levitating Pokemon thanks to Poison Touch. If this extra utility isn't needed, Protect is a decent alternative, scouting for dangerous moves while getting a little bit more recovery from Black Sludge. Sludge Bomb is a decently powerful STAB move that allows Dragalge to hit the likes of Virizion and Rotom-C pretty hard. Scald is nice coverage as it hits the likes of Rhyperior, Gligar, and Sandslash really hard.

Set Details
======

A physically defensive spread may not be the first idea that comes to mind with Dragalge, but it ensures that it can avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Adamant Hitmonlee's High Jump Kick as well as the OHKO from Virizion's +2 Zen Headbutt. Black Sludge provides passive recovery and is used over Leftovers to deter Trick users, such as Rotom-C, from trying to cripple Dragalge. A specially defensive spread is usable to make it even harder for special attackers, such as Rotom-C and Jolteon, to break through Dragalge, but such a spread makes it impossible for Dragalge to handle Hitmonlee and Virizion reliably. Even though Dragon Tail is a physical attack, an Attack-lowering nature is used over a Speed-lowering nature so Dragalge can use Scald before being hit by Rhyperior's STAB Earthquake.

Usage Tips
======

As it's a bulky user of Toxic Spikes, you'll want to pick and choose when to get them up with Dragalge. It's best to use Dragon Tail or Scald if the opponent has a grounded Poison-type like Drapion remaining, since such a Pokemon can remove Toxic Spikes by switching in. If there are no grounded Poison-types present on the opposing team, feel free to set up Toxic Spikes whenever Dragalge is able to force out an opposing Pokemon. Remember that Dragalge lacks reliable recovery and can be worn down quickly if it's relied on too much. Dragon Tail works great with other entry hazards, so don't be afraid to support Dragalge with Spikes and Stealth Rock to get the most out of Dragon Tail's phazing abilities.

Team Options
======

Dragalge really appreciates Wish support from Aromatisse and Alomomola as it lacks reliable recovery. Aromatisse typically uses Aromatherapy to rid Dragalge of bothersome status ailments while Alomomola has Toxic to poison Flying-types and Levitate users. Gligar is a solid physical wall to use with Dragalge as it's an even sturdier answer to Hitmonlee while also being a great switch-in for Rhyperior. Similarly to many other defensive Pokemon, Assault Vest Slowking is a solid teammate for its high special bulk, Regenerator ability, and resistance to Psychic- and Ice-type moves. Slowking also has Dragon Tail to continue phazing opponents and spreading around poison via Toxic Spikes. A sturdy spinblocker, such as Doublade, Spiritomb, or Gourgeist-XL, can keep Toxic Spikes from being spun away. Spikes is really helpful to amplify the damage done by the phazing effects of Dragon Tail. As most Spikes users in RU share similar counters with Dragalge, Ferroseed is an interesting option as it has solid defensive synergy with Dragalge and its Leech Seed can somewhat compensate for Dragalge's lack of reliable recovery.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Sludge Bomb
move 3: Scald / Hydro Pump
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Focus Blast
ability: Poison Point
item: Choice Specs
evs: 200 HP / 252 SpA / 56 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
======

Instead of using Dragalge's typing to wall dangerous attackers and set up Toxic Spikes, this set focuses on using its typing to pivot into resisted attacks and its respectable base 97 Special Attack and coverage to deal major damage to the opposing team. Draco Meteor is the strongest move in Dragalge's arsenal and is sure to dent most Pokemon without a resistance or immunity to it. Thanks to super effective STAB Sludge Bomb, opposing Fairy-types will be very hesitant to come in to block Draco Meteor. Despite its lower power, Scald is preferred over Hydro Pump in the third slot, because Dragalge will generally only need to use a Water-type move on Pokemon that are weak to Water-type attacks, such as Rhyperior. The 30% burn chance is also nice to have if you don't predict correctly. However, Hydro Pump has more power and can give Dragalge a decently powerful third option to lock itself into. The last move is primarily for Steel-types. Because of this, Hidden Power Fire is preferred as it hits all of them for significant damage, especially Escavalier, but Focus Blast hits Registeel twice as hard while also retaining coverage on Cobalion. However, it misses out on Escavalier and Doublade, and its accuracy can be a detriment in tight situations. Shadow Ball is an alternate coverage option that can hit the likes of Slowking, Doublade, and Reuniclus decently hard.

Set Details
======

56 Speed EVs are all Dragalge needs to outspeed Registeel and Tangrowth and smack them with the appropriate attack. A Modest nature along with maximum Special Attack investment is used to let Dragalge hit as hard as it possibly can, and all remaining EVs are put in HP for overall bulk. Choice Specs should be the only item used on this set, as the power boost is a necessity for Dragalge to hit as hard as it needs to.

Usage Tips
======

You should switch Dragalge in on resisted attacks from the likes of Jolteon, Rotom-C, and Virizion. Draco Meteor is the main move you should be using on this set, but don't be afraid to throw out a Sludge Bomb if there are Fairy-types, such as Aromatisse, Whimsicott, or Granbull, on the opposing team. Dragalge's Water-type move should generally only be used if you suspect a Rhyperior or other Pokemon weak to Water-type moves to come in. If using Scald, it can be thrown out if you suspect a bulky physical attacker in general as the possible burn will cripple them. Hidden Power Fire and Focus Blast are only used for Steel-types, so make sure to use them only if you suspect one is switching in. Keep Dragalge away from Knock Off users whenever possible, as losing its Choice Specs will severely detract from its damage output.

Team Options
======

Wish and cleric support is appreciated to keep Dragalge healthy throughout the match since it pivots into attacks quite often. Aromatisse and Alomomola are ideal Wish users, and Aromatisse even comes with Aromatherapy. Strong Choice Scarf users, such as Hitmonlee, Meloetta, and Rotom-C, are not only able to take advantage of the holes in the opposing team Dragalge creates, but also like having a sturdy fallback option if they're met with a counter after a successful revenge kill early on. Fast special attackers, such as Jolteon, Choice Scarf Moltres, and Choice Scarf Delphox can clean up opposing teams after Dragalge has weakened opposing special walls. Sweepers, such as Agility Moltres, Calm Mind Delphox, and Substitute + Calm Mind Meloetta are also able to take advantage of weakened special walls and find sweeping much easier after Dragalge does its job. Spikes support can be very useful as most of Dragalge's counters are grounded. Accelgor and Omastar are the best Spikes users in RU, but Ferroseed is a solid alternative if you're looking for a sturdy Spikes user that has good synergy with Dragalge.

Other Options
########

Dragalge has a large movepool, but not many of those moves are very useful over its primary options. Assault Vest seems like a great idea with a naturally bulky Pokemon like Dragalge, but it lacks power without Adaptability, thus making it inferior to a Choice Specs set. Thunderbolt is an alternate coverage move that can hit the likes of Slowking, Golbat, and Moltres pretty hard. Haze can be used over Dragon Tail to remove stat boosts, but it is only really more useful in last-Pokemon scenarios. Toxic is an option to hit Levitate users or Flying-type Pokemon that are otherwise immune to Toxic Spikes. Surf is an alternate Water-type move Dragalge has, but is not really useful compared to Scald and Hydro Pump. Finally, Sludge Wave is Dragalge's strongest Poison-type STAB move, but the extra 5 Base Power isn't worth missing out on Sludge Bomb's 20% higher poison chance.

Checks and Counters
########

**Ground-types**: Gligar and Rhyperior are able to smash Dragalge with Earthquake and Gligar can even Defog away Toxic Spikes. Both are hit pretty hard by Scald, however. Dugtrio also ruins Dragalge with Earthquake, but it trades the ability to take a hit for Arena Trap to ensure Dragalge can't escape.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types are immune to Toxic Spikes and deal with Dragalge's STAB combination quite nicely. However, most are crippled by a burn from Scald, and all need to be wary of Hidden Power Fire and Focus Blast from the Choice Specs set.

**Psychic-types**: Delphox, Meloetta, and Cresselia are all solid Psychic-types that can hit Dragalge for super effective damage. However, Delphox and Meloetta need to be careful with poison possibly wearing them down. Slowking is notable for taking on the Specs set better, but it struggles more with the Toxic Spikes set.

**Entry Hazard Removers**: Skuntank, Golbat, Gligar, Sandslash, and Hitmonlee are all good choices to remove Dragalge's Toxic Spikes, but all of them need to be careful around the Choice Specs set.
