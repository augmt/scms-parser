Overview
########

Houndoom is capable of functioning well against both defensive and offensive teams in the RU metagame. Its access to Pursuit makes it an excellent partner for Pokemon such as Meloetta, whose counters are easily trapped and taken out by Houndoom. Houndoom is also fairly unpredictable due to its sizable movepool and mixed offensive stats. Strong priority in the form of STAB Sucker Punch is also very useful and can catch the opponent off-guard. However, Houndoom is let down by its paper thin defenses, which render it unable to take anything but resisted hits. On top of this, Houndoom has many checks that fit on a wide variety of teams, meaning that the opponent will likely have at least one good response to Houndoom.

Trapper
########
name: Trapper
move 1: Pursuit
move 2: Sucker Punch
move 3: Fire Blast
move 4: Crunch
ability: Flash Fire
item: Life Orb
evs: 220 Atk / 36 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Hasty

Moves
========

Pursuit allows Houndoom to put Pokemon such as Meloetta, Bronzong, Delphox, and Slowking in a checkmate position. Sucker Punch is a strong priority move that allows Houndoom to pick off weakened threats and can force mind games for Pokemon such as Delphox. Fire Blast 2HKOes physically defensive Golbat after Stealth Rock damage and hits Steel-types extremely hard. Crunch allows Houndoom to deal with Bronzong and Slowking without relying on them switching out.

Set Details
========

220 Attack EVs let Houndoom OHKO Meloetta and Delphox with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO standard Bronzong and Slowking with Crunch. The 36 Special Attack EVs guarantee the 2HKO on physically defensive Golbat with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock damage. Finally, 252 Speed EVs are used alongside a Hasty nature to ensure Houndoom outspeeds neutral-natured base 100s such as Glalie and Speed tie with other positively-natured base 95s. Flash Fire allows Houndoom to switch into predicted Fire-type attacks from the likes of Moltres. The extra power granted by Life Orb is necessary for Houndoom to effectively Pursuit trap its intended targets.

Usage Tips
========

Houndoom should be used on offensively oriented teams that can utilize the holes that Houndoom opens up in the opposing team. When Pursuit trapping, it is important to predict carefully, as most of the targets of Pursuit are able to survive it if they don't switch out. Don't be afraid to sack Houndoom if it has successfully opened up a route for your win condition, but its powerful Sucker Punch can be extremely useful at cleaning up the opponent's team late-game.

Team Options
========

Choice Scarf and Choice Specs Meloetta both make excellent partners for Houndoom, luring in bulky Psychic- and Steel-types and U-turning into Houndoom. Electric-types such as Eelektross, Rotom-C, and Jolteon also make for good partners, as they are capable of dealing with the bulky Water-types that like to switch into Houndoom. Entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, are extremely important for this set to function. As such, Omastar, Rhyperior, Druddigon, and Cobalion all make good partners for Houndoom, depending on the composition of the rest of your team.

Nasty Plot
########
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Dark Pulse
move 4: Sucker Punch / Hidden Power Grass
ability: Flash Fire
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Hasty / Timid

Moves
========

Nasty Plot boosts Houndoom's Special Attack to extremely high levels, which allows Houndoom to easily blast its way through defensively oriented teams. Fire Blast spares only the bulkiest of Pokemon that resist Fire, as nothing else is capable of switching into a Fire Blast at +2. Dark Pulse has 100% accuracy, a chance to flinch, and nice coverage with Fire Blast, hitting key special walls such as Slowking. In the last slot, Houndoom has quite a few options. Sucker Punch allows Houndom to pick off faster, weakened Pokemon, allowing Houndoom to retain more utility against offense. Sucker Punch will also catch your opponent off-guard if you have already revealed that you have Nasty Plot. Hidden Power Grass is capable of OHKOing Rhyperior and Gastrodon at +2, which Houndoom otherwise struggles to do. Flame Charge can increase Houndoom's utility against offensively oriented teams. If Houndoom manages to get to +2 / +1, it is often game over.

Set Details
========

252 EVs are placed into both Speed and Special Attack, allowing Houndoom to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Hasty nature allows Houndoom to more easily set up on special threats, such as Cresselia, while also allowing Houndoom to Speed tie opposing positive-natured maximum Speed base 95s. Houndoom appreciates Life Orb's power boost and doesn't mind the loss of HP, given its frailty. The final 4 EVs are placed in Attack for Sucker Punch, though if you forgo Sucker Punch for Hidden Power Grass, these 4 EVs should be placed into Special Defense, and a Timid nature should be used.

Usage Tips
========

Against defensively oriented teams, set up a Nasty Plot against Pokemon that can't do much damage to Houndoom, or on forced switches. Against offensively oriented teams, it is not necessary to set up a Nasty Plot, and Houndoom's best option is to fire off its powerful Life Orb boosted STAB attacks and pick off weakened threats with Sucker Punch.

Team Options
========

Houndoom really appreciates the chip damage provided by entry hazards, which allow it to pick up some key OHKOs, such as Rhyperior with one layer of Spikes and Stealth Rock. Omastar and Accelgor are both good choices for setting up Spikes. Houndoom appreciates Pokemon that can take on bulky Water-types as well as clean up after Houndoom has punched holes in the opponent's team. Choice Scarf Rotom-C and Jolteon are both good options for cleaning up after Nasty Plot Houndoom and give it switch-in opportunities with Volt Switch. Life Orb Clawitzer is another good choice, as it can take advantage of Nasty Plot Houndoom's ability to take out specially defensive Alomomola and specially defensive Aromatisse, two of Clawitzer's best counters.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Overheat / Fire Blast
move 2: Dark Pulse
move 3: Flamethrower
move 4: Destiny Bond / Will-O-Wisp / Toxic
ability: Flash Fire
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Overheat can heavily damage the foe in emergency situations. Fire Blast can be used in this slot instead, as it lacks Overheat's power drop, but it is slightly weaker and less accurate. Dark Pulse allows Houndoom to deal with threats such as Meloetta. Flamethrower is Houndoom's most reliable Fire-type STAB move for cleaning up the opponent's team. Destiny Bond can be used to take out threatening Pokemon that have already set up, such as Swords Dance Drapion and Calm Mind Slowking. However, locking Houndoom into Destiny Bond is very risky and can be taken advantage of if the opponent decides not to attack that turn and sets up instead. Toxic and Will-O-Wisp give Houndoom more utility against defensively oriented teams. Will-O-Wisp's ability to cripple fast physical attackers is really useful against balanced teams, while Toxic's ability to put walls such as Alomomola on a timer is also very useful.

Set Details
========

With 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature, Houndoom is capable of outspeeding every unboosted threat in the RU metagame, as well as other common Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Meloetta and Moltres. Timid Choice Scarf Houndoom also Speed ties with Adamant Choice Scarf Durant. 252 EVs are placed into Special Attack so that Houndoom hits as hard as possible.

Usage Tips
========

Houndoom should primarily be used as a revenge killer, taking out the opponent's weakened Pokemon. This set is capable of surprising Pokemon such as Durant and Cobalion, which would otherwise easily take on Houndoom. It is very important that Destiny Bond be used only in emergency situations, such as after a threat has set up, as a Pokemon locked into Destiny Bond is very easy to take advantage of. With its base 95 Speed, Houndoom will always outspeed opposing Moltres and Meloetta, which is very useful in the current RU metagame.

Team Options
========

Choice Scarf Houndoom appreciates the presence of strong wallbreakers such as Mega Glalie, which can easily wear down the opponent's Pokemon to a point where Houndoom can clean. Pokemon that can easily take on Water-types, such as Virizion, Eelektross, and Rotom-C, all make for good partners. Entry hazard removal is especially nice for Choice Scarf Houndoom, as it is weak to Stealth Rock. Hitmonlee is a good choice for a Rapid Spinner that can also pressure the opponent's team, while Golbat is a good Defogger capable of pivoting into attacks aimed at Houndoom.

Other Options
########

Sunny Day Houndoom with Solar Beam can help deal with bulky Rock- and Water-types, but it is generally inferior to the Nasty Plot set in terms of sweeping prowess. A set utilizing Counter and a Focus Sash is viable, but it isn't that useful and requires a lot of team support to be done successfully. Houndoom could also utilize Reversal alongside a Focus Sash, but it doesn't really hit anything that significant. Taunt is a cool option on teams that rely heavily on entry hazard stacking, as it can prevent Defog; however, Houndoom has a favorable matchup against most Defoggers in RU anyway.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Emboar resists Houndoom's STAB moves and can retaliate with a super effective STAB Fighting-type move. Pangoro, Hitmonlee, Gurdurr, and Hitmontop can come into any move barring Fire Blast and take Houndoom out with their STAB attacks.

**Rock-types**: Specially defensive variants of Regirock and Rhyperior can take on all sets lacking Hidden Power Grass and strike back with their STAB moves.

**Faster Pokemon that resist Dark**: Cobalion and Virizion are both capable of revenge killing non-Choice Scarf variants of Houndoom, and they both benefit from Sucker Punches aimed at them. However, they must be wary of switching into Fire Blast.

**Fast Attackers**: Jolteon and Durant are both capable of revenge killing Houndoom, but they must be wary of the Choice Scarf set, which is capable of outspeeding and dealing heavy damage to both of them.

**Specially Defensive Walls**: Specially defensive Alomomola and Gastrodon are both capable of taking Houndoom's STAB moves and striking back with a super effective STAB move.
