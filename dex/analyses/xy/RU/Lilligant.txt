Overview
########

Lilligant has access to the coveted Quiver Dance, an amazing boosting move. It also has good abilities to compliment its decent movepool, which includes Sleep Powder, Giga Drain, Petal Dance, and Healing Wish. With its good Speed and Special Attack, Lilligant manages to carve out a niche in RU. It has a few downsides, however. It is definitely lacking in bulk. Furthermore, its bad defensive typing certainly does not complement its frailty. Its defenses aren't the only problem, as it also doesn't have very good coverage to hit its weaknesses, and it faces competition as a Quiver Dance user from Vivillon. Overall, Lilligant can manage to be of use on most teams between its offensive set and its Choice Scarf support set.

Quiver Dance
########
name: Quiver Dance
move 1: Quiver Dance
move 2: Sleep Powder
move 3: Giga Drain / Petal Dance
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Rock / Hidden Power Flying
ability: Own Tempo
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Quiver Dance gives Lilligant its niche and allows Lilligant to be potentially dangerous to any team. Sleep Powder is very useful in that it not only puts foes that may threaten your team to sleep but also gives Lilligant a good chance to set up safely. Giga Drain is a reliable STAB move that also lets Lilligant regain any HP it may have lost. Petal Dance, on the other hand, is a high Base Power spammable move, and, thanks to Own Tempo, Lilligant does not get confused after using it. Petal Dance is unreliable, however, as it locks Lilligant into it for two to three turns. The last slot is a toss-up between Hidden Power Rock, Hidden Power Fire, and Hidden Power Flying. Hidden Power Rock hits huge threats such as Moltres and Fletchinder on the switch, while also hitting Bug-types and other Fire- and Flying-types. Hidden Power Fire hits threatening Steel- and Bug-types, such as Durant, Escavalier, and Doublade. Lastly, Hidden Power Flying hits targets that would otherwise completely wall Lilligant, such as Emboar, Virizion, and Amoonguss; it also is able to OHKO Virizion, which is very important.

Set Details
========

252 EVs go into Lilligant's best stats, Special Attack and Speed, with 4 EVs in HP. Own Tempo is used so that Lilligant can never be confused, from either Petal Dance or moves that cause confusion. Lum Berry is so that Lilligant can recover from status once, while Life Orb is used to boost the power of all of Lilligant's attacks. A Timid nature is preferred, as Lilligant sits at a good Speed tier and needs maximized Speed most of the time. A Modest nature can be used to hit exceptionally hard.

Usage Tips
========

There are a few key things to note about Lilligant when you use it. Firstly, do not switch Lilligant into any incoming attacks, as it is pretty frail. Sleep Powder should be used when you want a free opportunity to set up. If not using Sleep Powder to create opportunities to set up, set up on walls that do not threaten Lilligant, such as Alomomola. Take out threats that could pose problems for Lilligant beforehand, such as Registeel and Poison-types such as Golbat and Amoonguss. Lastly, use this Lilligant as a late-game sweeper, as it cannot take out whole teams or switch in very often most of the time.

Team Options
========

Lilligant needs support to function properly. Fire-types such as Delphox and Moltres work especially well, as they can beat troublesome Pokemon such as Registeel, Amoonguss, Golbat, and Doublade. Lilligant beats Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types in return. Rhyperior works especially well, as it not only sets up hazards to allow Lilligant an easier time to sweep, but also beats Fire-, Poison-, and Flying-types for Lilligant. Finally, Rapid Spin or Defog users such as Golbat, Gligar, and Hitmontop work well as they get rid of entry hazards that hinder Lilligant.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Leaf Storm / Petal Dance
move 3: Hidden Power Rock / Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Flying
move 4: Healing Wish
ability: Own Tempo
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Sleep Powder is used to induce sleep, helping out teammates. Leaf Storm and Petal Dance are used as offensive options so that Lilligant can do more than just support its teammates. Leaf Storm provides greater power, but halves Lilligant's Special Attack. Petal Dance, on the other hand, locks Lilligant in in, so it's risky to use. The third slot is a toss-up between coverage choices. Hidden Power Rock hits huge threats such as Moltres and Fletchinder on the switch, while also hitting Bug-, Fire-, and Flying-types. Hidden Power Fire hits threatening Steel- and Bug-types, such as Durant, Escavalier, and Doublade. Lastly, Hidden Power Flying hits targets that would otherwise completely wall Lilligant, such as Emboar, Virizion, and Amoonguss. It is able to OHKO Virizion, which is very important. The last slot holds Lilligant's most important move on the set, Healing Wish. The ability to send out an unneeded Lilligant late-game, pull off a speedy Healing Wish, and fully heal a win condition is very valuable.

Set Details
========

252 EVs go into Lilligant's best stats, Special Attack and Speed, while 4 HP EVs are for a little bit of bulk. Own Tempo is used so that it can never become confused, from either Petal Dance or moves that cause confusion. Choice Scarf allows Lilligant to be a very fast support Pokemon as well as a late-game cleaner.

Usage Tips
========

There are a few things to keep in mind when using Lilligant. Send it in on any walls that it can put to sleep. Its main function is to support its teammates and put threatening opponents to sleep. Also, keep Lilligant around as long as possible so that it is able to use Healing Wish late-game. Do not try to use this Lilligant primarily as an attacker, as it isn't very strong without Quiver Dance boosts. It should stick to supporting teammates and picking off weakened opponents or threats.

Team Options
========

Lilligant complements many Pokemon, so it has a wide variety of compatible teammates. Late-game sweepers such as Swords Dance Cobalion make exceptionally good teammates for Lilligant, as Healing Wish fully heals them and allows them to finish off an opponent's team. Most Pokemon can benefit from Lilligant putting one of their main checks to sleep. Lilligant can function and support almost any Pokemon and makes for an exceptional partner for anything. Finally, Rapid Spin or Defog users such as Golbat, Gligar, and Hitmontop work well as they get rid of entry hazards that may hinder Lilligant. 

Other Options
########

Lilligant has quite a few more options. Dream Eater can be used in tandem with Sleep Powder. Swords Dance is an option for a physical set, but a special set is much better. Substitute can be used in tandem with Quiver Dance to allow Lilligant to avoid status and take advantage of switches. Giga Drain can recover back the damage lost from the Substitute. Choice Specs can be used with Petal Dance, but it's pretty unreliable. A Chlorophyll set with Growth is an option in the sun and can sweep teams nicely. Lastly, Heal Bell can be used to heal teammates of any ailments, but there are better, bulkier users of the move.

Checks & Counters
########

**Flying-types**: Flying-types pose big threats to Lilligant. Moltres can beat it with any STAB move. Fletchinder can pick it off with a priority Acrobatics, while Golbat is bulky enough to take any hit and KO it with Brave Bird. Moltres and Fletchinder should be wary of Hidden Power Rock on the switch, however.

**Fire-types**: Fire-types also make excellent checks to Lilligant. Pokemon such as Emboar, Delphox, and Magmortar have no problem picking Lilligant off with one of their STAB moves. Additionally, Magmortar has access to Vital Spirit, which gives it an immunity to Sleep Powder.

**Poison-types**: Poison-types are arguably the biggest threat to Lilligant. Amoonguss, Weezing, Drapion, and Skuntank can all usually take a hit and KO Lilligant with a Poison-type STAB move. Amoonguss is arguably the best Poison-type check due to its immunity to Sleep Powder, and access to Clear Smog.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types also pose a threat to Lilligant, as its movepool cannot always cover them. Cobalion, Escavalier, Durant, and Registeel can all either KO it with a STAB move or wear down Lilligant gradually. They must be wary of Hidden Power Fire, however.

**Opposing Grass-types**: Grass-types have a favorable type matchup against Lilligant, as they are immune to Sleep Powder. Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Abomasnow can all take hits relatively well and KO Lilligant with a coverage move. Amoonguss can use Sludge Bomb, Tangrowth can wear it down, and Abomasnow can use Blizzard if Lilligant lacks Hidden Power Fire.
