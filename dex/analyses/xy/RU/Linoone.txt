Overview
########

Linoone is the only Pokemon with access to both Belly Drum and Extreme Speed, making it incredibly hard to revenge kill and an absolutely terrifying late-game cleaner. This trait is complemented by Linoone's above-average movepool, which was greatly improved by the nerf to the Steel type, allowing Linoone to now hit Steel-types for neutral damage. However, Linoone needs lots of support in order to successfully sweep through offensive teams. Linoone is still checked very well by the Steel-types of the tier. Linoone forces you to run a Pokemon that is specifically catered to support Linoone and potentially another sweeper. This is disappointing, as that teamslot could have been used for a Pokemon that your team is in dire need of. However, can still aid your team by giving it a decent win condition.

Belly Drum
########
name: Belly Drum
move 1: Belly Drum
move 2: Extreme Speed
move 3: Shadow Claw
move 4: Seed Bomb
ability: Gluttony
item: Sitrus Berry
evs: 160 HP / 252 Atk / 96 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

After a Belly Drum, Linoone's Attack skyrockets to an astounding 1048! Extreme Speed is the best STAB move on Linoone, as it can pick off revenge killers such as Fletchinder and non-Focus Sash Dugtrio. Shadow Claw is also a very handy move for Linoone as it provides nearly unresisted coverage in conjunction with Extreme Speed and also allows Linoone to hit the Ghost-types that would otherwise completely stop it. Seed Bomb is used for hitting Rock-types such as Rhyperior.

Set Details
========

An Adamant nature is used to ensure that Linoone hits as hard as possible. The EV spread allows Linoone to outspeed Adamant Kabutops and OHKO it with Seed Bomb while the rest of the EVs are dumped into HP and Attack. Sitrus Berry is very handy, as it allows Linoone to instantly recover after using Belly Drum. Linoone's ability is really not important as both Gluttony and Pickup are rather useless. Quick Feet would be useful, but it is incompatible with Extreme Speed.

Usage Tips
========

Steel-types should always be either disposed of or heavily weakened, as they hinder Linoone's ability to sweep late-game. Setting up a Belly Drum is sometimes very hard to do, but with the right support, it is rather easy to clean late-game.

Team Options
========

Uxie stands out as the best teammate for Linoone, because as it has access to dual screens, Memento, and Stealth Rock, allowing Linoone to net easier KOs. Magneton and Dugtrio can trap Steel-types other than Doublade that Linoone absolutely despises. In addition, Dugtrio can also provide Memento support. Meowstic-M can set up dual screens for Linoone, allowing for a cleaner sweep. Dedicated users of Memento such as Whimsicott are very helpful because they allow Linoone to set up Belly Drum without taking much damage.

Other Options
########

Linoone has access to Play Rough, though the only notable Pokemon it hits is Spiritomb. Gunk Shot can be used to hit Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Tangrowth, but it does not have much use outside of nailing those two Pokemon. Rock Smash is a great option for Linoone, as it hits Steel-types for super effective damage in addition to having a good chance to drop Defense. Dig is another option to hit Steel-types, but it gives your opponent a free turn where they can switch in a counter. The final option that Linoone has is Natural Gift combined with the Salac Berry, creating a 110 Base Power Fighting-type attack, which OHKOes all relevant Steel-types after Stealth Rock at +6.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Cobalion can take an Extreme Speed even at +6 and retaliate with a Close Combat. Registeel can take a hit then fire off a Thunder Wave, greatly crippling Linoone. Doublade can survive a +6 Shadow Claw and counter with Sacred Sword. Steelix takes laughable damage from any of Linoone's attacks and can absolutely demolish Linoone with Gyro Ball.

**Taunt**: Linoone is vulnerable to Taunt before it sets up a Belly Drum, so Pokemon such as Whimsicott can easily counter it. Whimsicott can also use Prankster Stun Spore to check Linoone very well before Linoone sets up.

**Status**: Linoone is absolutely crippled by status, specifically burn and paralysis. Users of Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave such as Mega Banette` and double Powder Amoongus are a problem for Linoone before a Belly Drum.

**Bulky Pokemon**: Tangrowth can take the majority of Linoone's attacks at +6 then counter with a Focus Blast. Gligar is another good example, as it can sponge Linoone's attacks and retaliate with Earthquake.
