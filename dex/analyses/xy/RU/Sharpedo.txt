Overview
########

Sharpedo swims above the rest as one of the best late-game sweepers in the tier, as it requires very little team support to perform its role. Sharpedo is blessed with a naturally high base 120 Attack, as well as an acceptable base 95 Special Attack, along with a good movepool on both the physical and special sides to complement this. However, by far the best trait that Sharpedo has going for it is its access to the ability Speed Boost, which allows it to outspeed most of the tier after just a single turn. With all these traits put together, it's not hard to see why Sharpedo is the monster it is in RU.

However, even the best of Pokemon have their flaws, and Sharpedo is no exception. Its defenses are paper-thin, which means that most neutral hits are capable of taking it out. Since it will not be switching in on any hits, getting Sharpedo in on a free switch is necessary for it to start sweeping. It is also very priority-weak, and while running Aqua Jet might mitigate this problem, it will miss out on the coverage it so desperately needs if it chooses to do so. However, Sharpedo's good qualities far outweigh its negative ones, so it is still a top-tier threat and a force to be reckoned with.

Physical Attacker
########
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Waterfall
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Zen Headbutt / Aqua Jet / Earthquake / Destiny Bond
move 4: Protect
ability: Speed Boost
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

This is Sharpedo's bread-and-butter set and the one you will be finding yourself facing most often. Waterfall and Crunch are obvious moves to have on Sharpedo, as they are Water- and Dark-type STAB moves, respectively. The third moveslot is up to the player to get coverage on what they want to take out. Zen Headbutt is useful against Fighting-types such as Virizion, while Aqua Jet allows Sharpedo to mitigate its weakness to priority with a priority move of its own. Earthquake is useful for taking down bulky Steel-types, such as Registeel and Cobalion, that Sharpedo might not break through as easily with only neutral coverage. Destiny Bond is useful for securing one last kill with Sharpedo before it gets KOed. Finally, Protect is essential on this set, as it allows Sharpedo to get a free turn to boost its Speed and start sweeping.

Ice Beam gets a mention here for being able to take down bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth, while also nailing Gligar extremely hard. However, splitting EVs between Attack and Special Attack or running Ice Beam without investment does not appeal to most players.

Set Details
========

The EVs, an Adamant nature, and Life Orb are utilized on this set to maximize Sharpedo's Attack and Speed.

Usage Tips
========

Due to its severe frailty, Sharpedo should not be attempting to switch into any hits, as even a neutral hit is capable of taking it down. For the same reason, Sharpedo usually only has one opportunity to sweep, and that opportunity tends to not come up until the endgame, so make sure all of Sharpedo's checks and counters have been eliminated beforehand. Priority users should be KOed and all other checks should be weak enough for Sharpedo to take down in a single hit. When Sharpedo has switched in against an opponent that is faster, using Protect will give Sharpedo a free turn to nab that Speed Boost and outspeed it next turn. When using Protect, always be cautious not to give your opponent a free switch, because depending on what your opponent switches into, your sweep could be stopped cold. Finally, do not attempt to switch Sharpedo in on an attack, as any hit will severely dent it thanks to its frailty.

Team Options
========

Wallbreakers in general are great at supporting Sharpedo. Physical wallbreakers such Life Orb Hitmonlee and Choice Band Rhyperior lure in and weaken physical walls, while special wallbreakers such as Moltres can fish for KOs on physical walls. As with any sweeper, entry hazards support will wear down the opponent's team and open up opportunities for Sharpedo to sweep. This is especially true for Sharpedo, which is one ofthe best late-game cleaners in RU. Really, anything to wear down the opponent's team is great to have on a team with Sharpedo.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Hydro Pump / Surf
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Dark Pulse
move 4: Protect
ability: Speed Boost
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

This set plays almost identically to the physical set; however, this set completely annihilates the Pokemon that check the physical set, which is part of the unpredictability that makes Sharpedo so good. Hydro Pump is the preferred Water-type STAB move for raw power, though the shaky accuracy might make some players opt to use Surf. Ice Beam is a great coverage move that deals with Grass-types, such as Tangrowth and Virizion, as well as completely destroying Gligar. Dark Pulse is Sharpedo's Dark-type STAB move, which does some decent damage with 80 Base Power. Finally, Protect is essential in allowing Sharpedo to nab a free turn in order to boost its Speed, which allows it to start a sweep many opponents will find hard to stop if timed right.

Crunch with 100 Attack EVs and a neutral nature gets a notable mention as an option over Dark Pulse, as it can be used to take down special walls such as Meloetta and Slowking. Destiny Bond can also be used to get one last kill before going down, though it is significantly harder to fit into this set than it is in the physical set.

Finally, most players will expect Sharpedo to be physical and play accordingly, so use that to your advantage to score some surprise KOs.

Wallbreakers in general are great at supporting Sharpedo. For example, special wallbreakers such as Moltres and Exploud lure in and weaken special walls.

This is especially true for Sharpedo, which is one of the best late-game cleaners in RU. Really, anything to wear down the opponent's team is great to have on a team with Sharpedo.

Other Options
########

A mixed sweeper set is not a bad idea for Sharpedo, and it can be a real nasty surprise for players expecting a purely physical or special sweeper. Ice Fang can be used on the physical set to take down bulky Grass-types and Gligar. Poison Jab allows Sharpedo to heavily dent bulky Fairy-types such as Aromatisse.

Checks & Counters
########

**Priority users**: Priority users such as Mach Punch Hitmonlee will be able to bypass Sharpedo's extraordinary Speed and swiftly finish it off. Aqua Jet can be used to mitigate this problem, but Sharpedo will be forced to give up some of its nifty coverage if it does, and Aqua Jet does come with the nasty downside of only having 40 Base Power.

**Water-types**: Bulky Water-types are some of the most reliable checks to Sharpedo that you will find. Specially defensive Alomomola and Gastrodon can boast of being some of the few Pokemon that can wall both the physical and the special set. Others, such as Qwilfish with its physical bulk and access to Indimidate, are better at walling only one set or the other. Poliwrath is also a good Water-type check, as long as Sharpedo isn't running Zen Headbutt. Seismitoad is also a good option and can heal itself when switching into Sharpedo's Water STAB moves thanks to Water Absorb.

**Grass-types**: Bulky Grass-types, such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss, are great at walling the physical set, but struggle against any set that happens to be running Ice Beam. Ferroseed is also a great Pokemon to use when walling Sharpedo, as it has the advantage of being able to take on both sets.

**Steel-types**: Bulky Steel-types, such as Registeel and Cobalion, can take a hit and retaliate as long as Sharpedo isn't running Earthquake.

**Bulky Attackers**: Most of the other checks and counters listed above, with the exception of priority users, are all bulky Pokemon. However, any other bulky Pokemon not listed is also a viable check to Sharpedo as long as it can take a hit, as Sharpedo's poor defenses will ensure that it goes down quickly. Examples of bulky attackers include Gurdurr and Druddigon.
