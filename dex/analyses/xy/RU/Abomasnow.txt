Overview
########

After gaining a Mega Evolution, Abomasnow became a unique threat in the RU tier. Mega Abomasnow's excellent offensive stats and powerful STAB moves, complemented by the necessary coverage options, make it extremely difficult to switch into. Notably, it is able to abuse a 100% accurate Blizzard due to its ability, Snow Warning, which summons hail. The residual damage that hail racks up can also prove very useful in whittling foes down, although it affects Abomasnow's teammates as well. Additionally, Abomasnow can strike hard with powerful physical attacks such as Wood Hammer and Earthquake. Sadly, an abysmal base 30 Speed, coupled with weaknesses to common offensive types such as Fire, Steel, and Fighting, means Abomasnow has a hard time switching in and gets forced out easily. Having no reliable recovery move further impairs its durability. That being said, it still finds opportunities to switch in on defensive Pokemon such as Gligar. Finally, it is worth noting that Abomasnow's poor Speed can be turned into an asset with Trick Room support, and can be bypassed on a situational basis with a decently powerful priority move in Ice Shard.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Ice Shard
move 2: Wood Hammer / Giga Drain
move 3: Blizzard
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Soundproof
item: Abomasite
evs: 8 HP / 160 Atk / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 84 Spe
nature: Lonely

Moves
========

With +1 priority, Ice Shard picks off weakened offensive threats in general, proving especially useful against Pokemon weak to it or otherwise frail threats such as Braviary, Virizion, and Hitmonlee. Wood Hammer hits very hard with sizable Attack investment, notably OHKOing Rhyperior, but the recoil wears Abomasnow down quickly. Giga Drain hits decently hard, and its HP-draining effect is useful for sustaining Abomasnow's lifespan. Blizzard is a strong STAB move that gets great neutral coverage in the tier and has perfect accuracy under hail. With maximum Special Attack investment, it does a number to anything that doesn't resist it. Earthquake is used primarily for its super effective coverage on Steel-types such as Cobalion and Registeel. It also hits predicted Delphox and Emboar switch-ins. Hidden Power Fire can be considered in the last moveslot, as it is 4x effective against Escavalier, which otherwise solidly stomachs all of Abomasnow's other moves and can OHKO it in return.

Set Details
========

160 Attack EVs with a Lonely nature let Abomasnow accomplish a pertinent feat in 2HKOing Registeel with Earthquake after it has taken a turn of hail damage and a round of Spikes or 2 rounds of Stealth Rock damage. 252 Special Attack EVs let Abomasnow hit as hard as possible with its powerful STAB Blizzard. A Defense-lowering nature is used to take advantage of Abomasnow's specially based resistances such as to Electric- and Grass-type moves. 84 Speed EVs let Mega Abomasnow outspeed and OHKO 0 Speed Rhyperior with Wood Hammer. Alternatively, if outpacing Rhyperior is not an issue, a spread of 96 HP / 160 Atk / 252 SpA can be used. Soundproof lets Abomasnow switch into Choice-locked Exploud's Boomburst before it Mega Evolves. Lastly, a specially oriented spread of 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 SpA with a Quiet nature is usable if you pair Abomasnow with teammates that can trap and remove Registeel, like Dugtrio. Using a Lonely nature and investing in Speed to outpace Rhyperior and other relevant threats is also an option in that case.

Usage Tips
========

Abomasnow gets few switch-in opportunities; as such, you should actively attempt to bring it in via double switching on predicted switches into defensive Pokemon like Gligar and Alomomola. Also, Abomasnow gets forced out easily due to its poor Speed and many weaknesses, but at the same time, it is hard for enemies to switch into. Attempt to determine what Pokemon the opponent intends to switch in on Abomasnow, and hit it with the appropriate STAB or coverage move in order to get the most out of its limited time on the battlefield before you switch out. Due to its mediocre Speed and typing, Abomasnow fails to accomplish much late-game. Most of the time, when it has done its job of wallbreaking or dispatching a relevant threat early- and mid-game, it might be prudent to sack it, especially if the opponent can possibly capitalize on the turn you switch out to set up a threatening sweeper. However, if you see Pokemon like Braviary or Virizion in Team Preview, saving Abomasnow for an emergency Ice Shard late-game would be wise. Lastly, think twice about Mega Evolving if the opponent has Boomburst or Hyper Voice users, such as Exploud and Meloetta, on their team; Soundproof lets Abomasnow switch into Choice-locked attacks from these threats.

Team Options
========

Abomasnow appreciates Trick Room support. Slowking, Reuniclus, and Cofagrigus are examples of good Trick Room setters; all of these have decent defensive synergy with Abomasnow. Aromatisse can also set up Trick Room while being a blanket special wall that can provide Wish support. Note that Abomasnow should have 0 Speed IVs on such teams. Doublade is then a good partner, as it stands up well to the many physical attackers Abomasnow cannot handle and also benefits from Trick Room support. A reliable Stealth Rock user is recommended, as Mega Abomasnow forces many switches. Rhyperior is a good Stealth Rock setter that resists many of Abomasnow's weaknesses. Bronzong can also set up Trick Room in addition to Stealth Rock. Finally, U-turn users can bring Abomasnow in safely. For example, Braviary can U-turn out of physical walls like Gligar and Alomomola to bring Abomasnow in unscathed. A teammate with Wish can keep Abomasnow healthy during the match, as it has no means of reliable recovery. Alomomola is a very reliable user of Wish and boasts excellent type synergy with Abomasnow; Aromatisse can provide Wish support as well as set Trick Room.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Ice Shard
move 3: Wood Hammer
move 4: Earthquake
ability: Soundproof
item: Abomasite
evs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe
Nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Swords Dance boosts Abomasnow's Attack stat to gigantic levels. Ice Shard makes up for Abomasnow's low Speed stat, and with a Swords Dance boost under its belt, Abomasnow can use it to OHKO Pokemon such as Moltres, Jolteon, and Druddigon after Stealth Rock damage. Wood Hammer, despite quickly chipping away at Abomasnow's longevity, allows it to break through some of RU's bulkiest Pokemon, such as Cresselia, scoring a clean 2HKO on it after a Swords Dance. Earthquake complements Abomasnow's STAB moves nicely, covering common threats that resist them such as Doublade, Cobalion, and Registeel. Seed Bomb is an alternative to Wood Hammer for a Grass-type STAB move. However, it misses out on OHKOs on some crucial targets, such as Aromatisse, Reuniclus, and Spiritomb, which would usually crumble to a Swords Dance-boosted Wood Hammer.

Set Details
========

Maximizing Abomasnow's Attack is the natural choice, giving it enough power to hit hard right off the bat. The Speed EVs allow Abomasnow to outrun defensive variants of Rhyperior. However, if desired, one can opt for more Speed investment so that Abomasnow can outrun the likes of Druddigon and Tangrowth, though it's usually unnecessary to do so. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP. Soundproof lets Abomasnow serve as a decent Exploud check before Mega Evolving.

Usage Tips
========

In spite of having a below-average defensive typing, Abomasnow can be brought in on weaker Water- and Electric-types under most circumstances. However, it benefits the most from switching in unscathed, either through double switching or by the use of U-turn or Volt Switch. In order to fulfill its role, Abomasnow doesn't always need to get a Swords Dance boost, so it's recommended to carefully judge the situation before using it. It's also important to keep in mind that Abomasnow is quite versatile regarding its role. Against more defensive-leaning teams, it can break through bulkier targets with ease, whereas against offense, it is easily able to pick off weaker targets with Ice Shard.

Team Options
========

Abomasnow heavily benefits from entry hazard control, mostly due to its Stealth Rock weakness, but also because having Stealth Rock on the opposing side allows Abomasnow to score some OHKOs that usually wouldn't be possible, such as on Jolteon and Druddigon with a Swords Dance-boosted Ice Shard. Because of that, Defog users such as Gligar, as well as Stealth Rock setters such as Cobalion, are naturally good partners for Abomasnow. Pokemon that can bring Abomasnow in safely through the use of U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Eelektross, the aforementioned Gligar, and Lanturn, are nice teammates for Abomasnow, although it's possible for it to function well without those Pokemon. Pokemon that benefit from Abomasnow's ability to break through walls in order to clean later in the game, such as Fletchinder and Sharpedo, pair well with it too. Abomasnow also really enjoys paralysis support from the likes of Druddigon. Abomasnow can also be used under Trick Room, due to its low Speed and good defensive synergy with the common Trick Room setters, such as Cresselia and Bronzong.

Other Options
########

Mega Abomasnow lacks many other options. Its first three moves are essentially non-negotiable, as they have target very important Pokemon. In the last moveslot, either Leech Seed or Substitute can be used over Earthquake; the former provides Abomasnow some passive healing while sapping the foe's HP, and the latter eases prediction, allowing Abomasnow to batter the enemy from the safety of its Substitute. In any case, Abomasnow will miss the utility of a coverage move, making both of these suboptimal choices. Using Focus Blast is an option on specially oriented sets to hit Registeel; it also yields super effective coverage on bulky Normal-types such as Audino and Lickilicky. Using another item over Abomasite is not recommended, as you miss out on Mega Abomasnow's excellent mixed offensive stats for negligible gains that items such as Leftovers or Assault Vest provide, as Abomasnow is not taking hits anyway due to its many weaknesses. Items such as Choice Specs and Choice Scarf are gimmicky at best, given Abomasnow's poor Speed and susceptibility to entry hazards. Also, there are a mere two Mega Pokemon usable in RU, which means you will likely not be spoilt for choice on that front anyway.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Moltres, Houndoom, Emboar,and Delphox all OHKO Abomasnow with their STAB moves while resisting its STAB combination; however, only Moltres can safely switch in, as the other three fear Earthquake.

**Steel-types**: As with Fire-types, Steel-types do not fancy switching into Earthquake, but they resist Abomasnow's STAB moves and can cripple or OHKO it. Choice Specs Magneton's Flash Cannon decimates Abomasnow. Durant has a high chance to OHKO with a Life Orb-boosted Iron Head. Doublade and Cobalion outspeed Mega Abomasnow, can take a hit from the likes of Earthquake, and retaliate with Iron Head for the 2HKO; Registeel can beat non-Earthquake variants and Escavalier non-Hidden Power Fire ones. Lastly, Bronzong is completely immune to even Earthquake and has enough bulk to take a Hidden Power Fire, making it quite the solid check.

**Super Effective STAB Moves**: Abomasnow's defensive typing is quite unfortunate. STAB Fighting, Bug, Flying, Poison, and Rock moves from an assortment of Pokemon all plague Abomasnow. Examples include Drapion's Poison Jab, Braviary's Brave Bird, Gurdurr's Drain Punch, and Accelgor's Bug Buzz.

**Super Effective Coverage Moves**: Watch out for coverage moves as well; a stray Fire Blast from Slowking or Exploud might result in Abomasnow's untimely demise.

**Stealth Rock**: Stealth Rock strips 25% of Abomasnow's HP upon each switch in, hugely inconveniencing it.
