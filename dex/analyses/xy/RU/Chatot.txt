Overview
########

Chatot, once the butt of many jokes, has made quite a comeback in the XY RU metagame. Possessing Boomburst, a STAB 140 Base Power move that has absolutely no drawbacks, alongside its signature move, Chatter, which provides it with numerous opportunities to set up, Chatot can be devastating if played right. It also has access to a wonderful boosting move in Nasty Plot, which makes it extremely dangerous once it sets up. Unfortunately, it's not hard to clip this bird's wings; its defenses are horrendous, and it can't really stand up to any move before being KOed.

Moves
========

Chatter is a brilliant STAB attack that Chatot should use for its chance to confuse the opponent, giving Chatot a free turn to set up a Substitute. Boomburst is the main attacking move on this set, allowing this songbird to punch holes in most of the tier, helped by Boomburst going through Substitute. Boomburst can 2HKO most of the tier that isn't a dedicated special wall and can easily dismantle physical ones such as Alomomola one-on-one. Encore is another useful support option that Chatot can use early game against the likes of hazard setters, while forcing setup sweepers to use their boosting move repeatedly. Nasty Plot can be used over Encore if Chatot desires an extra power boost to its moves.

Set Details
========

The EV spread and nature maximize Chatot's offensive stats. Add Life Orb into the mix and you have one powerful Pokemon. Leftovers is also an option that provides Chatot with passive recovery and helps regain the self-inflicted damage caused by Substitute.

Usage Tips
========

Once Chatot is safely behind a Substitute, just focus on breaking the opposition with Boomburst. Try to use Chatter to provide Chatot opportunities to set up a Substitute; the same principle applies to Encore, except Chatot should use it when it's up against a Pokemon that is trying to deploy entry hazards or set up. Chatot can also try to use Substitute and Chatter repeatedly to rack up chip damage on the opponent. Bring Chatot into the match early-to-mid-game since Chatot becomes deadweight in the fast paced late-game due to Choice Scarf users and revenge killers.

Team Options
========

Chatot appreciates Sticky Web support so that it can offset its mediocre Speed. Try to pair Chatot with Pokemon that are able to set up entry hazards, as the chip damage racks up on the opposition because of the sheer amount of switches Chatot causes due to Encore and confusion; this is especially true with Toxic Spikes. Delphox and Moltres pair well with Chatot, as they can easily decimate opposing Steel-types. Late game cleaners, like Sharpedo, are also useful since they can pick off whatever is left of the opposing team after Chatot goes down.

Other Options
########

Chatot gets access to Heat Wave, which gives it a way to inflict damage on Steel-types, but it's incompatible with Boomburst, Chatot's biggest niche. Chatot can also offer momentum with U-turn, but it can't find enough room to run it. Roost allows Chatot to heal itself, but Chatot's main moves are more useful. A Focus Sash in tandem with Nasty Plot can be used as a surefire way to get Chatot to set up, but it's usually better to rely on Substitute. Chatot can also run Hidden Power Grass to bypass Rock-types, though once again, it's fairly weak and is generally outclassed by Chatot's other moves.

Checks & Counters
########

**Revenge Killers**: Revenge killers can easily outspeed and KO Chatot before it can do anything. Examples include Jolteon, Delphox, Choice Scarf Rotom-C, and Heliolisk.

**Rock- and Steel-types**: Registeel, Escavalier, Rhyperior, and Doublade take pitiful amounts of damage from both of Chatot's STAB moves and can force it to switch out.

**Special Walls**: Chatot struggles to break some dedicated special walls such as Slowking, which has a high chance of KOing it with Scald.

**Damage Dealing Moves**: Almost anything that can break through Chatot's pitiful 76 / 45 / 42 defenses can KO it.
