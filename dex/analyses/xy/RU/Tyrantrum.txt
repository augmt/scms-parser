Overview
########

Bearing the unique Rock / Dragon typing, Tyrantrum stands out as the only viable user of Dragon Dance in the RU tier. Dragon Dance enables it to boost its excellent base 121 Attack stat while patching up its mediocre base 71 Speed stat, allowing it to perform as a sweeper. With access to Thunder Fang, Ice Fang, Fire Fang, and Crunch, as well as the ability Strong Jaw, which gives a 50% boost in power to these moves, Tyrantrum has an incredibly wide range of coverage, being able to deal serious damage to every single Pokemon in the tier with the correct move. This allows it to be very threatening after setting up, which is made easier by its base 119 Defense stat.

Tyrantrum's biggest shortcoming aside from its poor Speed is its high susceptibility to special attacks, which is worsened by its typing being weak to Ground-, Ice-, and Fighting-type moves, all of which are relatively common, as well as the that fact its Rock-typing neutralizes the resistances to Water- and Grass-type moves its Dragon-typing carries. This flaw leaves it competing for a team slot against Pokemon with better bulk, Speed, or typing, such as Braviary, Doublade, and Cobalion, though it should be that noted none of them have access to the coveted Dragon Dance or the excellent coverage moves Tyrantrum does.

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Ice Fang
ability: Strong Jaw
item: Lum Berry / Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Dragon Dance allows Tyrantrum boost its Attack and Speed so that it can sweep. Stone Edge is a strong STAB move that is complemented nicely by Earthquake, which forms the EdgeQuake combo and offers near-perfect coverage in just two moves. Ice Fang rounds out this coverage by being able to dispatch Gligar and Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Virizion, and Amoonguss. Dragon Claw can be used for neutral coverage, as it is Tyrantrum's strongest Dragon-type STAB move, but it lacks significant power and hits nothing but Druddigon for super effective damage. Fire Fang can be used if Escavalier, Durant, or Bronzong are more of a concern, as it still covers Grass-types. Thunder Fang and Crunch are also useful for coverage against specific Pokemon: Thunder Fang scores a 2HKO on Alomomola when Tyrantrum is at +1, while Crunch can more readily dispose of Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon after a boost. Bear in mind, however, that Tyrantrum loses out on hitting more Pokemon by giving up its primary coverage options. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge if Stone Edge's accuracy is a concern, and the flinch chance Rock Slide offers can be helpful, but it is not as powerful as Stone Edge. Substitute can also be used to aid in setting up by avoiding status moves and making Tyrantrum harder to revenge kill, but Tyrantrum must lose out on coverage to run it.


Set Details
========

An Adamant nature maximizes Tyrantrum's power, allowing it to hit hard as possible. Unfortunately, this means it Speed ties with Ambipom and Cinccino when it is at +1, though they cannot do much to Tyrantrum anyway. A Jolly nature ensures Tyrantrum outspeeds Jolteon at +1, but makes it lose out on power. The item choice is dependent on whether you want Tyrantrum to be able to set up on Pokemon that can inflict status or whether you wish to deal as much damage as possible. Life Orb has the negative side effect of wearing down Tyrantrum as it attacks, making it more susceptible to priority; this is exacerbated if it has taken significant damage while setting up. A bulky spread of 248 HP / 44 Atk / 216 Spe can be used to add to Tyrantrum's low bulk, allowing it to more easily set up on Pokemon such as Braviary and Moltres while being able to outpace Cobalion at +1 with an Adamant nature.

Usage Tips
========

It's best to set up against Pokemon that cannot expect to do much to Tyrantrum, such as Choice Scarf Braviary, Golbat, Ambipom, Choice Delphox locked into Fire Blast, and Moltres. If Lum Berry is used, Tyrantrum is able to set up against defensive Pokemon that rely on status moves, such as Alomomola, Cofagrigus, and Jellicent, though they need to be weakened enough that Tyrantrum can take them out after its item has been used up. Use Dragon Dance mid- or late-game, when the opposing Pokemon are weakened enough that Tyrantrum can sweep uninterrupted after a boost. Try to cut down on the number of Pokemon that Tyrantrum can only hit with Stone Edge, so that it doesn't have to rely as heavily on Stone Edge's shaky accuracy to ensure a successful sweep.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that set up entry hazards are excellent partners for Tyrantrum, as entry hazards can weaken the opposing team for it. Stealth Rock users such as Rhyperior, Cobalion, Gligar, and Registeel, as well as users of Spikes or Toxic Spikes such as Roselia and Qwilfish, can help Tyrantrum sweep more easily. Omastar is also noteworthy because it has access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Pokemon such as Aromatisse, Lickilicky, Assault Vest Slowking, and Registeel can fend off special attackers for Tyrantrum; the former two are also able to keep it healthy with Wish support. Aromatisse once again, as well as Alomomola, Cofagrigus, Doublade, Gligar, and Tangrowth, is able to check Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Cobalion that threaten Tyrantrum. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Exploud, Clawitzer, Life Orb Moltres, Delphox, Jolteon, Choice Band Braviary, Escavalier, and Druddigon can soften up defensive Pokemon to allow Tyrantrum to sweep against bulkier teams. Dugtrio, Delphox, and Moltres are also able to remove or weaken Steel-types such as Registeel, Doublade, Escavalier, and Bronzong which would otherwise hinder Tyrantrum's ability to sweep, especially if it lacks Fire Fang. Dual screens support from Uxie, Cresselia, or Bronzong is also helpful, as Tyrantrum appreciates the extra protection from attackers while setting up and can beat most Defog users that aim to get rid of the screens one-on-one.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Stone Edge
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Ice Fang
move 4: Fire Fang
ability: Strong Jaw
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

The EdgeQuake combo allows Tyrantrum to hit the majority of the tier for neutral damage. Ice Fang primarily hits Gligar, scoring a solid 2HKO, while Fire Fang reliably covers Escavalier and Durant. Both Ice Fang and Fire Fang hit the Grass-types that resist EdgeQuake for super effective damage.

Set Details
========

Attack and Speed investment is maximized for full offensive presence. A Jolly nature is preferred, as this set aims to be a revenge killer, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame. An Adamant nature can be used for more power, though it leads to Tyrantrum being outsped by Jolteon and possibly KOed by a Hidden Power Ice.

Usage Tips
========

Tyrantrum is typically not expected to be holding a Choice Scarf, so this set is best executed when in a position to get a surprise KO against a threat that would otherwise outspeed Tyrantrum. As it is still slower than other revenge killers in RU, ensure opposing Pokemon aren't holding a Choice Scarf before attempting to KO, as Tyrantrum may be taken out by something unexpectedly faster. Despite Tyrantrum's great Attack stat, it lacks significant strength due to the average Base Power of its moves, so use it to pick off weakened or frailer Pokemon. Solid coverage on top of its Speed allows it to function as a cleaner during the late-game.

Team Options
========

Its role as a revenge killer lets Tyrantrum fit easily onto balanced and bulky offensive teams that require its support. Choice Scarf Tyrantrum struggles with bulky Water-types more than any of its other sets, so partners such as Tangrowth, Virizion, Jolteon, and Heliolisk are ideal for removing them. As Choice Scarf Tyrantrum has to switch in and out frequently to change its moves, partners that cover its weaknesses are appreciated. Gligar, Moltres, and Golbat are immune to Ground-type moves and resist Fighting-type moves, while Alomomola, Slowking, and Clawitzer resist Ice- and Steel-type moves. Alomomola and Slowking are also able to check Fighting-types. Because of how often Tyrantrum switches in and out, Pokemon that clear entry hazards can prevent it from being worn down quickly. Hitmonlee can beat most Steel-types for Tyrantrum while offering Rapid Spin support, while Gligar and Golbat have access to Defog.

Other Options
########

Aside from its coverage moves boosted by Strong Jaw, Tyrantrum's movepool is a bit lacking. Head Smash can be used, as it is Tyrantrum's strongest Rock-type STAB move and is more reliable than Stone Edge, but the recoil wears Tyrantrum down quickly. Tyrantrum has access to Stealth Rock, but the move is difficult to fit onto any of its sets, and the role of entry hazard setter is better left to other Pokemon on its team. Curse allows Tyrantrum to boost its great Attack and Defense stats further, but Tyrantrum has several weaknesses and is generally not worth using over Dragon Dance. Hone Claws boosts both Attack and accuracy, allowing Stone Edge to hit reliably, but because Tyrantrum loses out on being able to boost Speed, it will be too slow to sweep. Rock Polish doubles Tyrantrum's Speed, allowing it to get the jump on the entire unboosted metagame; however, because it does not boost Attack, Rock Polish is still inferior to Dragon Dance.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Despite Tyrantrum's access to Earthquake, certain Steel-types still threaten it. Durant and Cobalion can outspeed and KO it with their STAB moves, while bulkier ones such as Doublade and Escavalier can take a hit and deal serious damage back. Registeel and Bronzong are able to take a hit when Tyrantrum is at +1 and status it. Bronzong is a notable threat, as it outright counters any set lacking Fire Fang or Crunch and can KO Tyrantrum with Gyro Ball.

**Gastrodon and Alomomola**: Defensive Gastrodon and Alomomola are able to sponge a hit, even when Tyrantrum is at +1, and possibly burn Tyrantrum with Scald, or in Gastrodon's case, KO it with Earth Power.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee, Virizion, Gallade, and Hitmontop are all able to OHKO Tyrantrum with their respective Fighting-type STAB moves. Hitmonlee is able to revenge kill Tyrantrum even after a Dragon Dance thanks to Mach Punch, while Hitmontop's Intimidate allows it to sponge any hit and KO back. The former three also all naturally outspeed Tyrantrum, meaning they can swiftly deal with it if it hasn't set up.

**Special Attackers**: Tyrantrum's terrible Special Defense combined with its typing leaves to it being exploited by nearly every special attacker in the tier. Faster special attackers carrying strong neutral or super effective moves, such as Jolteon, Delphox, Heliolisk, and Zoroark, all are able to outspeed and KO Tyrantrum with ease.

**Revenge Killers**: Because Tyrantrum's Speed is so poor, faster Choice Scarf users such as Hitmonlee, Rotom-C, Durant, and Delphox are able to revenge kill it even after a boost. Sharpedo and Dugtrio are also notable problems because of the former's access to Speed Boost and the ability to inflict severe damage to Tyrantrum with Waterfall, while the latter can trap, outspeed, and KO Adamant variants even when they are at +1.
