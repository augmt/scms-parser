Overview
########

Weezing's great defensive Poison typing, coupled with its high physical bulk, allows it to counter Fighting- and Grass-type physical attackers such as Hitmonlee and Virizion. What sets Weezing apart from other Poison-types is that it has Levitate, which gives it an immunity to Spikes and Ground-type moves; it also allows it to deal with Ground-types such as Mega Steelix and Rhyperior, which are very threatening and common. Furthermore, Weezing has a great support movepool that includes moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic Spikes; it also has access to Flamethrower, which allows it to check Steel-types such as Durant and Cobalion. However, Weezing's only form of recovery is Pain Split, which makes it easy to wear down. In addition, its low Special Defense stat leaves it vulnerable to powerful special attackers such as Reuniclus and Mega Camerupt.

move 1: Toxic Spikes
move 2: Will-O-Wisp
move 3: Sludge Bomb
move 4: Flamethrower / Pain Split
ability: Levitate
item: Black Sludge
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Toxic Spikes is used to support Weezing's teammates as well as cripple walls, while Will-O-Wisp is used to punish physical attackers that try to switch into Weezing; it also allows Weezing to damage its switch-ins that are immune to Toxic Spikes as well as Toxic Spikes absorbers, such as Cresselia and Drapion and Qwilfish, respectively. Sludge Bomb hits Grass- and Fairy-types such as Tangrowth and Whimsicott for super effectively while preventing Aromatisse from Wish passing in front of Weezing and pressuring Fire-types such as Houndoom and Emboar. Flamethrower is used to KO Steel-types, which are immune to Sludge Bomb, such as Escavalier, Doublade, and Cobalion. Pain Split provides some longevity for Weezing, but it is an unreliable form of recovery.

Set Details
========

The EV spread and Bold nature are used to maximize Weezing's physical bulk to allow it to handle physical attacks with more ease. Weezing is more suited to taking physical attacks, with the only special attacks it should be tanking are among Giga Drains from Whimsicott and Moonblasts from Aromatisse.

Usage Tips
========

Try to set up two layers of Toxic Spikes against defensive teams in order to acquire Toxic poison on Alomomola and Quagsire. Against offensive teams, only one layer of Toxic Spikes is necessary, as they will be taking more poison damage in the initial turn than gradually with two layers. Weezing should also not recklessly use Will-O-Wisp, as it gives Fire-types such as Houndoom a free switch, the former also gaining a Flash Fire boost from it. It is recommended for players to keep Weezing healthy whenever there is a Ground- or Bug-type left on the opposing team, such as Mega Steelix or Durant.

Team Options
========

Alomomola works well with Weezing, as it handles most special attackers that Weezing loses to and provides Wish support for Weezing. Dark-types such as Houndoom and Drapion also make for great partners, as they can stop Psychic-types that Weezing doesn't like taking on, such as Reuniclus and Cresselia. Rhyperior and Mega Steelix stand out as excellent partners to Weezing because they can beat Exploud and also provide Stealth Rock support. They can also phaze foes with Roar, which works well when used with Toxic Spikes.

Other Options
########

Clear Smog can be used to stop setup sweepers such as Virizion and Drapion, but it has a very low Base Power and doesn't affect Steel-types and Substitute users. Haze is an option to stop Steel-type setup sweepers such as Mega Steelix and Cobalion. Sludge Wave can be used for a higher damage output, but it does not pick up any notable KOs and the higher poison rate from Sludge Bomb is generally more useful. A mixed wall set with an EV spread of 252 HP / 132 Def / 124 SpD is a viable option that allows Weezing to survive two Choice Specs-boosted Leaf Storms from Tangrowth after Stealth Rock.

Checks & Counters
########

**Psychic-type Pokemon**: Psychic-types such as Cresselia, Reuniclus, Meloetta, Sigilyph, Mesprit, Delphox, and Xatu are all able to survive any hit that Weezing throws at them and can retaliate with their STAB moves to either heavily damage or OHKO it.

**Special Attackers**: Due to Weezing's low Special Defense, special attackers such as Heliolisk, Meloetta, Houndoom, and Mega Camerupt can OHKO or 2HKO it easily, while Weezing cannot do much against them.

**Taunt Users**: Taunt users such as Qwilfish and Drapion can stop Weezing from setting up entry hazards or burning its foes. Weezing cannot deal much damage to them, while they can set up entry hazards to support their teammates.

**Wallbreakers**: Powerful wallbreakers such as Emboar, Tyrantrum, and Exploud can either KO Weezing out or hit it so hard, making it easy to pick off. Because Weezing does not have a reliable form of recovery, it can be worn down without much difficulty.
