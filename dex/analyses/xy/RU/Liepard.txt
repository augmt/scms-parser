Overview
########

Liepard is a very interesting Pokemon in the RU metagame. When you first look at its stats, you might wonder why you would use an offensively inclined Dark-type over the likes of Shiftry and Sharpedo. However, Liepard's niche lies in its ability, Prankster, along with its wide support movepool. Liepard will generally find a home on offensive teams that need the ability to revenge kill Pokemon such as Sigilyph, Delphox, and Meloetta while providing support in the form of Prankster Encore or Thunder Wave. Although weather teams aren't very common in RU, Liepard is one of the top choices for such teams thanks to its access to Encore and U-turn, giving weather sweepers a near-guaranteed switch-in opportunity. Liepard is still overshadowed offensively by Shiftry and Sharpedo, however. With paper-thin defenses and a lackluster defensive typing, Liepard is often ignored in favor of other Prankster users, such as Whimsicott and Mega Banette, for supporting needs.

Offensive Support
########
name: Offensive Support
move 1: Encore
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Sucker Punch / Pursuit
item: BlackGlasses
ability: Prankster
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
======

Liepard's main niche is providing team support, despite its offensive nature. Encore allows Liepard to stop any setup sweeper in its tracks due to Prankster. Thanks to Liepard's high base Speed, even fast setup sweepers with a priority move, such as Kabutops and Fletchinder, can't outprioritize Encore. Knock Off is a reliable STAB move and annoys opposing Pokemon by removing their items. It easily OHKOes Meloetta, Slowking, Sigilyph, and Delphox, while reliably 2HKOing Doublade should it try to stay in to stall out the Encore turns. U-turn is a great follow-up move to Encore, as it will almost always provide a free switch-in for one of Liepard's teammates while also giving Liepard switch initiative. The last slot gives Liepard some added utility in a secondary STAB move. Sucker Punch is useful to pick off weakened threats. Again, thanks to Liepard's high base Speed, very few Pokemon can outprioritize it. Pursuit is another good option, as Liepard can easily force out most offensive Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon with the threat of Knock Off. Thunder Wave is a usable move if you feel that your team doesn't need Liepard to run a STAB move in the fourth slot, as Prankster Thunder Wave might be the only thing that can stop dangerous sweepers such as Cobalion, Virizion, and Durant. Yawn is yet another status move that can be used in the last slot. While it won't immediately cause sleep, it will generally force out whatever the move is used on, thus giving Liepard another way to force switches and giving its teammates free switch-in opportunities.

Set Details
======

This set's spread maximizes Attack and Speed so that Liepard can hit as hard and fast as possible. As Liepard isn't going to be surviving many hits, Black Glasses is used to give a boost to Liepard's STAB moves. The boost in power is what makes Liepard's Knock Off capable of OHKOing and 2HKOing Pokemon such as Meloetta and Doublade. While an Adamant nature might seem tempting, as Liepard has priority on Encore as-is and might also be using Sucker Punch, the boost in power is simply not worth being outsped by dangerous threats such as Mismagius and Calm Mind Delphox.

Usage Tips
======

Liepard doesn't play like most other Prankster users. Instead of using its bulk and good defensive typing, Liepard relies on its solid offensive presence to deny free switches, while Encore is used to punish anything that tries to set up on Liepard. You will generally want to get Liepard in safely against defensive threats with low offensive presence, or on a predicted setup move from a sweeper. Liepard absolutely detests paralysis and burns, so steer clear of possible inducers of these status ailments whenever possible.

Team Options
======

Liepard tends to force a lot of switches due to Encore, U-turn, and the threat of Knock Off, so entry hazard users can exploit this. Cobalion and Rhyperior are reliable Stealth Rock users, while Accelgor, Omastar, and Qwilfish can set up Spikes. As Liepard is capable of providing easy switch-in opportunities through the use of Encore + U-turn, it stands to reason that most offensive Pokemon can take advantage of these chances. Delphox, Sharpedo, and Hitmonlee are among the most dangerous offensive threats in RU when they're given a free switch-in. Liepard is next to helpless against Cobalion and Virizion, as both have Justified, resist Liepard's STAB moves, outspeed it, and don't need to set up in order to OHKO it. Cobalion is handled by Slowking, Gligar, and Alomomola reasonably well, while Virizion will have a difficult time with Amoonguss, Durant, and Fletchinder. If you're looking for a counter to both, look no further than Doublade, which can use both of them as setup fodder for a sweep of its own. It even spinblocks to protect the hazards that likely accompany Liepard.

Weather Support
########
name: Weather Support
move 1: Rain Dance / Sunny Day
move 2: Encore / Yawn
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: U-turn
item: Damp Rock / Heat Rock
ability: Prankster
evs: 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
======

This set uses Liepard's support movepool and Prankster to reliably set up the desired weather. The choice between Rain Dance and Sunny Day is dependent on what your team is designed to take advantage of. Encore is the primary move in the second slot, as it can force the opponent into a weak or otherwise useless attack and allow a weather sweeper to come in unscathed. Yawn is a fine alternative, however, as it also tends to force the opponent to switch out. Knock Off gives Liepard a reliable STAB move and has the ability to handle the likes of Delphox, Meloetta, and Sigilyph reliably when needed. U-turn is a great move for this set, as it allows Liepard to immediately bring in a weather sweeper after it has set up the desired weather condition, and generally pairs well with either move chosen in the second slot. The only other move worth considering is Thunder Wave. This can allow a weather sweeper to continue its sweep if the desired weather ends prematurely. However, Thunder Wave is very hard to fit onto this moveset and is usually better left to bulkier Pokemon such as Volbeat and Uxie.

Set Details
======

As this Liepard aims to set up weather reliably, HP is maximized while minimizing opposing passive damage. Speed is maximized to stay in front of key threats such as Delphox and Mismagius, while the rest of the EVs are put into Attack. The item depends solely on the weather move Liepard uses. Damp Rock should be used with Rain Dance, while Heat Rock should be used with Sunny Day. You can shift all the HP EVs to Attack if you wish to have more firepower, but keep in mind that this Liepard's primary goal is to set up weather for its team, not to deal damage on its own.

Usage Tips
======

This Liepard is used to set up the desired weather condition, so it's best to get Liepard in on a weak or resisted attack once the desired weather wears off for a sweeper. Due to Prankster, Liepard can set up the desired weather in the face of Jolteon, Mach Punch Hitmonlee, Cobalion, and Virizion without fear of being KOed before setting up the weather. Keep Liepard away from paralysis and Knock Off if possible. Paralysis might keep Liepard from setting up weather again, while Knock Off will cut down on how long the weather lasts. Using Encore and U-turn after setting up the desired weather condition is ideal to bring in a sweeper unscathed so that it can wreak havoc.

Team Options
======

The only universally good partner for this Liepard set is Uxie, as it is also capable of setting up either weather condition as well as Stealth Rock. Aside from Uxie, teammates for Liepard largely depend on the weather condition it is setting up. Pokemon that benefit from rain, such as Ludicolo, Kabutops, Jolteon, Rotom-C, and Omastar, are fantastic choices for a Liepard carrying Rain Dance. Sunny Day variants of Liepard can allow the likes of Victreebel, Delphox, Moltres, Shiftry, and Emboar to truly shine. Volbeat and Bronzong are reliable Rain Dance users to pair with Liepard on a rain team, while Whimsicott is a good Sunny Day user to use with Liepard on a sun team.

Other Options
########

Liepard has a ton of other moves. Perhaps the most notable of these is Taunt. As Liepard has Prankster, Taunt seems like a very effective move for it. However, Liepard's lackluster bulk and defensive typing make this a difficult move to use. Foul Play is another STAB option Liepard has that can punish physical attackers. However, Liepard generally hits what it needs to hard enough with its other STAB moves. A Nasty Plot + Copycat set might seem gimmicky at first, but such a set can become devastating if it gets a quick KO with a +2 Dark Pulse, as Liepard can then utilize Prankster Copycat to keep using Dark Pulse in the face of would-be revenge killers. However, this set is held back by Liepard's extreme frailty. Toxic can make life difficult for walls that Liepard has trouble with, specifically Alomomola and Tangrowth. Torment can force Choice-locked Pokemon to Struggle every other turn, but it has little use otherwise with Liepard's low defenses. Hone Claws can boost Liepard's Attack to decent levels, but Liepard is quite frail, making it hard to set up in the first place. Hidden Power, Gunk Shot, and Play Rough are decent coverage options, but Liepard is pressed for moveslots as it is. Finally, Trick can be used alongside a pointless item, such as Iron Ball or Ring Target, but Liepard generally wants an item it can benefit from.

Checks and Counters
########

**Whimsicott**: Whimsicott has Prankster and a higher base Speed than Liepard, which allows it to Taunt Liepard before it can use any support moves. Whimsicott also resists Dark-type moves thanks to its Fairy typing. Offensive Whimsicott can simply OHKO Liepard with STAB Moonblast before it can fight back.

**Aromatisse**: Aromatisse can deal with anything Liepard throws at it and is immune to Encore and Taunt thanks to Aroma Veil.

**Cobalion and Virizion**: While most Fighting-types can fare well against Liepard, these are the best two by far. Cobalion and Virizion have Justified to benefit from a Dark-type move, have higher Speed than Liepard, and don't need to set up in order to OHKO it. Cobalion is the better choice due to a 4x resistance to U-turn and much higher physical bulk when compared to Virizion.

**Burn and Paralysis**: Burn and paralysis completely cripple Liepard, especially the offensive support variant. Amoonguss can handle Knock Off fairly well and has Stun Spore, while Alomomola has great physical bulk and access to Scald to potentially burn Liepard.
