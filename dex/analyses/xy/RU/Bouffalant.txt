Overview
########

Bouffalant is quite the interesting Normal-type in RU. It has a solid movepool, respectable bulk, and good abilities at its disposal. Sap Sipper is the best ability of Bouffalant's, as it makes Bouffalant immune to all Grass-type moves, including Spore, Leech Seed, and Sleep Powder, thus allowing it to easily switch in against most defensive Grass-types in the tier. Soundproof is another great ability that Bouffalant has that let's it switch into powerful attacks like Meloetta's Hyper Voice and Exploud's Boomburst without taking any damage at all. Bouffalant also has Head Charge and Return, two reliable and powerful STAB moves at its disposal to deal significant damage, and its coverage in Earthquake, Megahorn, and Stone Edge allows it to handle most Pokemon that would want to switch into its STAB moves. However, Bouffalant has a few glaring flaws that can hold it back at times, namely its poor Speed and lack of resistances to take advantage of its decent bulk. Bouffalant's Normal typing also makes its life difficult with the myriad of powerful Fighting-types in the tier, such as Hitmonlee, Gallade, and Virizion. Bouffalant is a solid Pokemon that is capable of making many Grass-types a liability for your opponent, but you will need to account for its low Speed, lack of resistances, and vulnerability to common Fighting-types if you hope to get the most out of it.

Substitute
########
name: Substitute
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Return
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Swords Dance / Stone Edge
ability: Soundproof / Sap Sipper
item: Leftovers
evs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
======

This set uses Bouffalant's solid bulk and immunity to Grass-type moves to attempt to switch-in, set up, and deal serious damage to common defensive cores. Substitute offers Bouffalant protection from status moves, and most defensive Pokemon struggle to break Bouffalant's Substitutes due to its above average HP. Return is the chosen STAB move here because of its solid power and lack of drawbacks. Earthquake is mandatory coverage to hit the Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon that resist Return. The last slot either gives Bouffalant more utility against defensive teams or more coverage. Swords Dance is generally preferred to give Bouffalant a major power boost, allowing it to break down stall teams more reliably. If you need Bouffalant to get around frail Ghost-types, Stone Edge is a good option for this, as it allows Bouffalant to hit Mismagius and Rotom fairly hard. Head Charge is a stronger STAB option, but the recoil it induces combined with Substitute will squander Bouffalant's respectable bulk.

Set Details
======

The EV spread maximizes Bouffalant's damage output, while also allowing it to outspeed Alomomola and get a Substitute up before it goes for a Scald or Toxic. You can use 100 Speed EVs if you want Bouffalant to outspeed Lanturn, but it isn't nearly as common as Alomomola is. Soundproof is the preferred ability on this set, as it allows Bouffalant to set up on Pokemon such as Exploud, Perish Song Meloetta, and defensive Pokemon with Roar, while simultaneously preventing Exploud and Meloetta from revenge killing Bouffalant with a sound-based move if it's behind a Substitute. Sap Sipper is a viable alternative if you want Bouffalant to have an easier time setting up on Grass-types, but the only relevant Grass-type it can safely set up on is Amoonguss.

Usage Tips
======

Bouffalant likes nothing more than to set up on weak, defensive Pokemon that are incapable of breaking its Substitutes. When running Sap Sipper, try to get Bouffalant in on defensive Grass-types, especially Amoonguss, as it can't break Bouffalant's Substitutes unless it uses Foul Play. Even without setting up, Bouffalant can make use of its good coverage and solid Attack stat to deal out some decent damage, possibly even OHKOing frailer threats that are incapable of OHKOing Bouffalant first. Don't overuse Substitute attacking a switch-in that can keep on breaking Bouffalant's Substitutes isn't a bad idea as long as you are able to get a Substitute up on the switch. When using Swords Dance, use it once you've removed any possible Whirlwind or Roar users, as the foe can phaze Bouffalant out through a Substitute. Do note that Roar users will not be an issue if Bouffalant uses Soundproof.

Team Options
======

Bouffalant likes setting up against defensive Grass-type Pokemon, so teammates that can lure them are good choices. Kabutops and Barbaracle tend to do this quite well, and both can sweep once Bouffalant removes these Pokemon. Rhyperior is another good option to attract these Grass-types, and it can also set up Stealth Rock for Bouffalant. When Bouffalant uses Swords Dance over Stone Edge, it is highly recommended to pack an answer to Ghost-types with Levitate. Pursuit support from the likes of Drapion and Spiritomb can remove these threats with relative ease.

Afro SMASH (Choice Band)
########
name: Afro SMASH (Choice Band)
move 1: Head Charge
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Megahorn
move 4: Stone Edge
ability: Sap Sipper / Soundproof
item: Choice Band
evs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
======

This Bouffalant set focuses on dealing as much damage as it can as fast as it can. Head Charge is the STAB move of choice here as it easily crushes most opponents without a resistance or immunity to Normal. Earthquake allows Bouffalant to smash opposing Rock- and Steel-types expecting to tank a Head Charge and force Bouffalant out. Megahorn allows Bouffalant to crush the likes of Tangrowth, Slowking, and Reuniclus with ease, while also heavily denting Cresselia. Stone Edge completes the set by allowing Bouffalant to hit Mismagius and Rotom, while also OHKOing Moltres without resorting to Head Charge. Wild Charge is an option if your team is really weak to Jellicent, but it has little use outside of that.

Set Details
======

The EV spread allows Bouffalant to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding Alomomola. You can invest 100 EVs into Speed if Lanturn is causing your team problems, but it's not as common as Alomomola. Sap Sipper is the preferred ability as it allows Bouffalant to have the freedom to come in against defensive Grass-types, possibly netting an Attack boost from Sap Sipper in the process. However, should your team be struggling with Exploud or Choice Specs Meloetta when it locks into Hyper Voice, Soundproof is an option to allow Bouffalant to switch into them easily.

Usage Tips
======

Try to get Bouffalant in against a defensive Grass-type to possibly net a Sap Sipper boost to cause even more damage. If you think that a Pokemon that resists or is immune to Head Charge is going to switch in, try to hit it with the appropriate coverage move so as to not waste a turn. This Bouffalant is more of a hit-and-run attacker, as it will likely be forced out once it lands an attack.

Team Options
======

Bouffalant loves switching in against defensive Grass-types, so a teammate that can lure them out is very helpful. Kabutops can not only attract Grass-types for Bouffalant to switch in against, but it can also utilize Rapid Spin to get rid of the entry hazards Bouffalant dislikes due to its tendency to switch in and out a lot. Rhyperior is able to set up Stealth Rock, while also attracting Grass-types for Bouffalant to switch in on. Barbaracle can possibly take advantage of the holes Bouffalant punches and sweep the opposing team. Spikes support is helpful to wear down the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Head Charge, as most of them are grounded and lack reliable recovery. Accelgor, Omastar, and Qwilfish are all reliable Spikes users to use alongside Bouffalant. Pursuit support from Spiritomb and Drapion can remove or severely weaken these Ghost-types. Finally, Wish and cleric support is helpful considering Bouffalant can easily be worn down and lacks a way to deter Pokemon from inflicting it with status. Aromatisse can switch into most Fighting-types and provide both Wish and cleric support. Jolteon has much greater offensive presence at the cost of the size of its Wish. However, it makes up for this by also being able to Baton Pass a Substitute to Bouffalant to give it more chances to switch in.

Other Options
########

Bouffalant has a few other moves at its disposal that could be worth considering. Superpower gets a harder initial hit on most Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon, but the stat drops can be a nuisance. Swords Dance can be used with full coverage, but Bouffalant lacks the Speed to pull off a sweep. Iron Head and Poison Jab are both options to hit Fairy-types harder on the Substitute set. Iron Head has the added benefit of hitting Rock-types, while Poison Jab nails Tangrowth and Virizion. Toxic can catch unsuspecting defensive checks, such as Rhyperior, off-guard and slowly wear them down. Frustration is the equivalent of Return. The only ability of Bouffalant's not discussed thus far is Reckless, which can boost the power of Head Charge on the Choice Band set. However, Sap Sipper and Soundproof have more overall utility. Bouffalant has decent bulk and a solid Attack stat, so one may wonder why Assault Vest isn't listed as a set. This is simply because Bouffalant lacks the useful resistances of other good Assault Vest users in RU, such as Escavalier, Druddigon, Eelektross, and Slowking.

Checks and Counters
######

**Fighting-types**: Most Fighting-types can't take too many hits from Bouffalant, but all of them can force it out or KO it. Cobalion is perhaps the most notable one as it resists every attack Bouffalant commonly runs except for Earthquake.

**Ghost-types**: Ghost-types are immune to Bouffalant's STAB moves. Gourgeist-XL and Spiritomb are able to cripple Bouffalant with Will-O-Wisp and Doublade can usually beat it one-on-one. Mega-Banette can do both depending on the moveset it has.

**Offensive Pressure**: Bouffalant is hard to switch into, but it can have a difficult time switching in itself due to its low Speed and lack of resistances. Most powerful attackers, such as Delphox, Sharpedo, and Jolteon can keep Bouffalant from coming in at will due to the threat of a 2HKO upon switch-in.

**Status**: Any user of Toxic or Will-O-Wisp instantly has a way to deter Bouffalant from switching in. Golbat and Spiritomb are the most notable thanks to Infiltrator allowing them to status Bouffalant, even if it's behind a Substitute.
