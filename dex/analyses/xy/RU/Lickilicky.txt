Overview
########
As the only Pokemon with access to STAB Explosion other than Smeargle, Lickilicky isn't good just for that reason. It has good defensive stats with base 110 HP and base 95 defenses. That and access to Wish along with a big HP stat gives it a good way of recovery and makes it a good supporting option, being able to pass big Wishes to its teammates. Thanks to its ability, Oblivious, it's also immune to Taunt, meaning nothing can stop it from using Wish or Protect. Lickilicky also has a large movepool with colorful offensive and supportive options such as the aforementioned Wish, Heal Bell, Body Slam, Fire Blast, Fire Punch, Thunderbolt, Knock Off, Dragon Tail, Curse, Seismic Toss, and, of course, Explosion. However, with a large movepool comes slight four-moveslot syndrome. Additionally, Lickilicky faces competition from Aromatisse as a Wish passer with Aromatherapy support, but having access to Dragon Tail and Knock Off separates it from Aromatisse, as well as having more bulk in general.

Wish
########
name: Wish
move 1: Wish
move 2: Protect
move 3: Heal Bell / Knock Off
move 4: Knock Off / Dragon Tail
ability: Oblivious
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD
nature: Careful

Moves
========
Wish is used as a means of recovery for Lickilicky, and it's also used to support teammates with Lickilicky's large HP stat. Protect gives Lickilicky a guaranteed turn of Wish and Leftovers recovery, as well as scouting the opponent's move. The choice between Heal Bell and Knock Off ultimately depends on Lickilicky's teammates; if another Pokemon has Heal Bell or Aromatherapy, then Knock Off and Dragon Tail should be used. Otherwise, Heal Bell and either Knock Off or Dragon Tail is preferred to let Lickilicky act as a cleric. Knock Off is a good utility move that annoys a number of Pokemon and doesn't allow them to switch into Lickilicky for free, while Dragon Tail is used to phaze the opponent and rack up residual damage with the help of entry hazards in addition to preventing Pokemon from setting up. Body Slam can be used as a reliable STAB move, and it can help spread paralysis, while Seismic Toss can provide consistent damage.

Set Details
========
Maximum HP EVs are invested for overall better bulk and bigger Wishes to pass, and maximum Special Defense investment with a Careful nature helps Lickilicky take on threatening Pokemon such as Delphox, Moltres, and Yanmega. Leftovers is the item of choice for passive recovery, and it goes nicely with Protect for a free turn of HP gain. Oblivious is the chosen ability because it grants Lickilicky immunity to Taunt, which means Lickilicky can't be shut down by Pokemon such as Mega Banette and Golbat.

Usage Tips
========
Lickilicky can comfortably switch into the tier's most threatening special attackers such as Delphox and Yanmega without much trouble and threaten them with its attacking moves. Knock Off is used to remove items such as Life Orb and Choice Specs and cripple the opponent's Pokemon. Use Body Slam for its STAB and 30% chance of paralysis, or Seismic Toss for the consistent damage. Beware of Pokemon that carry a Choice item and Switcheroo or Trick, as Lickilicky doesn't appreciate being locked into one move. Wish can be used whenever Lickilicky or another teammate needs recovery, and Protect can be used to guarantee the Wish. However, the opponent can easily exploit an obvious Protect after Wish and use the opportunity to set up or get a free switch. All of Lickilicky's attacking moves&mdash;Knock Off, Dragon Tail, Seismic Toss, and Body Slam&mdash;are spammable and do not have many drawbacks unless the opponent's Pokemon is immune to them. Additionally, using Dragon Tail when entry hazards are on the field is preferred to shuffle the opponent's team and rack up residual damage.

Team Options
========
When talking about teammates for Lickilicky, the first thing that should pop up in anyone's mind is a Pokemon that resists Fighting-type moves, and as such, Granbull makes a fine teammate. Having Fairy typing along with Intimidate allows it to easily switch into most Fighting-types with ease and KO or threaten them out. Additionally, it can also use Heal Bell which can free up a moveslot for Lickilicky. Granbull also likes the Wish support Lickilicky provides. Physically defensive Aromatisse does the same thing as it can also switch into most Fighting-types with ease and can carry Aromatherapy, which clears a moveslot for Lickilicky. Amoonguss is another good teammate because of its Poison typing, which lets it take on Fighting-types without much trouble, and has good synergy with Lickilicky as they both switch into the weaknesses of one another, with Lickilicky not having much trouble switching into most Fire-types that threaten Amoonguss.

Alomomola is a sturdy physical wall that goes well with Lickilicky in more defensively oriented teams for its ability to overwhelm most physical attackers, something Lickilicky struggles against, with Lickilicky being able to switch relatively easily into the special attackers that Alomomola has trouble with. Pokemon that like Wish support in general like having Lickilicky as a teammate, and those include Doublade, Meloetta, Rhyperior, and Registeel, among others. Additionally, entry hazard setters are good to have in conjunction with Dragon Tail, and for that reason, Roselia and Weezing are good teammates for their ability to set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, respectively. Weezing can also counter Fighting-types. Registeel and Rhyperior appreciate the Wish support Lickilicky brings and can set up Stealth Rock.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Return
move 2: Power Whip
move 3: Knock Off / Earthquake
move 4: Explosion
ability: Cloud Nine
item: Choice Band
evs: 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
Return is a STAB move that hits everything that doesn't resist it decently hard, and Power Whip is a powerful coverage move that can dispose of Rhyperior and 2HKO Alomomola, allowing Lickilicky to muscle through those two sturdy walls. Knock Off is a good move to spam in general for its good neutral coverage in conjunction with the utility it brings in removing the target's item and crippling almost all Pokemon. Earthquake, on the other hand, can be used as another coverage move that can hit Pokemon such as Cobalion on the switch and Registeel while still hitting Doublade harder than Knock Off would. Explosion often takes the target down with Lickilicky, unless it's a very bulky physical wall, making it a good last-resort move.

Set Details
========
Choice Band might sound like an unusual item to use on Lickilicky, but it works very well because of its ability to dispose of certain Pokemon and the sheer surprise factor. An added bonus is having an extremely strong Explosion. Max Attack investment is used to hit as hard as possible, while still having enough Speed investment to outspeed minimum Speed Alomomola. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP for more overall bulk.

Usage Tips
========
Return is Lickilicky's spammable move unless the opponent has a Pokemon that is immune to it or resists it, in which case predicting a little bit with a coverage move is best. If you're not sure what the opponent will do and can't predict their move, then going for Knock Off is the best play for its power and utility. Lickilicky can be used throughout the match, but bringing it out early-game is best for its ability to soften up or KO walls, therefore giving its teammates an opportunity to sweep. Lickilicky can be easily overwhelmed by powerful attacks, so beware of that.

Team Options
========
Physically defensive Aromatisse handles the Fighting-type Pokemon that Lickilicky struggles with while also providing cleric support in Aromatherapy and Wish. Alomomola is also another Wish passer that's a good teammate to Lickilicky for its large Wishes and the ability to switch into most physical attackers without much trouble. As Choice Band Lickilicky can easily remove walls such as Alomomola and Rhyperior, sweepers that like those two Pokemon gone appreciate Lickilicky. Fletchinder, in particular, comes to mind as it struggles with those two Pokemon. Additionally, setup sweepers are also good teammates for that reason, and those can include Cobalion, Virizion, and Durant. Also, as Lickilicky can somewhat lure in some Fighting-types like Hitmonlee and Gurdurr and severely damage them, Pokemon that like those Fighting-types out of the field work with Lickilicky, such as Zoroark and Registeel. Finally, entry hazard support is very good to have with Choice Band Lickilicky to rack up as much damage as possible, and Stealth Rock setters include Rhyperior, Registeel, and Druddigon, while Spikes setters include Roselia and Qwilfish, who can also provide Toxic Spikes.

Other Options
########
Lickilicky has a number of other options that it could run, but sadly, almost all of them are done better by other Pokemon. Curse can be utilized along with Body Slam, Earthquake, and Rest with Leftovers, but it struggles against a lot of common Pokemon and is done better by Miltank. Lickilicky can use any of the coverage moves it has, such as Muddy Water, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Fire Blast. Thunder Wave is an option if paralysis support is needed, but Body Slam can already cover that. A physically defensive set can be run, but Lickilicky can't handle physical attackers too well in general because of its weakness to Fighting-type moves. Finally, a weather support set can be used on weather-based teams with either Sunny Day or Rain Dance and Heat Rock or Damp Rock respectively. With Explosion, it can set up weather and then allow a teammate to come in safely without taking any damage.

Checks & Counters
########
**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types resist Knock Off and can hurt Lickilicky with super effective STAB moves. Cobalion and Virizion even gain a Justified boost if they switch into Knock Off.

**Offensive Pressure**: Offensive pressure from the physical side can hurt Lickilicky, especially coming from Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Exploud, Druddigon, and Escavalier. Entry hazards also pressure and hurt it, as it has no direct recovery besides Wish, which can be exploitable. If it lacks Dragon Tail, Lickilicky becomes setup fodder for Pokemon such as Doublade, Virizion, and Cobalion, which aren't threatened by Knock Off.
