Overview
########

Aurorus's access to one of the best offensive STABs in the tier, Ice, and Refrigerate, which boosts its Normal-type moves to monstrous power, make a potent offensive threat. It has a niche over similar wallbreakers such as Exploud with its useful utility moves, Stealth Rock and Rock Polish. Aurorus is a good user of Stealth Rock because it is able to threaten nearly every Defog user with its Ice-type STAB moves, and it can even clean offensive teams thanks to its ability to outspeed the entire tier after a Rock Polish boost. However, Aurorus still possess an extremely horrible defensive typing that gives it six common weaknesses, including 4x ones to Steel and Fighting and a weakness to Stealth Rock. This, coupled with its low Speed before a Rock Polish boost, limits its ability to switch into attacks and set up. Finally, Steel-types such as Bronzong and Escavalier can easily counter Aurorus, meaning it needs team support to weaken these Pokemon before it can substantially threaten the opposing team.

Stealth Rock
########
name: Stealth Rock
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Hyper Voice
move 3: Freeze-Dry
move 4: Earth Power
ability: Refrigerate
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Aurorus is a good user of Stealth Rock because it can utilize its immense offensive presence to keep it on the field. Hyper Voice is Aurorus's strongest STAB move due to it being boosted by Refrigerate. Freeze-Dry hits Water-type Pokemon hard, being able to 2HKO Alomomola. Finally, Earth Power rounds out coverage by hitting Steel- and Fire-types such as Cobalion, Doublade, and Houndoom. Dark Pulse and Hidden Power Fire can be used over Earth Power to hit Bronzong and Escavalier, respectively, both of which would otherwise have little to fear from Aurorus. Dark Pulse also hits Doublade hard, and Hidden Power Fire can still 2HKO both Doublade and Cobalion. However, Earth Power generally has the best consistency, as in addition to Houndoom, it deals with the less common Delphox and Registeel as well.

Set Details
========

Maximum Special Attack EVs with a Life Orb are used to hit as hard as possible. A Timid nature is usually preferred over a Modest nature in order to outspeed Adamant Pangoro and Speed tie with Jolly Pangoro. Aurorus will also be able to outspeed Modest Exploud, which it checks. However, a Modest nature can be used for greater power; for example, Aurorus will then have a high chance to OHKO Cobalion and Doublade after a layer of Spikes.

Usage Tips
========

This set is best used on teams looking for an offensive Stealth Rock user that can directly threaten Defoggers, due to its powerful Ice-type STAB moves, while also being able to punch significant holes in the opposing team. Because of its offensive presence, Aurorus can force many switches, which it should use to set Stealth Rock. Try to bring Aurorus in on a Pokemon it can threaten and wall. Such examples include Choice item users locked into an ineffective move, such as Meloetta, Exploud, and Moltres, or slower defensive Pokemon such as Golbat, and Aromatisse. Aurorus can also easily sponge hits from some offensively inclined Pokemon without a super effective move, such as Fletchinder. When possible, avoid switching Aurorus in on direct damage, as it is extremely vulnerable to being worn down by entry hazards and Life Orb recoil. After Stealth Rock has been used, the best move to spam is Hyper Voice, since it is immensely powerful and there are very few Pokemon that resist Ice and have reliable recovery. If your opponent has a defensive Steel-type such as Bronzong or Escavalier, it is very likely they will send it out to take a Hyper Voice, so predict accordingly.

Team Options
========

Aurorus loses one-fourth of its health whenever it switches into Stealth Rock, so entry hazard removers are essential. Hitmonlee can provide Rapid Spin support and threaten the Steel-types that Aurorus struggles with, while Skuntank can use Defog to remove hazards and Pursuit to weaken checks such as Bronzong, Cresselia, and Slowking. In general, Pursuit users can help whittle down Aurorus's checks, most notably Bronzong. Houndoom can both threaten and Pursuit-trap on Escavalier, making it a good partner. Aurorus also works well with teammates that similarly dislike Steel-types, as it can weaken Steel-types for them. Examples include Choice Scarf Meloetta and Mega Abomasnow. Pivots such as Eelektross are able to get Aurorus in safely. 

Rock Polish
########
name: Rock Polish
move 1: Rock Polish
move 2: Hyper Voice
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Freeze-Dry
ability: Refrigerate
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========
Rock Polish allow Aurorus to outspeed every relevant Pokemon in the metagame after a boost. Hyper Voice is Aurorus's best Ice-type STAB move due to being boosted by Refrigerate. Freeze-Dry is super effective against Water-types like Alomomola, and Earth Power rounds out Aurorus's coverage by hitting Steel- and Fire-types such as Cobalion, Doublade, and Houndoom. Dark Pulse and Hidden Power Fire are its strongest options against Bronzong and Escavalier, respectively, while also being able to do sizable damage to Doublade and Cobalion (Hidden Power Fire only in the case of Cobalion). However, both of these moves cannot KO Bronzong or Escavalier without significant prior damage, so Earth Power is recommended due to its overall consistency.

Set Details
========
252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allows Aurorus to outspeed Choice Scarf Moltres after a Rock Polish boost. Against defensive and slower teams, where Rock Polish is not as necessary, a Timid nature also ensures it can outspeed Pokemon such as Modest Exploud and Adamant Pangoro, allowing Aurorus to consistently check or force out these threats. 252 Special Attack EVs along with a Life Orb makes Aurorus hit as hard as possible, maximizing its chances of cleaning the opposing team.

Usage Tips
========
This is set is designed to make Aurorus sweep late-game; therefore, do not try to set up until its counters are weakened to the point where Aurorus can OHKO them, as Aurorus's many weaknesses often mean it cannot survive a hit back. Early-game, try and weaken counters such as Bronzong and Escavalier, and maintain entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field. Try to set up on Pokemon that either cannot significantly damage Aurorus or get forced out by it, such as Moltres locked into Hurricane, Fletchinder, Golbat, Aromatisse, Meloetta locked into Hyper Voice, and Exploud locked into Boomburst. Keep in mind that Aurorus has above-average bulk, so it can survive most neutral hits in order to set up. Also, keep in mind that Aurorus needs slight prior damage to OHKO Pokemon such as Cobalion, Doublade, Pangoro, Rhyperior, and Moltres, to name a few. Against more defensive teams, Aurorus can be directly threatening without the use of Rock Polish, as it can outspeed most defensive Pokemon naturally and hit them hard.

Team Options
========
Because Aurorus is weak to Stealth Rock, entry hazard removers can maximize Aurorus's chances of setting up a Rock Polish. Hitmonlee can use Rapid Spin while also threatening the Steel-types that check Aurorus. Pursuit trappers can help weaken Aurorus's counters such as Bronzong, Cresselia, and Slowking. Skuntank is a good user of Pursuit due to its access to Defog, while Houndoom can threaten Escavalier and use Pursuit on it as it switches out. A slow pivot, such as Eelektross, helps to get Aurorus into the field safely. Other attackers that can deal with Steel-types can help wear them down, such as Meloetta and Exploud. Dugtrio can weaken certain targets if necessary, such as Rhyperior. It can also utilize Memento to allow Aurorus to set up more easily.


Other Options
########

Using four attacks with a Life Orb can give Aurorus room to run coverage moves such as Dark Pulse and Hidden Power Fire, allowing it to threaten Bronzong and Escavalier; however, Aurorus generally prefers the utility of either Stealth Rock or Rock Polish, both of give it a niche over other wallbreakers like Exploud. Aurorus can also use Choice Specs to hit extremely hard, but this isn't preferred for the same reasons. Assault Vest can be tempting when looking at Aurorus's good special bulk, but Aurorus is a horrible user of the item. It is very prone to being worn down by entry hazards; has many common weaknesses; and with an Assault Vest, loses out on much-needed power and the ability to use crucial moves like Stealth Rock and Rock Polish. Finally, Nature Power is an option over Hyper Voice that allows Aurorus to avoid Sucker Punch and has a decent chance of inflicting a status condition, but Aurorus generally prefers the extra power.


Checks & Counters
########
**Specially Defensive Steel-types**: Steel-types like Bronzong and Escavalier can easily shrug off any attack Aurorus throws at them, and retaliate with a 4x super effective move. Registeel can also take an Earth Power reasonably well and potentially cripple it with Thunder Wave.

**Faster Attackers with a Super Effective Move**: While almost no offensive Pokemon can directly switch into a Hyper Voice, many Pokemon can capitalize on Aurorus's numberous weaknesses and low Speed to revenge kill it, such as Cobalion, Magneton, and Tyrantrum.

**Mach Punch Users**: Due to Aurorus's 4x weakness to Fighting-type moves, Mach Punch users such as Hitmonlee and Gurdurr can easily end its sweep.

**Specially Bulky Pokemon**: Aurorus's power can punch large holes in most Pokemon, but many specially bulky Pokemon can take a hit from Aurorus and cripple it in return. For example, Assault Vest Slowking isn't even 2HKOed by Freeze Dry and can hit back with Scald, and Calm Mind Cresselia can use Aurorus as setup fodder.

**Passive Damage**: Aurorus's susceptibility to all forms of entry hazard and Life Orb recoil lets it get worn down easily.
