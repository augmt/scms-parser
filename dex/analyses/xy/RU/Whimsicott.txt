Overview
########

Whimsicott might strike you as another cute, fluffy, and useless Fairy-type with bad stats, but it's far from useless with its amazing Speed tier, Fairy typing, and access to Prankster with an incredible supportive and offensive movepool to back it up. Sadly, it doesn't have good Special Attack to use its special attacks with, and its defensive stats aren't anything special, although its Grass / Fairy typing is a saving grace. However, with a good movepool comes 4 moveslot syndrome, and that is an issue that Whimsicott struggles with, especially with its access to a variety of supportive moves such as Leech Seed, Stun Spore, Memento, Taunt, Encore, and Tailwind, and respectable offensive moves such as Giga Drain, Moonblast, Hurricane, and U-turn.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Encore
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Stun Spore
move 4: Moonblast
ability: Prankster
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 236 Def / 24 Spe
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Prankster Encore allows Whimsicott to discourage setup sweepers and other defensive Pokemon from doing anything without getting an Encore. Combined with U-turn, Encore can give a lot of momentum, as Encore forces a lot of switches. Stun Spore allows Whimsicott to function as a fail-safe option to sweepers that threaten your team, allowing it to paralyze them before they're able to do anything thanks to Prankster giving it priority. Moonblast is used to allow Whimsicott to beat Pokemon it's supposed to check such as Hitmonlee, Druddigon, and Virizion, and it's the strongest STAB Whimsicott gets, and has good overall coverage, though Giga Drain can be used instead to better check Pokemon such as Alomomola, Rhyperior, and Gastrodon. The choice between them depends on what the team needs the most, as Whimsicott can't really do anything to Druddigon or Virizion with Giga Drain.

Memento can be used over Stun Spore to lower the target's offenses and give a teammate an opportunity to sweep. Tailwind can also be used, and along with U-turn, it can give your team a couple turns of doubled Speed, which can help you get the upper hand in the game, although it is exactly two turns, which usually is not long enough. Taunt stops setup completely and can be used over Encore. Finally, Leech Seed allows Whimsicott to have some sort of passive recovery, and can help teammates such as Registeel or Delphox gain a little bit of health.

Set Details
========

The Speed EVs allow Whimsicott to outspeed Adamant Hitmonlee while having the best possible HP and Defense to be able to switch into Pokemon like Druddigon, Rhyperior, Gastrodon, Alomomola, and Hitmonlee without much trouble. Leftovers is Whimsicott's only method of recovery other than Leech Seed, and Prankster is the best ability Whimsicott can have as it gives all non-attacking moves +1 priority.

Usage Tips
========

As Whimsicott has the ability to check threatening Pokemon such as Hitmonlee, Druddigon, and Rhyperior, it can directly switch into them, but be careful as the latter two have moves that can hurt Whimsicott, Fire Punch and Gunk Shot in Druddigon's case, and Stone Edge in Rhyperior's case. It should be noted, however, that Stone Edge can only 2HKO Whimsicott. Whimsicott can be used throughout the match, but it can be used early-game to spread paralysis and gain momentum, or mid-game and late-game to discourage setup sweepers with Encore or Taunt, as well as Stun Spore.

Team Options
========

Other Pokemon with U-turn and Volt Switch, such as Jolteon, Swellow, Moltres, and Braviary can form a VoltTurn core with Whimsicott. If Memento is used on the set, then Whimsicott can be paired with setup sweepers to help them set up. Those include Cobalion, Virizion, and Durant. Whimsicott's weakness to Steel-types is rather obvious, and for that reason, Fire-types such as Delphox, Moltres, and Emboar are recommended, and Fletchinder can spread burns and render Escavalier setup fodder. Furthermore, Whimsicott also covers the aforementioned Fire-types' weaknesses and reliably checks Pokemon such as Sharpedo, Druddigon, and Rhyperior for them.

Because Whimsicott has no reliable recovery, clerics, especially Alomomola, can provide useful Wish support. Alomomola also has good synergy with Whimsicott, resisting Fire- and Steel-type moves. Specially defensive Meloetta also has good synergy with Whimsicott, as it can use Heal Bell to cure Whimsicott from status, and likes the support Whimsicott brings with Leech Seed.

Life Orb
########
name: Life Orb
move 1: Moonblast
move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Encore / Tailwind
ability: Prankster
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Moonblast is a strong STAB move that hits a lot of Pokemon, namely Virizion, Sharpedo, Druddigon, Shiftry, and Spiritomb for super effective damage. Giga Drain also receives STAB and is useful for regaining back HP lost from Life Orb recoil; it is also used to hit Alomomola, Rhyperior, and Gastrodon, among other Pokemon, for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fire is useful to 2HKO Doublade after Stealth Rock, while also 2HKOing Escavalier and OHKOing Durant. Encore is used to deter Pokemon from setting up or using non-attacking moves such as Defog, allowing another teammate to come in for free. Tailwind can be a good move to use late-game for a couple turns of doubled Speed, which can help gain the upper hand. Nature Power is an option as it is an 80 Base Power move that gains +1 priority thanks to Prankster and the move's mechanics, and can be useful to pick off weakened Pokemon such as Fletchinder or Sharpedo without taking any unnecessary damage. Shadow Ball is an option that can be used over Hidden Power Fire to guarantee a 2HKO on Doublade, while also hitting Psychic-types for super effective damage. However, Hidden Power Fire is preferred as it hits Pokemon that Whimsicott usually lures, such as Escavalier.

Set Details
========

An offensive set with Life Orb allows Whimsicott to function as a check to various threats on offensive teams. Such Pokemon include Druddigon, Sharpedo, Rhyperior, Alomomola, Shiftry, Spiritomb, Jolteon, and Virizion, among others. The EV spread is straightforward, as it aims to maximize Special Attack and Speed, with a Timid nature to make use of Whimsicott's excellent Speed stat. Prankster is used to gain priority on Encore and Tailwind.

Usage Tips
========

Whimsicott should be used as an offensive utility Pokemon on offensive teams to check the aforementioned Pokemon throughout the match. It should be kept at decently high HP to allow it to consistently switch into these threats, either through the use of Giga Drain or by keeping it safe from any unnecessary damage. If the opponent has Doublade or Escavalier, hitting them with the appropriate coverage move on the predicted switch to 2HKO is a risk that is worth taking. Use Encore on Pokemon that try to set up, or on a non-attacking move to allow a teammate to come in for free. If Tailwind is chosen, it should be used as a last resort move before Whimsicott goes down, for a couple turns of doubled Speed that its teammates can benefit from.

Team Options
========

Stealth Rock is important as it can turn some 2HKOs into OHKOs, and also because Whimsicott can force some switches. Rhyperior, Cobalion, and Druddigon are good at setting up Stealth Rock, and the former two are also good at checking Poison-types such as Golbat and Drapion. Other entry hazards are also appreciated, and some setters include Qwilfish, which has access to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, Accelgor, which has access to Spikes, and Omastar, which can set up Spikes as well as Stealth Rock. Spiritomb is a good offensive partner, as it can Pursuit trap some Pokemon that can prove to be annoying to Whimsicott, such as Delphox and Bronzong, and neutralize Pokemon like Doublade with Foul Play or Will-O-Wisp. Assault Vest Slowking is an excellent counter to the Fire-types that plague Whimsicott, whereas Assault Vest Druddigon is a good offensive check to Pokemon such as Moltres and Delphox. Likewise, counters to Poison-types are important; Reuniclus, Choice Specs Meloetta, and Delphox are powerful Psychic-types that can get rid of those. Finally, wallbreakers such as Moltres, Clawitzer, and Exploud are good teammates to punch holes in the opposing team, enabling Whimsicott to perform its role more effectively.

Other Options
########

Whimsicott is a Pokemon with a wide movepool, and as such, it has quite a handful of other options at its disposal. A set that uses Leech Seed and Substitute can be used, but Whimsicott is far better at being a supportive Pokemon, and other SubSeeders such as Gourgeist-S do it better. Life Orb can be utilized, seeing as how Whimsicott has a diverse offensive movepool consisting of options such as Giga Drain, Moonblast, Hurricane, and U-turn, but Whimsicott has poor offensive stats. Choice Specs can be used with Switcheroo, but it suffers the same fate as Life Orb. Switcheroo can also be used with other items such as Lagging Tail or Iron Ball to cripple some targets, but it's a gimmicky strategy. Knock Off can be used on the main set to rid Pokemon of their items, but it can't do any serious damage and there are often better moves to be used. Finally, Sunny Day along with U-turn, Solar Beam, and Heat Rock as the item can be used to support Sunny Day teams.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Escavalier, Doublade, and Bronzong are hard counters, as Whimsicott can't touch them at all while they can KO it with either Iron Head or Gyro Ball. Steelix, Durant, and Cobalion can also switch into Whimsicott and threaten it with Iron Head, but the latter two don't like Stun Spore or a strong Moonblast.

**Poison-types**: Golbat can take any hit from Whimsicott and retaliate with Toxic or Brave Bird. Amoonguss and Roselia can outright OHKO Whimsicott with Sludge Bomb or set up Spikes in the latter's case, and other Poison-types can also do the same.

**Fire-types**: Delphox, Emboar, and Moltres can all take whatever Whimsicott has and OHKO, but don't like a Stun Spore.
