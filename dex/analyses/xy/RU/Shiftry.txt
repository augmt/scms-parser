Overview
########

Shiftry jumped from being a niche NU sweeper to one of the best assets to have on an offensive team in just one generation thanks to the Defog buff. It gives Shiftry a niche no other Pokemon has, being a strong offensive Defogger with no safe switch-ins. With Life Orb, Shiftry's good Attack can cripple defensive cores early game with Knock Off, and its access to Sucker Punch means it can act as a revenge killer late-game. This also means that Braviary can't deter Shiftry from using Defog, as Shiftry can KO it on the switch with Knock Off and Sucker Punch. Not only does Shiftry have good Attack, but it also has good Special Attack and Leaf Storm to threaten Pokemon such as Alomomola and Rhyperior. Sadly, it's average Speed makes it a bit hard to use Defog against offensive teams, and its poor Grass / Dark typing along with its below average defenses means it is KOed easily. The fact that its STAB options are walled by common Pokemon like Cobalion and Virizion doesn't help either. Still, Shiftry can make use of its typing to check threatening Pokemon such as Slowking, Clawitzer, Heliolisk, and Jolteon, and possibly take them out with the appropriate move.

Defog
########
name: Defog
move 1: Defog
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Leaf Storm
ability: Chlorophyll
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Lonely / Hasty

Moves
========

Defog is the reason to use Shiftry, and it's an important move to have on a lot of teams as it can clear hazards from both sides of the field and support Shiftry's team. Knock Off is a strong STAB move that cripples a lot of Pokemon, and it's very hard to switch into. Sucker Punch is good to have on Shiftry since it also gets STAB, and gives it a way of getting past faster Pokemon like Heliolisk and Jolteon. It also means it can revenge kill some Pokemon. Leaf Storm means that Shiftry will be able to KO Pokemon like Alomomola, Rhyperior, and Gligar, though the latter can only be KOed after it has taken a Knock Off. Leaf Storm also allows Shiftry to serve as a potential wallbreaker with its decent offensive stats and Knock Off, which is the bane of any defensive Pokemon.

Set Details
========

The EVs are to maximize Attack and Speed, with the remaining dumped into Special Attack. This allows Shiftry to outspeed Pokemon like neutral-natured Tyrantrum and everything below it, while it Speed ties with Adamant Gallade. Life Orb is the item of choice as it boosts Shiftry's damage output. Additionally, a Hasty nature can be used to make Shiftry Speed tie with Jolly Gallade and Kabutops, and outspeed anything slower. It could also out-prioritize Adamant Hitmonlee's Mach Punch, but it will make Shiftry lose out on a lot of power.

Usage Tips
========

Shiftry is a Pokemon that can be used throughout the entire match, be it early-, mid-, or late-game. If you see an opportunity to use Defog, take it, otherwise Knock Off is a safe option to go for. Use Shiftry to cripple defensive cores and walls like Rhyperior and Alomomola with Knock Off and Leaf Storm early-game, and to hit Pokemon such as Amoonguss hard on the switch with Knock Off. If possible, save Shiftry for late-game cleaning or to act as a revenge killer. It can also come in mid-game if a Defog is needed. With a bit of prediction, it can switch into Pokemon like Slowking, Rhyperior, and Clawitzer, and take them out, but beware of a possible Scald burn in Slowking and Clawitzer's case, and they all could potentially KO Shiftry if it switches into the wrong move.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that like entry hazards off of the field generally like having Shiftry as a partner. This includes Moltres and Delphox, especially because Shiftry is able to get past their counters, Slowking and Jellicent. Additionally, pairing it with Assault Vest Slowking creates a sort of Fire / Water / Grass core which can work pretty nicely, both offensively and defensively, with Slowking being able to easily pivot in and out. Doublade synergizes well with Shiftry since it can come in on Cobalion and Virizion, two of Shiftry's counters, and use them as set up fodder.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Seed Bomb / Bullet Seed
ability: Chlorophyll
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Swords Dance is used to boost Shiftry's Attack stat to impressive levels, allowing it to muscle through teams. Knock Off is a powerful STAB move that removes the target's item, making it a spammable move with no drawbacks that can cripple nearly all Pokemon. Sucker Punch is a strong priority move that allows Shiftry to OHKO Hitmonlee at +2 as well as threaten faster Pokemon. Seed Bomb is another STAB move that allows Shiftry to hit Pokemon such as Alomomola, Aromatisse, and Rhyperior for super effective damage, while Bullet Seed is mainly used to KO Omastar leads, preventing them from setting up any entry hazards. Low Kick is an option, as at +2 it KOes Cobalion as well as Virizion after Stealth Rock damage. This allows Shiftry to work as a lure to these two Pokemon. Low Kick should only be used with Focus Sash; Shiftry can set up as these Pokemon switch in, take any hit, and KO in return with Low Kick. With Focus Sash, Shiftry can also potentially break through a slightly weakened Aromatisse with Seed Bomb.

Set Details
========

The EV spread is straightforward, with maximum Attack and Speed investment. A Jolly nature is used primarily to outspeed Adamant Gallade and Hitmonlee and OHKO them at +2 with Sucker Punch, which outprioritizes the latter's Mach Punch. Life Orb is used to maximize damage output, although Focus Sash is an option that should only be used with Low Kick. An Adamant nature is not preferred because it leaves Shiftry prone to being revenge killed by the likes of Mach Punch Hitmonlee.

Usage Tips
========

Swords Dance Shiftry should be used as a late-game sweeper and should only attempt to sweep when its checks and counters, such as Cobalion, Virizion (in case you're not using Focus Sash), and Drapion are either weakened or eliminated. Shiftry can also be used early-game for its strong Knock Off, or to revenge kill with Sucker Punch. This will also lead the opponent into thinking that Shiftry is not carrying Swords Dance, only to be surprised with a late-game sweep. Beware of U-turn Gligar, as it can potentially KO Shiftry. If Bullet Seed is used and the opponent has what looks like an Omastar lead, then Shiftry should be used as a lead to prevent Omastar from setting up entry hazards. Finally, Knock Off is a spammable move that cripples a lot of Pokemon, so use it freely.

Team Options
========

Entry hazards are important for Swords Dance Shiftry as they can really help it sweep late-game by inflicting residual damage on the opponent's Pokemon. For this reason, Spikes users such as Omastar, which also has access to Stealth Rock, and Accelgor are appreciated. Qwilfish has access to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, the latter of which really weaken offensive teams, allowing Shiftry to easily sweep. Stealth Rock users such as Druddigon, Cobalion, and Rhyperior are also appreciated. The latter two can also check Drapion and Skuntank.

Doublade is a good partner as it can counter Cobalion and Virizion, two Pokemon that could potentially counter Shiftry. Additionally, Doublade can also spinblock and keep the entry hazards that Shiftry loves intact. Certain wallbreakers, such as Clawitzer, Choice Specs Meloetta, and Choice Specs or Calm Mind Delphox, are good to wear down the opponent's walls, giving Shiftry an easier time sweeping. Hitmonlee is also a wallbreaker, and it has access to Rapid Spin to remove any entry hazards on Shiftry's side of the field. Choice Band Dugtrio is a good partner because it can trap and KO a slightly weakened Cobalion and OHKO Virizion with Aerial Ace. Life Orb Dugtrio also has access to Memento, which can help Shiftry set up. Finally, if Focus Sash and Low Kick are used, then Pokemon that like Aromatisse, Cobalion, and Virizion gone are appreciated; Hitmonlee, Choice Band Druddigon, Sharpedo, and Electric-types in general are some examples of these.

Other Options
########

Nasty Plot with Giga Drain and Dark Pulse is an option to use, but it's outclassed and inferior to the Swords Dance set as it lacks priority. Explosion can be utilized on any set to go out with a bang and possibly allow Shiftry to take something with it, but Shiftry doesn't really have much place for it. Finally, Shiftry can utilize a Sunny Day set with Solar Beam for sun teams, but Defog or Swords Dance are two of the few reasons to use Shiftry, and give it its niche.

Checks & Counters
########

**Cobalion**: Cobalion resists both of Shiftry's STAB moves, and can potentially get a Justified boost by switching into Knock Off. It also has Close Combat to KO Shiftry.

**Virizion**: It can appreciate a Justified boost, can take anything Shiftry throws at it, and retaliate with Close Combat.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon that can take a Sucker Punch can easily revenge kill Shiftry. This includes Choice Scarf Braviary, Jolly Hitmonlee, and Moltres among others, although they must be wary as a +2 Sucker Punch can potentially KO.

**Pokemon that resist its STABs**: Pokemon that can take Knock Off, Leaf Storm or Sucker Punch can easily counter Shiftry. This includes Whimsicott, Drapion, Skuntank, Emboar, Druddigon, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth.
