Overview
########
Sandslash turned from a mediocre Pokemon in BW to an outstanding Rapid Spin user in XY with one simple change: Knock Off's buff. Knock Off allows Sandslash to beat almost all spinblockers, including Mismagius, Jellicent, Banette, and most importantly, Doublade. With Sandslash's bulk and typing, it can also threaten most Stealth Rock users, including Rhyperior, Cobalion, and Registeel. Along with Knock Off, Sandslash learns other notable moves such as Earthquake, Stone Edge, Stealth Rock, and Swords Dance, which can turn Sandslash into a boosting threat. It has good base 100 Attack coupled with respectable physical bulk, but its Special Defense stat is poor, and its Speed is nothing special.

Rapid Spin
########
name: Rapid Spin
move 1: Rapid Spin
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Stealth Rock / Swords Dance
ability: Sand Rush
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
Rapid Spin is the only reason to use Sandslash. Knock Off allows Sandslash to beat most spinblockers such as Jellicent, Mismagius, Banette, and most importantly Doublade. Earthquake is a strong STAB option that can hurt Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Registeel, and Cobalion, and hits Spiritomb for more damage than Knock Off. In the last slot, Stealth Rock can be used if there is no other setter on the team, while Swords Dance allows Sandslash to beat spinblockers with more ease and lets it perform better against defensive teams.

Set Details
========
The EVs aim to maximize bulk and power by having maximum investment in HP and Attack, with an Adamant nature to boost Sandslash's damage output. Leftovers is a staple on bulky Pokemon, and Sandslash lacks any other way of recovery, but Soft Sand can be used to ensure that a +2 Earthquake OHKOes Pokemon such as Doublade and Spiritomb. A defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Atk with an Impish nature can be used for more physical bulk, but isn't advised because Sandslash can't beat spinblockers reliably with such low Attack investment.

Usage Tips
========
Bring out Sandslash whenever entry hazards need to be removed. It can Rapid Spin against most hazard setters, including Rhyperior, Registeel, Drapion, and Cobalion, so that should be taken advantage of. If the opponent has a spinblocker, then use Knock Off, Swords Dance, or Earthquake depending on the spinblocker itself; if it's Doublade, Banette, Mismagius, or Jellicent, then using Swords Dance, or Knock Off followed by Earthquake, is better. If it's Spiritomb, then using Earthquake, or Swords Dance followed by Earthquake, is better. Swords Dance should also be taken advantage of against defensive teams, as a +2 Soft Sand-boosted Earthquake can hurt a lot of Pokemon, including Aromatisse and Registeel. Sandslash is fairly bulky, so it can take a couple hits from Pokemon such as Hitmonlee and Cobalion and hurt them back with Earthquake. Finally, Knock Off is a spammable move, so don't hesitate to use it if you're not sure what to do.

Team Options
========
In general, Pokemon that like Stealth Rock removed appreciate Sandslash's support. Therefore, Fire-types such as Moltres and Delphox and Flying-types such as Braviary and Swellow make good teammates. In addition to liking Stealth Rock removed, the aforementioned Pokemon also have good defensive synergy with Sandslash, with Sandslash taking Rock- and Electric-type moves aimed at Moltres, Swellow, and Braviary, and them taking Grass-type moves aimed at Sandslash. Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary in particular is a good teammate for its ability to set up on a lot of Sandslash's counters, including Tangrowth, Gastrodon lacking Ice Beam, and Alomomola.

Sandslash fits well on Spikes-stacking hyper offense teams for its ability to use Rapid Spin and set up Stealth Rock, so Accelgor and Qwilfish are good partners for setting up Spikes and, in Qwilfish's case, Toxic Spikes. Likewise, it can also fit onto defensive teams that stack entry hazards for passive damage but don't want to rely on Defog from Gligar or Golbat. Finally, Sandslash appreciates having Grass-type teammates, such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Rotom-C, to switch into Water-types. Virizion can also switch in against most Water- and Grass-type Pokemon and set up Swords Dance without any problems.

Other Options
########
An offensive Sand Rush set with Sandstorm, Earthquake, Stone Edge, and Knock Off with Life Orb can be used, but it's subpar and outclassed as a sweeper by Rock Polish Rhyperior, which has more power and bulk. Counter can be utilized with a defensive set, but Sandslash lacks reliable recovery and therefore can't pull it off too well. Toxic can also be used on a defensive set to cripple switch-ins such as Alomomola and Tangrowth. Additionally, Sandslash has cool coverage options such as Stone Edge and Iron Tail, which hit Moltres and Aromatisse, respectively.

Checks & Counters
########
**Strong Special Attackers**: Sandslash has pitiful Special Defense, and for that reason, any strong special attacker will hurt it a lot. Examples include Exploud, Clawitzer, and Meloetta.

**Flying-types**: If Sandslash doesn't have Stone Edge, most Flying-types can counter it easily. Fletchinder can burn it and use it as setup fodder, and Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary can also set up on it. Moltres can outright KO Sandslash with Fire Blast.

**Grass-types**: Grass-types resist Sandslash's STAB moves and hit it super effectively. Rotom-C, Tangrowth, Shiftry, and Amoonguss can switch in easily and KO Sandslash with Leaf Storm or Giga Drain. Virizion resists Earthquake and doesn't mind Knock Off as it can gain a free Attack boost from Justified. Mega Abomasnow resists Earthquake and takes little damage from Knock Off while only fearing Stone Edge, and can OHKO with Giga Drain or Blizzard.

**Water-types**: Alomomola and Gastrodon can switch in relatively easily and threaten to KO Sandslash with Scald.
