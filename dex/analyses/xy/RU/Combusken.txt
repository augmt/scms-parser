Overview
########

Combusken has access to the highly coveted Speed Boost, as well as Bulk Up, Swords Dance, and Substitute, which can be given to a partner through Baton Pass. Combusken also happens to be an NFE Pokemon, so it can utilize Eviolite to boost its bulk to respectable levels. Thanks to Combusken's solid bulk, it can Baton Pass multiple times in a single match. Combusken can also sweep teams when boosted, although this is better left to a teammate. However, Combusken is stopped by common Pokemon such as Fletchinder and Slowking, weak to common Water-, Ground-, and Flying-type moves, and lacks reliable recovery, so it is easily worn down. Combusken's typing also doesn't help, sharing weaknesses with common Baton Pass recipients such as Drapion and Emboar.

Moves
========

Baton Pass is the main reason to use Combusken, as it can pass boosts to a teammate, giving them a chance to sweep. Protect guarantees that Combusken can get one extra turn of Speed Boost. Substitute lets Combusken dodge status and can be passed along with stat boosts. Baton Passing Substitutes is also much more reliable than baton passing Bulk Up boosts, as it gives the recipient a nice buffer against incoming attacks. Swords Dance boosts Combusken's Attack by two stages and, if given the chance, can help Combusken sweep. In cases where Combusken cannot sweep, the boosts should be passed to a partner that is capable of sweeping. Flare Blitz is Combusken's strongest STAB move and can be used to sweep. Flare Blitz can also weaken phazers such as Drapion and Steelix, cutting down on the number of times they are able to switch in. Bulk Up can be used if not running Swords Dance, as it boosts Combusken's Attack and Defense by one stage. This acts as a nice priority buffer, making setting up with Pokemon such as Xatu easier.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs, 108 Special Defense EVs, and a Careful nature allow Combusken's Substitute to survive Alomomola's Scald and +1 Cresselia's Moonblast. The HP and Defense investment allows Combusken to survive Fletchinder's Acrobatics at full health, while the Speed investment allows Combusken to outpace neutral-natured Hitmonlee after one Speed boost. Eviolite is the only item considered, as it boosts Combusken's defenses. Speed Boost is Combusken's niche and the only reason to use it. At +2, Combusken outspeeds the majority of the tier, and at +3, it outspeeds the entire metagame.

Usage Tips
========

Bring Combusken in on Pokemon that it can force out or set up on, such as Abomasnow and Registeel, and then set up a Substitute on the switch or boost with Swords Dance or Bulk Up. Try to remove all phazers such as Roar Rhyperior before attempting to set up with Combusken, as they can easily phaze out Combusken or the recipient. Combusken dislikes being paralyzed, so set up a Substitute when you think the foe will try to inflict status on it. Make sure that the recipient can safely switch in on the opposing Pokemon; this can be accomplished by setting up a Substitute before Baton Passing.

Team Options
========

Any Pokemon that appreciates Attack and Speed boosts is a good partner. Virizion can switch on on Water- and Ground-type attacks, but note that it shares a Flying-type weakness with Combusken. Virizion also appreciates the Speed, power, and bulk provided by Speed Boost and Bulk Up. Drapion, Feraligatr, Glalie, Pinsir, Tyrantrum, and Druddigon all appreciate the Attack and Speed boosts, as they can easily sweep teams thanks to their good coverage. Calm Mind Xatu is an excellent recipient, as Magic Bounce bounces back Roar and Whirlwind, making it impossible to phaze without Dragon Tail. Defense boosts from Bulk Up make setting up with Xatu easier, and it also has access to Stored Power so that it can make full use of the boosts accumulated.

Other Options
########

Combusken doesn't really have that many other options. It can run a set with Thunder Punch, Swords Dance, Flare Blitz, and Low Kick to try to sweep, but Combusken is rather weak even after a boost. Combusken can also utilize other boosting moves such as Work Up and Hone Claws.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fletchinder**: Fletchinder's priority Acrobatics ignores Combusken's Speed boosts and has the potential to stop a Baton Pass if Combusken has taken some prior damage.

**Phazing**: Phazing shuts down Combusken completely. Drapion and Slowking can easily phaze out Combusken with Whirlwind and Dragon Tail, respectively, while Combusken cannot do much back to them. Slowking also puts lots of pressure on Combusken, as it has super effective STAB moves to hit Combusken with. Haze from Cofragrigus erases all of Combusken's boosts, and Perish Song from Meloetta forces Combusken to switch out. However, if Combusken is running Flare Blitz, it can chip away at these phazers, limiting the number of times they can get away with it.

**Super Effective Attacks**: Strong special attackers with super effective moves, such as Delphox and Clawitzer, can easily force Combusken out, as Combusken lacks a way of boosting its Special Defense.

**General Offensive Presence**: A general offensive presence takes away most of Combusken's legroom, usually resulting in a scenario where the recipient has to take a hit. Pokemon with Infiltrator, Boomburst, or Hyper Voice can also bypass Substitutes, making it harder for Combusken to use Baton Pass.
