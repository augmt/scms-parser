Overview
########

Rotom-S finds itself outclassed, for the most part, by the other Rotom formes in the RU tier, and only has a very small niche. Relative to the other Rotom formes available for use in the RU tier, Rotom-S has an extremely useful defensive typing, bearing resistances to the Fighting-, Flying-, and Bug-type moves that are common in the RU tier, as well as a neutrality to Fire-type attacks. Unfortunately, Rotom-S lacks reliable recovery and has a weakness to Stealth Rock, making its defensive typing less valuable. Although Rotom-S struggles to get around the Ground-types in the tier, it is able to power through other Pokemon such as Virizion with its STAB Air Slash, something Rotom-C can only dream of. It should be emphasized, however, that Rotom-S should only be used on teams that really need a way to beat a select few Pokemon, such as Durant and Virizion.

Physically Defensive
########
name: Physically Defensive
move 1: Will-O-Wisp
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Air Slash
move 4: Pain Split / Volt Switch
ability: Levitate
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpA
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Will-O-Wisp is an excellent move for Rotom-S, allowing it to cripple many physical threats, such as Durant and Escavalier. Air Slash and Thunderbolt are solid STAB moves with good coverage in the RU tier. Air Slash is also useful for dealing with opposing Virizion, which often carry a Lum Berry. Pain Split is the best option for the final slot, as it works in tandem with Rotom-S's relatively low HP to keep Rotom-S healthy. Volt Switch is an option on balanced teams, however, as it generates momentum against the Pokemon that Rotom-S checks.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs are used to give Rotom-S the maximum possible HP while minimizing the damage it takes from Stealth Rock. Maximum Defense and a Bold nature are necessary for Rotom-S to counter threats such as Escavalier, Doublade, and Durant, as well as check Hitmonlee. Leftovers provides Rotom-S with another form of recovery.

Usage Tips
========

Rotom-S fulfills the very specific niche of beating pretty much every Steel-type sweeper in the tier; if you don't need a Pokemon to do that for you, choose a different Pokemon. Once you have revealed that you aren't an offensive variant of Rotom-S, your opponent will likely switch in their Fire-type, so don't spam Will-O-Wisp. Rotom-S is worn down pretty easily, so it is important to use it conservatively if you see a Pokemon on the opponent's team that threatens Rotom-S. Doublade, Escavalier, Durant, Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, Bulk Up Gurdurr, and some variants of Substitute + Bulk Up Gallade are all good stallbreakers that Rotom-S is capable of beating if you keep it healthy. Although Rotom-S is a very good check to Hitmonlee, do not switch it in if Stealth Rock is on the field, as you will likely be 2HKOed.

Team Options
========

Rotom-S really appreciates cleric support, making both Aromatisse and Alomomola good partners. Specially defensive Aromatisse also appreciates Rotom-S's ability to switch into Steel-type attacks aimed at it. Rotom-S also enjoys teammates capable of removing Stealth Rock, making it more effective at switching into dangerous physical attackers. Hitmontop and Gligar are both capable of removing entry hazards for Rotom-S and its team. Hitmontop in particular has good synergy with Rotom-S, switching into Rock-type moves with ease. Teammates like Tangrowth that give Durant or Escavalier free switch-ins also appreciate the presence of Rotom-S.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Air Slash
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Trick
move 4: Thunderbolt
ability: Levitate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Air Slash is a really nice move on Choice Scarf Rotom-S thanks to its ability to completely shut down Swords Dance Virizion. It also has a 30% chance to flinch, which can be useful. Volt Switch is a decently powerful STAB move that generates momentum against predicted switches. Trick allows Rotom-S to cripple opposing defensive Pokemon. Thunderbolt is the move of choice in the last slot, as it is a more powerful Electric-type STAB move than Volt Switch. However, Hidden Power Grass is also an option in the last slot if you feel your team is especially weak to Rhyperior or Gastrodon.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allow Rotom-S to revenge kill as many Pokemon as possible when equipped with a Choice Scarf, also allowing it to Speed tie with opposing Choice Scarf Rotom-C. Special Attack EVs are also maximized so that Rotom-S can hit as hard as possible.

Usage Tips
========

Bring Rotom-S in after a teammate has fainted in order to revenge kill the opponent's weakened Pokemon. It is a good idea to use Volt Switch on predicted switches to gain momentum for your team.

Team Options
========

This set really appreciates Pokemon that can lure in and dispose of opposing Gastrodon and Rhyperior. Eviolite Magneton with Hidden Power Grass is a good option for this, as the opponent might think that it is Choice-locked into an Electric-type move. Pokemon that are setup bait for Virizion enjoy Rotom-S's ability to revenge kill it. As such, Alomomola makes a pretty good partner for Rotom-S.

Other Options
########

Rotom-S can run a decently effective Expert Belt set to lure Rhyperior and Gastrodon with Hidden Power Grass, but it then loses its niche as an Electric-type that consistently beats Virizion. Confuse Ray, Air Slash, and Thunder Wave can be used on the same set in order to annoy the opponent, but this is relatively unreliable, and confusion isn't that good without Prankster. A more offensive spread can be utilized on the physically defensive set if you want more of a tank than a wall.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: With the exception of Moltres, which hates Thunderbolt, Fire-types are relatively good switch-ins to the defensive sets. Delphox, for example, can set up Calm Minds on defensive Rotom-S easily and threaten to sweep.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types tend to be specially based and do not mind Will-O-Wisp too much; Heliolisk, Jolteon, and Magneton all do solid damage to Rotom-S, and it can't do much in return.

**Stealth Rock**: Rotom-S is pretty easy to wear down, so shaving off a quarter of its health every time it switches in really limits its effectiveness.

**Ground-types**: Rhyperior and Gastrodon wall the Choice Scarf set unless it carries Hidden Power Grass, but neither appreciate being burned, especially Rhyperior.
