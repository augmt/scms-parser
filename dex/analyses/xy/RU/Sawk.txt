Overview
########

While it is a terror in NU, Sawk isn't that scary in RU. It has a high Attack stat, a usable base 85 Speed, and mediocre defenses. It also has access to a strong STAB move in the form of Close Combat, along with good coverage moves which Hitmonlee doesn't learn, such as Knock Off, Poison Jab, and Ice Punch. Sawk, unlike Hitmonlee, also has enough room to run both Ice Punch and Poison Jab to beat Gligar and Aromatisse, respectively. However, Sawk is outclassed by Gallade, which has all the coverage moves Sawk has access to, in addition to Bulk Up, Swords Dance, and a good secondary STAB move. Hitmonlee, another Fighting-type, hits harder with High Jump Kick than Sawk does with Close Combat thanks to Reckless. However, Sawk's access to Ice Punch differentiates it from Hitmonlee, and Sawk can form an effective core with Gallade, Hitmonlee, or other Fighting-types to weaken the opponent's Fighting-type checks and counters.

Moves
========

Close Combat acts as a reliable and strong STAB move that can deal lots of damage to Pokemon that don't resist it. Knock Off hits the Ghost- and Psychic-types, most notably Doublade, that are immune to or resist Close Combat. Ice Punch is used mainly to 2HKO Gligar and Amoonguss, and Poison Jab is used to 2HKO Aromatisse. Stone Edge is good for coverage, but Sawk doesn't have a place for it on its set. Earthquake along with Mold Breaker can be used to hit Weezing.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed investment along with an Adamant nature allow Sawk to hit as hard as possible. Choice Band lets Sawk hit extremely hard, 2HKOing Alomomola and Doublade with Close Combat and Knock Off, respectively. Life Orb is an option to allow Sawk the freedom to switch moves, still gaining 2HKOs on Aromatisse and Gligar, but with Life Orb, Sawk won't always 2HKO Alomomola and Doublade without any prior damage. Additionally, it also breaks Sturdy, which allows Sawk to survive strong hits that would otherwise OHKO it, such as Acrobatics from Fletchinder; however, Mold Breaker should be used if Earthquake is chosen. Mold Breaker also ensures an OHKO on Rhyperior with Close Combat. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Pokemon such as Adamant Hitmonlee, but it takes away some of Sawk's wallbreaking capabilities.

Usage Tips
========

Sawk should use its coverage moves to break walls that resist Close Combat such as Gligar, Doublade, Amoonguss, and Aromatisse, and use Close Combat on Pokemon that don't resist it, including Alomomola and Registeel. With Choice Band, predictions have to be made because it is important to hit Aromatisse and Gligar with the respective coverage move on the switch. Avoid getting Sawk burned or paralyzed as status completely shuts Sawk down.

Team Options
========

Hitmonlee, Gallade, Cobalion, and Virizion are great teammates because of their abilities to weaken each other's shared checks and counters. For example, Sawk can weaken Doublade, Aromatisse, or Gligar, allowing another Fighting-type to easily muscle through them. As Sawk is mostly a wallbreaker, sweepers such as Sharpedo, Choice Scarf Delphox, and Jolteon can clean up after Sawk has weakened walls. Stealth Rock is necessary for Life Orb Sawk to 2HKO Alomomola and Doublade with Close Combat and Knock Off respectively. Druddigon, Cobalion, Sandslash, and Rhyperior are good teammates to set up Stealth Rock. Rhyperior can also check Flying-types such as Fletchinder and Braviary, which threaten Sawk. Accelgor can set up Spikes, while Qwilfish and Omastar can set up Spikes as well as Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock, respectively.

Other Options
########

Sawk doesn't have many other options, as those options are used better by other Fighting-types. Choice Scarf can be used to allow Sawk to act as more of a revenge killer, but Hitmonlee is a better user of Choice Scarf. Bulk Up is a setup option, but Gallade is a better user of the move thanks to its good natural Special Defense. Taunt is also an option to prevent Pokemon such as Drapion and Qwilfish from setting up entry hazards.

Checks & Counters
########

**Weezing**: Weezing can switch into any attack except Mold Breaker Earthquake and can either threaten Sawk with Will-O-Wisp or force it out.

**Faster Pokemon**: Sawk is relatively frail, so any strong, fast Pokemon can KO Sawk with ease. Fletchinder, Delphox, Moltres, Hitmonlee, and Meloetta are all faster and can KO Sawk with their STAB moves, but they must be wary of Sturdy as Sawk can potentially KO them in return.

**Status**: Burn and paralysis completely shut down Sawk.
