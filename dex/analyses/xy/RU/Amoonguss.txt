Overview
########

Amoonguss has access to many great traits, most notably its Grass / Poison typing, which makes it a great answer to most Electric-, Water-, and Grass-types in the tier, and also means it can absorb Toxic Spikes. It also has access to a 100% accurate sleep move in Spore, allowing it to easily cripple a member of the opposing team. Not only that, but Regenerator allows Amoonguss to heal just by switching out, meaning it can create Regenerator cores with Pokemon such as Slowking and Alomomola. Combine this with really good overall bulk and moves such as Stun Spore, Synthesis, and Foul Play, and it's easy to see why Amoonguss sticks out as one of the best defensive Grass-types in the tier. Unfortunately, Amoonguss has a very low Speed stat, meaning it will almost always move last. It also has common weaknesses to Fire-, Ice-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks, limiting the amount of Pokemon it can wall.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Spore
move 2: Giga Drain
move 3: Sludge Bomb / Clear Smog
move 4: Stun Spore / Foul Play / Synthesis
ability: Regenerator
item: Black Sludge
evs: 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Spore is an extremely helpful support move that can immobilize a Pokemon, making it useless for a good portion of the match. Giga Drain is used as it is a decently powerful Grass-type STAB attack that can also recover HP. Sludge Bomb is used in the third slot for its high Base Power, and also has a good chance to poison the target. Clear Smog is another option in the third slot to stop setup sweepers, though it's weaker and doesn't have the chance to poison. Stun Spore is nice for crippling faster Pokemon and can be especially helpful as the opponent tries to switch into a fast Fire- or Flying-type. Foul Play is also a nice option for damaging physical attackers, and does a ton of damage if they decide to boost their Attack. Synthesis is another option for a healing move; its low PP isn't as big of a problem for Amoonguss due to Regenerator being Amoonguss's main way of healing.

Set Details
========

The EV spread with a Bold nature allows Amoonguss to avoid a 2HKO from Reckless Life Orb Hitmonlee's High Jump Kick, even after Stealth Rock, with the rest thrown into Special Defense for more special bulk. A specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 84 Def / 172 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to take special hits better, notably only being 4HKOed by Heliolisk's Hidden Power Ice. Black Sludge provides nice passive recovery and can also deter Trick users such as Rotom-C from using Trick on Amoonguss. Regenerator heals on the switch, allowing Amoonguss to heal itself even without using a recovery move.

Usage Tips
========

It's important to switch often when using Amoonguss, as the free healing from Regenerator is great for preventing it from getting worn down. Use Spore sparingly; Spore can only put one Pokemon to sleep, so try to make sure it's used against your opponent's most threatening Pokemon. After it's put something to sleep, it may be wise to use Stun Spore on a predicted switch into your opponent's Amoonguss check post-sleep clause, as it will usually be a fast Fire- or Flying-type. Amoonguss should almost always be brought in on Electric-, Water-, and Grass-types due to its ability to counter most of them with impunity.

Team Options
===========

Pokemon with Regenerator make excellent partners, as they can form a hard-to-break Regenerator core with Amoonguss. Assault Vest Slowking gets a special mention, as it can take on Fire-, Psychic-, and Ice-types with relative ease, while Amoonguss easily absorbs Water- and Grass-type moves for Slowking. Alomomola is another bulky Water-type with Regenerator that also makes for a great partner. Rhyperior can take on Fire- and Flying-types, while Amoonguss can take on Water- and Grass-type attacks, making it another helpful partner. Drapion is another Pokemon that makes for a great teammate, as it can set up Toxic Spikes and deals with Psychic-types easily. Pokemon that hate Electric-types such as Braviary and Fletchinder appreciate Amoonguss's support. Finally, Fire-types like Delphox and Emboar dislike Water-types, so they appreciate Amoonguss's support.

Other Options
########

There are a few other option for Amoonguss. An offensive Life Orb set with Spore, Giga Drain, Sludge Bomb, and Hidden Power Fire can be used to catch some normal switch-ins off-guard, though it's not extremely powerful and tends to face competition from Grass-types such as Rotom-C, Mega Abomasnow, Virizion, and even Tangrowth. Toxic is another status move that can help Amoonguss in beating Pokemon like specially defensive Alomomola. Rain Dance or Sunny Day can be used on dedicated weather teams, though Amoonguss doesn't really contribute much to the offensive nature of these teams.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Delphox, Moltres, and Emboar can easily hit Amoonguss with one of their super effective STAB attacks. They must be careful of Spore and Sleep Powder, however, though the former two can use Substitute to help avoid these moves.

**Psychic-types**: Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Meloetta can hit Amoonguss with a super effective Psychic-type move. Cresselia can also dodge Spore with Substitute and proceed to set up Calm Mind. They must all watch out for Spore on the switch, however, and Reuniclus Speed ties with Amoonguss, meaning it can get outsped and Spored before it can even attack. Meloetta also dislikes Stun Spore.

**Flying-types**: Braviary and Fletchinder are both Flying-types that can hit Amoonguss with their super effective STAB moves. However, they all hate Spore and Stun Spore though Bulk Up Braviary can use Substitute to somewhat remedy this.

**Ice-types**: Mega Abomasnow is the only relevant Ice-type in the tier, though its STAB Blizzards have no trouble doing massive amounts of damage. Amoonguss does, however, outspeed Mega Abomasnow which are running a negative Speed nature and can hit back with a STAB Sludge Bomb, though it doesn't OHKO. Other Ice-type coverage moves, such as Life Orb Clawitzer's Ice Beam, 2HKO Amoonguss on the switch.

**Steel-types**: Steel-types are barely touched by both of Amoonguss's STAB attacks. Escavalier gets a special mention for being immune to Spore with Overcoat, while other Pokemon such as Durant, Cobalion, and Doublade can switch in once something has been put to sleep. However, they all fear Foul Play.
