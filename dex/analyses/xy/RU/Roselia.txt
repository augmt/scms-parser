Overview
########

With access to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, Roselia is one of the premier hazard setters for bulky teams in RU. It also has great special bulk, and its good defensive typing grants it resistances to common Water-, Electric-, Grass-, and Fighting-type attacks. An immunity to Toxic, the ability to absorb Toxic Spikes, and Natural Cure make facing Roselia a nightmare for defensive teams. However, due to a reliance on Eviolite for its bulk, Roselia needs to avoid switching into Knock Off, which makes its already poor physical bulk laughable. Roselia should not be used as a Spikes setter on offensive teams, as it is outclassed by both Omastar and Accelgor at this role.

Moves
========

Entry hazards are the only reason to use Roselia in RU, as it is otherwise outclassed by Amoonguss. Sludge Bomb is Roselia's most powerful STAB move and allows it to defeat threats weak to Poison, such as Aromatisse and Calm Mind Virizion, with ease. Giga Drain is useful for taking out Rhyperior and helps Roselia take on bulky Water-types such as Alomomola, Slowking, and Clawitzer. Toxic Spikes are helpful on stall teams, as they can wear down opponents much faster than Spikes alone can. Synthesis prevents Roselia from being worn down by weaker Pokemon throughout the match. On balanced teams, Sleep Powder is also a good choice for Roselia, incapacitating an opponent's Pokemon for a few turns, and giving it an opportunity to set up entry hazards. Rest is also an option in the last slot, to fully restore Roselia's health, as Roselia wakes up upon switching out.

Set Details
========

The given spread hits a jump point in Special Defense and avoids the 2HKO from Life Orb Clawitzer's Dark Pulse, though they often carry Ice Beam, and avoid the OHKO from Life Orb Virizion's +2 Stone Edge. HP is maximized to increase Roselia's overall bulk. Eviolite is the obvious item choice, further increasing Roselia's bulk to respectable levels.

Usage Tips
========

Roselia is capable of switching into many of RU's premier defensive Pokemon, including Alomomola, Amoonguss, Aromatisse, and Registeel, as it doesn't mind status and has good special bulk. Facing these defensive Pokemon gives Roselia the perfect opportunity to lay as many layers of Spikes as possible. If the opponent does not have a grounded Poison-type, laying Toxic Spikes first is preferred, as it wears down Rapid Spin users such as Hitmonlee and Hitmontop. Against more offensive teams, one layer of Toxic Spikes is often better than two, as they tend to have to switch a lot against defensive teams. Two layers of Toxic Spikes may be necessary against Alomomola and Slowking, as they are much harder to wear down. Against teams with Escavalier, don't spam Sleep Powder, as it has Overcoat and switches into Roselia with ease.

Team Options
========

Assault Vest Slowking is a good teammate for Roselia, as it is capable of taking on Fire-types such as Moltres, Delphox, and Emboar. Alomomola and Gligar are good teammates for Roselia, as they are both extremely physically bulky and can take on opposing Escavalier, Drapion, and Skuntank, which all cause trouble for Roselia. Either Aromatisse or Alomomola is mandatory if you lack Synthesis or Rest, as they can provide Wish support, which Roselia greatly appreciates. Rhyperior has excellent synergy with Roselia and provides Stealth Rock support. On balanced teams, Spikes support from Roselia can wear down many grounded walls that lack reliable recovery; as such, Swellow, Exploud, and Sharpedo appreciate the support provided by Roselia. Dugtrio can trap grounded Poison-types looking to soak up the Toxic Spikes that Roselia lays, as well as trap the Steel-types that are immune to them. Doublade and Spiritomb are both excellent teammates for Roselia, as they are capable of spinblocking the entry hazards it sets up.

Other Options
########

Roselia can choose to focus on either its Special Defense or Defense by running a 252 / 252 spread, but Roselia loses the capability to take on many threats in the metagame. Hidden Power Fire is also an option, as it can deter Pokemon like Doublade from setting up, and gets some chip damage on Escavalier, but Roselia is better off relying on teammates to take on Steel-types. Aromatherapy is another good support move that Roselia has access to, but it is already stretched for moveslots.

Checks & Counters
########

**Escavalier**: Escavalier switches into Roselia easily and threatens to Knock Off its teammates or hit them hard with a powerful STAB Megahorn.

**Grounded Poison-types**: Drapion and Skuntank soak up Toxic Spikes and can potentially Pursuit Roselia for a decent chunk of its health; Skuntank is also able to Defog away Roselia's Spikes.

**Fire-types**: Fire-types such as Delphox, Moltres, and Emboar threaten to muscle right past Roselia with their powerful STAB moves, but they must be cautious of switching into Sleep Powder.

**Psychic-types**: Meloetta, Cresselia, and Reuniclus can all set up Substitute and/or Calm Mind on Roselia, with the last two being immune to Roselia's hazards thanks to Levitate and Magic Guard, respectively.
