Overview
########

Hitmonlee has a number of assets that make it good. First, its access to High Jump Kick, which can be further boosted by Reckless, means it will hit very hard. The buff to Knock Off also helped Hitmonlee a lot, as it now has a way of hitting bulky Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon and allows Hitmonlee to cripple a lot of its switch-ins by removing their item. It has access to another great ability in the form of Unburden, which can make Hitmonlee work as a sweeper with doubled Speed. Mach Punch and Sucker Punch are two good priority moves that can help Hitmonlee sweep, and they're great for keeping Pokemon such as Sharpedo, Delphox, and Meloetta in check. However, Hitmonlee suffers from its somewhat middling base 87 Speed, meaning it's still outrun by faster Pokemon such as Moltres and Drapion. It's also got pitiful HP and Defense, but a surprisingly high Special Defense stat. Furthermore, as they can be crippled by Knock Off, some of Hitmonlee's counters, such as Aromatisse, Amoonguss, and Gligar, are common and don't fear a kick in the face.

Reckless
########
name: Reckless
move 1: High Jump Kick
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Mach Punch / Sucker Punch
move 4: Rapid Spin / Poison Jab / Stone Edge
ability: Reckless
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========
High Jump Kick is the kicker in this set because it's a very strong move that is further boosted by Reckless, meaning that it will badly hurt anything that doesn't resist it, including OHKOing Pokemon such as Druddigon and Escavalier. Knock Off, in tandem with High Jump Kick, gives great coverage against Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Reuniclus and Doublade. It also cripples a number of Pokemon such as Gligar, Doublade, and Golbat, removing their precious Eviolite. Mach Punch is a useful priority move that can revenge kill faster Pokemon that otherwise would threaten offensive teams, such as Sharpedo and weakened Cobalion. On the other hand, Sucker Punch is a stronger priority move that can take down Delphox and hit a few other targets that Hitmonlee otherwise can't touch, such as Fletchinder. Sucker Punch can be easily exploited, however, and Hitmonlee will miss out on revenge killing Sharpedo. In the 4th slot, the choice depends on the rest of the team. Rapid Spin can be used if the team lacks a way to get rid of entry hazards, but Poison Jab is Hitmonlee's only way of getting past Fairy-types such as Aromatisse and Whimsicott, 2HKOing the former and OHKOing the latter. Finally, Stone Edge is a move that can be used to hit Hitmonlee's checks and counters such as offensive Moltres on the switch, and KOing Golbat after Knock Off and OHKOing defensive Moltres.

Set Details
========
A spread of 252 Attack and Speed is used here to maximize both Attack and Speed, with the 4 leftover EVs dumped into Defense. The choice of nature comes down to preference. Adamant gives a little kick to Hitmonlee's attacks, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon it otherwise couldn't, but Jolly lets it outspeed positive nature base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Gallade, Kabutops, and Braviary, and also outspeed Timid Rotom-C and opposing Hitmonlee. Life Orb is used to maximize Hitmonlee's damage output.

Usage Tips
========
Use Rapid Spin whenever it is needed. If the opponent has a Ghost-type, then some prediction with Knock Off is required. Knock Off itself is a spammable move, so don't hesitate to spam it early on as it has no drawbacks. Additionally, a lot of Hitmonlee's checks and counters, such as Gligar, Golbat, and Aromatisse, don't like having their item removed. Use Mach Punch to revenge weakened targets such as Sharpedo lacking priority and Cobalion. Don't use High Jump Kick too much, as some Pokemon might carry Protect and the recoil would backfire. Before using it, make sure that the opponent lacks Protect or a Ghost-type Pokemon. Finally, use High Jump Kick to break down walls.

Team Options
========
Hitmonlee appreciates entry hazards to help it break down walls. For that reason, Qwilfish, Accelgor, and Omastar are good partners to set up Spikes and, in the latter's case, Stealth Rock. Rhyperior and Druddigon are good setters of Stealth Rock, and Druddigon can lure and KO Aromatisse, a counter to Hitmonlee, with Gunk Shot. Doublade is a good answer for Aromatisse and can check Amoonguss. Grass-types that can counter Alomomola are also appreciated; examples of those include Rotom-C and Tangrowth. Steel-types such as Escavalier and, to an extent, Durant can deal with Fairy-types. Offensive Trick Room Reuniclus can deal with Poison-types and clean up after Hitmonlee has weakened some walls. Assault Vest Slowking is a good offensive pivot to pair with Hitmonlee for its ability to switch into Moltres, Gligar, and Golbat, which are counters to Hitmonlee.

In general, Hitmonlee is good to pair up with another Fighting-type Pokemon for its ability to weaken their common checks and counters such as Doublade and Aromatisse, with Knock Off and Poison Jab, respectively, then allow its partner to sweep. The same goes for the other Fighting-type, as it can weaken said counters for Hitmonlee to continue sweeping afterwards. For this reason, pairing it with Fighting-types such as Virizion, Cobalion, Gallade, and Sawk is a good option. And finally, VoltTurn cores can work well with Hitmonlee to bring it in safely. Moltres with U-turn can lure Slowking and allow Hitmonlee to KO it with Knock Off or cripple the incoming switch-in. Swellow and Braviary both lure Registeel and Rhyperior and then U-turn into Hitmonlee for High Jump Kick to KO them.

Unburden
########
name: Unburden
move 1: Endure
move 2: Reversal
move 3: Knock Off
move 4: Mach Punch
ability: Unburden
item: Liechi Berry
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========
Endure is used to get Hitmonlee to 1 HP, maximizing Reversal's Base Power and activating Liechi Berry. Reversal is Hitmonlee's strongest STAB move which hits a lot of Pokemon very hard. Knock Off gives it good coverage along with Reversal to hit things it otherwise can't, such as Slowking, Cofagrigus, Banette, and Jellicent. Mach Punch gives Hitmonlee its own priority to outspeed opposing priority users such as Aqua Jet Sharpedo and hit him before he is able to hit you, after Unburden's activation. Close Combat is an option to use over Reversal for its guaranteed power, but it's a lot weaker than a Reversal at 1 HP. Stone Edge can also be used to KO counters such as Moltres.

Set Details
========
Adamant with 252 Attack EVs gives Hitmonlee maximum power, as with Unburden doubling Hitmonlee's Speed, it doesn't need to use Jolly. Liechi Berry gives Hitmonlee a kick in power, boosting its Attack by +1, and works perfectly combined with Unburden and Endure, allowing it to sweep with +1 Atk and +2 Spe, which lets it outrun the entire tier.

Usage Tips
========
This is a late-game sweeper, so play with it accordingly. This isn't a wallbreaker, so don't bring it in early-game; instead, save it for late-game, when Pokemon such as Moltres and potentially fast priority users are taken down. Occasionally, Abomasnow and Hippopotas's respective weather conditions can hinder Hitmonlee's sweep, picking it off with their weather's residual damage when it is at 1 HP, so make sure those are taken down before Hitmonlee is sent out. Likewise, make sure that Hitmonlee's checks and counters are weakened. Use Mach Punch when the opponent's Pokemon might carry priority and has low enough HP for it to KO.

Team Options
========
Stealth Rock users and hazard setters in general are good to pair up with Hitmonlee. Omastar, Qwilfish, and Accelgor can all set up Spikes and, in Omastar's case, Stealth Rock as well. Druddigon and Rhyperior can reliably set up Stealth Rock, and Druddigon can also lure Aromatisse and KO it with Gunk Shot. Strong wallbreakers are appreciated to weaken walls for Hitmonlee to sweep afterwards. Life Orb Druddigon, Delphox, and Moltres are all good wallbreakers to pair up with Hitmonlee, especially because the former can lure Aromatisse and the latter two can KO Amoonguss.

In general, Hitmonlee pairs well with Fighting-types such as Gallade, Virizion, and Cobalion as they lure in the same checks and counters. Additionally, Reuniclus and Psychic-types in general are good teammates for Hitmonlee for their ability to easily KO Poison-types. Fletchinder can clean up after Hitmonlee with Acrobatics.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: High Jump Kick
move 2: Knock Off
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Close Combat / Rapid Spin
ability: Reckless
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========
High Jump Kick still hits ridiculously hard without Life Orb, and is the strongest STAB Hitmonlee has access to. Knock Off is a good spammable move that's an annoyance to most Pokemon that switch into Hitmonlee; Knock Off also allows Hitmonlee to have a way to hit Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon, as well as to revenge kill some threats such as Delphox. Stone Edge is useful for picking off Moltres, as well as hitting Golbat. In the last slot, Close Combat can be used as a reliable STAB move without High Jump Kick's chance of missing, which makes cleaning up easier. Rapid Spin can be used if no other Pokemon on the team can clear hazards, but it's generally inferior because Hitmonlee can't switch moves and therefore has a hard time getting past spinblockers if you predict poorly, and being locked into Rapid Spin isn't a good thing as it can be easily exploited.

Set Details
========
Choice Scarf is used to boost Hitmonlee's somewhat lacking Speed, turning it into a very strong revenge killer that can outpace Jolteon, the fastest relevant threat, with an Adamant nature. The choice between Adamant and Jolly comes down to personal preference regarding whether more power or Speed is desired. With Jolly, Hitmonlee can outspeed positive nature base 80 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Braviary, but Adamant gives Hitmonlee more power.

Usage Tips
========
This particular set is better used late-game to clean up once the opponent's team has been weakened. That doesn't mean it can't come in early- or mid-game to revenge kill opponents, however, as it can definitely do that. Spamming High Jump Kick isn't preferred, as the opponent might carry Protect or switch out to a Ghost-type Pokemon, so make sure there are no Protect users or Ghost-types to ruin Hitmonlee's day. Knock Off is a good move to spam and cripple incoming checks and counters, and so is Close Combat if you choose that in the final slot. Don't use Rapid Spin recklessly. Only do so against targets Hitmonlee forces out, and don't do it when a Ghost-type remains in reserve on the opponent's team.

Team Options
========
Hazards are almost mandatory for Hitmonlee. Accelgor, Qwilfish, and Omastar can set up Spikes and, in the latter's case, Stealth Rock as well. Rhyperior, Cobalion, and Druddigon are all good Stealth Rock setters, and Druddigon can even lure and KO Aromatisse with Gunk Shot. Strong Psychic-types such as Choice Specs Meloetta, Delphox, and Reuniclus can easily take out Poison-types, and are good wallbreakers to pair with Hitmonlee in general. Wallbreakers and sweepers that Hitmonlee can clean up after are also good; Life Orb Druddigon, Swords Dance Cobalion, Swords Dance Virizion, Choice Band Gallade, and Choice Band Sawk are all good at this, especially the Fighting-type Pokemon as they share the same checks and counters with Hitmonlee and can weaken them for it to sweep, and vice versa. Additionally, Pokemon that can take care of Alomomola are good, as Hitmonlee doesn't have the power to muscle through it. Rotom-C, Jolteon, Heliolisk, and Magneton can all do a good job at disposing of Alomomola. Finally, Moltres is a strong special attacker that can dispose of the physical walls that can switch in on Hitmonlee, such as Gligar and Amoonguss.

Other Options
########
There aren't really many other options to use on Hitmonlee. It can use a Choice Band set, but the little extra power over Life Orb isn't worth being locked into one move, especially because Hitmonlee can require some prediction with using Knock Off or a coverage move. The Fake Out Normal Gem set might sound appealing, but it is inferior to the Endure set as it's weaker, and wasting a moveslot on Fake Out isn't good. Additionally, Hitmonlee can run some other coverage moves on the Reckless set such as Earthquake, which hits some Poison-type Pokemon harder than its other moves, but the aforementioned Poison-types are rare and generally not worth the moveslot. Blaze Kick can be used to 2HKO Amoonguss, but Hitmonlee generally doesn't have an empty slot for it. Double-Edge is a way to let Hitmonlee hit both Aromatisse and Amoonguss with one move, and is also Hitmonlee's only way of damaging Gligar significantly, but Hitmonlee weakens itself very quickly with the recoil.

Checks &amp;amp; Counters
########
**Bulky Fighting-type Resists**: Although they do not enjoy Knock Off, physically defensive Aromatisse and Amoonguss can switch in on any move Hitmonlee has and threaten it with Moonblast or Spore and Giga Drain, respectively. Gligar and Golbat are crippled by Knock Off, but even then, they still fully counter Hitmonlee, with only Golbat having to fear Stone Edge.

**Doublade and Spiritomb**: They both prevent Rapid Spin, can take a Knock Off or two, are immune to High Jump Kick, and the former threatens to 2HKO with Shadow Sneak while the latter can burn with Will-O-Wisp.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon that can take a Mach Punch can get rid of Hitmonlee most of the time. Moltres can switch in on any move other than Stone Edge, KO Hitmonlee, and then Roost the damage back up. Dugtrio can revenge kill Hitmonlee and trap it.

**Priority**: Fletchinder has priority Acrobatics that can instantly KO Hitmonlee. Aqua Jet Sharpedo can prevent Hitmonlee from revenge killing it with Mach Punch.
