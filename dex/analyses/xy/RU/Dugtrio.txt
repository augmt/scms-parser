Overview
########

Despite its paltry stats other than Speed, Dugtrio has a niche in the RU metagame thanks to its Arena Trap ability, which lets it remove troublesome walls for offensive Pokemon. However, Dugtrio is really frail and not that strong, meaning that it can trap and kill opposing Pokemon only if they are weak to Ground or have a lackluster Defense stat. Furthermore, Arena Trap is negated by Pokemon that have Ghost or Flying typing or a different form of Ground immunity such as Levitate, giving the opponent time to switch to a Pokemon that can take advantage of Dugtrio.

Moves
========

Earthquake is a decently powerful STAB move, capable of at least 2HKOing most offensive Pokemon. It also does major damage to one of Dugtrio's main targets, Registeel. Stone Edge has good coverage alongside Earthquake and hits the Flying-types that avoid Arena Trap. Sucker Punch is a dangerous move to be locked into, but it is relatively reliable on Dugtrio, as the opponent can't switch out against it. Memento can give a free setup opportunity to a sweeper like Virizion or Cobalion and is particularly effective with Arena Trap. Stealth Rock is another good option for the last slot if your team doesn't have another user of the move, and Dugtrio can use it quite well with its high Speed. Substitute lets Dugtrio dodge Sucker Punch from Pokemon such as Skuntank and Druddigon and is useful when Dugtrio is trapping a Choice-locked Electric-type such as Jolteon. Toxic is Dugtrio's best move to hit Alomomola, but it does not have many other uses and pairs poorly with Choice Band. Aerial Ace is a decent option if your team has trouble with Virizion, but it should be used only with Life Orb, as it is easily taken advantage of.

Set Details
========

Life Orb is the best so that Dugtrio isn't easily taken advantage of after having trapped a threat. Choice Band is also viable as it lets Dugtrio trap Registeel more reliably, and it works well because Dugtrio doesn't have to predict switches; on the other hand, They both boost Dugtrio's Attack to decent levels, allowing it to 2HKO Registeel, specially defensive Aromatisse, and offensive Pokemon such as Meloetta. Attack and Speed are maximized to increase Dugtrio's offensive potential, as it can't take hits regardless of its defensive investment. A Jolly nature is used to let Dugtrio outspeed targets such as Cobalion, Virizion, and Cinccino, but an Adamant nature is usable with Sticky Web support.

Usage Tips
========

No prediction is required when using Dugtrio, so just use the strongest move against your target. Dugtrio should only be brought in with a slow U-turn or with a double switch, as it can't directly take hits. The only exception is Registeel, on which you can come in on Thunder Wave or Seismic Toss quite easily and 2HKO it. In any case, remember that bulky targets such as Rhyperior and Registeel should be weakened before Dugtrio attempts to trap them.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that are walled by Registeel, such as Meloetta and Exploud, are good partners. Durant also appreciates Dugtrio's ability to remove Registeel, as it does not have to use Superpower. Vivillon can put its strongest checks, Rhyperior and Registeel, to sleep so that Dugtrio can freely switch in on them and weaken them to Hurricane's KO range. Dugtrio can also heavily damage Escavalier for Vivillon. Slow U-turn and Volt Switch users like Eelektross and Gligar can bring in Dugtrio for free and weaken the opponent so that it can be trapped easily. Life Orb Moltres is a fantastic partner, as it can hit Slowking with U-turn on the switch, bringing it to Earthquake's KO range. Dugtrio can also severely weaken Rhyperior to the point where it can't take STAB moves from strong Flying-types such as Braviary, Swellow, and Moltres. Fletchinder appreciates Dugtrio weakening Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-types so that it can more easily clean with Acrobatics late-game, while it can give Dugtrio more freedom to switch in, thanks to Will-O-Wisp. Sharpedo struggles with Virizion and Cobalion, and Dugtrio can weaken or outright kill them. Other notable Dugtrio targets are Delphox and Drapion, so, Pokemon walled by them, such as Sigilyph, are good partners.

Other Options
########

Dugtrio can also opt to use a Focus Sash set with moves such as Endure and Reversal, but those sets are pitifully weak and Dugtrio misses the 2HKO on Registeel without a boosting item. Hone Claws is Dugtrio's only boosting move and can be useful if Dugtrio is up against a Choice-locked Electric-type. Other moves such as Night Slash, Rock Slide, and Final Gambit can be useful in certain situations but are outclassed most of the time, and Dugtrio struggles to find a moveslot for them anyway.

Checks & Counters
########

**Pokemon immune to Arena Trap**: While they can't switch in if Dugtrio is up against a grounded Pokemon, Flying- and Ghost-types and Levitate users are the best Pok√©mon to be brought out after Dugtrio has trapped something, as they are immune to Arena Trap and can freely switch out. Cofagrigus, Weezing, and Bronzong can set up entry hazards on it while taking next to no damage from its moves, and Cresselia can also start setting up with Calm Mind.

**Bulky Pokemon**: Bulky Pokemon that are not weak to Earthquake don't take too much damage from anything Dugtrio can throw at them and can kill it or set up. Examples include Alomomola, Amoonguss, and Reuniclus.

**Priority Moves**: Moderately strong priority moves from the likes of Skuntank, Spiritomb, Fletchinder, and Hitmonlee are enough to revenge kill Dugtrio if it doesn't have Focus Sash or a Substitute up.
