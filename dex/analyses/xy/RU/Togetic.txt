Overview
########

Togetic gained a Fairy typing this generation, a huge upgrade from Normal-type. Its new Fairy typing enable it to check Dragon-types such as Druddigon and synergize with its teammates more easily. With Eviolite, Togetic becomes a great defensive Pokemon, especially with its already good 55 / 85 / 105 bulk. One key niche to using Togetic is its access to both Nasty Plot and Baton Pass, which enables it to quickly pass boosts to a teammate. Moreover, Togetic has Roost has to keep it healthy throughout the match, allowing it to pass boost multiple times. Although it's not very powerful, at +2, its attacks pack quite a punch. Togetic's low Speed may appear to be a negative trait; however, this is not the case when Baton Passing because it ensures Togetic can almost always bring in a teammate safely. Despite these positive traits, Togetic is majorly reliant on Eviolite, meaning that Knock Off or Trick completely compromises its bulk. Togetic does not have enough moves to fit everything it wants to, giving it major four-moveslot syndrome. Finally, some more powerful attacks such as Jolteon's Thunderbolt are a real pain in Togetic's side.

NastyPass
########
name: NastyPass
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Roost
move 4: Fire Blast
ability: Serene Grace
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 240 Def / 20 SpA
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Nasty Plot is often used alongside Baton Pass to boost Special Attack and pass the boost to a teammate, and Togetic's bulk makes it a very reliable choice for this role. It's important to note that the two moves do not always have to be used together; Baton Pass can be used simply to gain momentum. Roost is Togetic's method of regaining health lost from Stealth Rock or throughout the match, which enables it to boost and pass repeatedly. Fire Blast is important because it OHKOes Doublade at +2, and also hitting Steel-types in general. Dazzling Gleam may appear to be a good STAB option; however, it's not very strong and does not have any use other than hitting Dragon-types. Defog could be squeezed onto the set, but this is often unwise because Togetic will not be able to pull all of its roles off and will prove to be very ineffective.

Set Details
========

Maximum Defense investment allows Togetic to stomach powerful physical hits such as Hitmonlee's High Jump Kick. Running 20 Special Attack EVs enables Togetic to OHKO Doublade with a +2 Fire Blast, which would otherwise setup a Swords Dance on Togetic or simply Iron Head it. A Relaxed nature could be chosen to ensure Togetic is as slow as possible to almost always Baton Pass safely to a teammate; although Speed tying with Doublade is quite important. Eviolite is the chosen item for the large boosts to Togetic's defenses; although one might think Leftovers is a viable option for passive recovery, this is often unwise because Togetic loses its great bulk by doing so. Serene Grace is chosen merely because of the off chance that Fire Blast will burn, which can come in handy in some instances. Super Luck is usable to help beat Calm Mind users; however, Serene Grace's small perk is usually more useful.

Usage Tips
========

When the opponent has powerful special walls such as Aromatisse or Lickilicky, it's often best to wait until they are weakened before attempting to set up and pass. Generally, waiting until you find a golden opportunity to sweep is best, such as when the opponent's team has been worn down through entry hazard damage. Roost keeps Togetic alive; however, it does have limited PP, so always save it until Togetic is below half HP. Togetic absolutely resents status, especially Toxic, and is thus best kept away from any status users. Fire Blast is usually not going to be used often, as it should only be used on Doublade and other Steel-types or to break the Substitute of a Pokemon trying to set up alongside Togetic. It's definitely useful to note that Pokemon such as Delphox and Meloetta that resist Fire Blast or have great special bulk and commonly carry Substitute must be accounted for as well.

Team Options
========

Pretty much all special attackers enjoy the boosts Togetic provides with Nasty Plot; some special attackers that work well are Sharpedo and Jolteon, which both have great Speed and the power to abuse Nasty Plot to its fullest. Sharpedo in particular stands out because of its high powered coverage and the gradual boosts provided by Speed Boost. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Hitmonlee or Gligar is nearly mandatory because of Togetic's Stealth Rock weakness compounded with the fact that it will be switching a lot to pass. Meloetta is a good partner because of its access to Heal Bell to cure Togetic from Toxic, and it enjoys the sponging of strong Dragon-type attacks. Lanturn is also neat because it can pivot with Volt Switch and also has access to Heal Bell. Dual screens support from Cresselia can make Togetic nearly untouchable and aids greatly in setting up Nasty Plot.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Seismic Toss / Dazzling Gleam
move 2: Roost
move 3: Defog
move 4: Heal Bell / Thunder Wave / Toxic
ability: Serene Grace
item: Eviolite
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Seismic Toss does consistent 100 HP damage, while Dazzling Gleam has coverage and STAB but is somewhat weak. Roost is mandatory to keep Togetic healthy throughout the match and, when used with Heal Bell, can be used to stall out Alomomola. Defog provides team support by removing pesky entry hazards, three of which Togetic is immune to. Heal Bell keeps Togetic free of Toxic and keeps its teammates healthy as well. Toxic is able to cripple defensive threats such as Alomomola and puts offensive threats on a timer. Thunder Wave is more useful versus offensive threats, cutting their Speed in half. Flamethrower is an option over Dazzling Gleam for Steel-types, although Seismic Toss is usually better, and Flamethrower is fairly weak.

Set Details
========

Maximum Defense investment is used to allow Togetic to wall physical attackers, although a specially defensive EV spread can be used thanks to Togetic's naturally high Special Defense. 248 HP EVs are run instead of 252 HP EVs to ensure Togetic can switch into Stealth Rock four times instead of three. Eviolite is always the chosen item for the great boosts it provides to Togetic's bulk, the whole reason it's a viable wall. Serene Grace is the chosen ability because if Togetic is running Flamethrower, it has a slightly higher chance to net a burn; although when it is not running Flamethrower, it doesn't have much use, though Super Luck is unfortunately illegal with Defog.

Usage Tips
========

Togetic is great at walling Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee thanks to its 4x resistance to their STAB moves. This set is fairly simple. Using Roost only when below 50% HP is advised, as it has limited PP. The decision between Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Heal Bell is a tricky one, but it all comes down to what your team needs. Most importantly, though, keep Togetic away from Knock Off, which severely lowers its bulk. It's also important to note that using Defog can be a bit risky at times because Defiant users, most notably Braviary, can come in on the Defog and receive a free Attack boost.

Team Options
========

Steel-types such as Doublade and Cobalion have fantastic synergy with Togetic thanks to their ability to wall powerful Ice-types in exchange for Togetic's nice ability to take on threatening Ground-types. Gastrodon makes a neat defensive partner thanks to the two's synergy. Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock such as Moltres enjoy Togetic's ability to remove that entry hazard. Powerful and slow Pokemon make for good partners if Togetic is running Thunder Wave, as it can spread paralysis to slow down the opposition.

Other Options
########

Wish can be considered thanks to its ability to heal teammates; however, Alomomola and Aromatisse often outclass Togetic in Wish passing because of their higher HP and Roost is generally more reliable for recovery. An option that is somewhat viable on both sets is Encore, locking the opponent into a hopefully unfavorable move for Togetic's or its teammates to take advantage of. To take advantage of Serene Grace, Tri Attack is an option, although it's unreliable and weak. Similarly, Ancient Power is an option thanks to the occasional boost to all stats; however, this should never be counted on, and the move is fairly weak otherwise. Shadow Ball is an option for all-around coverage and provides a means of hitting Delphox. Finally, Calm Mind can be used over Nasty Plot, but Nasty Plot is often better thanks to its larger boost.

Checks & Counters
########

**Knock Off**: Knock Off is a hindrance to Togetic because Eviolite is the whole reason that Togetic should be used, and removing it makes Togetic's bulk mediocre. It should be noted, however, that many Knock Off users aren't able to KO Togetic thanks to its resistance to Knock Off.

**Electric-types**: Electric-types, namely Jolteon, have especially powerful Thunderbolts that can do a bunch to Togetic regardless of its bulk. Most Electric-types shrug off Fire Blast as well, even when boosted.

**Substitute**: Substitute is a problem because Togetic is far too weak to break any Substitute. Substitute also shields the user from Toxic or Thunder Wave and eases setup tremendously.

**Toxic**: Toxic sets Togetic on a timer, and due to its lack of Leftovers, it will be quickly worn down. Toxic also grows stronger and will KO Togetic eventually, although running Heal Bell makes Toxic not as much as a problem as it would otherwise be.

**Rhyperior**: Rhyperior gains a special mention because of its ability to break down Togetic with Rock Blast or simply Roar it away, removing its boosts while shrugging off any attack thrown at it.
