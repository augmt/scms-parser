Overview
########

Mr. Mime has high Special Attack and Special Defense stats, a high Speed stat that allows it to outspeed Hitmonlee, a great ability in Soundproof which allows Mr. Mime to check Exploud, as well as an amazing support option in Healing Wish, which allows Mr. Mime to fully heal a teammate. Mr. Mime's new Fairy typing this generation gives it an immunity to Dragon Tail, as well as a neutrality to Bug- and Dark-type attacks.

However, Mr. Mime faces enormous competition from Mesprit as a Healing Wish user due to Mesprit's better stats and access to Stealth Rock, whereas Mr. Mime only has a higher Speed stat and Soundproof. Mr. Mime's great Special Defense stat is easily offset by Mr. Mime's horrid base 40 HP stat, which means most powerful attacks can power through it. Mr. Mime's pathetic Defense stat also stops it from handling any physical attack well, and even priority attacks can deal a decent chunk of damage. These low stats stop Mr. Mime from being able to switch into many attacks and limit Mr. Mime from using its support options, such as Calm Mind, Nasty Plot, and Baton Pass, to their full extent.

Healing Wish
########
name: Healing Wish
move 1: Healing Wish
move 2: Dazzling Gleam
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Focus Blast
ability: Soundproof
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Healing Wish provides the invaluable support of being able to heal up a completely weakened teammate at the expense of Mr. Mime's life. Dazzling Gleam is Mr. Mime's main STAB attack and hits prominent targets in the tier such as Virizion and Druddigon. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types such as Banette, while Focus Blast hits Steel-types such as Registeel. Combined, these moves provide perfect coverage. However, Mr. Mime also has other tricks up its sleeve. Encore is great at forcing switches and crippling setup sweepers. Mr. Mime can opt for Psychic over Dazzling Gleam to hit Amoonguss and Golbat and serve as a stronger STAB attack.

Set Details
========

Mr. Mime's EV spread maximizes both Special Attack and Speed so that it can pose an offensive threat as well as provide Healing Wish's recovery support. Life Orb increases the damage output of Mr. Mime's attacks. Soundproof is the best ability choice for Mr. Mime, as it allows Mr. Mime to force out most variants of Exploud, and switch into Pyroar's Hyper Voice, Swellow's Boomburst, and Chatot's Boomburst.

Usage Tips
========

Healing Wish, while a great move, should not be used recklessly. Always remember that Healing Wish causes Mr. Mime to faint, giving you one less Pokemon. Also, Healing Wish should be used to heal weakened late-game cleaners rather than bulkier Pokemon, which usually have recovery. While Mr. Mime does mainly fulfill a support role, it still functions as a very good wallbreaker due to its high Special Attack stat and Life Orb. Mr. Mime also can be used to counter Exploud, an ability which is valuable for most hyper offense teams.

Team Options
========

Mr. Mime finds a good place on hyper offense teams that value its ability to check Exploud. Fletchinder can burn physical attackers that threaten Mr. Mime and can also take advantage of Healing Wish. Doublade and Virizion can both opt for the recovery from Healing Wish, as the former has no form of it and the latter has no space for it. Late-game cleaners that double as wallbreakers, such as Meloetta-P, can take advantage of Mr. Mime's Healing Wish support. Sharpedo makes for a great partner as it is amazing at late-game cleaning and can take huge advantage of Healing Wish. As a bonus, Mr. Mime can also sponge Mach Punch for Sharpedo. Bulk Up Combusken is a good partner, as it can Baton Pass Defense and Speed boosts, allowing Mr. Mime to sponge priority a bit better and outspeed some threats. Pokemon such as Emboar and Moltres that can eliminate Steel-types neutral to Focus Blast, such as Escavalier, make great partners.

Other Options
########

Mr. Mime has many options in its arsenal. Mr. Mime's classic Baton Pass set with Substitute and Nasty Plot can be used, as well as an offensively based Nasty Plot set with Baton Pass as a last resort; both aren't amazing, however, due to Mr. Mime's poor HP and Defense stats. Mr. Mime's access to Trick allows it to cripple Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Doublade, but it is outclassed by Delphox, which is a faster, more powerful user of the move. Magic Coat can bounce back Taunt and entry hazards. Dual screens can be used for team support, but Mr. Mime's defenses are still only passable on the physical side, and Mr. Mime doesn't find many opportunities to set these up, as well as being outclassed in general as a user of these moves by Uxie and Cresselia. Psyshock is a reliable STAB move that can be used to hit physical walls hard, but Psychic is a better Psychic-type STAB move in general. Thunder Wave can cripple quicker Pokemon. Thunderbolt hits Flying- and Water-types decently hard. Hypnosis and Confuse Ray both have their merits, but the former has terrible accuracy and the latter is unreliable. Calm Mind can be used to boost Mr. Mime's Special Attack and Special Defense.

Checks & Counters
########

**Steel-types**: Registeel, Escavalier, Durant, and Doublade can all take Mr. Mime's attacks well and easily OHKO back.

**Powerful Physical Attackers**: Physical attackers such as Rhyperior, Braviary, Coballion, Emboar, and Sharpedo can easily OHKO Mr. Mime with their STAB moves.

**Taunt**: Faster Taunts from Drapion and Mega Banette keep Mr. Mime from making use of its main niche, Healing Wish.
