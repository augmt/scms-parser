Overview
########

Mightyena is a Pokemon often considered to be terrible by most players; however, this is not the case. Thanks to its ability, Moxie, Mightyena has a respectable Attack stat after KOing an enemy. Furthermore, Mightyena gets good coverage with its STAB moves and Play Rough. It also has a strong priority STAB move in Sucker Punch, which mitigates its lacking Speed.

However, Mightyena has its fair share of flaws as well. It does not have very good bulk at all, meaning it can't even take neutral hits. Mightyena also has an average Attack stat, meaning it struggles to take down bulkier Pokemon before a Moxie boost. Outside of its STAB moves, it also has a very tiny movepool with few options. Mightyena also has to compete with other Dark-type Pokemon such as Sharpedo and Zoroark. This, when compounded with its low Speed stat and lack of opportunities to switch in, gives Mightyena a rough time in RU.

Life Orb Attacker
########
name: Life Orb Attacker
move 1: Crunch
move 2: Sucker Punch
move 3: Play Rough / Iron Tail
move 4: Fire Fang
ability: Moxie
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Crunch is Mightyena's main STAB move as it has respectable Base Power and is very reliable. Sucker Punch mitigates Mightyena's low Speed stat and can pick off weakened foes after a Moxie boost. Play Rough gets great coverage alongside Mightyena's Dark-type STAB moves and hits Fighting-types that attempt to switch in, along with Dragon-types such as Druddigon, though Iron Tail can be used instead of Play Rough to hit Fairy-types like Aromatisse while also hitting Rhyperior. Fire Fang breaks through bulkier Steel- and Grass-types and has nice coverage all around.

Set Details
========

The listed EVs give Mightyena maximum offensive potential. Adamant is the preferred nature of choice over Jolly because Mightyena is quite weak and needs as much power as it can get. Life Orb adds to this, making Mightyena much more powerful with the ability to switch moves. Expert Belt can be used to bluff a choice item, but the power loss is very noticeable. In a similar vein, Black Glasses can be used so that Mightyena does not have to take Life Orb recoil and also boosts its Dark-type STAB moves.

Usage Tips
========

Mightyena is best saved for late-game after the opponent's team has been weakened, and should not try to sweep early game. Mightyena has to watch out for priority, as it does not have the bulk to survive many attacks. Bulkier Pokemon must be weakened before Mightyena is sent out so it can sweep later on. Be wary when using Sucker Punch because if the opponent predicts Mightyena is using it, it gives them a free turn.

Team Options
========

Wallbreakers make for good partners because they can soften the opponent's team; such wallbreakers include Choice Specs Delphox. Mightyena greatly struggles against bulky Fairy-types like Aromatisse, so ensure that they are removed with a partner such as Escavalier. Cleric support is needed as Mightyena is very prone to status, making Aromatisse a good partner that can also pass Wishes to keep Mightyena healthy. Fairy-types, in general, synergize well, as they can handle Fighting-types for Mightyena. Hazard support is needed as this greatly aids in wearing down bulkier teams; thus, Rhyperior and Crustle are good partners.

Other Options
########

Substitute can be used to give Mightyena an immunity to status and somewhat mitigates its reliance on Sucker Punch; it also makes up for Mightyena's bulk issues. Howl is Mightyena's only way to boost its Attack outside of Moxie, but Mightyena lacks the bulk to properly utilize it. Ice Fang can be used as a coverage option, but it doesn't hit much more than what's already listed on the set. Finally, Taunt is an option, although Mightyena is too slow and not bulky enough to make use of it.

Checks & Counters
########

**Fairy-types**: Fairy-types resist Mightyena's STAB moves, while in return, their own STAB moves are super effective against Mightyena. Most Fairy-types are also bulky, and Mightyena struggles to break through them if lacking Iron Tail.

**Physically Bulky Pokemon**: Because Mightyena has an average Attack stat, Pokemon with high Defense stats can switch in with ease; such Pokemon include Rhyperior, Alomomola, and Gligar.

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types can easily KO Mightyena with their STAB moves, while resisting Mightyena's STAB moves. However, they must be wary of Play Rough.

**Priority**: Priority from the likes of Sharpedo, Hitmonlee, and Fletchinder gives Mightyena a hard time because of its lack of bulk.
