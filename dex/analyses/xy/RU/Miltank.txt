Overview
########

Miltank is often overlooked in RU due to its stats being relatively low compared to the rest of the tier. Furthermore, it has been burdened with a rather small movepool, and although it was blessed with three great abilities to choose from, Miltank can only afford to run one in RU as it would be sacrificing its main role in the tier if it ran either of its other two abilities. If you look past the resistances provided by Thick Fat, Miltank's typing really is a double-edged sword, giving it only one weakness and an immunity, but at the cost of having no resistances. However, it does have a few redeeming qualities that make it good in RU. Firstly, Thick Fat makes it one of the few reliable checks to Delphox in the tier: a niche which is further augmented by its access to reliable recovery in Milk Drink. On the subject of Milk Drink, Miltank has a few supportive gems hidden away within its small movepool in the forms of Heal Bell and Thunder Wave; these give it a unique supportive niche which it only shares with Lanturn. Finally, its stats are certainly not unreasonable to use, giving it decent bulk and very high Speed, being the fastest uninvested wall in the tier. Although Miltank does have its flaws, it has a few redeeming qualities; therefore it should always be considered if you need a check for Delphox that you can rely on.

Moves
========

Heal Bell is arguably the best move that Miltank has in its arsenal, letting it heal itself and its teammates of detrimental burns, paralysis, and poisoning. Thunder Wave lets it cripple faster threats such as Choice Specs Yanmega and Hitmonlee on the switch-in and makes it easier for Miltank's teammates to deal with them. It also helps slower, bulkier sweepers to deal heavy damage to the opposing team. Seismic Toss gives Miltank a way to deal consistent damage to the opposing Pokemon. Milk Drink is a pre-requisite for Miltank as it lets it recover HP and continue supporting its team. Earthquake can be used over Seismic Toss to score a 2HKO on Delphox and to hit most Steel-types harder; however, Miltank really misses the consistent damage that Seismic Toss provides, it doesn't hit anything else notable. Ironically, Seismic Toss does more damage on average to Registeel and Bronzong, the latter of which is completely immune to Earthquake. Toxic can be used over Thunder Wave, but Miltank has difficulty sacrificing it for Toxic as it needs Thunder Wave to cripple Delphox. Finally, Stealth Rock can be used if your team lacks an entry hazard setter, but Miltank struggles to set it up multiple times throughout a match&mdash;something which is needed more than ever since the Defog buff&mdash;and is outclassed by other Pokemon with more resistances in the role of hazard setting.

Set Details
========

The EVs are simple: maxed out Special Defense to help check Delphox. A Calm nature boosts Miltank's Special Defense even further and reduces the damage dealt by Foul Play and rare confusion. Thick Fat helps check Delphox by giving Miltank a resistance to Fire-type moves, and Leftovers gives it the passive healing to increase its longevity; the recovery provided will often make the difference between Miltank fainting or retaining consciousness and restoring HP with Milk Drink.

Usage Tips
========

When using Miltank, always be aware of the situation in the battle and make sure that you know when it needs to be brought in. It can't afford to come in too many times if it doesn't need to. Make sure to use Heal Bell sparingly, and only use it when it is absolutely required as it is a big momentum-killer. Finally, you need to keep Miltank as healthy as possible; it needs to retain its ability to check Delphox and Jynx reliably, and it can't do that at low health. This means that you should use Milk Drink as often as possible, try to keep hazards off the field while clearing poison, burn, and Leech Seed with a well-predicted Heal Bell or switch, but not waiting any more than two or three turns at the most to do so in the case of status and Leech Seed.

Team Options
========

Miltank tends to work best on more defensive and bulky offensive teams, so make sure to build accordingly if you decide to use it. Defensive Pokemon that are weak to status, such as Alomomola and Weezing, appreciate the Heal Bell support. Steel-types like Ferroseed, Registeel, and Bronzong have good defensive synergy with Miltank, although all notable ones except for Doublade and Bronzong are weak to Fighting-type moves. As such, Ghost-types and bulky Pokemon resistant to Fighting-type attacks, such as Reuniclus, Banette, and Doublade, are great partners. Rapid Spin users such as Hitmontop and users of Defog such as Gligar, Golbat, Skuntank, and Shiftry help to keep Miltank's HP high to reliably check Delphox. Offensively, fast, frail sweepers like Ludicolo and Haunter and physical attackers like Braviary and Hitmonlee benefit from Heal Bell clearing paralysis and burns. Slower powerhouses like Clawitzer, Exploud, and Gallade benefit hugely from the Thunder Wave support that Miltank provides. Finally, Swords Dance Drapion can easily come in against opposing walls, Ghost-types, and Calm Mind Cressellia, set up Swords Dance, and easily dispose of them with its STAB moves.

Other Options
########

Miltank has a small movepool, but it does have a few other options that it can consider. A fully offensive set with Return or Double Edge, Fire Punch, Earthquake, and Milk Drink is feasible, but it is generally outclassed by other Pokemon in this role. Similarly, it can attempt to imitate UU's Curselax with a set of Curse, Body Slam, Milk Drink, and Hammer Arm or Heal Bell, and this set works rather well on Trick Room teams. However, it suffers from the same issues as the fully offensive set. Miltank has a variety of other attacking moves which it can chose from, such as Rock Slide, Headbutt, Body Slam, and Brick Break, each with their own supportive niche. However, it generally prefers Seismic Toss or Earthquake over these options. Finally, if you feel like being obnoxious to players who are just starting to ladder, you can run use a set akin to Whitney's Miltank, but it is far too situational to be recommended in serious matches.

Checks and Counters
########

**Fighting-types**: Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Gallade capitalize on Miltank's sole weakness, but must be wary of Thunder Wave upon switch-in. Cobalion and Virizion commonly carry Lum Berry, giving them a safe switch-in, and can force Miltank out with STAB Close Combat, Sacred Sword, or Focus Blast.

**Bulky Ghost-types**: Doublade and Cofagrigus are immune to Seismic Toss, aren't fazed by Thunder Wave, and actually use Miltank as setup fodder.

**Bulky Setup Sweepers**: Miltank is setup fodder for tanks such Swords Dance Doublade and Calm Mind Cressellia who force it out with ease.

**Taunt**: Taunt completely shuts down Miltank, forcing it either to switch out or to use Seismic Toss. Jellicent is a good Taunt user, as it is also immune to Seismic Toss.

**Durant**: Durant outpaces Miltank and sets up on it, whereas Choice Band sets have a chance to OHKO Miltank with Superpower. However, non-Lum Berry variants must be wary of Thunder Wave when switching in.

**Powerful Attackers**: Powerful special attackers such Sceptile and Haunter, most notably Focus Blast variants, can easily deal heavy damage to Miltank with their attacks, whereas physical attackers can take advantage of Miltank's uninvested Defense stat to deal heavy damage to it. Life Orb variants of Clawitzer have a considerable chance to OHKO Miltank with Aura Sphere after Stealth Rock, and Choice Specs variants can force it out should Scald burn.

**Bronzong**: Bronzong is immune to the rare Earthquake and Toxic and actually benefits from paralysis as it powers up Gyro Ball. Furthermore, Seismic Toss deals a pitiful amount of damage to it.
