Overview
########

Mega Banette gets the coveted ability Prankster and the necessary support movepool to make the best of it. Notably, it has Destiny Bond, which lets it function as a one-off stop to numerous dangerous sweepers in the tier. Offensively, Mega Banette more than holds its own; a fearsome base 165 Attack stat gives it a very sizable offensive presence and lets it make good use of moves such as Sucker Punch and Shadow Claw. Sadly, a decidedly average base 75 Speed and poor 64/75/83 defenses mean Mega Banette cannot stick around to dish out hits for long. Banette also has a severe case of four-moveslot syndrome. Lastly, Prankster does not activate on the turn Banette Mega Evolves making it essentially a liability before it does so.

Moves
========

Destiny Bond allows Banette to effectively function as a revenge killer against a multitude of threats, albeit at its own peril. Knock Off works well in conjunction with the switches that Destiny Bond tends to cause, as permanently removing items from Pokemon is extremely useful. The fact that Mega Abomasnow is the only other Mega Evolution in the tier further enhances the move's effectiveness, as Mega Stones cannot be removed. Sucker Punch picks off weakened opponents, proving especially useful against fast, frail threats such as Delphox and Mismagius. STAB Shadow Claw is Banette's most consistently powerful attack, but bear in mind that a boosted Knock Off is nearly as strong as it. Taunt can be used to prevent attempts to Defog, heal, set entry hazards, or spread status; while Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and racks up residual damage. Protect allows Banette to Mega Evolve safely, which it might not be able to do against teams that apply sufficient offensive pressure on it. Shadow Sneak gives Banette a consistent priority move that can't be dodged, keep in mind however that it's a good bit weaker than Sucker Punch.

Set Details
========

84 Speed EVs allow Banette to outspeed minimum Speed Cresselia after Mega Evolving. Maximum Attack investment allows Mega Banette to hit as hard as possible, making the most of its sizable base 165 Attack. The remaining 172 EVs go in HP to allow it to take weaker attacks more comfortably. Both of Banette's abilities provide it with value before Mega Evolution: Insomnia allows Banette to be a sleep absorber, while Frisk can be used for scouting purposes.

Usage Tips
========

Even though it means sacrificing Banette, forcing one-for-one trades with Destiny Bond is the key to using this set effectively. Keep Banette in reserve as an emergency button if you see dangerous sweepers, such as Sharpedo, that can potentially overwhelm you. Of course, Banette must already be Mega Evolved to take out these threats. The very threat of Destiny Bond or Sucker Punch can be used to your advantage as well. If you manage to switch Banette in against a sweeper that the opponent does not want to sacrifice, throwing out a Knock Off or Shadow Claw on the predicted switch may be a good idea. Don't underestimate Mega Banette's sizable base 165 Attack stat; for example, Shadow Claw does a minimum of 42% to 252 HP Escavalier, a Pokemon that has decent natural bulk.

Keep in mind that Destiny Bond lasts until Banette attacks next. As such, alternating between Destiny Bond and then an attacking move (that isn't Sucker Punch) against a faster setup sweeper will near-guarantee bringing it down in a one-on-one situation. If you are not using Protect, try to Mega Evolve Banette as soon as possible. Actively seek out opportunities to Mega Evolve it safely, such as against slow, bulky Pokemon with little offensive presence; Registeel and Gligar are good examples. Note that Mega Banette can utilize its Ghost typing to spinblock; it stands up well to most defensive spinners and can use Destiny Bond to bring down offensive spinners such as Hitmonlee, preventing them from doing their job.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard support is compulsory, as the opponent can potentially stall Banette out of Destiny Bond PP by switching in and out of it, and having entry hazards on the field will at least ensure that they are punished by these switches. While Pokemon like Rhyperior and Druddigon can set Stealth Rock effectively, Spikes support is also recommended. Qwilfish is an excellent Spikes setter, using its good Speed and decent bulk aided by Intimidate to set multiple layers. Relatively fast, hard-hitting teammates such as Delphox, Jolteon, and Durant can heap offensive pressure on the opponent, which goes well with hazards support. In return, these Pokemon appreciate Mega Banette's ability to effectively revenge kill most threats that get out of hand. Other Taunt users such as Cobalion can also prevent attempts to Defog hazards, as well as set Stealth Rock and switch into Dark-type attacks.

Other Options
########

Banette has a wealth of support moves that are worth a mention for being usable, if niche. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple offensive Pokemon, while Toxic is useful for putting an opposing wall or tank on a timer. Having access to Trick Room, as well as Prankster Rain Dance or Sunny Day, Banette does well on dedicated Trick Room or weather teams. A specially defensive set using Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, Taunt, and Knock Off adopts a different approach to the main set, stalling out bulky Pokemon while keeping itself healthy with Pain Split. An offensive variant utilizing Substitute and Pain Split may also be used, as Prankster gives Mega Banette priority on both of these moves. Disable can be used in conjunction with Substitute to annoy Choice-locked opponents and mono-attacking defensive Pokenon. However, Destiny Bond is usually preferred to bring down problematic foes directly.

Checks & Counters
########

Prankster Destiny Bond lets Mega Banette force one-for-one trades with many Pokemon. Its checks and counters are, then, what prevent it from accomplishing this.

**Aromatisse**: Aroma Veil is a huge pain for Mega Banette, as it negates the effect of Taunt. Aromatisse can whittle Mega Banette down with Moonblast and/or use Wish unhindered, stalling out Destiny Bond PP if need be. Aromatisse also has access to Aromatherapy to cure itself and its team of status ailments.

**Pursuit**: Skuntank and Drapion hinder Banette because they can trap it with Pursuit, preventing it from using Destiny Bond to bring down a Pokemon of its user's choice later in the game.

**Regenerator**: Any combination of Alomomola, Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Audino is problematic to Mega Banette, as these Pokemon can switch in and out of it to drain PP while passively healing off damage incurred from its attacking moves. Slowking also has Regenerator but is decimated by STAB Shadow Claw.

**Burn and Poison**: Banette hates burns and poison because they gradually wear it down and prevent it from effectively using Destiny Bond to force trades. Scald users such as Lanturn and Alomomola can bypass Taunt and possibly cripple Banette with a burn.
