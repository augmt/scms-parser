Overview
########

Magneton has managed to carve itself a solid niche in the RU metagame, albeit a bit of a different niche than it had in the past. While in previous generations Magneton was primarily used as a trapper, in XY RU its main use is as one of the most threatening wallbreakers in the tier. Thanks to its huge Special Attack stat, great STAB combination, and access to STAB Volt Switch, Magneton's Choice Specs set is fantastic at wallbreaking and keeping up momentum. Magneton can also utilize its wonderful defensive typing and good bulk with a solid Eviolite set. However, while its typing grants it the most resistances of any type combination in the game, it also gives it debilitating weaknesses to three of the most common attacking types in RU in Ground, Fighting, and Fire. Magneton is also held back by its mediocre Speed, which leaves it outsped by most offensive threats. Despite this, Magneton remains a solid choice for an RU team that is sure to pull its weight in battle.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Flash Cannon
move 4: Hidden Power Grass
ability: Analytic
item: Choice Specs
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Volt Switch gains momentum while dealing quite a bit of damage to anything that doesn't resist it, while Thunderbolt is Magneton's strongest attack against neutral targets. Flash Cannon hits many of the Ground-types that attempt switching into Magneton to block Volt Switch, particularly Rhyperior, and Hidden Power Grass, while situational, nails Seismitoad and the uncommon Gastrodon.

Set Details
========

The given EVs are standard for an offensive Pokemon, with Modest as the preferred nature since Timid Magneton does not outspeed anything significant that Modest Magneton does not. Analytic grants Magneton a huge boost in power when the opponent switches, further enhancing its already great wallbreaking potential; Choice Specs increases Magneton's damage output even further.

Usage Tips
========

Early- to mid-game, Magneton should break down walls to open up holes for other Pokemon. Magneton should switch in on defensive Pokemon that can't do much damage to it such as Aromatisse or Alomomola, though it should be wary of potential Scald burns. Volt Switch is generally Magneton's safest move to use in most situations, though Pokemon that are immune to it can cause a bit of trouble.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate the opposing team being worn down, particularly frail cleaners such as Sharpedo and Fletchinder, benefit from Magneton as a teammate. Entry hazard support is useful with any wallbreaker, and Magneton is no exception, especially since Volt Switch allows it to wear its counters down more quickly. Examples of good Spikes users for offensive teams include Omastar and Accelgor. Dugtrio is helpful as a partner to remove Registeel and weakened Rhyperior, letting Magneton freely spam Volt Switch.

Eviolite
########
name: Eviolite
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Volt Switch
move 3: Flash Cannon
move 4: Hidden Power Grass
item: Eviolite
ability: Analytic
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Magneton's main STAB move is Thunderbolt, which can really pack a punch, especially against frail Pokemon. Volt Switch is another STAB move Magneton can use to great success, allowing it to pivot to other Pokemon while doing decent damage. Magneton's secondary STAB move, Flash Cannon, hits Fairy-, Rock-types for super effective damage. Hidden Power Grass is mainly used as a coverage move allowing Magneton to KO Water- and Ground-types, such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad. Hidden Power Ice can also be used instead of Hidden Power Grass to KO Gligar.

Set Details
========

The Special Attack and Speed EVs as well as the Modest nature are used so that Magneton can be as quick and powerful as possible. The remaining 4 EVs are put into Defense instead of HP to decrease the amount of damage Magneton takes from Stealth Rock. Eviolite is used to increase Magneton's bulk, preventing other Pokemon from OHKOing it. Analytic is the ability of choice because of the 30% damage increase Magneton gets if foe moves first or switches out. Magnet Pull is not the ideal ability because most of the Steel-types in RU have ways of playing around Magnet Pull Magneton. Also, Magneton can't do much damage to the likes of Registeel, so Magnet Pull would be useless.

Usage Tips
========

Volt Switch is a great move, as it can give you a good matchup while doing decent damage; however, knowing when to use Volt Switch and Thunderbolt is very important. Sometimes getting a better matchup is better than a KO, especially early in the game, because during early-game, it is important to scout out what moves your foes carry, and Volt Switch is perfect for that. Thunderbolt, however, is the superior option late-game, as Thunderbolt has the extra power needed to get KOs.

Team Options
========

Magneton appreciates hazard support, especially Sticky Web support, which allows it to easily outspeed quicker Pokemon. Pokemon such as Omastar are appreciated to set up Stealth Rock and Spikes. Magneton also appreciates Pokemon that are able to do lots of damage such as Druddigon, and Zangoose. As Magneton is a pivot, its teammates should be versatile to allow you to get the best matchup. Magneton can also fit into a VoltTurn core.including Pokemon such as Gligar, Liepard, and Moltres. The likes of Alomomola, Gligar, and Aromatisse are great walls, which Magneton can rely on to take hits. Other than being a pivot, Magneton can act as a lure to Grass-types and Druddigon, so Pokemon who can counter these Pokemon are highly appreciated.

Other Options
########

Choice Scarf is a good option for Magneton, but it isn't that strong and faces competition from other Electric-types, including Jolteon and Choice Scarf Rotom-C. While Magneton may seem like a good trapper with Magnet Pull, almost all relevant Steel-types in RU can either easily KO Magneton before it KOes them, outright wall it, or even switch out, making Magneton an ineffective trapper, especially in comparison to Dugtrio. Life Orb is a decent item on Magneton, but it compromises Magneton's decent bulk quite a bit. Magnet Rise is usable on the Eviolite set in order to deal with Gligar and Rhyperior rather well. Finally, Magneton can run various other Hidden Power types: Hidden Power Ground for Jolteon and opposing Magneton, Hidden Power Fire for Escavalier, or Hidden Power Ice for Gligar. However, these Pokemon are all 2HKOed or 3HKOed by Magneton's STAB moves, so these moves aren't very useful overall.

Checks & Counters
########

**Ground-Types**: As they are immune to its Volt Switch, Ground-types such as Gligar, Seismitoad, and Rhyperior are good answers to Magneton. However, the latter two are OHKOed by Hidden Power Grass and Flash Cannon, respectively, so they must be wary when switching in. Dugtrio deserves a special mention for its ability to trap Magneton.

**Registeel**: Registeel shrugs off Magneton's attacks thanks to its absurd special bulk and also can 3HKO Magneton with Seismic Toss.

**Bulky Electric-types**: Bulky Electric-types, such as Lanturn and Assault Vest Eelektross take little damage from any of Magneton's moves thanks to their typing and bulk.

**Faster Fire- and Fighting-types**: While they can't switch in safely, Pokemon such as Moltres, Cobalion, and Hitmonlee can easily make quick work of Magneton with their STAB moves.
