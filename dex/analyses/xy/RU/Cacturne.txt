Overview
########

In addition to a useful ability in Water Absorb, Cacturne has many resistances and an immunity to Psychic, allowing it to set up Swords Dance and Spikes on a variety of bulky Pokemon, including Water-types such as Slowking, Gastrodon, and Alomomola. Cacturne also has very respectable Attack and Special Attack stats, both at 115, and access to Sucker Punch to mitigate its pitiful Speed, one of its main drawbacks. Unfortunately, Cacturne is very frail and weak to common attacking types, including Bug, Flying, Ice, and Fire. It also faces serious competition from Accelgor, which is a faster Spikes user, and Shifty, which shares its typing but has higher Speed and access to Defog. Lastly, Cacturne is fairly weak without a Swords Dance boost.

Swords Dance
########
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Seed Bomb
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Drain Punch / Low Kick
ability: Water Absorb
item: Life Orb / Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Swords Dance allows Cacturne to break through bulky walls and punch holes in the opposing team. Seed Bomb is a Grass-type STAB move that hits fairly hard, and Sucker Punch is a Dark-type move that has good Base Power and makes up for Cacturne's poor Speed, though opponents can take advantage of Sucker Punch's low PP. Drain Punch allows Cacturne to regain HP as well as hit Steel-types for super effective damage. However, Low Kick is an option that deals more damage to heavier Steel-types such as Registeel. Substitute can be used to block status from the likes of Alomomola, ease setup opportunities, and protect Cacturne from revenge killers and priority.

Set Details
========

An Adamant nature and max Speed and Attack investment allow Cacturne to hit as hard and fast as possible. An Adamant nature is chosen over a Jolly nature because the latter does not allow Cacturne to outspeed anything significant, and the former gives a significant boost in power. Life Orb gives Cacturne an easier time breaking through walls, but a Focus Sash can allow Cacturne to set up more easily against offensive teams. If Substitute is chosen, then Leftovers should be used.

Usage Tips
========

This set is used mainly as a wallbreaker due to its ability to take advantage of the many bulky Water-types in the tier, such as Slowking lacking Fire Blast, Alomomola, Gastrodon, and Jellicent with Water Absorb. Many of those Pokemon carry status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, so Substitute definitely helps Cacturne to break them down. Unlike other Swords Dance users, such as Drapion and Virizion, Cacturne must rely on Sucker Punch to mitigate its low Speed, so it will often not be able to fully sweep. Cacturne should be brought in on double switches or on predicted Water- or Psychic-type attacks. In addition, you should be wary of super effective moves that defensive Pokemon carry, such as Slowking's Fire Blast and Gligar's U-turn. Also, faster Substitute users such as Braviary can take advantage of Sucker Punch and shut down Cacturne.

Team Options
========

Good teammates for Cacturne are Fire-types that appreciate bulky Water-types broken down, such as Fletchinder, Moltres, and Delphox. Also, Cacturne appreciates entry hazard support from partners such as Accelgor, Rhyperior, and Cobalion to aid in breaking down walls. However, if you would prefer Cacturne to act as a full sweeper, then a bulky Water-type of your own will help handle Fletchinder and Hitmonlee, as both of them can revenge kill Cacturne no matter what due to their higher Speed and priority. Lastly, Cacturne is crippled by many forms of status, so a cleric such as Aromatisse can be used to help remedy that issue.

Spikes
########
name: Spikes
move 1: Spikes
move 2: Bullet Seed / Seed Bomb
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Destiny Bond
ability: Water Absorb
item: Focus Sash
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Spikes wears down the opposing team's grounded Pokemon very quickly. Bullet Seed is a Grass-type STAB that allows Cacturne to beat other Focus Sash users such as Omastar, but Seed Bomb is more reliable. Sucker Punch serves as priority and a Dark-type STAB move, and Destiny Bond is a disrupting move that allows Cacturne to take out an opposing Pokemon if they KO Cacturne, or set up more entry hazards while threatening to take the opponent down with it. Encore is another option that can lock defensive Pokemon into moves such as Wish and Stealth Rock, allowing Cacturne to get up more hazards. However, it is illegal alongside Water Absorb. Bullet Seed is also illegal with Water Absorb, so you must use Sand Veil with it as well.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Cacturne to hit as hard and be as fast as possible. With a Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment, Cacturne Speed ties with lead Omastar, which gives Cacturne a 50% chance of stopping it from setting up any entry hazards by using Bullet Seed.

Usage Tips
========

This Cacturne set is best used as a lead in order to get up as many layers of Spikes as possible. If the opponent has a possible Taunt lead, such as Cobalion or Drapion, lead with something to handle that Pokemon. You should use Bullet Seed on turn one if your opponent leads with another Focus Sash user, such as Omastar or Dugtrio, in order to limit the entry hazards they can set up. Due to Cacturne's typing and ability, it can create free switches mid- or late-game, so it might not always be wise to use Cacturne as a suicide lead.

Team Options
========

Pokemon such as Jolteon, Fletchinder, Hitmonlee, and Sharpedo that appreciate their checks and counters, namely Slowking or Rhyperior, being weakened, make for good partners. In addition, a Stealth Rock user such as Rhyperior or Druddigon is a good partner in order to pressure opposing Flying- and Fire-types. Lastly, a spinblocker such as Doublade and Spiritomb should be used to keep your entry hazards up. Also, a Defiant user such as Braviary can discourage the use of Defog.

Other Options
########

Cacturne can utilize a special or mixed attacking set with Giga Drain, Dark Pulse, and Growth, but a set of this nature is usually outclassed by the faster Shifty. In addition, a mixed Cacturne set is forced to use a Defense-lowering nature, amplifying its frailty, and splitting its EVs, making its attacks relatively weak. Cacturne can also use a set with Substitute and Leech Seed, but Cacturne is too slow to use it well.

Checks & Counters
########

**Status**: Unless Cacturne is using Substitute, it is vulnerable to all forms of status. Burn halves its Attack and renders it nearly useless, paralysis slows it down greatly, and poison puts a timer on its longevity.

**Gligar**: Even if Cacturne is at +2, Gligar can stomach a Seed Bomb and either Toxic Cacturne or deal massive damage to it and gain momentum with U-turn. However, if it attempts to Roost stall out Cacturne's Life Orb recoil, it will be 2HKOed by a +2 Seed Bomb.

**Faster Priority Users**: Hitmonlee and Fletchinder can all out-prioritize Cacturne's Sucker Punch and KO it easily with Mach Punch and Acrobatics respectively.

**Bulky Grass Resistances**: Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Drapion, Amoonguss, Virizion, and others can use their type advantage to pressure Cacturne. Virizion does not appreciate switching in on a +2 Drain Punch, though it can use its ability Justified and Dark-type resistance to take advantage of Sucker Punch.

**Substitute Users**: Pokemon that set up Substitutes, such as Bulk Up Braviary, can avoid Sucker Punch and are able to set up alongside Cacturne.

**Bug-types**: Because most Bug-types carry U-turn, they can either KO Cacturne that lack a Focus Sash or force it out and gain momentum.

**Multi-Hit move users**: Five hits from a Life Orb or Choice Band Cinccino's Tail Slap can easily KO Focus Sash Cacturne.
