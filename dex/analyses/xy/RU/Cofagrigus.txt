Overview
########

Cofagrigus is a slow and bulky mixed wall that also packs a decent punch specially. By virtue of its Ghost typing, it can spinblock and has ample opportunities to switch in. Cofagrigus is also one of the most reliable users of Haze and Trick Room, the latter of which it can take advantage of with its low Speed. Access to Will-O-Wisp and Nasty Plot lets it wall physical attackers much better and boost its offensive presence, respectively. Furthermore, its unique Mummy ability allows it to act as a clutch check to some Pokemon that rely on their abilities. Unfortunately, Cofagrigus's low Speed outside of Trick Room, susceptibility to status, and lack of reliable recovery means that it will be worn down rather quickly, while the buffs to Knock Off and Dark- and Ghost-type moves in general are also bad news for it. Unfortunately, Cofagrigus faces heavy competition as a Ghost-type from the likes of Doublade and Spiritomb, both of which have a better typing and utility. As a defensive Pokemon, it also faces competition from Aromatisse and Gligar as a check to Fighting-types. Despite its good mixed bulk, it struggles to handle powerful attackers and sweepers such as Meloetta, Moltres, Bulk Up Braviary, and Drapion.

Offensive Trick Room
########
name: Offensive Trick Room
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Nasty Plot
move 3: Shadow Ball
move 4: Hidden Power Fighting
ability: Mummy
item: Leftovers
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Quiet


Moves
========

Trick Room can be set up rather easily thanks to Cofagrigus's above-average bulk and allows it to "outspeed" most Pokemon. Nasty Plot raises its Special Attack to threatening levels. Shadow Ball is its STAB attack with decent coverage, and it hits quite hard after a single Nasty Plot. Hidden Power Fighting provides perfect neutral coverage and stops Cofagrigus from being walled by Normal-types, and hits most Dark-types for super effective damage. Dark Pulse allows Cofagrigus to get past Meloetta, which is immune to Shadow Ball and takes little damage from Hidden Power Fighting.

Set Details
========

Maximum EV investment in HP and Special Attack allows Cofagrigus to take hits and dish out damage, making this set a tank. A Quiet nature further increases its Special Attack while lowering its Speed, making it even "faster" under Trick Room. Mummy effectively neuters some physical attackers by removing their ability. Leftovers provides some passive recovery.

Usage Tips
========

Trick Room and Nasty Plot are essential to allow Cofagrigus to even attempt a sweep, so beware of Taunt users and opposing Trick Room users; it should be used as a late-game sweeper when its checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened or removed. Cofagrigus can also come in at multiple points in the match and force out physical attackers with Mummy, allowing for more opportunities to set up Trick Room and Nasty Plot. 

Team Options
========

Knock Off absorbers such as Cobalion are appreciated, as the loss of Leftovers is very detrimental. Although this Cofagrigus functions well against balanced and hyper-offensive teams, its Special Attack is still below-average at best, so wallbreakers such as Abomasnow, Druddigon, Reuniclus, and Rhyperior can take down some bulky walls. Other slow Pokemon such as Abomasnow and Escavalier can take advantage of the Trick Room that Cofagrigus sets up. Alternatively, other Trick Room users such as Slowking can also aid in sweeping by either setting up Trick Room for Cofagrigus, or vice versa. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Bronzong is helpful to limit the amount of times offensive checks to Cofagrigus such as Meloetta can switch in, and it also somewhat compensates for its below-average offensive potential.

Defensive
########
name: Defensive
move 1: Will-O-Wisp
move 2: Shadow Ball
move 3: Pain Split / Protect
move 4: Haze / Knock Off
ability: Mummy
item: Leftovers
evs: 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD
nature: Bold / Relaxed

Moves
========

Will-O-Wisp cuts the opponent's Attack and provides residual damage, allowing Cofagrigus to force out or stall out most physical attackers. Shadow Ball provides a decent STAB attack and prevents Taunt from completely shutting this set down. Pain Split provides semi-reliable recovery and dents Pokemon with high base HP, while Protect racks up burn damage and Leftovers recovery while scouting for moves. Haze prevents setup sweepers from boosting properly, while Knock Off provides utility by depriving Pokemon of their items. Both are decent choices for the final slot, depending on what role you wish Cofagrigus to be more proficient at.

Set Details
========

248 HP EVs provide a Stealth Rock number, allowing Cofagrigus to take less entry hazard and status damage. 252 Defense EVs further bolster its already solid physical bulk, and the remaining EVs are placed in Special Defense for a tiny boost. A Bold nature boosts Defense in exchange for a drop in Attack, but a Relaxed nature can be used if Knock Off is elected in the last slot, though its damage increase is negligible. Leftovers provides passive recovery, but it might make Pain Split less effective. Alternatively, a specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD can be used to take on special sweepers.

Usage Tips
========

This set enables Cofagrigus to hard switch into almost any physical attacker without a super effective move, remove their ability, and destroy any offensive momentum. Opportunities to switch in are ample, thanks to its immunities to Normal and Fighting, two rather common offensive types. Will-O-Wisp, or Knock Off if it is run, is generally the best move to use if predicting a switch. Haze should be used on opponents that attempt to use Cofagrigus as setup fodder.

Team Options
========

Entry hazard setters such as Roselia, Qwilfish, and Drapion work marvelously with Cofagrigus due to its ability to force many switches. Cleric and Wish support from the likes of Aromatisse and Audino is also greatly appreciated to allow it to continue doing its job. Knock Off absorbers such as Cobalion are also nice, as the loss of Leftovers hurts this set greatly. A special wall such as Slowking, Aromatisse, or Audino is also somewhat necessary, as Cofagrigus's Special Defense is mediocre at best when uninvested.

Other Options
########

Toxic and Toxic Spikes are alternative moves that allow Cofagrigus to stall out opponents even better, but the Attack drop with a burn is crucial to walling most physical attackers and Toxic Spikes is illegal with Pain Split. Disable is a cool option if you can predict the opponent correctly. Other attacking moves include Infestation and Energy Ball. Destiny Bond on the Trick Room set can take down a wall with it, while Memento can pave the way for another sweeper to begin boosting. Hex can be used on the defensive set as an alternate STAB move that deals heavy damage to statused foes. A set consisting of Calm Mind, Rest, Sleep Talk, and Shadow Ball is an alternate way to boost, but this set is outclassed by Spiritomb. Magic Coat deflects status moves and entry hazards, but Cofagrigus has trouble fitting it onto its moveset.

Checks & Counters
########

**Taunt**: Taunt users such as Skuntank can usually shut Cofagrigus down; Drapion is possibly the greatest threat to the offensive Trick Room set, also having access to Knock Off, Toxic Spikes, and Swords Dance while forcing Cofagrigus out.

**Special Attackers and Walls**: Moltres gets a free switch into Will-O-Wisp and can Roost stall or hit Cofagrigus on its weak special side. Most other special attackers aren't as crippled by burn, so they can easily force Cofagrigus out. Dedicated special walls can soak up most of Cofagrigus's hits.

**Knock Off**: Knock Off hits for super effective damage and removes Leftovers, crippling Cofagrigus. Despite activating Mummy, it is still one of the best ways of dealing with Cofagrigus.

**Status**: Status such as poison and burn will wear Cofagrigus down very swiftly, as it has no way of removing it and Pain Split can only do so much to alleviate recovery issues.

**Meloetta**: Meloetta is immune to Shadow Ball, doesn't care much for being burned, and can use most variants lacking Knock Off as setup fodder. Meloetta only has to fear a boosted Dark Pulse from the Nasty Plot set.

**Normal-types**: Normal-types such as Exploud, Meloetta, Audino, Braviary, and Heliolisk are troublesome for Cofagrigus. All of these Pokemon are immune to Shadow Ball and dont mind Will-O-Wisp, but should be wary of Hidden Power Fighting. Exploud bypasses Cofagrigus's immunity to Normal-type attacks thanks to Scrappy. If Cofagrigus is lacking Haze, it is complete setup fodder for Sub Bulk Up Braviary.

**Dark-types**: Dark-types such as Drapion, Sharpedo, Spiritomb, and Skuntank are problematic for Cofagrigus. While they cannot safely switch into a Will-O-Wisp, they can shut Cofagrigus down with Taunt, deal massive damage with their STAB moves, or turn Cofagrigus into setup fodder; particularly for Taunt + Swords Dance Drapion.
