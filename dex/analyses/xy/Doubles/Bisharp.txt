Overview
########

Thanks to an excellent ability, high Attack, and dangerous STAB moves, Bisharp has no problem threatening opposing teams. Defiant is one of the best abilities in the metagame since it punishes common Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Hitmontop for switching in, as well as letting Bisharp take advantage of moves such as Icy Wind and Snarl for free Attack boosts. Knock Off makes Bisharp very difficult to switch into while dealing large amounts of damage, and Sucker Punch lets it take out frailer Pokemon and helps compensate for its middling Speed. While Bisharp does suffer from frailness coupled with weaknesses to common Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks, these issues are not enough to stop it from being an excellent attacker.

move 1: Knock Off
move 2: Sucker Punch
move 3: Iron Head
move 4: Protect
ability: Defiant
item: Life Orb
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Knock Off is the main move on this set and is notable for being both more powerful and more reliable than Sucker Punch while also stripping opposing Pokemon of their items, making Bisharp hard to switch into. Sucker Punch is for Pokemon that outspeed Bisharp, allowing it to pick them off before they can strike. However, the fact that it fails when the opponent isn't attacking makes it easier to play around than Knock Off, so when facing a Pokemon that Bisharp outspeeds, it's usually safer to go with Knock Off. Iron Head is a secondary STAB attack that's mainly used when Bisharp encounters something that resists its Dark-type attacks, or you're relying on a flinch. Protect is used to shield Bisharp from damage, which is especially useful as a strong attack will often put it out of commission.

Set Details
========

Life Orb is chosen to augment Bisharp's already high Attack to deal as much damage as possible, making it into an even more threatening attacker. The EVs give Bisharp as much power as possible, with an Adamant nature chosen over Jolly since Bisharp doesn't really need the extra Speed. Defiant allows Bisharp to get free Attack boosts from users of Intimidate and Icy Wind, which is great since they are very common. Focus Sash is an option since Bisharp has a lot of weaknesses and isn't very bulky. Low Kick is an option over Iron Head to hit Heatran super effectively, but other than that, Iron Head is better. Also, Swords Dance is an option as it makes Bisharp even more threatening, and the boosts can't be lowered by Intimidate thanks to Defiant. The listed set is generally the most effective one on Bisharp, though, so one should be wary of deviating from it.

Usage Tips
========

Bisharp makes for a great Trick Room check since it can hit most Trick Room setters super effectively, KOing them before they can set it up. Sucker Punch should be used to pick off fast, frail threats on the opposing team. However, if Bisharp outspeeds a Pokemon and you want to use a Dark-type attack, go with Knock Off as it's more powerful and reliable. If there are other Pokemon on your team that dislike Intimidate, using Bisharp to dissuade the opponent from switching in their Intimidate users is a good idea. Try to avoid letting Bisharp take any hits it doesn't need to, as its frailness coupled with Life Orb recoil means that any extra hits will hamper Bisharp's effectiveness. It can be a good idea to save Bisharp for late-game so it can clean up weakened teams with high-powered Sucker Punches. While this play can be risky, it's possible to switch Bisharp in on a predicted Icy Wind, Electroweb, or Snarl and get a +2 Attack boost from Defiant while taking very little damage.

Team Options
========

Strong physical attackers such as Landorus-T and Mega Kangaskhan appreciate Bisharp's ability to threaten Intimidate users. Psychic-, Fairy-, and Ghost-types such as Togekiss and Cresselia make for good partners since they can switch into Fighting-type attacks for Bisharp. Slower Pokemon such as Amoonguss appreciate that Bisharp can check faster threats with Sucker Punch. Faster Pokemon such as Terrakion and Shaymin-S like having Bisharp around since it can threaten most Trick Room setters. Terrakion also makes a particularly good partner because it can threaten Mega Charizard Y and Heatran, both of which can KO Bisharp. Partners that can redirect powerful hits for Bisharp such as Togekiss or Amoonguss are good to have. Amoonguss also appreciates how Bisharp can threaten the Psychic-types that prey on it, and it has Spore to put a threatening Pokemon out of commission. Speed control from Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Cresselia, or Togekiss is useful since Bisharp is even more threatening when it doesn't need to rely on Sucker Punch to handle faster Pokemon. Flying-types such as Talonflame make for good partners to Bisharp since they can decimate Fighting-types. Wide Guard users such as Hitmontop are good partners since they can shield Bisharp from Heat Waves and Earthquakes that would otherwise KO it.

Other Options
########

Due to the amount of switches it can force, Substitute can be a good option for Bisharp; it also lets Bisharp avoid status moves such as Will-O-Wisp. Choice Band is an option to make Bisharp's attacks even more devastating, but being locked into a move can make Bisharp easy to take advantage of. Choice Scarf is also an option to surprise people expecting a slower set with a powerful hit. Lum Berry can be used to cure burns that would cripple Bisharp, but a Life Orb is typically more useful. Psycho Cut can be used to lure in Fighting-types and hit them super effectively, but it's fairly situational. Taunt can mess up slower support Pokemon such as Amoonguss, rendering them useless. It also has the added benefit of forcing the opponent to attack or switch out, letting you use Sucker Punch with greater certainty. Pursuit could potentially be used to pick off fleeing Pokemon, but this move is highly situational and as such is not recommended.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Fighting-types such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Conkeldurr can easily OHKO Bisharp. Mach Punch users such as Conkeldurr and Breloom are especially threatening since they can hit Bisharp before it can use an Iron Head. Garchomp can outspeed Bisharp, live through a Sucker Punch, and KO back with Earthquake. Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Volcarona can all OHKO Bisharp with Heat Wave, although they have trouble switching into it. Opposing Bisharp with Low Kick resist Bisharp's STAB moves and KO back. Mega Gyarados resists both of Bisharp's STAB moves and can hit back for large amounts of damage, Choice Scarf Tyranitar resists Sucker Punch and has no trouble OHKOing with Low Kick or Superpower.

**Burns**: Pokemon that commonly carry Will-O-Wisp, such as Rotom-W and Sableye, can neuter Bisharp's offensive presence by burning it, although they might take heavy damage in the process.

**Utility Moves**: Faster Pokemon with Substitute such as Heatran and Chandelure can potentially be good Bisharp checks, as Substitute lets them play around Sucker Punch as needed.
