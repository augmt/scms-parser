Overview
########

Milotic faces large competition from other Water-types such as Suicune and Rotom-W, which have a better support movepool and dual typing, respectively. However, Milotic has a niche in its ability Competitive, which boosts its Special Attack by two stages every time one of its stats is lowered by a foe; this allows it to discourage Intimidate and Icy Wind. This allows it to become a good partner for physical attackers and patch up its average Special Attack. Milotic also has a decent support movepool, which includes moves such as Icy Wind and Safeguard, as well as good Special Defense.

Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Protect
move 4: Safeguard / Recover
ability: Competitive
item: Life Orb / Sitrus Berry
evs: 88 HP / 252 SpA / 168 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Hydro Pump is Milotic's main STAB move and strongest attack with a good typing, hitting Pokemon such as Heatran for super effective damage. Ice Beam provides good neutral coverage and hits Grass- and Dragon-types such as Amoonguss and Latios, respectively, for super effective damage. Protect is crucial in Doubles, as it allows Milotic to scout for moves and allows Milotic's ally to deal with a threat. The last move is a filler; Safeguard can be used to provide team support by blocking status, while Recover could be used to increase Milotic's longevity and complement its bulk.

Set Details
========

168 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Adamant Breloom and Bisharp while not hampering Milotic's bulk too much. 252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature are used to maximize Milotic's power. The remaining EVs go into HP to increase Milotic's bulk. Life Orb could be used to increase Milotic's power even more, whilst Sitrus Berry provides a small HP boost and prevents some attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird from 2HKOing it, causing them to 3HKO Milotic instead.

Usage Tips
========

Milotic works well when paired with a physical attacker, as Milotic discourages Intimidate users from switching in. Milotic is also successful when working as a lead to catch Intimidate users off guard. Milotic's good special bulk allows it to switch in to neutral or not very effective special attacks, especially Icy Wind, which activates Milotic's ability. Milotic should not feel pressured to stay in if it has received a boost; switching out can sometimes be the best play, especially if a foe is threatening Milotic.

Team Options
========

Milotic pairs best with physical attackers, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Terrakion, as it can discourage Intimidate, get a Special Attack boost when it is Intimidated, and block burns with Safeguard. Grass-types such as Shaymin-S and Amoonguss can beat the Water-types that wall Milotic. The former can also beat Grass-types with its Flying-type STAB moves. Fire-types such as Heatran and Mega Charizard X can beat Grass-types, whilst Milotic can take out Rock- and Ground-types for them. Ground-type Pokemon such as Mamoswine can beat Electric-types, which threaten Milotic. Milotic appreciates Tailwind support from Pokemon such as Latios and Hydreigon to patch up its middling Speed. It works well with the former because Milotic beats Pokemon such as Mega Mawile and Heatran, and Latios can KO Mega Venasaur and Amoonguss.

Other Options
########

Surf could be used as a Water-type STAB move that hits both foes but also Milotic's ally, Icy Wind provides team support by lowering the Speed of both foes, and Hidden Power Grass could be used to beat Water-types such as Rotom-W and Keldeo, which otherwise wall Milotic. Blizzard could be used on a hail team because it hits both foes, and Light Screen provides team support while allowing Milotic to check special attackers more easily. A support set consisting of Scald, Icy Wind, and Safeguard could be used, but it is very passive, so it can be manipulated and doesn't best utilize Milotic's main niche, Competitive. A Choice Specs set could be used for more power, but locks Milotic into one move, not to mention Milotic lacks the movepool to use it effectively.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage** Grass-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur can easily survive a hit and retaliate back with their STAB moves. Other Grass-types, such as Shaymin-S, can revenge kill Milotic; however, they fear Ice Beam. Electric-type Pokemon such as Thundurus and Mega Manectric can outspeed and deal heavy damage to Milotic with their STAB moves, but they do not want to switch in. Rotom-W can easily survive hits from and retaliate back against Milotic, and Ludicolo can survive hits from Milotic and hit it hard with its Grass-type STAB moves.

**Defensive Typing Advantage** Water-types such as Azumarril and Suicune can ignore Milotic, as they can both easily take hits, and the former can hit it hard with STAB Play Rough; Suicune, on the other hand, cannot do much damage in return, and Milotic discourages it from using Icy Wind and Snarl, but it can use the opportunity to set up Tailwind. Mega Gyarados can use Milotic as setup fodder, but has to be careful not to give Milotic a boost with Intimidate. Kyurem-B can freely set up a Substitute on Milotic.

**Opposing Weather** Sun weakens Milotic's STAB moves, and Pokemon commonly found on sun teams such as Venusaur and Mega Charizard Y can handle Milotic with their Grass-type moves, such as Giga Drain and Solar Beam, respectively.
