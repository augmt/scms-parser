Overview
########

Manaphy is a decent rain sweeper in Doubles thanks to its bulk and ability, Hydration, which keeps it alive longer than other rain sweepers such as Ludicolo and Kingdra. It has an okay movepool that gives it a great boosting move in Tail Glow and decent coverage moves in Ice Beam and Energy Ball. It is mostly outclassed as a Water-type by Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Suicune, which support their teams, and it lacks access to powerful STAB attacks, which Ludicolo and Kingdra have. Lastly, base 100 Speed isn't very good for a sweeper, so much team support is needed to patch it up.

Tail Glow
########
name: Tail Glow
move 1: Tail Glow
move 2: Scald
move 3: Ice Beam / Energy Ball
move 4: Rest / Protect
Ability: Hydration
item: Sitrus Berry / Wacan Berry
evs: 108 HP / 252 SpA / 148 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Tail Glow is the main reason to use Manaphy, as it confers an immediate +3 Special Attack boost. Scald is the main STAB move and has good neutral coverage and a nifty chance to burn. Ice Beam and Energy Ball provide coverage; Energy Ball hits bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Jellicent, which can take a Scald, while Ice beam is an option to hit Grass- and Dragon-types such as Latios and Amoonguss. Rest grants Manaphy instant recovery, and under the rain, Manaphy will wake up at the end of the turn; if this is unneeded, Protect shields Manaphy in various situations.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread lets Manaphy outspeed neutral-natured base 100s, such as Mega Kangaskhan, and maximizes its power, with the leftover EVs invested in HP. Wacan Berry lets Manaphy resist Electric-type attacks from Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Thundurus and KO them back. Sitrus Berry can be used to increase Manaphy's longevity. Mystic Water is an option for a consistent power boost on Manaphy's STAB moves without recoil, but other items typically outclass it. Rindo Berry allows Manaphy to withstand strong Grass-type attacks, but they aren't as common as Electric-type attacks, so it's usually not as useful as the other options.

Usage Tips
========

Manaphy can bust holes in opposing teams with powerful Tail Glow-boosted attacks early- to mid-game. Manaphy can also be saved until late-game to function as a powerful cleaner. Take advantage of its good bulk to boost, as with only one common weakness, setting up is often easy, as the most common Grass-type is Amoonguss, which doesn't usually have the Special Attack investment to pose a threat.

Team Options
========

Politoed is the best partner for Manaphy because it can set up rain immediately upon switching in, giving Manaphy a boost to its STAB moves and activating Hydration. Pokemon that can handle Grass- and Electric-type attacks such as Latios, Hydreigon, Thundurus-T, and Kyurem-B make good partners as well. Amoonguss can redirect Electric-type attacks with Rage Powder. Togekiss can redirect hits and set Tailwind to make Manaphy even more threatening. Jirachi, too, can redirect attacks and give Manaphy an opportunity to boost and sweep. Pokemon such as Garchomp and Terrakion make for good partners, as they can handle the problematic Mega Charizard Y.

Other Options
########

A bulky support set with a spread of 248 HP / 52 Def / 100 SpA / 108 Spe and a Modest nature gives Manaphy more bulk and allows it to avoid being 2HKOed by -1 Mega Kangaskhan and outspeed neutral base 70s; the rest of the EVs are invested in Special Attack. Another viable spread is the offensive 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature. This spread is Manaphy's best chance against Mega Charizard Y, so if that threatens your team, keep this spread in mind. Rain Dance could be used to be less dependent on Politoed and less weak to Grass- and Electric-types. Calm Mind lets Manaphy boost its Special Defense, but it doesn't give the immediate power boost that Tail Glow does. Safety Googles allows Manaphy to sweep without redirection support and avoid being put to sleep by Amoonguss's Spore.

Checks & Counters
########

**Type Advantage**: Shaymin-S can outspeed and KO Manaphy with Seed Flare; Mega Venusaur, thanks to Thick Fat, can't be KOed by a +3 Ice Beam and can hit hard with Giga Drain. Ferrothorn resists Scald, Manaphy's STAB move, and is annoying with Leech Seed recovery and Power Whip, and Manaphy lacks super effective moves to retaliate back, aside from the uncommon Hidden Power Fire. Rotom-W is a threat if Manaphy lacks Energy Ball, as are Thundurus-T and Mega Manectric if Manaphy lacks Rindo Berry. Latios, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon resist Scald and can KO Manaphy with their STAB moves if it is not running a bulky spread.

**Opposing Weather**: The sun severely hinders Manaphy, and under it, Mega Charizard Y can threaten Manaphy with a super effective Solar Beam. After a Tail Glow, however, Timid max Speed Manaphy can Speed tie with and KO Mega Charizard Y under the sun. Abomasnow is not common, but it handles all of Manaphy's attacks, removes the rain, and can be threatening with its Grass-type STAB moves, which include Giga Drain, Seed Bomb, and Power Whip.
