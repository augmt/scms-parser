Overview
########

While Suicune faces competition from Water-types such as Rotom-W, it is an excellent Pokemon in its own right. Its great defensive typing in conjunction with its good bulk mean that it has no problem staying on the field for a long time. Suicune is also blessed with a unique movepool with moves that many other common Water-types lack, such as Tailwind and Snarl giving it extra utility and allowing it to support its team throughout a match. Sadly, its pure Water typing leaves Suicune weak to Grass- and Electric-type attacks, which can be a problem for it. Also, its base 90 Special Attack is none too high, so its damage output can be underwhelming at times. These weaknesses, however, are overshadowed by the unique strengths it possesses.

Defensive Speed Control
########
name: Defensive Speed Control
move 1: Tailwind
move 2: Scald
move 3: Ice Beam / Protect
move 4: Snarl / Protect
ability: Pressure
item: Leftovers / Sitrus Berry
evs: 232 HP / 84 Def /112 SpA / 80 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Tailwind gives the set its name, and is used to boost the Speed of Suicune's allies in a pinch, putting the opponent under a lot of pressure. It's also a good way to counteract an opposing team full of fast and powerful Pokemon. Scald is the main attack Suicune should be using as it receives a STAB boost, has great neutral coverage, and has a 30% burn chance making it a good default choice. Ice Beam is a coverage move to hit the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Scald. Snarl should be used when the opponent has a threatening special attacker, as the Special Attack drops from Snarl will quickly neuter their offensive presence. Protect is used to shield Suicune from unneeded damage, potentially stopping it from being KOed. It's also useful to stall out opposing field conditions and rack up Leftovers recovery.

Set Details
========

The EV spread allows Suicune to live through an unboosted Shaymin-S's Seed Flare as well as OHKO Landorus-T with Ice Beam, with the remaining EVs being put into Defense. Bold is the preferred nature on this set, as Suicune has Snarl to soften special attacks. If you choose not to use Ice Beam, it's best to move the Special Attack EVs into Defense for increased survivability. Leftovers is the main option as Suicune will often be on the field for extended periods of time when supporting the team. Sitrus Berry is also an option to give a large chunk of health back in a pinch, which can help Suicune avoid being KOed.

Usage Tips
========

Using Suicune as a bulky pivot that can tank resisted moves is best due to Suicune's excellent bulk. It can even take some non-resisted hits thanks to its bulk and few weaknesses. If none of your attacking options are very damaging to the opponent, fishing for a burn with Scald can be a good option. Repeatedly using Snarl can be a good way to cripple opposing special attackers and render them harmless after a few hits. Be sure to watch out for Defiant users when doing this though, as Snarl will give them a +2 Attack boost. If Suicune isn't doing much on the field at a given time, it can be a good idea to switch it out for later, as it's able to set up Tailwind multiple times throughout a match thanks to its bulk.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that handle Grass- and Electric-type attacks such as Latios, Hydreigon, and Kyurem-B make for good partners. Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Genesect, Mega Heracross, and Garchomp all enjoy Suicune's Tailwind support as it makes them even more threatening. Amoonguss makes for a fantastic partner by redirecting Electric-type attacks from Suicune while also checking Trick Room, which can be problematic for Suicune as a Tailwind setter. Suicune can also check Fire-types for Amoonguss, further strengthening the pairing. Ground-types such as Garchomp and Rhyperior make for good partners to take the Electric-type attacks that can dent Suicune. Rhyperior is especially good at this role as its Lightning Rod ability redirects Electric-type attacks from Suicune.

Offensive
########
name: Offensive
move 1: Hydro Pump / Scald
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Tailwind
move 4: Protect
ability: Pressure
item: Sitrus Berry
evs: 28 HP / 252 SpA / 228 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Hydro Pump is used as the main STAB move for its power and excellent neutral coverage. However, if Hydro Pump's shaky accuracy needs to be avoided, Scald is another attacking option, albeit a less powerful one. Scald also comes with a 30% burn chance, which comes in handy at times. Ice Beam is used to hit the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Suicune's Water-type attacks. Tailwind is a good way to give your team a large Speed boost, and can put a lot of pressure on the opponents as your Pokemon will likely be outspeeding them. Protect is used to avoid taking damage for a turn, which can even prevent Suicune from being KOed.

Set Details
========

The EV spread is used to give Suicune as much power as possible while outspeeding base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Bisharp and Breloom, with the rest being put into HP. Modest is the chosen nature to maximize Suicune's power. Sitrus Berry is typically used to help give a large chunk of health back at once. Mystic Water is another option if you want to augment Suicune's power.

Usage Tips
========

Thanks to Suicune's great defensive stats and typing, having it act as a bulky pivot and switch into resisted hits can work well. With an offensive set, Suicune can take advantage of its own Tailwind to pose a threat to the opponent. If your opponent has many threatening Pokemon that are faster than your own, then Tailwind is a good way to turn the tables on them. If none of your attacks do very much damage to an opponent, then fishing for Scald burns is a decent strategy.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can handle Grass- and Electric-type attacks such as Latios, Hydreigon, and Kyurem-B make for good partners. Amoonguss is a nice partner as it can redirect Electric-type attacks from Suicune while also checking Trick Room, which can be problematic for Suicune as a setter and abuser of Tailwind. Suicune can also check the Fire-types that threaten Amoonguss. Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Genesect, and Mega Heracross all enjoy Suicune's Tailwind support as it makes them even more threatening, letting them overcome their Speed issues. Ground-types such as Garchomp and Rhyperior make for good partners to take the Electric-type attacks that can do heavy damage to Suicune. Rhyperior is especially good at this role since its Lightning Rod ability redirects Electric-type attacks from Suicune. Pokemon such as Thundurus-T, Zapdos, and Mega Venusaur make for good partners to take down the bulky Water-types that Suicune would have no hope of touching on its own. Thundurus-T is especially good as it enjoys the Tailwind support that Suicune provides.

Other Options
########

Calm Mind can be used to increase Suicune's offensive presence while making it difficult to KO, but setting up multiple boosts can be difficult and time-consuming. ChestoRest is an option instead of Protect and a Sitrus Berry to let Suicune fully heal itself when needed. Icy Wind is a good support move to help with speed control. Assault Vest can be used to grant Suicune more survivability through a boost to its Special Defense. It's even more helpful as both of Suicune's weaknesses are typically seen on the special attacking side. Roar is an option to phaze out an opposing Pokemon before they can set up Trick Room, but it is somewhat situational. Wacan or Rindo Berry are options to mitigate damage from powerful Electric- or Grass-type attacks, respectively.

Checks & Counters
########

**Defensive Pokemon**: Amoonguss can redirect all of Suicune's attacks, put it to sleep, hit it super effectively, and shrug off any potential damage with Regenerator. Jellicent completely walls most Suicune as it is immune to Water-type attacks and takes little from Ice Beam. Gastrodon also falls into this category, as it is able to redirect Water-type attacks. Both of them need to watch out for Snarl though, as it will quickly render them useless offensively.

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Abomasnow, Mega Venusaur, and Ludicolo can both easily tank Suicune's moves and strike back with a powerful Grass-type attack. Life Orb Shaymin-S can OHKO Suicune with Seed Flare, but must watch out for Ice Beam. Thundurus-T, Thundurus, Zapdos, and Rotom-W can all nail Suicune with a Thunderbolt. Rotom-W also resists both of Suicune's commonly carried moves, while Thundurus typically carries Taunt, which shuts down Suicune's support moves. Due to its great bulk and the fact that it has nothing to fear from a burn, Guts Conkeldurr makes a great check to defensive Suicune. Bisharp can also mess up Suicune if it can switch in on a predicted Snarl. All offensive answers must be sure to watch out for a Scald or Snarl, though, depending on their attacking spectrum.

**Speed Control**: Common Trick Room setters such as Cresselia make for good checks as Trick Room can turn Suicune's Tailwind into a serious disadvantage, making Suicune and its allies move last under Trick Room for several turns. Paralysis from users such as Thundurus can cripple Suicune and its partners, rendering them unable to take advantage of Tailwind.

**Utility Moves**: Pokemon with Taunt, such as Thundurus and Sableye, can prevent Suicune from setting up Tailwind when needed, reducing its ability to support its team.
