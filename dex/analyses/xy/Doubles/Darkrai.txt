Overview
########

Darkrai's high Speed and Special Attack stats allow it to outspeed and hit the majority of the unboosted metagame hard. This is further enhanced by Darkrai's STAB Dark Pulse, which hits a large portion of the metagame for at least neutral damage. Darkrai can also provide support, being able to lower the foe's Attack with Will-O-Wisp or prevent status with Taunt. It also has decent bulk and a few nifty resistances. Despite this, Darkrai heavily relies on its Speed to function, and so has to be wary of speed control. In addition, it is weak to three common types, Fairy, Fighting and Bug. Darkrai also has a slight case four-moveslot syndrome, because if it wants to use a status move, such as Taunt or Will-O-Wisp, it has to relinquish a coverage move. Lastly, despite its power, Darkrai often needs some team support to score KOs, such as Jellicent and Heatran.

Moves
========

Dark Pulse has decent power and good coverage across the metagame, while Focus Blast hits Pokemon that resist Dark Pulse, such as Scrafty, Tyranitar, and Terrakion, for super effective damage. Taunt can be used to prevent Trick Room and status, and Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple physical attackers. Ice Beam is an option for the last slot, providing extra coverage and allowing Darkrai to hit Thundurus, Togekiss, and Amoonguss for super effective damage. Protect can block Fake Out, scout for moves, and avoid a KO or a status move while a partner deals with a threat. 

Set Details
========

A Timid nature and 152 Speed EVs allow Darkrai to outspeed Mega Lucario, the next fastest relevant threat. However, more Speed investment can be run to outspeed specific Pokemon; 252 Speed EVs allow Darkrai to Speed tie with Weavile, and 232 Speed EVs let Darkrai outspeed Greninja, though these two threats are not very common. Max Special Attack EVs and a Life Orb maximize Darkrai's damage output. The remaining EVs are put into HP to maximize Darkrai's overall bulk and allow it to survive a Jolly Mega Kangaskhan Return at full health.

Usage Tips
========

Darkrai's main purpose is to outspeed the opponent's Pokemon and deal out damage. Taunt and Will-O-Wisp should only be used when necessary, to either prevent being inflicted by status or being KOed by a physical attacker. Darkrai is a good lead against Trick Room teams, as it can hit most users of Trick Room super effectively with STAB Dark Pulse or stop them with Taunt. Although it has decent natural bulk, Darkrai does not want to switch in and possibly take a hit; it prefers to switch in after a KO and revenge kill. Protect should be used for blocking Fake Out or letting a teammate deal with a threatening Pokemon. This is very important because Darkrai has two common weaknesses to Fighting- and Fairy-type moves. Darkrai is best used late-game after the opposing team is weakened and possible threats are removed.

Team Options
========

Amoonguss makes for a good partner, as it can redirect moves aimed at Darkrai with Rage Powder, can tank Fighting-type moves that are super effective against Darkrai, and can use Spore to activate Darkrai's ability Bad Dreams. Togekiss is also a good partner, as it can redirect moves and 4x resists Darkrai's weaknesses to Bug- and Fighting-types. Wide Guard users such as Hipmontop are helpful, as they block Pixilate Hyper Voice. Steel-types such as Aegislash, Scizor, and Mega Mawile can threaten Fairy-types with their STAB moves. Cresselia can threaten Fighting-types with its Psychic STAB moves or boost Darkrai's damage output with Helping Hand, and Talonflame can beat most Fighting-types with its priority Brave Bird. Darkrai also works well with offensive Pokemon such as Mega Gardevoir, who appreciates burns spread by Will-O-Wisp and threatens Fighting-types with either one of its STAB moves, Thundurus, who checks Keldeo and faster attackers, as well as Latios and Latias, both of which provide Tailwind support and can hit Fighting-types with their Psychic-type STAB moves. Darkrai also works well with physical attackers as it can OHKO all three main Intimidate users: Landorus-T, Salamence, and Scrafty.

Other Options
########

Sludge Bomb hits Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Azumarill, which resist Dark Pulse and Focus Blast, for super effective damage. Psychic hits Fighting- and Poison-types such Hitmontop, Conkeldurr, and Mega Venusaur, and Thunderbolt hits Pokemon like Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, and Gyarados. Blizzard could be used instead of Ice Beam on a hail team, as it hits both the opposing Pokemon, but has low accuracy outside of hail. Darkrai also has a lot of support options, such as Thunder Wave, which could be used if your team has Speed issues, Hypnosis, which is an option to activate Darkrai's Bad Dreams ability and cripple an opposing threat, and Disable, which could be used in conjunction with Protect to stop a super effective hit or block a status. Darkrai could use Substitute to block status, but it has to be wary of Bug Buzz or Pixilate Hyper Voice which are not affected by it. Lastly, a bulky set with Snarl and Will-O-Wisp could work, lowering the opposing Pokemon's Special Attack and Attack stats.

Checks & Counters
########

**Type Advantage**: Fairy-types such as Mega Mawile, Azumarill, Sylveon, and Mega Gardevior can all survive a hit from Darkrai and OHKO it with their STAB moves; however, the first two have to be wary of burns, and Mega Gardevoir gets 2HKOed by Dark Pulse. Togekiss can redirect and survive any hit or lower Darkrai's Speed with Thunder Wave, but has to watch out for Taunt and Ice Beam. Hitmontop, Keldeo, Heracross, and Conkeldurr can all survive a hit and OHKO back, and Conkeldurr gets an Attack raise from Guts if burnt; Conkeldurr also has Mach Punch, which has priority and can 2HKO Darkrai. Breloom can finish off a weakened Darkrai with priority Mach Punch and Genesect or Volcarona can take a hit and OHKO back with their Bug-type STAB moves.

**Speed Control**: Darkrai depends on its Speed, and so has to be careful against potential Thunder Wave users, such as Thundurus and Klefki, which can take a hit or paralyze Darkrai before it moves due to Prankster. Pokemon that use Icy Wind and Electroweb, such as Suicune and Rotom-W, will also lower Darkrai's Speed, making it more manageable for the opponent. Darkrai dislikes Trick Room, but stops most setters of Trick Room with Taunt. Aromatisse, however, resists Darkrai's STAB moves, can survive any hit, cannot be Taunted due to Aroma Veil, and can 2HKO in return with Moonblast.

**Speed**: Both Choice Scarf Genesect and Landorus-T can outspeed and deal large amounts of damage to Darkrai with U-turn, or Superpower in Landorus-T's case. Other Choice Scarf users, such as Salamence or Rotom-W can deal lots of damage to Darkrai with their STAB moves as well. Pokemon that naturally outspeed it such as Shaymin-S, Mega Manectric, and Mega Gengar threaten it as well. Strong priority moves, such as Talonflame's Brave Bird, also do a lot of damage to Darkrai.
