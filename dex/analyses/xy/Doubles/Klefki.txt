Overview
########

Klefki's access to Prankster and numerous support moves make it one of the better support Pokemon in Doubles. Firstly, Prankster in combination with dual screens allows Klefki to aid setup sweepers such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Tyranitar with ease, allowing them to take hits more easily and increase their chances of sweeping. Klefki also has other great support moves such as Safeguard and Thunder Wave, with the former being very effective in combination with Swagger, as it can give your teammate a +2 Attack boost. Klefki's Steel / Fairy typing is also stellar, giving it numerous resistances, two immunities, and only two weaknesses. Klefki can even utilize Foul Play to deal large amounts of damage to the opponent without having to invest in its offensive stats. Unfortunately, once Klefki has set up its support moves, it tends to be a dead weight unless it can target something with Foul Play. Klefki's base stats are also quite poor, with no base stat being above 95. Finally, while Klefki only has two weaknesses in Ground and Fire, these weaknesses are to two of the most common spread moves in Doubles, Earthquake and Heat Wave, respectively.

Dual Screens
########
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Light Screen
move 2: Reflect
move 3: Thunder Wave / Safeguard
move 4: Foul Play
ability: Prankster
item: Light Clay
evs: 252 HP / 64 Def / 192 SpD
nature: Bold

Moves
========

Light Screen and Reflect allow Klefki to weaken incoming attacks for itself and its teammates, helping setup sweepers and giving frailer attackers more longevity. Thunder Wave is a helpful move to cripple faster attackers and works well when Klefki is paired with slower setup sweepers such as Azumarill and Mega Scizor. Safeguard protects Klefki's teammates from status, further aiding them in setting up. This works best with Pokemon that hate paralysis or burns, such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Tyranitar. Foul Play is used in the last slot, as it doesn't require Klefki to invest in a offensive stat, making it Klefki's best attacking option.

Set Details
========

The EV spread guarantees Klefki will survive Modest Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave behind Light Screen, with the rest of the EVs put in Defense for added bulk. Light Clay is used to keep dual screens up for longer, while Prankster is used to give priority to Klefki's support moves.

Usage Tips
========

Klefki tends to work best early- to mid-game in order to set up dual screens and allow its teammates to better take hits. Thunder Wave Klefki can also be saved for late-game as a last resort against setup sweepers. Make sure to use Reflect against physical attackers, Light Screen against special attackers, and Safeguard against status users.

Team Options
========

Setup sweepers appreciate dual screen support to more easily set up. Common setup sweepers include Mega Charizard X, (Mega) Tyranitar, Mega Gyarados, and Azumarill. These Pokemon also can take incoming Fire-type attacks, making them even more helpful. Frail attackers such as Shaymin-S, Excadrill and Genesect appreciate the ability to take an extra hit, allowing them to further damage the opponent. Mega Kangaskhan makes for a good teammate, especially if Klefki is using Safeguard, as it appreciates the immunity to burn and can take hits extremely well under dual screens. It also has Fake Out to help Klefki set up its support moves. Intimidate and Snarl support from the likes of Hitmontop, Salamence, Suicune, and Raikou can help Klefki survive longer, while rain support from Politoed helps Klefki better deal with Fire-types. In general, Pokemon that can deal with Klefki's two weaknesses such as Rotom-W, Latios, Talonflame, Salamence, and Mega Charizard Y make for good partners. Lastly, Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Tyranitar, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T can distract Thundurus and prevent it from using Taunt on Klefki.

Safeguard Support
########
name: Safeguard Support
move 1: Safeguard
move 2: Swagger
move 3: Foul Play
move 4: Protect / Thunder Wave
ability: Prankster
item: Sitrus Berry
evs: 252 HP / 164 Def / 94 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
======

Safeguard is a great move for protecting teammates from status, which is especially helpful for setup Pokemon that want as much power and Speed possible. When paired with Safeguard, Swagger allows Klefki to give its teammate a free +2 Attack boost. It can also confuse the opponent, though the Attack raise makes this very risky against physical attackers. Foul Play is Klefki's best way to damage the opponent as it deals a large amount to Pokemon with high Attack stats. It also does a lot of damage to Pokemon that have had their Attack stat raised by Swagger. Protect allows for Klefki to scout for attacks, punish double targeting, and protect itself from spread moves such as Earthquake and Heat Wave. Thunder Wave can also be used in the last slot to cripple faster attackers.

Set Details
==========

The EV spread with a Calm nature ensures Klefki will survive an Adamant Earthqauke from Landorus-T and Substitute Heatran's Heat Wave. Sitrus Berry is used for added longevity, while Prankster is used to allow Klefki's support moves to go first.

Usage Tips
==========

This set focuses on setting up Safeguard to protect Klefki's teammates from status, and then using Swagger to give them an Attack boost. Only use Swagger on your teammates when Safeguard has been set up, or else they have a 50% chance of doing a large amount of damage to themselves. Swagger should only be used against your opponent's as a last resort and should never be relied on to deal with a target. It can be used, however, if Klefki is out against special attackers and has no other way to support its team.

Team Options
============

Pokemon that appreciate an Attack boost such as Mega Kangaskhan, Terrakion, and Conkeldurr all appreciate Klefki's ability to use Prankster Safeguard + Swagger. Pokemon that hate status such as Mega Gyarados, (Mega) Tyranitar, Azumarill, and Mega Lucario all love Safeguard support. Rotom-W, Talonflame, Latios, Salamence, and Mega Charizard Y all either resist or are immune to Klefki's two weaknesses, Fire and Ground, making them great partners. Water-types such as Azumarill and Keldeo can take Fire-type attacks for Klefki and have a super effective STAB move for Ground-types, making them helpful teammates. Heatran receives a boost from Fire-type attacks, so Klefki appreciates it as a partner. Klefki hates Prankster Taunt from Thundurus, making Mamoswine, Tyranitar, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T good partners to help deal with Thundurus.

Other Options
########

While Klefki usually relies on Foul Play for damage, it does have quite a few usable STAB attacks. Play Rough hits hard and does good damage to Pokemon with lower Defense stats, such as Latios. For special attacks, Dazzling Gleam hits both opponents, Moonblast has a high Base Power with a chance to lower Special Attack, while Draining Kiss can give a small amount of recovery. Flash Cannon is another option if Klefki needs a Steel-type STAB attack. Rain Dance and Sunny Day are usable if Klefki is being used on a weather team. A ChestoRest set is an option for recovery, though this takes up a move and an item slot, making it not worth it most of the time. Switcheroo can be used in combination with a choice item or Lagging Tail to cripple your opponent's Pokemon. Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers, especially Mega Kangaskhan, which tends to use Fake Out against Klefki to prevent it from setting up. Metal Sound lowers the opponents Special Defense stat, helping special attackers in netting KOs. Confide lowers the opponent's Special Attack, weakening it and making it easier for Klefki to support its team. Lastly, Occa Berry is an option to better take Fire-type attacks from the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Heatran.

Checks & Counters
########

**Utility Moves**: While Klefki can act before most utility moves thanks to Prankster, they still give it trouble. Taunt completely shuts down Klefki, as it stops it from using any of its support moves. Thundurus and Whimsicott get a special mention, as they can outspeed Klefki with their own Prankster Taunt. Other Taunt users such as Gyarados, Terrakion, and Keldeo can also limit Klefki to the use of only one support move. Encore from the likes of Politoed and Togekiss also stops Klefki cold, as locking Klefki into something such as Reflect makes it absolutely useless. Whimsicott can also use Prankster Encore to shut Klefki down before it can use another attack. If Klefki lacks Safeguard, sleep can also prevent it from doing its job; common sleep users include Amoonguss, Breloom, and Venusaur. Substitute users such as Heatran and Kyurem-B can also avoid Thunder Wave and proceed to attack Klefki. However, Klefki's Thunder Wave has priority, so they must set up a Substitute before Klefki uses Thunder Wave. Fake Out in combination with a powerful super effective attack can also deal with Klefki, as Fake Out prevents it from setting up a screen to survive an incoming attack.

**Offensive Type Advantage**: Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp can severely damage Klefki with Earthquake. Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Chandelure, and Heatran can also hit Klefki with a powerful STAB attack, and Chandelure can even utilize Infiltrator to bypass Klefki's dual screens. However, they all dislike Thunder Wave.

**Defensive Pokemon**: Any Pokemon that takes little damage from Foul Play and doesn't mind Thunder Wave makes a good answer to Klefki. Conkeldurr is a notable example, as not only does it resist Foul Play, but actually benefits from Thunder Wave thanks to Guts. Other Pokemon like this include Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Zapdos.
