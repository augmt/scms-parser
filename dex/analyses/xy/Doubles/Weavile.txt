Overview
########

Weavile sports great Speed and Attack stats, making it an excellent choice for teams that aim to pile offensive pressure on the opponent. It boasts the fastest unboosted Fake Out in the metagame, which allows it to support teammates and disrupt opposing strategies. Weavile's STAB attacks provide fairly rounded coverage and hit a multitude of common threats such as Landorus-T, Cresselia, and Shaymin-S. However, its defenses are almost non-existent, meaning most neutral hits will OHKO it, and it carries a typing riddled with weaknesses to common offensive types such as Fire, Fighting, and Rock. This makes Weavile hard to switch in and forces it to run a Focus Sash so that it can stay on the field for more than one turn.

Moves
========

Fake Out allows Weavile to provide excellent support to teammates; by targeting opposing Fake Out users or other threatening Pokemon, Weavile can buy its partner a free turn to attack or set up. Knock Off is an excellent STAB move that complements Fake Out superbly by hitting the Ghost-type Pokemon that are immune to it. It also removes items such as Sitrus Berry and Choice Scarf from opposing Pokemon, thus making it easier for teammates to muscle through them. Weavile's Ice Punch can OHKO non-bulky variants of Landorus-T, the premier Intimidate user in the Doubles metagame, but it must be wary of a Choice Scarf set with U-turn. It also provides coverage against Dragon-types such as Salamence and Garchomp. Ice Shard is a useful priority move that can be used to pick off weakened threats. It also helps Weavile handle faster threats such as Shaymin-S and Choice Scarf variants of Landorus-T. Protect helps Weavile scout for moves and avoid taking damage whilst teammates deal with the threat at hand. Low Kick can be used to hit a multitude of threats for good damage if you aren't worried about throwing away Weavile after it has performed its duties as a lead. Notable examples include Mega Kangaskhan, Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Heatran. These Pokemon can usually wall Weavile and easily switch into a Fake Out.

Set Details
========

The EV spread allows Weavile to hit as hard and fast as possible. Focus Sash helps  make up for Weavile's lackluster defensive stats by allowing it to survive more than one hit. This ensures it can have as much impact on the game as possible and at least manage to fire off an extra attack before going down.

Usage Tips
========

Weavile typically functions best as a lead. Thanks to its high Speed stat and access to Fake Out, it can disrupt opposing strategies and also provide setup opportunities for teammates. Weavile should then continue to maintain high offensive pressure, allowing its partner to maintain Substitutes or fire off powerful attacks. It is difficult to find switch-in opportunities for Weavile, so it is best off coming in once a teammate goes down and acting as a revenge killer.

Team Options
========

Substitute users such as Heatran and Kyurem-B appreciate the offensive support provided by Weavile. Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon are both great choices for partner Pokemon, as Weavile provides opportunities for them to spam their Pixilate-boosted spread attacks. It also helps them by handling Steel-type Pokemon with Low Kick. Weavile makes for a great partner to Deoxys-A thanks to its fast Fake Out, which allows the latter to fire off a powerful attack the first turn itself. Terrakion and other Fighting-types benefit from Weavile's ability to remove Psychic-types and Ghost-types with its STAB Knock Off. Fake Out also buys Terrakion a turn to set up a Substitute.

Other Options
########

Weavile can use Life Orb to increase its damage output, but this doesn't pick up any notable OHKOs and is generally outclassed by Focus Sash. Pickpocket can be used to steal items after Weavile's Focus Sash has been used, but it runs the risk of picking up unwanted items such as Choice Scarf or Life Orb. Icicle Crash is a stronger Ice-type STAB attack, but it is incompatible with Knock Off. If you wish to run Icicle Crash, Night Slash is the recommended Dark-type STAB attack. Swords Dance can be used to boost Weavile's Attack, but it is difficult to find setup opportunities. Taunt is a good option that helps Weavile avoid Will-O-Wisp, and it also disrupts strategies such as Follow Me and Trick Room. Weavile can use Beat Up on a partner Pokemon with the ability Justified, such as Terrakion, to boost its Attack to a high level. It can use Feint to support its teammates by breaking through Protect, Wide Guard, and Quick Guard.

Checks & Counters
########

**Intimidate and Burns**: Intimidate is a big issue for Weavile. Whilst it can handle Landorus-T fairly well, Hitmontop and Scrafty both switch in very easily and lower Weavile's Attack stat. Weavile needs to be wary of Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon such as Rotom-W too, as the Attack drop will render it almost useless.

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Fighting-types such as Hitmontop, Scrafty, and Conkeldurr all threaten Weavile with their STAB attacks. Mach Punch in particular is a big threat to Weavile. Fire-types such as Charizard, Heatran, and Rotom-H can also switch into Weavile with ease and proceed to OHKO it. A particularly notable example is Mega Kangaskhan, which can easily OHKO Weavile with Power-Up Punch, even through its Focus Sash.

**Defensive Typing Advantage**: Bulky Pokemon that resist Weavile's STAB attacks can easily sponge any hit and take it down with even neutral attacks. Examples include Politoed, Mega Mawile, and Gyarados.

**Opposing Weather**: The chip damage provided by sandstorm breaks Weavile's Focus Sash, making it much easier to handle.

**Speed**: Faster threats such as Deoxys-A and Mega Manectric can easily pick off Weavile. Choice Scarf users such as Genesect can also handle it with ease.

**Speed Control**: Since Weavile relies on its high Speed stat to do its job, every form of speed control is effective against it. Tailwind, Thunder Wave, and Trick Room all make it easier to take down.
