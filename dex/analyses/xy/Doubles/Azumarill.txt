Overview
########

Azumarill's Water / Fairy retyping was extremely beneficial for it, as it gained a slew of useful resistances and a great STAB combination that few Pokemon resist. Only three common Pokemon resist Azumarill's STAB combination: Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn, with the latter two hit hard by its coverage moves. Coupled with the power boost it gets from its ability and its solid attacking options, Azumarill is a fairly bulky Water-type pivot that is capable of dealing serious damage. Unfortunately, despite its access to Aqua Jet, its poor Speed stat holds it back somewhat, ensuring that in an offensive environment, it almost always moves last. This makes it fairly easy to check, as there are quite a few Pokemon that can outspeed Azumarill, sponge an Aqua Jet, and deal serious damage to it. Azumarill is also susceptible to Intimidate and the burn status, both of which severely reduce its attacking capabilities. All in all though, Azumarill will definitely make an impact on many of the games that it is a part of.

Physical Attacker
########
name: Megabus (Physical Attacker)
move 1: Play Rough
move 2: Waterfall / Belly Drum
move 3: Aqua Jet
move 4: Protect
ability: Huge Power
item: Sitrus Berry
evs: 164 HP / 252 Atk / 92 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Play Rough, a powerful 90 Base Power attack (135 Base Power after STAB), is the main attack for this set. When coming off of Azumarill's immense Attack, it easily makes short work of many unprepared teams, and its ability to lower the opponent's Attack stat can be very useful at times. Waterfall is the secondary Water-type STAB attack that has near-perfect coverage with Play Rough. It has better accuracy than Play Rough and almost as much power, and is generally a more reliable move. Belly Drum can be used in this slot instead, giving Azumarill a high risk, high reward setup move that will quickly enable it to deal even more damage than before. With adequate team support, Azumarill can use this move to boost its Attack to insane levels and easily OHKO many opponents. Aqua Jet rounds off Azumarill's offensive arsenal by quickly taking down weakened foes, making up for its middling Speed stat and helping it function as a great revenge killer. Protect is the last move, and allows Azumarill to protect itself from an opposing attack and buy time for its partner to execute attacks. It also guards Azumarill against its partner's spread moves and stalls out opposing field effects.

Set Details
========

Maximum Attack investment is used to make Azumarill as powerful as possible, while enough Speed investment to outpace 0 Spe Tyranitar and below gives it the ability to tackle most bulkier tanks without sacrificing too much bulk or power. The rest of the EVs are stashed into HP for rounded bulk. Sitrus Berry is used to give Azumarill a bit more longevity, healing 25% of its HP once it's whittled down to below 50%, helping it recover from Belly Drum. Azumarill's natural bulk allows it to survive most neutral attacks, and the Sitrus Berry can often turn 2HKOs into 3HKOs by boosting Azumarill's total usable HP. Lum Berry can also be used to help Azumarill heal off status conditions if necessary. A spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def is preferred for the Belly Drum route, which would appreciate the extra bulk to successfully pull off this costly set up.

Usage Tips
========

Due to its below-average Speed, Azumarill really requires partner support in order to shine. It needs a good partner to buy it time and bulk while it dishes out powerful attacks and sets up, though its natural bulk can allow it to sponge a few neutral hits. In general, it should be brought in against Dragon- and Fighting-types that it can defeat relatively easily or to revenge kill weakened opponents. Due to its typing advantage, it's a good idea to use Azumarill to bait common Intimidate users such as Hitmontop, Landorus-T, and Scrafty and KO them with super effective STAB moves. It's generally best to play Azumarill as a hit-and-run attacker (unless it's running Belly Drum) due to its low Speed and high attack power. It isn't really as much of a flat-out sweeper as it is a revenge killer and pivot.

Team Options
========

Hitmontop is a great partner for Azumarill, as Fake Out and Intimidate buy it a lot of time and bulk, increasing its longevity. Hitmontop also has Wide Guard, which is useful in stopping opposing Discharge users. Other Intimidate users such as Scrafty and Landorus-T are great partners as well. Partners that can target Electric-, Poison-, and Grass-types are really useful to help cover Azumarill's weaknesses. Ground-types are notable partners as Earthquake can target multiple threats at once while Azumarill uses Protect. Azumarill loves the company of status users: it greatly appreciates paralysis support as well as the free turns it can get from a partner's Spore. Rage Powder/Follow Me users are vital for Azumarill's success should it use Belly Drum, as they can redirect attacks and give it the valuable window it needs to set up safely. Amoonguss is a notable user as it walls Electric-types and can spread status, but unfortunately, it can't do much against Grass-types. This set could also work well with Trick Room, as Azumarill's low Speed makes it very fast while the field effect is active. If run with Trick Room support, Azumarill should use a Brave nature with minimum Speed investment. Dual screens users are helpful as they increase Azumarill's bulk, allowing it an easier setting up. Helping Hand users can boost Azumarill's power, helping it reach some key KOs and revenge kill a greater number of Pokemon. Jirachi is an awesome partner because it can provide Azumarill with Follow Me, Trick Room, Helping Hand, speed control, and dual screens support, while also walling Grass- and Poison-types. Azumarill in turn can handle Fire-, Dark-, and Ground-types that threaten Jirachi.

Choice Band
########
name: Choice Band
move 1: Aqua Jet
move 2: Play Rough
move 3: Waterfall
move 4: Ice Punch / Superpower
ability: Huge Power
item: Choice Band
evs: 164 HP / 252 Atk / 92 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

While it may not be Azumarill's main STAB attack of choice, Aqua Jet is arguably one of the most important moves on its Choice Band set. As a priority move, it remedies Azumarill's poor Speed stat and helps chip off HP from weakened opponents. Aqua Jet has decent power, letting Azumarill take down even mildly weakened opponents and making it a very reliable revenge killer. Play Rough and Waterfall are next on the list as Azumarill's main STAB attacks. Both hit with a lot of power, have good coverage, and have useful secondary effects. When Azumarill holds a Choice Band, few Pokemon can sponge multiple attacks from it unless they resist its chosen move. The last slot is only for coverage on specific threats, as Azumarill's STAB moves do more damage most of the time. Ice Punch hits Grass-types, most notably Amoonguss, which would otherwise wall this set. Superpower smacks Steel-types, namely Ferrothorn, and OHKOes Mega Kangaskhan. However, it's riskier to be locked into Superpower, so it should only be used in those specific situations.

Set Details
========

Choice Band is used to grant an immediate boost to Azumarill's Attack stat, giving it explosive power and the ability to revenge kill a much wider range of opponents. Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature make Azumarill as powerful as possible, and the Speed EVs let it outspeed uninvested base 61s and below, beating key threats such as Tyranitar. The remaining EVs are put into HP for additional bulk.

Usage Tips
========

In contrast with the Belly Drum set, this set's purpose is to deal as much damage as possible as quickly as possible without the need to set up first. Azumarill's powerful Aqua Jet makes it a powerful revenge killer capable of taking down a lot of neutral targets with moderate health. Due to its destructive nature, it is possible to play a little more recklessly with this set and let it punch major holes in opposing teams. Be careful, however, as this set is a lot more vulnerable to offensive strategies than the Belly Drum set is. It simply needs to take advantage of opportunities presented to fire off powerful STAB attacks at its opponents. A hit-and-run playstyle can also be used to great effect. As with all Choice-locked Pokemon, partner support is key to cover for Azumarill's weaknesses once its job is done and to ward off potential counters.

Team Options
========

The Choice Band set relies heavily on partner support. Because Azumarill is susceptible to opposing type advantages after revealing its set, teammates that can tackle Grass-, Steel-, and Poison-types are highly recommended. Fire-types are great partners, and Heatran in particular supports Azumarill well with its powerful Heat Wave, blasting away Steel- and Grass-types that Azumarill lures in. Trick Room setters are also great partners for this set, as the field effect helps mitigate Azumarill's low Speed. Heatran again pairs particularly well with Azumarill in Trick Room, and together they make a very capable offensive core. Azumarill can aid Fire-types by warding off Ground-, Rock-, Dragon-, and Fire-types. Partners that can handle Electric-types are great as well. Ground-types such as Landorus-T help take down Electric- and Steel-types, and can use Intimidate to lower the opponents' Attack. This set doesn't require setup opportunities, but it does appreciate lures that buy it opportunities to hit hard. Dual screens setters are helpful as they increase Azumarill's bulk, making it easier to switch in and out. Helping Hand users can boost Azumarill's power and help it reach some key KOs and revenge kill a greater number of Pokemon. Jirachi provides Azumarill with lots of useful support, as it walls Grass- and Poison-type opponents and can offer Follow Me, dual screens, Helping Hand, Trick Room, and speed control support. Keep in mind that due to this set's lack of Protect, it is susceptible to its partner's spread moves.

Other Options
########

Azumarill has a few other options it can use. Splash or Pixie Plate can be used to slightly boost the power of Azumarill's STAB attacks. Leftovers can be used in tandem with Substitute, whereas Life Orb can be used for a significant power boost at the cost of recoil damage. Knock Off is good coverage move against Ghost-types and removes opposing items. Encore is an option to buy opportunities for Azumarill to set up. Aqua Tail can be used instead of Waterfall for more power at the cost of accuracy and the flinch chance. Finally, Azumarill can use Helping Hand to aid its partner.

Checks & Counters
########

**Grass-types**: Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn all resist Azumarill's STAB attacks and can cripple it with status or take it down with Grass-type attacks. Venusaur gets a special mention as it is neutral to Azumarill's coverage moves. Pokemon with Grass-type coverage moves can check Azumarill as well; for example, Mega Charizard Y can weaken its Water-type attacks with Drought and KO it with Solarbeam.

**Bulky Water-types**: Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Jellicent can wall Azumarill and burn it with Scald. Rotom-W gets a special mention as it can KO Azumarill with its Electric-type attacks or simply burn it with Will-O-Wisp.

**Faster Pokemon**: Faster Pokemon that can take an Aqua Jet and deal lots of damage back are good checks. Thundurus-T is a great example, as it can deal a lot of damage with its powerful, super effective Thunderbolt. Shaymin-S is a good counter as well, easily sponging an Aqua Jet and OHKOing with Seed Flare. Generally, Pokemon with adequate amounts of bulk, no weakness to Water-type attacks, and powerful, moderately fast attacks fall into this category.

**Status**: Azumarill is shut down by almost all forms of status. Burns cripple it beyond repair and paralysis severely hinders its usefulness, especially in times where its Aqua Jet is crucial. Toxic isn't as annoying but due to the prevalence of Protect stalling and Azumarill's lack of recovery, it can quickly wear Azumarill down.

**Intimidate**: Although Azumarill can hit most Intimidate users hard, their ability to lower Azumarill's Attack can be very annoying if said Intimidate user is played very actively. Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Landorus-T can pivot in and out and gradually lower Azumarill's Attack stat until it is no longer a threat. Mawile also has the advantage of being able to hit it fairly hard with Iron Head. However, many Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Scrafty have to be careful when switching in because they are weak to Azumarill's STAB moves.

**Indirect Damage**: Azumarill isn't particularly powerful, but it lacks recovery, making it relatively easy to wear down. It is susceptible to all kinds of weather and takes noticeable damage from Pokemon with Iron Barbs and Rough Skin. The fact that it already has to sponge a few hits due to its low Speed severely cuts down on its longevity.
