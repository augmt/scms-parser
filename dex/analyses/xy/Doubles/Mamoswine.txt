Overview
########

Mamoswine has great neutral coverage with just its two STAB moves, as they are only resisted by a few Pokemon, such as the Rotom formes. Its STAB moves also net super effective coverage against many Pokemon in the metagame. Mamoswine's base 130 Attack stat is nothing to mess around with and its great ability Thick Fat helps it take super effective Fire-type hits better. Mamoswine can deal with many common threats in the metagame, such as Garchomp, Heatran, Shaymin-S, and Landorus-T. Thanks to its Ice / Ground typing, it is a great solution to most Electric-types such as Thundurus and Zapdos; however, Mamoswine loses to Rotom-W and Rotom-H. If Mamoswine can't hit an opponent for super effective damage there's a very high chance that it will be KOed because Mamoswine has low Special Defense and Defense stats. Mamoswine has mediocre Speed and weaknesses to common types such as Fighting, Grass, and Water. Intimidate and burns give it some problems as well.

All-Out Attacker
########
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Ice Shard
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Icicle Crash / Superpower / Icicle Spear
move 4: Protect
ability: Thick Fat
item: Life Orb / Focus Sash
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant / Jolly

Moves
========

Ice Shard is used because Mamoswine has mediocre Speed; it does around 70% to 4 HP / 0 Def Landorus-T, which is pretty decent, and allows Mamoswine to pick off most weakened threats. It also makes Mamoswine a reliable check to Skymin, but it can't switch into it. Earthquake is a powerful STAB spread movethat provides almost perfect coverage with an Ice-type move. Even though it is less accurate, Icicle Crash is more powerful than Icicle Spear usually, being more reliable with an added 30% flinch chance, making Mamoswine a reliable answer to Amoonguss. Protect disrupts offensive strategies and helps to stall out Trick Room, sun, and rain turns. Superpower can be used over Icicle Crash to hit Ferrothorn, Mega Kanghaskan, Scrafty, and Rotom formes for a decent amount of damage if you're willing to give up a strong Ice-type STAB move and have just Ice Shard.


Set Details
========

The EVs are simple: 252 in Attack with an Adamant nature for immediate power, while 252 in Speed are used to Speed tie with Chandelure and to outspeed Adamant Bisharp and Breloom. Life Orb can be used for immediate power at the cost of survivability. Jolly can be used over Adamant to reliably outspeed Breelom and Bisharp, while Life Orb allows Mamoswine to OHKO Garchomp and Salamence and 2HKO Mega Manectric at -1 Attack with Earthquake + Ice Shard. Mamoswine has mediocre bulk, so a Focus Sash helps a lot versus Pokemon that can outspeed and OHKO it, such as Terrakion.

Usage Tips
========

Beware of random coverage moves such as Landorus-T's Superpower. Don't switch Mamoswine in on most attacks because of its frailer defenses; for example, versus Landorus-T, Mamoswine can take a Rock Slide and KO with Ice Shard, but should avoid taking multiple Earthquakes. Mamoswine benefits from Speed control and redirectors, especially with the Life Orb, as without Focus Sash, it is easily OHKOed if outsped. Mamoswine doesn't mind eating up some spread-reduced moves or non-super effective attacks; it can take a Heat Wave in the sun. Rock Slide works great on the Focus Sash set as a last resort answer to Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona. The Life Orb set needs much more support, such as Speed control and redirectors, to be as effective. Focus Sash makes Mamoswine a great late-game cleaner and allows it to be a reliable answer to threats that manage to set up against its team.


Team Options
========

Mega Charizard Y is a great partner, as it is immune to Earthquake, can KO most of Mamoswine's checks such as Landorus-T and Heatran, and removes Mamoswine's Water-type weakness. Mamoswine hates bulky Water-types, so anything that can take those down is a good partner; some examples are Shaymin-S and Thundurus, which are both immune to Earthquake as well. Aegislash can use Wide Guard to protect itself from Mamoswine's Earthquake, KO Terrakion, heavily dent Cresselia and Rotom-W, and deal with Fairies and Trick Room. Amoonguss resists all of Mamoswine's weaknesses except for Ice and Fire, therefore it can redirect most hits to itself and also put foes to sleep. While Togekiss can also redirect attacks, it doesn't resist many types, but can set up Tailwind and allow Mamoswine to spam Earthquake; the choice depends on what you need more. Hitmontop can spam Wide Guard and protect Mamoswine from Heat Wave and Rock Slide and use Fake Out and Helping Hand. Mamoswine loves all kinds of Speed control, such as Thunder Wave from Thundurus or Tailwind from Talonflame. It also appreciates a partner that can use Fake Out to stun a faster opposing Pokemon and allow Mamoswine to take it out. Due to Mamoswine's low Speed, it won't be able to outspeed and KO many Pokemon, so it appreciates a fast offensive partner such as Talonflame, Latios, or Deoxys-A to do that for it.


Other Options
########

Choice Scarf is another nice option on Mamoswine, but it is outclassed by other Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Excadrill. Knock Off can be used instead of Superpower, as it gives Mamoswine an edge against opposing Mamoswine and removes opposing items; this is especially useful against a Pokemon holding a Choice item or an Assault Vest. Stone Edge can be considered over Rock Slide for more power, but Rock Slide is generally the best option, as it is a spread move, has a good 30% flinch chance, and is more accurate. Assault Vest can also be considered, as it allows Mamoswine to withstand powerful attacks such as Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave while also having more coverage than the All-Out Attacker set by having both Rock Slide and Superpower.


Checks & Counters
########

**Utility Moves**: Hitmontop and Aegislash don't mind taking any attacks from Mamoswine and can spam Wide Guard to stop Earthquake and OHKO Mamoswine with their STAB moves. Fake Out can cripple Mamoswine's Focus Sash set by breaking its Focus Sash, thus not allowing Mamoswine to safey KO Pokemon that outspeed it.

**Intimidate and Burns**: Hitmontop and Scrafty can come in on any move, lower Mamoswine's Attack with Intimidate, and deal heavy damage with their STAB moves. Rotom-H can come in on any move and burn Mamoswine, making it offensively useless.

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Azumarill, and Rotom-W can come in on any move and deal tons of damage with their Water-type STAB moves. Fighting-types such as Breelom, Terrakion, Conkeldurr, and others can deal heavy damage with their STAB moves. Levitate users and Flying-types that don't mind Ice-type attacks, such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, are great checks to Mamoswine. Almost all Pokemon that can outspeed or tank a hit from Mamoswine make for a good check, such as Scizor with Bullet Punch or Keldeo with its STAB moves.

**Speed Control**: Mamoswine's Choice Scarf set is ruined by Trick Room and Tailwind, as it relies on Speed to KO Pokemon. Watch out for common Trick Room users such as Cresselia, Aromatisse, and the rare Bronzong.
