Overview
########

Salamence returns for another generation of Doubles as a powerful special attacker with support potential. Intimidate and Tailwind allow it to help out its allies, while its incredible movepool and solid offensive stats allow it to threaten its enemies. Salamence receives competition from Hydreigon or Latios as a specially attacking Dragon-type, but its ability is what really sets it apart. In truth, Intimidate and Salamence's fortunate typing are the main reasons to use Salamence over either of these Pokemon.

However, despite its large special movepool, Salamence's Special Attack is only decent. Its most powerful STAB, Draco Meteor, forces it to switch out constantly, although Intimidate turns this constant switching into an advantage. Salamence would love to run a physically attacking set, but the prominence of Intimidate and burn and the unreliable nature of Outrage leave something to be desired. Its Dragon / Flying typing leaves holes both offensively and defensively, as it has no viable Flying-type attacks, and its weakness to Ice-, Fairy-, and Rock-type attacks severely hinder how freely it can be used.


Special Attacker
########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Protect
move 4: Hydro Pump / Tailwind
ability: Intimidate
item: Life Orb / Yache Berry
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid / Modest

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is a STAB heavy nuke, hitting many Pokemon hard. Fire Blast sears through the Steel-types that resist Draco Meteor, such as Aegislash and Scizor. Protect is a staple of Doubles because it gives Salamence a free turn of safety. During this turn, Salamence's partner can take out whatever is threatening Salamence. Hydro Pump hits Fire-, Ground-, and Rock-types much harder than Draco Meteor or Fire Blast, specifically Heatran, which resists Draco Meteor and is immune to Fire Blast because of Flash Fire. Tailwind doubles the Speed of Salamence and its allies for four turns, which can help slower Pokemon keep up with faster threats.

Set Details
========

Maximum EVs should be invested into Special Attack and Speed to increase Salamence's damage potential. Life Orb increases Salamence's damage output significantly, but Yache Berry covers for Salamence's Ice-type weakness. Ice is common for an attacking type in Doubles, so Yache Berry can be a lifesaver. If Salamence is running Life Orb, it should only run 29 HP IVs in order to minimize recoil damage. If Salamence is running Yache Berry, though, it should run full HP IVs. Timid increases Speed while Modest increases Special Attack, both at the expense of Attack. The increased Speed that Timid provides should be used to keep up with base 100 Speed Pokemon, like Mega Charizard Y and Mega Kangaskhan. Intimidate lowers the Attack of both opposing Pokemon, which can inhibit a lot of would-be threats.

Usage Tips
========

Protect helps Salamence avoid dangerous attacks like Fake Out, and Tailwind helps slower allied Pokemon take out faster enemies. Salamence should switch in, use Draco Meteor, nuking a Pokemon, then switch out to rid itself of the Special Attack drop. This also reapplies the Intimidate. Salamence's typing, along with Intimidate and Protect, help it switch in and out with relative ease. There are occasions, however, when Intimidate can be dangerous. Defiant Pokemon, such as Bisharp and Tornadus, get an Attack boost when Intimidated, making them more dangerous as threats.

Team Options
========

Slower Pokemon that benefit from a Speed boost give Salamence purpose in carrying Tailwind. Some examples are Heatran, Excadrill, Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Heracross, and Sylveon; what you want are slower Pokemon with bulk and offensive capability that just need Speed to be a threat. These Pokemon are also helped out by Intimidate. Fake Out support from Kangaskhan and Hitmontop can give Salamence a free turn, which is useful to set up Tailwind or use a super effective attack. Hitmontop can also provide Wide Guard and Helping Hand support, but the second Intimidate can be dangerous considering the prominence of Bisharp. Helping Hand users, such as Cresselia and Jirachi, help increase Salamence's damage output. Pokemon that Salamence can switch to that absorb Ice-type attacks, like Rotom-W and Suicune, make good partners. Steel-type Pokemon, such as Jirachi, Heatran, and Aegislash, can take out Ice- and Fairy-type Pokemon with ease, as well as resist Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks. Jirachi can use Follow Me to redirect super effective attacks aimed at Salamence while resisting all of Salamence's weaknesses. Aegislash provides Wide Guard support, which is excellent at deterring Rock Slide, Icy Wind, and Pixilate Hyper Voice. Bisharp deters Icy Wind through Defiant while also benefiting immensely from Tailwind, due to its middling Speed. Scizor deals with Latios and Latias, as well as Terrakion, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Weavile.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Draco Meteor
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Hydro Pump
move 4: Stone Edge
ability: Intimidate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Draco Meteor is an immensely powerful STAB attack. Fire Blast is used in order to destroy Steel-types that resist Draco Meteor. Hydro Pump deals with Landorus-T, as well as several dangerous Fire-types, such as Heatran, which resist Draco Meteor and Fire Blast. Despite being a physical move in a special set, Stone Edge merits use because it hits for 4x damage against some extremely common Pokemon, specifically Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona. Although Rock Slide may seem like a better move to have, the damage it deals it minuscule and isn't worth the moveslot.

Set Details
========

Use Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs to pose the biggest threat to opposing Pokemon. A Choice Scarf increases Salamence's Speed dramatically, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Modest increases Special Attack at the expense of Attack, though Timid can be used to outspeed Choice Scarf Genesect and +2 base 70 Speed Pokemon, like Ludicolo in the rain or Bisharp with Tailwind, but the power drop is noticeable. Attack EVs or an Attack-positive nature are not necessary, as Stone Edge should OHKO Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona, with no investment. Intimidate lowers the Attack of both opposing Pokemon, which can improve the longevity of Salamence and its team.

Usage Tips
========

If all attacks hit neutrally, Draco Meteor will hit for the most damage, so that is the preferred means of attack. However, the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor will start to become apparent with increased usage, so be prepared to switch Salamence out. Because of this, Salamence's gameplay will be hit-and-run, coming in, Intimidating the enemies, firing off a Draco Meteor, then switching out to undo the Special Attack drop. It switches in and out with relative ease, due to its defensive typing and Intimidate. Be careful what move you lock Salamence into, as often times the wrong move could mean the game. Stone Edge is solely intended for 4x damage against Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona, and won't deal much damage otherwise. Do not Intimidate Bisharp, Tornadus, or any other Defiant or Competitive Pokemon, because they will get a boost and deal tons of damage. Rage Power, Quick Guard, or Follow Me can help Salamence to avoid a Defiant-boosted Sucker Punch, and Salamence's Fire Blast can OHKO Bisharp.

Team Options
========

While Choice Scarf Salamence is fast, there are still faster Pokemon, so Pokemon that can check or counter these Pokemon are useful. For example, Heatran can take out Timid Choice Scarf Genesect. Cresselia and Jirachi are great as Helping Hand users, increasing Salamence's damage output. Steel-type Pokemon, like Heatran, Jirachi, and Aegislash, deal with Ice- and Fairy-types with their super effective attacks. They are also immensely useful for switch-ins, as they resist the Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks that scare Salamence. Jirachi can use Follow Me to redirect super effective attacks aimed at Salamence. Aegislash provides Wide Guard support, which is excellent at deterring Rock Slide, Icy Wind, and Pixilate Hyper Voice, and it can effectively take out the Pokemon that carry these moves. Bisharp deters Icy Wind through Defiant.

Other Options
########

Flamethrower or Heat Wave are both more accurate but weaker than Fire Blast, and Heat Wave can hit both opposing Pokemon. Dragon Pulse is also a more conservative option than Draco Meteor, sacrificing power for consistency and accuracy. Hidden Power Flying and Air Cutter are Salamence's only Flying-type STAB moves, but both of them are bloody weak. Roost can be used on the Life Orb set to compensate for the recoil and residual damage that accumulates over time.

Salamence has an enormous base 135 Attack stat, maning, it can run a Dragon Dance set, increasing its Attack and Speed and then attempting to sweep with its wide physical movepool. Among these moves are some powerful options, including Outrage, Aqua Tail, Earthquake, Crunch, Dragon Claw, Iron Tail, Shadow Claw, and Zen Headbutt. This set's potential power can also be augmented by Moxie, which would increase its power for every Pokemon that it KOes. However, Moxie is considered to be a much less useful ability compared to Intimidate.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Ice-type attacks pose a massive threat to Salamence and are common in Doubles. Thundurus and Mega Manectric commonly carry Hidden Power Ice and easily outpace the special attacker set, but have trouble outspeeding the Choice Scarf set. Abomasnow's or Mamoswine's Ice Shard will OHKO any Salamence without a Yache Berry and has priority to hit Salamence regardless of whether it has a Choice Scarf or not. Fairy-types are immune to Draco Meteor and deal considerable damage to Salamence. Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir especially pose a threat, as their massive special bulk allows them to survive Salamence's other attacks with ease. Azumarill resists Fire Blast and Hydro Pump, is immune to Draco Meteor, and can easily OHKO if it avoids the Intimidate Attack drop. Dragon-types deal super effective damage, and Garchomp or Latios outspeed the special attacker set and can OHKO, while either of them with a Choice Scarf will outspeed the Choice Scarf set. Bisharp and Tornadus have their Attack boosted when Salamence switches in on them. This makes them a problem and discourages Salamence from switching in. Bisharp, for example, can almost always OHKO with a Defiant-boosted Sucker Punch, while Tornadus has a small chance to OHKO with a Defiant-boosted Acrobatics.

**Speed Control**: Icy Wind will not only deal super effective damage to Salamence, it will also slow Salamence and its partner down. Trick Room will make Salamence move last almost all of the time. Salamence is impeded by Thunder Wave or opposing Tailwind, especially on the Choice Scarf set, as it needs to outspeed to be a serious threat.

**Utility**: Priority Encore or priority Taunt from Whimsicott lock the first set into a move or keep Salamence from using Tailwind or Protect, both of which could inhibit Salamence's usefulness. Even merely fast Encores or Taunts can inhibit Salamence's usefulness, but most of the Pokemon that can get off a fast Encore can't comfortably take a Draco Meteor.

**Defensive**: Jirachi and Togekiss can force a Draco Meteor to hit them, either resisting it or taking no damage from it, respectively. They can also easily take all of Salamence's other hits, with the exception of Fire Blast for Jirachi. Pokemon that commonly run Assault Vest, like Scrafty, Ludicolo, or Conkeldurr, are less threatened by Salamence due to their increased bulk, and they carry moves that can threaten Salamence, like Ice Punch or Ice Beam. Pokemon with large special bulk, like Politoed and Cresselia, wall Salamence by taking little damage from its attacks, and both of these Pokemon can even deal super effective damage back with an Ice Beam.
