Overview
########

Aromatisse is one of the more reliable Trick Room setters in Doubles for a number of reasons. The first is its great ability, Aroma Veil, which provides itself and its teammates with an immunity to Taunt, a common way of stopping Trick Room. In combination with Safety Goggles and its good bulk, this makes it very hard to prevent Aromatisse from setting up Trick Room. Secondly, its defensive typing gives it helpful resistances to Dark- and Fighting-type attacks as well as very few weaknesses, making it even harder to stop. Aromatisse's low Speed helps it a lot because it allows it to be quite fast under Trick Room. Finally, its access to helpful support moves such as Heal Pulse, Reflect, and Light Screen means that it's quite capable of supporting its team.

However, there are a good amount of flaws that come with Aromatisse. The first is its low offensive presence, making it dead weight after it has set up Trick Room. Its bulk, while good, isn't the greatest, and it can easily be overpowered by powerful attackers. It also doesn't have access to a reliable recovery move, meaning that it can find itself fainting quite early. Even with these flaws, Aromatisse still cements itself as one of the best Trick Room leads due to its ability to almost guarantee that Trick Room goes up.

Moves
======

Trick Room is the focus of this set, as Aromatisse's helpful ability, typing, and stats make it one of the most reliable setters in the tier. Moonblast is a reliable STAB move, and is preferred over Dazzling Gleam due to how weak Dazzling Gleam is coming from Aromatisse. Heal Pulse is great for healing teammates without reliable recovery, such as Heatran, Conkeldurr, and Escavalier, that tend to find themselves getting worn down easily. If Heal Pulse is not being used, Reflect or Light Screen can be used in the third slot. The choice is up to the user to decide what their team needs more, with each boosting the team's Defense or Special Defense, respectively. Protect is an extremely important move, as it scouts for Fake Out, punishes double targeting, and also adds to Aromatisse's longevity.

Set Details
=========

Aroma Veil is the preferred ability, as it makes Aromatisse immune to one of the most common anti-Trick Room tactics, Taunt. Aroma Veil also protects its teammates from Taunt, meaning that even if it cannot get Trick Room up, there is a good chance that its teammates will be able to. Healer is also a viable option, as most opponents will not Taunt Aromatisse in the first place due to it possibly having Aroma Veil, and it can be helpful for removing burn from the likes of Mega Mawile and Escavalier. Do note, however, that once Healer has been revealed, your opponent will have an easy time stopping Aromatisse with Taunt. Safety Goggles is the preferred item to beat sleep, another common anti-Trick Room tactic. Sitrus Berry can be helpful, however, to keep Aromatisse in the match for longer, though it does make it more vulnerable to Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Venusaur. The EV spread with a Relaxed nature allows Aromatisse to survive Life Orb Bisharp's Iron Head, helping ensure that Trick Room is set up. A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs further increases its Speed to speed it up in Trick Room, allowing it to move before Pokemon like Amoonguss when Trick Room is in effect.

Usage Tips
==========

Aromatisse usually functions best as a Trick Room lead due to its ability to almost guarantee that Trick Room goes up. It does not have to lead, however, and can set up Trick Room later in the game if need be. If led with, Aromatisse can also set up dual screens while its partner sets up Trick Room under the protection of Aroma Veil. If a possible Fake Out user is on the opponent's side of the field, Protect should be used in order to avoid it. It's also best to try to set up Trick Room as soon as possible in order to assist teammates immediately. If Sitrus Berry is used as the item, make sure to be careful of possible sleep inducers, and if Healer is used, make sure to be careful of potential Taunt users. Aromatisse is a Pokemon that should be played very actively, switching in and out to replenish Trick Room and dual screens.

Team Options
============

Slow Pokemon such as Heatran, Aegislash, Conkeldurr, Mega Mawile, Azumarill, Escavalier, and Mega Abomasnow make good partners as they can use Trick Room to its fullest extent. Heatran and Conkeldurr can also defeat Steel-types with their super effective STAB moves, making them even more helpful. Other Trick Room setters such as Cresselia, Reuniclus, Jellicent, Slowking, and Dusclops are also good partners for this set, as they can set up Trick Room after Aromatisse has fainted, and also appreciate Aroma Veil support. Fake Out support from the likes of Hitmontop and Scrafty is helpful, as it can neuter a Pokemon that could possibly KO Aromatisse. Rage Powder and Follow Me support from Amoonguss or Jirachi fall in a similar boat as they draw attacks away from Aromatisse, allowing it to set up Trick Room with greater ease. Lastly, Steel-type Pokemon like Heatran, Aegislash, Ferrothorn, and Escavalier make good partners, as they can easily absorb the Steel- and Poison-type attacks that trouble Aromatisse, while Aromatisse can take the Fighting-type attacks they hate.

Other Options
############

Dazzling Gleam is an option to hit both opponents, though it's laughably weak being a spread move and coming off of Aromatisse's low Special Attack. Wish in combination with Protect can be used for healing, though it takes up a support moveslot, forces Aromatisse to Protect after it uses Wish, and isn't the most reliable move in general. Another form of healing can be found in ChestoRest, though it only works once, and forces Aromatisse to give up Safety Goggles or Sitrus Berry. Light Clay can extend the duration of Light Screen and Reflect, though Aromatisse once again must give up Safety Goggles or Sitrus Berry in order to use it. Misty Terrain is an interesting option, as it prevents status moves and weakens the power of Dragon-type moves. Aromatherapy is another option that heals status. Rain Dance or Sunny Day can be used for weather teams, though Cresselia usually performs this role better due to its higher bulk and Speed. Draining Kiss can recover HP, though it's extremely weak and doesn't recover very much. Calm Mind can be used for boosting, though Sylveon almost always performs this role better. An offensive Life Orb or Choice Specs set can be used to catch the opponent off guard, but once again, Sylveon is usually the better option for this role.

Checks & Counters
##############

**Offensive Type Advantage**: Offensive pressure is easily the best way to stop Aromatisse from setting up Trick Room. Pokemon such as Aegislash, Amoonguss, Mega Mawile, Escavalier, and Mega Scizor do very well in Trick Room and can do a lot of damage to Aromatisse. Heatran can set up a Substitute on Aromatisse with ease, while Choice Band Bisharp can OHKO with Iron Head. Jirachi can reverse Trick Room, use Follow Me to redirect Moonblast, and hit Aromatisse with a STAB Iron Head. Mega Gengar traps Aromatisse and hits it with Sludge Bomb, while other Pokemon such as Genesect, Venusaur, and Metagross, can threaten Aromatisse with a powerful Iron Head, Sludge Bomb, or Meteor Mash, respectively. Overall, anything with good power, recovery, and a neutral typing will usually beat Aromatisse 1v1.

**Utility Moves**: If Aromatisse is not running Safety Goggles, sleep-inducing moves from the likes of Amoonguss, Breloom, and Venusaur can stop Aromatisse quite easily. Fake Out can also stop Aromatisse from setting up Trick Room as well as stall Trick Room turns, with notable users being Mega Kangaskhan, Hitmontop, Scrafty, and Ludicolo. Opposing Trick Room users such as Cresselia can reverse Trick Room in a single turn.
