Overview
########

Whimsicott's ability Prankster and its great support movepool allow it to disrupt the opponent's team while boosting its team's Speed with Tailwind. In addition, it has a blistering base 116 Speed, outspeeding even Thundurus, a more popular Prankster user. Furthermore, its new Fairy typing gives it a much-appreciated immunity and resistance to Dragon and Fighting, respectively, in addition to key resistances to Ground and Water. However, Whimsicott is still plagued by its frailty and lack of offensive presence. A misplay, two unresisted hits, or both can make Taunt bait or mincemeat out of Whimsicott, and you can't expect it to win anything one-on-one.

Moves
========
One of the most important facets of Doubles is Speed control, which Whimsicott easily counteracts with Tailwind. This move allows Whimsicott's partner to get the jump on faster Pokemon, especially Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, as well as counteracting negative effects such as a Speed drop from Icy Wind. Encore and Taunt do similar jobs: Encore interferes with setup sweepers and is disruptive to Pokemon with Trick Room, Fake Out, or Protect, while Taunt is generally better at stopping foes such as Cresselia and Amoonguss from using support moves or setting up Trick Room. Helping Hand gives partners the boost needed to KO an opposing Pokemon. Moonblast stops Whimsicott from being Taunt bait, hitting common Pokemon such as Hitmontop, Scrafty, and Terrakion. Giga Drain's usefulness is relative to its effectiveness; for example, it won't do decent damage or heal Whimsicott if it isn't hitting the foe for super effective damage, but it hits Rotom-W harder than the other options. Protect blocks Fake Out and other priority moves in addition to generally helping Whimsicott survive.

Set Details
========

216 Speed EVs allow Whimsicott to outspeed and Taunt opposing maximum Speed Thundurus before it Taunts Whimsicott. Whismicott can relocate its Speed EVs into its Defense or Special Defense to improve its bulk, but this means Thundurus and Adamant Talonflame will outspeed Whimsicott. Sitrus Berry can be used because Whimsicott will usually switch into resisted attacks and typically survive a number of unresisted hits. Focus Sash can be used instead to allow Whimsicott to survive one more powerful hit, such as Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave or Talonflame's Brave Bird. Maximum HP investment is for all-around longevity, and Defense investment helps Whimsicott take physical spread moves such as Earthquake and Rock Slide.

Usage Tips
========

Cripple something with Encore or Taunt, boost with Tailwind, and, if Whimsicott faints, its teammates can make the most out of the opportunities it creates. Its ability to disrupt common strategies such as Trick Room make it a good choice for a lead. Thanks to its Grass / Fairy typing, you can switch it into Water-, Ground-, Electric-, and Fighting-type Pokemon that only threaten it a little. Moonblast and Giga Drain are last-ditch moves; don't use Whimsicott for offense unless you are backed into a corner or need it to force switches. If Whimsicott is likely to be hit by Fake Out, use Protect first and Tailwind, Taunt, and Encore later. Encore is an obvious choice against setup sweepers, Protect, and Fake Out&mdash;your opponent likely knows this as well, so don't waste Encore on obvious switches, even though it is beneficial to force the foe to use the same move. Taunt stops foes from using Trick Room, Spore, Rage Powder, and Follow Me, giving Whimsicott's partner a free turn to attack.

Team Options
========

Whimsicott is primarily a support Pokemon, so pair it with Pokemon that can take advantage of the opportunities it creates, such as Substitute users like Mega Mawile and Heatran, or setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Mega Gyarados and Mega Kangaskhan. Deoxys-A is an especially terrifying partner that applies relentless offensive pressure. Slower Pokemon that can take advantage of Tailwind, such as Mega Heracross, Mamoswine, and Breloom, make for good partners. Pokemon that hate Speed control, such as Latios, Deoxys-A, and Choice Scarf users, appreciate the Taunt and Tailwind that Whimsicott provides. In return, they force all-important Protects, allowing Whimsicott to safely boost or switch out to maximize offensive potential. Ancient Power Heatran and Rotom-W enjoy Tailwind support and solidly check Talonflame, OHKOing it with Ancient Power and Hydro Pump, respectively.

Other Options
########

Focus Sash + Endeavor could drop a Pokemon into KO range for a partner. Light Screen gives a boost to your team's Special Defense. Beat Up coupled with a user of Justified can often lead to upwards of +6 Attack boosts; the most common abuser of this strategy is Terrakion, while Arcanine is a less common option. Memento drops a foe's Attack and Special Attack to -2 and can be used for when Whimsicott has done all it can. Stun Spore paralyzes foes and is difficult to avoid due to Prankster; it also is able to paralyze threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Excadrill, which are immune to Thunder Wave. U-turn could be used to maintain momentum, and Switcheroo can offload items with negative effects like Iron Ball or Flame Orb onto foes. SubSeed is a nice alternative set, but it is difficult to use in Doubles. Priority Sunny Day with Heat Rock is a good addition to sun teams, and an offensive set with Life Orb + Giga Drain could be run to take advantage of its Speed and movepool, but Whimsicott usually lacks the power to break targets.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Whismsicott is frail in general, so super effective moves make quick work of it, such as Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave, Scizor's Bullet Punch, and Talonflame's Brave Bird. Mega Gengar can trap Whimsicott and hit it hard with Sludge Wave. Fire- and Steel-types such as Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, Rotom-H, Scizor, Excadrill, and Bisharp can threaten to KO Whimsicott with their super effective STAB moves.

**Miscellaneous**: Aromatisse's Aroma Veil stops Whimsicott from using Taunt and Encore. Trick Room setters holding Mental Herb can get away with setting up in Whimsicott's face and can switch out if they fear Encore, and they can turn Tailwind into a liability. Whismicott loses most 1v1 situations mostly due to its damage output; its frailty contributes too but to a lesser degree.
