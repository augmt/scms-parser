Overview
########

Hariyama faces huge competition as a supportive Trick Room Pokemon from Hitmontop and Scrafty, and as an offensive Trick Room Pokemon from Conkeldurr. Hariyama can perform both roles while only taking up one slot on the team, though the fact that it isn't solely dedicated to one of these roles may compromise its effectiveness. A great Attack stat means Hariyama can hit most threats very hard, especially after Flame Orb has been activated. A diverse movepool allows Hariyama to hit multiple threats and fulfill many roles on a Trick Room team. However, Hariyama's longevity is greatly shortened by Flame Orb and its lack of reliable healing options, as well as its underwhelming defenses. In addition, Hariyama's low Speed stat is a huge liability outside of Trick Room, and Hariyama is also one of the slowest Fake Out users.

Moves
========

Fake Out and Protect are both good options to activate Flame Orb in conjunction with their additional utility. Fake Out helps teammates set up Trick Room more easily, and Protect keeps Hariyama alive longer while its teammate sets up Trick Room. Close Combat hits like a truck after Hariyama is burned, heavily damaging or OHKOing Pokemon that don't resist it. Knock Off is a great and powerful Dark-type move; it hits Ghost-types, which are immune to Close Combat, as well as Psychic-types for super effective damage. Access to both Close Combat and Knock Off is Hariyama's biggest niche over Hitmontop and Scrafty. Wide Guard can be used in a similar capacity, negating spread attacks such as Heat Wave, Rock Slide, and Earthquake. Ice Punch allows Hariyama to deal with threats such as Landorus-T, as well as Amoonguss, who loves to mess with Trick Room using its low Speed. Rock Slide can be used if additional coverage is wanted, as it takes care of Pokemon Hariyama otherwise barely could touch, such as Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona.

Set Details
========

The given EV spread is used to maximize Hariyama's attacking power, with the remaining EVs put in Defense and Special Defense to improve Hariyama's general bulk. Flame Orb is used to boost Hariyama's Attack stat by 50% thanks to Guts, while also letting it avoid status ailments such as sleep and paralysis. Hariyama can also use a Sitrus Berry and Guts to absorb Scald and Will-O-Wisp. Flame Orb is used over Toxic Orb as Trick Room attackers can't afford to switch in and out to reduce Toxic's damage; therefore Flame Orb does, in the end, less damage. Thick Fat and Sitrus Berry, together with Rock Slide, can be used to make Hariyama a cool check to Fire-types. 0 Speed IVs and a Brave nature are used to lower Hariyama's Speed as much as possible, allowing Hariyama to outspeed neutral base 30 and faster Pokemon in Trick Room. An Adamant nature and 31 Speed IVs can be used when not using Trick Room, although this results in this set being inferior to Hitmontop.

Usage Tips
========

Trick Room is essential for this set to work properly, as Hariyama's lacking Speed and underwhelming bulk results in faster Pokemon KOing Hariyama before it can attack without Trick Room. Using Fake Out, Hariyama can be easily paired with a Trick Room setter, allowing Trick Room to be set up multiple times throughout the match. Once Trick Room is up, Hariyama becomes a Pokemon that can break down many checks and counters to the team, hitting hard with its STAB and coverage moves. Because of the limited turns of Trick Room and Hariyama's limited longevity because of Flame Orb, Hariyama must be wary of Protect. However, Protect can also be used to Hariyama's advantage, allowing it to freely switch out and bring in a Trick Room setter to come in and set it up again. Hariyama can also predict the Protect, attacking the other Pokemon and leaving the opponent at a disadvantage.

Team Options
========

Trick Room setters are mandatory. Cresselia is one of the best Trick Room setters in Doubles, and is therefore a great teammate for Hariyama. Jellicent and Chandelure are also great partners, both being able to reliably set up Trick Room with Fake Out support. Something to deal with Talonflame is also strongly appreciated. Heatran is therefore a great teammate, as it resists Brave Bird while also being immune to Flare Blitz. Heatran also beats Amoonguss, who can be really annoying for Hariyama. Mega Ampharos can also be used to stop Talonflame. Bulky and powerful Pokemon such as Mega Abomasnow can help clean up once Hariyama is done blowing holes in the opponent's team. Talonflame also gets a mention as a partner due to its ability to attack first with its Flying-type STAB despite Trick Room, and deal with Amoonguss, which can take Close Combats easily and is also a problem during Trick Room due to its low Speed. Bisharp is another good teammate as its Defiant ability deters Intimidate users from switching in and destroys Psychic-, Ghost-, and Fairy-types, such as Latios, Cresselia, Gengar, Sylveon, and Gardevoir.

Other Options
########

Due to Hariyama's underwhelming Speed and poor defenses, Hariyama sadly has little use outside of Trick Room. However, there are some different sets Hariyama can run. A set utilizing Life Orb and Sheer Force can be used to boost the power of elemental punches and Rock Slide. Hariyama can also use a set with Assault Vest, which can be used in conjunction with Thick Fat to make Hariyama a decent specially defensive tank. Heavy Slam can be used if the team struggles against Fairy-types, as it hits most Fairies except Mawile, Klefki, and Azumarill extremely hard. A ChestoRest set can be good in conjunction with Hariyama's other abilities, Thick Fat and Sheer Force. Hariyama can use Helping Hand to boost the power of a teammate's attack. Feint can be used, but a set with Feint would be almost completely outclassed by Hitmontop; Hariyama needs to focus on hitting like a truck instead, and therefore prioritizing powerful moves. Hariyama has a wealth of coverage options to further support its team. Earthquake can be used to specifically deal with Mega Mawile, as Mega Mawile takes any other hit Hariyama has and OHKOes it with Play Rough. Fire Punch can be used for Scizor, while Thunder Punch surprises and OHKOes Azumarill.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Talonflame can easily OHKO Hariyama with its priority STAB Brave Bird; Hariyama can, however, OHKO a predicted switch-in with Rock Slide. Azumarill, Mega Mawile, Sylveon, and Mega Gardevoir are all huge threats, and can easily OHKO Hariyama with their Fairy-type STAB moves, especially if Trick Room is not active. Bulky and powerful Mega Evolutions, such as Mega Heracross, Mega Venusaur, and Mega Scizor, can also often beat Hariyama.

**Utility Moves**: Protect and Fake Out can easily stall out Trick Room, and Pokemon with Taunt, such as Gyarados, or with sleep inducing moves, such as Breloom, can stop Hariyama's partner from setting up Trick Room.

**Intimidate**: Hariyama doesn't like Intimidate, as Intimidate greatly reduces its offensive presence, typically forcing a switch. Gyarados, Hitmontop, and Landorus-T are all notable users of Intimidate. Landorus-T has to watch out for Ice Punch, however.
