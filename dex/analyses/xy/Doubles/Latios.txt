Overview
########

At first glance, Latios's decline in usage seems baffling. It has a high base 130 Special Attack stat, access to powerful moves such as Draco Meteor, a base 110 Speed which allows it to outpace Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Terrakion, a Dragon typing which grants it resistances to common types such as Fire and Water, and, to top it all off, it has access to Levitate. However, with the rise of Steel- and Fairy-types, more teams have an effective answer to Latios. In addition, it has a weakness to Sucker Punch that is made more burdensome on account of the high usage of Bisharp and Mega Kangaskhan, and, while its bulk is not bad, it's not stellar either, which can make Latios easy for more powerful Pokemon to wear down. All in all, though, it is still a solid choice for those looking for a fast and powerful attacker.

Moves
========

Draco Meteor's high power allows it to either KO or deal heavy damage to most opposing Pokemon. However, it comes with the nasty side effect of lowering Latios's Special Attack by two stages, so it's wise not to spam it or Latios runs the risk of being forced out. If you need a good neutral attack for when you don't want to drop Latios's stats, Psyshock or Psychic is your best bet, as they're both strong secondary STAB attacks. Psyshock is listed first because it deals more damage to Amoonguss and also allows Latios to hit common Assault Vest users such as Ludicolo harder. If these benefits don't matter to you, though, use Psychic, as it has higher Base Power and deals more damage to neutral targets. For the third slot, Tailwind is listed first because it allows Latios to provide valuable support to its teammates, letting it remain useful even once its Special Attack has been dropped. However, if Scizor and Ferrothorn are an issue, Hidden Power Fire can be used to catch them off guard. If you'd like to give your Latios more longevity, Roost can be used in the third slot. Another option in the third slot is Hidden Power Ground, which can be useful to hit Heatran and, to a lesser extent, Aegislash. Finally, Protect allows Latios to avoid damage during critical turns, potentially shielding itself from being KOed.

Set Details
========

The spread is chosen to maximize Latios's power and Speed. Timid is chosen over Modest so Latios can outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon, as well as Pokemon such as Garchomp, Terrakion, and Keldeo, which are all significant benchmarks. Life Orb is used to give Latios as much power as possible.

Usage Tips
========

Latios is a great Pokemon to bring in early-game, as you can take advantage of its high power to blast holes in your opponent's team. When using this strategy, Latios should be played in a hit-and-run style, as with recoil from Life Orb and stat drops from Draco Meteor, you'll likely not want to keep Latios in for too long at any one time. If you choose to fire off Draco Meteors, though, be sure to wait for Fairy-types, Steel-types, and other Pokemon that have no problem taking one to be out of the way so that you can put more pressure on your opponent. Another way Latios can be used in the early-game is as an offensive pivot, as its typing grants it a number of useful resistances, such as to Water- and Fire-type attacks. Tailwind or other non-attacking moves make for great ways to avoid a predicted Sucker Punch, which would likely otherwise KO Latios. If you don't need Latios's wallbreaking power in the early-game, it can be wise to save it for the late-game, as its power and Speed make it very effective at cleaning through weakened teams.

Team Options
========

Steel-types such as Heatran make for good partners to Latios because they can tank hits from both Fairy-types and opposing Dragons. Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan that can punch holes in the opposing team also make for good partners. Latios appreciates being paired with Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Conkeldurr, as they have no problem dealing with Dark-types that threaten it. Fairy-types are also able to deal with Dark-type Pokemon, with the added benefit of easily handling opposing Dragons.

Teams with an abundance of slower Pokemon might appreciate having Latios as a teammate, as its high Speed lets it outspeed most of the tier. Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Mega Heracross, and Genesect all enjoy Tailwind support, so if you decide to run Tailwind Latios, these are options worth considering to take advantage of it. Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Terrakion appreciate having a Latios running Hidden Power Ground or Fire as a partner, as it can lure in and eliminate Heatran and Scizor, respectively. As Latios's Defense leaves it vulnerable to powerful physical attacks, Intimidate support is much appreciated. Quick Guard support from Pokemon such as Terrakion can be useful, as it protects Latios from priority moves such as Fake Out and Sucker Punch that can be very problematic. Pokemon that are generally bulky and can take powerful hits for Latios, such as Heatran or Togekiss, also make for good partners.

Other Options
########

Choice Specs is an option to take advantage of the power of Draco Meteor, as the item mitigates the effect of the stat drop, while the spammability of Draco Meteor means that the restrictions associated with Choice items aren't as problematic. If you'd like increased Speed over more power, Choice Scarf is also an option, but it's less offensively threatening then Latios's other options. Calm Mind is an option to give Latios more power and bulk at the same time, but finding a way to effectively make use of the boost can be difficult. Substitute is a nice option in the third slot to shield against status and priority, but losing 25% health to make a Substitute adds up, especially when factoring in Life Orb recoil.

Thunderbolt can be used as a way to hit bulky Water-types that Latios might otherwise be unable to break through. Helping Hand can be a way to give team support while keeping Latios from being a sitting duck after its stats are dropped. However, Tailwind is typically more useful. If you want to have a way to set your own weather beyond a weather inducer, or have a way to disrupt opposing weather, Latios has access to both Rain Dance and Sunny Day. Latios also learns both Reflect and Light Screen, which can be useful to reduce damage from physical and special attacks, respectively. Heal Pulse can be used to give back health to a weakened ally, but in general, Latios has better options for the slot. Memento can inflict severe stat drops on a foe, but to do so, you must sacrifice Latios and there's nothing stopping your opponent from simply switching out. Dragon Pulse is a STAB option if you don't want to deal with the stat drops associated with Draco Meteor, but the significant loss in power makes Latios noticeably less threatening.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Dark-types such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Scrafty can all maul Latios. Assault Vest Scrafty is particularly effective, as Assault Vest gives it a very high Special Defense stat. Bug-types such as Scizor, Escavalier, and Genesect can also beat Latios, although they must watch out for coverage moves. Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Gardevoir, Mega Mawile, and Azumarill are all immune to Latios's Dragon-type attacks and can KO it with their Fairy STAB moves. Steel-types such as Heatran can easily tank a hit and force Latios out, but they need to beware of coverage moves. Mega Kangaskhan has a powerful Sucker Punch to get around its lower Speed and deal heavy damage to Latios. Under Trick Room, Mega Abomasnow and Chandelure become very threatening to Latios as well.

**Speed**: Choice Scarf Genesect has no problem putting Latios out of commission with a powerful U-turn. While less common, Choice Scarf Landorus-T sometimes carries Knock Off, which can OHKO Latios 50% of the time. Mega Gengar outspeeds Latios and has a powerful Shadow Ball to deal large amounts of damage.

**Speed Control**: A Thunder Wave from Thundurus or Klefki will severely cripple Latios, as a large part of what makes it threatening is its high Speed. Pokemon such as Cresselia and Aromatisse can further remove its Speed advantage by using Trick Room to turn its Speed into a liability. Icy Wind is less common, but can also make Latios less effective.

**Utility Moves**: Follow Me Jirachi has no problem redirecting and tanking anything that Latios can throw at it, especially under rain.
