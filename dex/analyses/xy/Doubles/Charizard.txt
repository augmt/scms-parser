Overview
########

The ability to run two completely different, strong Mega Evolutions with different typings makes Charizard a top-tier threat. Mega Charizard Y makes sun a viable strategy in Doubles, allowing partners to utilize the field condition while boasting a powerful, spread, STAB, sun-boosted Heat Wave. Mega Charizard X eliminates Charizard's Electric-type weakness, allowing it to set up on many of Mega Charizard Y's checks. A burn-immune physical sweeper, Mega Charizard X uses its unique offensive typing to threaten a large portion of the metagame. Charizard is not invulnerable, however, as both sets have weaknesses that are common in Doubles attackers, lack of coverage needed to hit key threats, and they are basically helpless against speed control.

Sun Attacker
########
name: Sun Attacker
move 1: Heat Wave
move 2: Solar Beam
move 3: Focus Blast / Overheat
move 4: Protect
ability: Blaze
item: Charizardite Y
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Heat Wave is Mega Charizard Y's most reliable attack as it is a STAB spread move and is boosted under the sun to deal massive amount of combined damage. Solar Beam hits the Water- and Rock-type Pokemon that wall Heat Wave for super effective damage. The next move Mega Charizard Y should use depends on its team. It typically runs Focus Blast to hit threats that wall its coverage, such as Heatran and Tyranitar in the sand. However, Overheat is an option that hits even resistant Pokemon hard in the sun, turning Mega Charizard Y into a hit-and-run nuke. Lastly, Protect scouts for moves, ruins offensive strategies, blocks Fake Out, and stalls out opposing field conditions.

Set Comments
========

Mega Charizard Y has an important base 100 Speed tier, tying with many other threats in Doubles, including Mega Kangaskhan, Zapdos, and Mega Gardevoir, so it typically runs a Timid nature so it can stand a chance against those threats. However, if those threats are handled by its teammates, a Modest nature is viable as well for the greater power. Charizard Y has some coverage options that can fit easily into the third slot. It can run Ancient Power to beat opposing Mega Charizard Y, Hidden Power Ground to safely take out non-Shuca Berry Heatran as opposed to relying on Focus Blast's accuracy, and Dragon Pulse can be used to hit Pokemon such as Latios and Salamence hard without suffering the Special Attack drop of Overheat.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Charizard Y is a pretty simple Pokemon when it comes to how it is used. In most scenarios, it just spams Heat Wave and watches opponents crumble, using its coverage options against specific threats. If it uses Overheat, Mega Charizard Y plays a more hit-and-run game, so it needs to switch out and be pivoted in to be more effective. It is common for opponents to lead with checks to Mega Charizard Y, such as Terrakion, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Thundurus, so if Charizard leads, it needs a partner that can handle those threats. If the sun is used only for itself and not for supporting other sun sweepers, Charizard shouldn't Mega Evolve while it uses Protect, so it can maximize the amount of times it can spam its Fire-type attacks. When a weather war is apparent, it is wise to hold off Mega Evolving until the opposing setter is on the field, so Mega Charizard Y changes the weather last and gains maximum offensive momentum for the team.

Team Options
========

Chlorophyll Venusaur is a great partner for Mega Charizard Y, because it outspeeds almost all of the tier under the sun and can put to sleep or damage the opponents. It also covers Mega Charizard Y's Electric-type weakness and checks rain teams well. Other teammates that threaten rain teams include Ferrothorn and Ludicolo. Heatran enjoys using sun-boosted Heat Waves, and Mega Charizard-Y covers Heatran's Ground- and Fighting-type weaknesses and also weakens its Water-type weakness under the sun. Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Scrafty can check the Rock-types, such as Choice Scarf Tyranitar and Terrakion, that scare Mega Charizard Y. Wide Guard users, such as Aegislash and Hitmontop, can handle Charizard's Rock Slide weakness. Hitmontop also offers Feint support, allowing Mega Charizard Y to spam its attacks even through Protect and Wide Guard. Speed control really helps because most of its checks rely on their higher Speed stats. Cresselia is a good option due to its bulk and access to Icy Wind. Latios also pairs well with Mega Charizard Y and can support it with Tailwind. Lastly, Mega Charizard Y enjoys partners with Helping Hand to further boost the devastating power of Heat Wave; good partners for this include Cresselia and Latias.

Dragon Dance
########
name: Dragon Dance
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Flare Blitz / Fire Punch
move 3: Dragon Claw
move 4: Protect / Substitute
ability: Blaze
item: Charizardite X
evs: 40 HP / 208 Atk / 32 Def / 228 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Dragon Dance boosts Mega Charizard X's Attack and Speed, allowing it to outspeed and threaten almost the entire metagame after one boost; it also lets Mega Charizard X bypass Attack drops from Intimidate. Flare Blitz is its strongest STAB attack, but considering how there is no room for recovery moves on the set, Fire Punch can be used to avoid recoil damage; however, the damage difference between Flare Blitz and Fire Punch is huge and will turn many OHKOs into 2HKOs. Dragon Claw is a reliable, decently powered STAB move that has great coverage with Mega Charizard X's Fire-type attack. In the last slot, Protect can be used to scout for attacks, stall field conditions, and ruin offensive strategies. Alternatively, Substitute can be used instead to capitalize on the type change from Charizard to Mega Charizard X, allowing it to set up on threats such as Electric-types, easing the sweep.

Set Details
========

An Adamant nature is preferred to boost the power of Mega Charizard X's attacks. A Jolly nature isn't necessary, as the given EVs allow it to outspeed even Deoxys-A at +1. However, a set with Swords Dance, maximum Speed, and a Timid nature works similarly to this one, but it starts with less power as opposed to less Speed; a Swords Dance set will also be much more vulnerable to revenge killing. Lastly, the current EV spread allows Mega Charizard X to survive a Jolly Landorus-T Earthquake.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Charizard X should focus on using its typing to set up Dragon Dance against threats aimed to attack Charizard's Fire / Flying typing, mainly Electric-types such as Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Mega Manectric. In addition, it can set up on Wide Guard or Protect users that are anticipating a strong Heat Wave from Mega Charizard Y. Because of this, Charizard should try to remain out of play until it gets the best chance to Mega Evolve and set up Dragon Dance, or it will be much more vulnerable and lose its surprise factor. Partners can also help Mega Charizard X set up with Follow Me, Rage Powder, or by applying offensive pressure. While Dragon Dance can be difficult to set up, once Mega Charizard X gets a boost or two, it can be incredibly difficult to stop.

Team Options
========

Togekiss, Jirachi, and Amoonguss are all viable users of Follow Me or Rage Powder and can drastically ease Mega Charizard X's setup; Togekiss and Jirachi can also offer it speed control with Thunder Wave and redirect Dragon-type attacks aimed at it very easily, while Amoonguss can help it set up Dragon Dance with Spore support as well. Landorus-T makes a great partner because it can handle opposing Ground- and Rock-types as well as Heatran, which walls Mega Charizard X. Bisharp makes a good partner because it can pick off threats that outspeed Mega Charizard X with Sucker Punch, and makes Pokemon with Intimidate think twice about switching in on Mega Charizard X. Wide Guard support from Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Aegislash is useful as well because Mega Charizard X is weak to Earthquake and Rock Slide, two very popular spread attacks in Doubles. Lastly, other partners that offer speed control, such as Thundurus and Suicune, make it less reliant on setting up to sweep.

Other Options
########

The necessity of a Mega Stone limits Charizard's other options. Both Mega forms can use Roost for longevity and Mega Charizard Y can use Substitute to ease prediction and aid sweeps, but they can rarely afford to fit these in a set. In addition, they have access to Will-O-Wisp and Tailwind, but they should be focusing on applying offensive pressure, as there are other supporting Pokemon with those moves that don't take up a Mega Evolution slot. Mega Charizard Y could use Flame Charge to boost its Speed in an attempt to sweep, but it will miss out on valuable coverage. It could also use Air Slash as a solid STAB attack for use against rain teams, but it doesn't hit hard enough against any other playstyle. Mega Charizard X can run Brick Break or Earthquake to hit Heatran, but it will have to miss out on one of its better moves.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Mega Charizard Y's biggest problems come from the holes in its coverage. Dragon-types such as Salamence and Latios can take any hit and deal massive amounts of damage back. Chandelure with Flash Fire can take anything it offers and fire off its own STAB moves; Heatran is a similar case, because Mega Charizard Y has to rely on Focus Blast's bad accuracy to hit it, and it will only 2HKO.

Heatran completely walls the main Mega Charizard X set. Intimidate Gyarados and Azumarill can also play around it decently. Aside from those common threats, it has to be handled by means other that a blatant type advantage.

**Opposing Weather**: Politoed completely shuts down Mega Charizard Y, weaking its Fire-type STAB attacks in addition to neutering SolarBeam. It also weakens Mega Charizard X's strongest STAB attack as well. Also, Tyranitar can easily switch in on Mega Charizard Y, especially if it lacks Focus Blast.

**Speed**: Several threats outspeed and KO both Charizard forms outside of Speed boosts and speed control. Terrakion is a popular threat that can take Charizard out with Stone Edge or Rock Slide. Choice Scarf users such as Tyranitar, Landorus-T, and Excadrill can surprise it and deal heavy damage as well. Talonflame can deal major damage to both forms no matter what field condition. Other fast threats that can deal crucial damage before the Charizard forms can strike are Latios, Mega Gengar, Garchomp, and Deoxys-Attack. Mega Kangaskhan has a chance to outspeed and OHKO with a STAB Return as well. Swift Swim users such as Ludicolo and Kingdra can outspeed and severely damage both forms. Lastly, Electric-types such as Thundurus and Mega Manectric can take out Mega Charizard Y easily.

**Speed Control**: Under Trick Room, both Charizard forms can easily be taken out by threats such as Rhyperior, Jellicent, and Mega Ampharos. Many threats under Tailwind, such as Hydreigon, outspeed and cripple the Charizard sets. Thunder Wave is an easy way to hurt Charizard; Cresselia is a common user who can tank most hits, even boosted, and retaliate. Pokemon such as Thundurus, Klefki, and Meowstic can paralyze even the fastest Charizard sets.

**Utility Moves**: A priority Encore can catch a Mega Charizard Y in a Protect or a Mega Charizard X in a Protect or Dragon Dance; good users include Whimsicott and Liepard. Fake Out users, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Hitmontop, and Ludicolo, can grant their partners a chance to take out Charizard as well. Lastly, although uncommon, Stealth Rock is an easy way to limit any Charizard set.
