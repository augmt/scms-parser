Overview
########

Thanks to its ability, typing, and defensive stats, Ferrothorn is a real nuisance for physical attackers to face. It also does a great job against a wide range of special attackers, including Latios, Jirachi, and Cresselia. Rain teams in particular usually struggle to break through Ferrothorn, which checks common rain sweepers such as Kingdra, Ludicolo, and Azumarill well with its great typing. Ferrothorn's low base Speed makes it a good check to Trick Room teams and lets it deal heavy damage to fast threats with Gyro Ball. It is a great answer to the ever-present Mega Kangaskhan; Iron Barbs discourages the use of Fake Out from the opponent and acts as a safety net against even the most powerful physical attackers. Whilst its typing does it some favors, Ferrothorn is 4x weak to Fire-type moves, which is a dangerous attribute in a metagame where Charizard and Heatran are commonly used. In addition to this, Grass- and Steel-type moves don't provide great coverage, and Ferrothorn's offenses can thus feel lackluster; consequently, it relies on Leech Seed or Thunder Wave to cripple opposing Pokemon that it can't damage with its STABs, making it setup bait for threats such as Heatran.

Moves
========

Power Whip is for bulky Water-types such as Politoed, Rotom-W, and Jellicent, also hitting other common threats like Tyranitar and Mamoswine. Gyro Ball makes Ferrothorn an excellent answer to powerful Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir, Togekiss, and Sylveon whilst also assuring consistent damage on the faster threats in the metagame, cleanly 2HKOing Garchomp and Latios. Thunder Wave is an alternative option which Ferrothorn can utilize well thanks to its great bulk, allowing it to spread paralysis and also cripple common switch-ins. Leech Seed improves Ferrothorn's longevity whilst also dealing consistent chip damage and forcing switches. It also helps Ferrothorn stall out opposing Trick Room teams as most Trick Room setters and users are bulky, meaning Ferrothorn often gains a significant amount of health from Leech Seed. Protect allows Ferrothorn to scout enemy attacks and also steal more HP through Leech Seed. It also gives Ferrothorn a turn to avoid any damage whilst its partner handles a threat that it may struggle with.

Set Details
========

172 Attack EVs ensure Ferrothorn can OHKO both Rotom-W and Jellicent with Power Whip. It also means Gyro Ball will OHKO 252 HP / 0 Def Togekiss under Tailwind. The remaining EVs are put into Defense so Ferrothorn can tank physical hits better. A Brave nature is used to help Ferrothorn perform better as a Trick Room check and power up its Gyro Ball. 0 Speed IVs are used for the same reason. Players using Thunder Wave and Gyro Ball on the same set should be wary of the fact that Gyro Ball's power is based on how much slower Ferrothorn is than the opponent. Lum Berry is the preferred item as it lets Ferrothorn absorb a burn from Rotom-W or Jellicent before OHKOing with Power Whip in return. It also allows Ferrothorn to easily handle Thunder Wave Togekiss, which can be very obtrusive. A Rocky Helmet can be used to help rack up easy damage and discourage the use of Fake Out. 252 Attack EVs can be used for Gyro Ball to OHKO Latios (after Life Orb damage) and Tornadus. A specially defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 48 Def / 208 SpD with a Relaxed nature is also usable; with this spread, Ferrothorn can take three Ice Beams from Modest Kyurem-B.

Usage Tips
========

Ferrothorn is easy to switch into a multitude of physical threats and can even get chip damage off through Iron Barbs; for instance by switching into a Fake Out from Pokemon such as Mega Kangakhan or Hitmontop. Through the use of Leech Seed and Protect, Ferrothorn can stall out Trick Room with ease. In addition to this, it can handle Trick Room threats such as Rhyperior and Sylveon with its low Speed and powerful STAB moves. Ferrothorn is also a good lure for Jellicent and Rotom-W; it can absorb a burn with Lum Berry and then OHKO with Power Whip.

Team Options
========

Chandelure makes a good teammate for Ferrothorn as it can absorb any Fire-type attacks with Flash Fire while being immune to the Fighting-type attacks that threaten Ferrothorn. Heatran is a bulkier Flash Fire user, but it shares a Fighting-type weakness with Ferrothorn. Trick Room-setting partners such as Cresselia can ensure Ferrothorn moves first and thus help it to avoid taking hits from any threats it can OHKO. Politoed can provide rain support to lessen Ferrothorn's Fire-type weakness; it also handles Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran. Fighting-type Pokemon blast through the Steel-types that Ferrothorn struggles to break through. Terrakion is a good choice because it also resists the Fire-type moves that Ferrothorn fears. Tyranitar can remove sun and provide additional chip damage by setting up sand.

Other Options
########

Knock Off can help Ferrothorn deprive Pokemon of Choice items as well as recovery from items such as Sitrus Berry or Leftovers. Through the use of a Chople Berry, Ferrothorn makes for an effective lure to both Keldeo and Terrakion, as it can survive their Fighting-type attacks and strike back with either Power Whip or Gyro Ball. Leftovers or a Sitrus Berry can be used to aid with Ferrothorn's staying power thanks to the recovery they provide. A Choice Band set with Power Whip, Gyro Ball, Knock Off, and Explosion can be used, but it's far less effective than the above set. Bulldoze can be used to surprise Heatran switch-ins and also provide speed control. Iron Head can be used over Gyro Ball to deal more damage to slower threats such as Mega Abomasnow; it also comes with a flinch chance that can prove to be useful under Trick Room. Occa Berry can help Ferrothorn survive the odd Fire-type attack. Although it isn't nearly as effective as it is in in singles, Stealth Rock is a viable option that Ferrothorn can easily fit onto its set.

**Intimidate Users**: Whilst Intimidate does not render Ferrothorn useless, it is a hindrance. Landorus-T, Scrafty, and Hitmontop are common Intimidate users that can make Ferrothorn miss out on significant OHKOs such as Rotom-W, Jellicent, and Togekiss under Tailwind.

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard Y can all easily KO Ferrothorn with their 4x effective STABs. Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and Terrakion can punch their way through Ferrothorn's defenses. Rotom-H is one of the best switch-ins to Ferrothorn as it resists both of the latter's STABs, is immune to Thunder Wave, and can proceed to OHKO with Overheat.

**Utility Moves**: Ferrothorn provides lots of opportunities for Pokemon such as Heatran and Aegislash to set up a Substitute. Both threats can become immediately more threatening behind a Substitute, putting you in a dangerous position. Due to its low Speed, it's easy to lock Ferrothorn into a non-damaging move such as Leech Seed or Protect through the use of Encore.
