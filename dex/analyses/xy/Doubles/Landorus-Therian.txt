Overview
########

Landorus-T is one of the prime Intimidate users in Doubles. With its sky-high Attack, Landorus-T hits very hard with its STAB spread move Earthquake. Landorus-T has a good offensive typing and access to many coverage moves, and powerful spread moves in Rock Slide and STAB Earthquake allowing it to deal major damage to all the opponents on the field; access to U-turn and Knock Off grants it greater utility and great coverage. Furthermore, Landorus-T has a great defensive typing, being weak only to Water and Ice but having resistances to Fighting, Bug, and Poison and two great immunities in Electric and Ground. Thanks to its well-rounded stats, Landorus-T is versatile and very easy to fit onto teams. However, Landorus-T has merely average special bulk, so it has trouble switching into neutral special attacks.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Stone Edge / Rock Slide
move 4: Superpower / Explosion / Knock Off
ability: Intimidate
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 44 HP / 252 Atk / 212 Spe
nature: Adamant


Moves
========

Earthquake is the mandatory STAB move that deals damage to both opponents. However, it hurts Landorus-T's partner as well, so care must be taken to mitigate this. U-turn is great for coming in to Intimidate the opponents then getting out of the battle quickly. Stone Edge can be used to deal more damage to a single target, whereas Rock Slide is a spread move with a nice flinch rate but the side effect of being stopped by Wide Guard. Superpower is a coverage move that allows Landorus-T to hit major threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Ferrothorn. Explosion should be used in a pinch to sacrifice Landorus-T, and lets it deal major damage to all opponents at the start of the turn, and also provides momentum. Knock Off cripples the opponent by removing their item and also hits Ghost-types super effectively.

Set Details
========

Choice Scarf allows Landorus-T to outspeed and OHKO faster Pokemon, rather than be threatened by them. The Speed EVs allow Landorus-T to outspeed Shaymin-S, Gengar, and Timid Manectric. Intimidate cripples the opponents and allows Landorus-T and its partner to survive more physical hits. An Adamant nature is used for maximum power. A Jolly nature should not be used, as the Speed increase does not allow Landorus-T to outspeed anything significant.

Usage Tips
========

Most of the time, Landorus-T will be using a hit-and-run strategy with U-turn and to Intimidate the opponents multiple times, reducing their Attack stats to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Landorus-T is a good lead unless the opponent has a Bisharp, as U-turn allows Landorus-T to Intimidate the opponents, deal chip damage, and then switch into the actual best lead all while moving before anything without priority. It is also smart to U-turn out if you predict that the opponent will switch in an Intimidate user, as opposing Intimidate hampers Landorus-T greatly. Landorus-T can function as a powerful late-game cleaner, but many Pokemon in Doubles are immune to Earthquake so be wary of using it during early-game. Landorus-T acts as a great revenge killer to faster threats such as Charizard, Kangaskhan, Terrakion, Latios, Gengar, Shaymin-S, and Thundurus. When you are in a pinch, spamming Rock Slide for that lucky flinch is a viable strategy. Use Explosion to lure and deal a lot of damage to Landorus-T's checks such as Rotom-W and Keldeo, but do not use Explosion early-game; wait until Landorus-T can't do much with its other attacks.

Team Options
========

Flying-types and Levitate users such as Rotom-W, Shaymin-S, and Mega Pinsir make for good teammates as they are immune to Landorus-T's Earthquake. Ghost-type partners are also useful, as they are immune to Explosion. Aegislash receives a special mention as it has great type synergy with Landorus-T, resisting Ice-type attacks for it, while Landorus-T handles the Ground-type attacks aimed at Aegislash in return. Additionally, Aegislash is one of the two viable Pokemon with access to Wide Guard to protect itself from Earthquake and Landorus-T from Icy Wind, with the other being Hitmontop. Hitmontop also has Intimidate to completely nullify the opponent's physical attackers. However, having two Intimidate users makes you weaker to Defiant users. Partners with Feint pair well with Landorus-T because they stop Wide Guard users from blocking Landorus-T's spread attacks. Mega Pinsir is a good example because it has the advantage of being immune to Landorus-T's Earthquake. Bulky Water-types such as Azumarill, Suicune, and Rotom-W cover both of Landorus-T's weaknesses. Azumarill can easily KO Intimidate users, such as other Landorus-T, Hitmontop, and Scrafty, which check Landorus-T. Suicune can take many hits while supporting Landorus-T with Tailwind, Icy Wind, or Snarl. Rotom-W deserves a special mention, as it resists Landorus-T's weaknesses and is also immune to Landorus-T's Earthquake. Many Pokemon appreciate Landorus-T's removal of Steel-types: Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon, Steel-types such as Scizor and Mega Mawile, Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Venusaur, and Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B and Salamence all like having Landorus-T as a partner.

Physical Attacker
########
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge / Rock Slide
move 3: U-turn / Knock Off
move 4: Protect
ability: Intimidate
item: Leftovers / Yache Berry
evs: 184 HP / 236 Atk / 88 Spe
nature: Adamant

Moves
========

Earthquake is a strong STAB spread move that can deal major damage to both opponents on the field. Stone Edge is a concentrated Rock-type coverage move that can OHKO Thundurus that do not invest in bulk. Rock Slide is a good spread move that has EdgeQuake coverage with Earthquake and can also achieve a timely flinch on the opponents. U-turn allows Landorus-T to escape from the field if there is a bad matchup. Knock Off is a good Dark-type coverage move and removes the opponent's item. Protect is useful to scout moves, stall out field conditions, and survive a turn when it is predicted that the opponents will attack Landorus-T.

Set Details
========

Leftovers grants Landorus-T greater longevity so that it can Intimidate opponents more often over the course of the match. Yache Berry is used to take down Electric-types such as Mega Manectric that rely on Hidden Power Ice to attack Ground-types. Sitrus Berry is a last option to allow Landorus-T to survive more hits but is generally outclassed by Leftovers in this role. Intimidate helps neutralize physical attackers on the opponent's field, give your teammates greater leeway, and reduce damage taken.

88 Speed EVs allow Landorus-T to outspeed and OHKO 252 Speed Bisharp. 184 HP EVs allow Landorus-T to survive Adamant +1 Life Orb Bisharp's Sucker Punch, Modest Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave, neutral natured Thundurus's Hidden Power Ice, -1 Mega Kanghaskhan's Fake Out and Double Edge, and Adamant -1 Conkeldurr's Ice Punch and Mach Punch. The remaining EVs are put into Attack to deal as much damage as possible. Adamant Landorus-T can OHKO Bisharp and Thundurus with the appropriate move, while Jolly Landorus-T cannot.

Usage Tips
========

As Landorus-T functions as a great check to physical attackers thanks to its ability Intimidate, take all opportunities to switch in on physically offensive opponents. However, during early-game, opposing Intimidate users will be switching in to check Landorus-T's attacks as well, so usually U-turn should be used until these threats have been eliminated. Landorus-T can function well both defensively and offensively thanks to its high Attack, so it can be used to put a lot of offensive pressure on opponents with powerful spread Earthquakes and Rock Slides. Against a threatening opponent with Water- or Ice-type coverage, Landorus-T should switch out into a teammate with a more favorable matchup so that Landorus-T can be preserved.

Team Options
========

Flying-types or Levitate users such as Togekiss, Cresselia, Rotom-W, Shaymin-S, and Thundurus should be used to avoid the dangerous Earthquakes that Landorus-T uses. Cresselia deserves a special mention for having a great support movepool, with Helping Hand to support Landorus-T, Trick Room to counter opponents' Trick Room, and Icy Wind for speed control. Jirachi can use Follow Me to deter Water- and Ice-type moves from striking Landorus-T, though it is weak to Landorus-T's Earthquake. Bulky Water-types such as Azumarill, Suicune, and Rotom-W cover Landorus-T's weaknesses. Azumarill is great at KOing Intimidate users such as other Landorus-T, Hitmontop, and Scrafty that check Landorus-T. Suicune can take many hits while supporting Landorus-T with Tailwind, Icy Wind, or Snarl. Rotom-W deserves a special mention, as it resists Landorus-T's weaknesses and is also immune to Landorus-T's Earthquake. Many Pokemon appreciate Landorus-T's removal of Steel-types, such as Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon, Steel-types such as Scizor and Mega Mawile, Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Venusaur, and Dragon-types such as Kyurem-B and Salamence.

Other Options
########

A Choice Band set is viable, but Landorus-T must give up either the Speed provided with Choice Scarf or the ability to use Protect. Hidden Power Ice is an option to defeat opposing Landorus-T. Assault Vest is great to cushion Landorus-T from special attacks, and works well with Intimidate to cover both physical and special moves, though Landorus-T has to forego Protect to use Assault Vest. Substitute can be used to ease prediction, protect Landorus-T from status effects and Intimidate, and to act as a cushion against faster checks. Swords Dance and Rock Polish can be used to boost Landorus-T's stats to terrifying levels. Stealth Rock is great to check opposing Pokemon such as Charizard, Mega Pinsir and Talonflame, but it has less utility in Doubles as compared to singles because there is less switching, and due to the fast-paced nature of the metagame it's harder to find time to set it up. Imprison is an interesting option that can be used to prevent the opponent from using the common Protect, Earthquake, and Rock Slide. Gravity is another interesting option to remove immunities to Ground-type attacks and also reduce the evasion of all Pokemon on the field.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Bulky opponents with Ice-type coverage that are able to survive an Earthquake can put a dent in Landorus-T's health. Cresselia can take multiple attacks and retaliate with Icy Wind, which has the added effect of lowering Landorus-T and its partner's Speed. Azumarill can use its super effective priority, or take a hit and use Waterfall. Rotom-W is immune to Earthquake and is not weak to Rock-type attacks, and it can easily defeat Landorus-T with a Hydro Pump. Politoed OHKOes Landorus-T with Scald and provides rain, which allows Ludicolo and Kingdra to outspeed and KO Landorus-T.

**Speed**: Faster Pokemon with Ice-type attacks, such as Deoxys-A, Choice Scarf Genesect, Choice Scarf Kyurem-B, Ludicolo in rain, and Ice Shard users such as Mamoswine and Weavile, will be able to defeat Landorus-T. Shaymin-S and Deoxys-A can also KO Landorus-T with their STAB moves after some prior damage.

**Speed Control**: All variants of Landorus-T, especially the Choice Scarf set, dislike Trick Room and Tailwind, so its partners should try their best to neutralize any Trick Room and Tailwind setters to allow Landorus-T to function at its best.

**Utility**: Landorus-T's spread moves are rendered useless by users of Wide Guard, especially Hitmontop which also has Intimidate to cripple Landorus-T. Shuca Berry or Air Balloon Heatran can also OHKO Landorus-T easily with Hidden Power Ice and is able to withstand Earthquakes due to its item. Fake Out immobilizes Landorus-T and renders it vulnerable to another foe's powerful attack.

**Intimidate and burns**: Burns and Intimidate reduce Landorus-T's overall damage output, so try to prevent these effects. Common Will-O-Wisp and Intimidate users are Rotom-W and Gourgeist for Will-O-Wisp and Landorus-T or Scrafty for Intimidate. Scrafty may also have Ice Punch, which is super effective against Landorus-T.
