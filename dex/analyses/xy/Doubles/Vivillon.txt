Overview
########

ORAS was somewhat kind to Vivillon, giving it an easier time putting foes to sleep by giving it access to Tailwind, which allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Although Vivillon competes with other sleep-inducing move users for a team slot, it has a solid niche, being able to set up Tailwind and beat Grass-types, which are immune to Sleep Powder, with Hurricane. This is helped by Vivillon's ability, Compound Eyes, which grants Hurricane and Sleep Powder near-perfect accuracy. Unfortunately, it is easy to revenge kill, as outside of Tailwind, it gets outsped by common Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y; furthermore, Vivillon has horrible bulk, meaning it has to rely on Focus Sash to survive a hit. Its Special Attack is also far from perfect, but Hurricane's high Base Power makes up for that slightly. Vivillon is also reliant on Sleep Powder, so it has difficulty getting past Safety Goggles and Taunt users.

Moves
========

Sleep Powder shuts the opposing Pokemon down for a few turns, giving Vivillon and its teammate free turns to attack or set up. Hurricane gives Vivillon an offensive presence, allowing it to hit Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Mega-Venusaur, which are immune to Sleep Powder. Tailwind provides support and allows Vivillon to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Protect allows it to block priority moves such as Fake Out and scout for moves. Quiver Dance could be used over Tailwind to boost its Speed and Special Attack, allowing it to hit hard, but unlike Tailwind, it does not help its teammates and Vivillon will be outsped by Choice Scarf users.

Set Details
========

Maximum Speed investment allows Vivillon to have as much Speed as possible. A Timid nature allows it to outpace neutral-natured Pokemon with base 100 Speed such as Mega Kangaskhan outside of Tailwind. 252 Special Attack EVs allow it to hit as hard as possible, as investment in bulk would be pointless. Focus Sash guarantees that Vivillon will survive a hit, as it has low bulk and a poor defensive typing. Compound Eyes is used to increase the accuracy of Sleep Powder and Hurricane.

Usage Tips
========

Vivillon works well as a lead, as it can take out foes temporarily, giving its team an early advantage. It should not be switched into attacks, as it has poor bulk and its Focus Sash might get broken. Vivillon should try to put threatening enemies to sleep to allow its teammate to set up while giving itself an easier time setting up Tailwind. Tailwind should be used if Vivillon or its teammate needs to outspeed a foe, or when predicting an opposing Protect. Vivillon should often switch out to allow its teammates to take advantage of the good situation Vivillon produces with Sleep Powder and Tailwind. Hurricane should be used if the opponent has a Grass-type that can take Sleep Powder. Vivillon should be aware of Pokemon such as Aegislash and Rotom-H that will sometimes carry Safety Goggles.


Team Options
========

Setup sweepers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Azumarill appreciate the enemy being put to sleep, as it gives them free turns. Fake Out users such as Hitmontop and Mega Kangaskhan are often able to give Vivillon a free turn, allowing it to set up Tailwind or put a foe to sleep. Knock Off users such as Scrafty, Bisharp, and Weavile can remove the foe's Safety Goggles; however, only the latter is faster than Vivillon and can Knock Off Safety Goggles before Vivillon uses Sleep Powder. This is important, as most Safety Goggles users can beat Vivillon, and putting them to sleep would be Vivillon's best response. Kyurem-B works well as a partner, as it can Substitute on opposing sleeping Pokemon, and can take out the biggest problems to Vivillon, namely Thundurus, Shaymin-S, Safety Goggles Togekiss, and Rotom-H. Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Excadrill can beat Rock-types, which are particularly threatening to Vivillon, as they can bring Vivillon down to its Focus Sash and possibly cause it to flinch with Rock Slide.

Other Options
########

Bug Buzz provides a secondary STAB option and more neutral coverage, but Vivillon does not have the room for it. Friend Guard helps Vivillon support its team, but it greatly appreciates the accuracy boosts from Compound Eyes. Hurricane could be dropped for a support move, but that makes Vivillon complete Taunt fodder. U-turn allows Vivillon to gain momentum after putting a foe to sleep. Rage Powder allows it to help its teammate, but Vivillon cannot take many hits.

Checks & Counters
########
**Speed**: Pokemon that outspeed Vivillon such as Landorus-T and Shaymin-S can deal heavy damage to it with their STAB or coverage moves. The latter can switch into Sleep Powder and can cause Vivillon to flinch with Air Slash, but is OHKOed by Hurricane. Most moves can 2HKO Vivillon, making it vulnerable to revenge killing. Mega Diancie is particularly effective, as it blocks Sleep Powder with Magic Bounce, resists Hurricane, and can retaliate with super effective Diamond Storm, which, being a spread move, also bypasses Rage Powder.

**Utility Moves**: Taunt from Pokemon such as Thundurus prevents Vivillon from using Sleep Powder, making it easy for the foe to attack and KO it. Thundurus is a particularly good example, as it has Prankster, meaning it will move first in Tailwind, and resists Hurricane. Safeguard from Pokemon such as Klefki will also ruin its niche in putting foes to sleep. Fake Out from Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Weavile will break its Focus Sash, making it easy to KO. Substitute from Pokemon such as Aegislash and Heatran will block Sleep Powder, and Vivillon cannot break either with Hurricane. Faster Substitute users such as Thundurus and Terrakion can outspeed Vivillon and set up a Substitute before it uses Sleep Powder.

**Miscellaneous**: Safety Goggles prevents the Pokemon from falling asleep and common users of it, such as Rotom-H, can deal heavy damage to Vivillon. Safety Goggles Togekiss and Jirachi can redirect Vivillon's Sleep Powders and take little damage from Hurricane. Tyranitar's Sand Stream will break Vivillon's Focus Sash and Tyranitar can OHKO it with Rock Slide, and although they are not too common, Choice Scarf sets will outspeed it. Mega Abomasnow can break Vivillon's Focus Sash with hail, OHKO with Blizzard, is immune to Sleep Powder, and can take a Hurricane from full health. Ferrothorn and Escavalier are both immune to Sleep Powder, avoid the 2HKO from Hurricane, and can 2HKO Vivillon back with their STAB moves.

**Speed Control**: Icy Wind from Pokemon such as Suicune and Cresselia will break Vivillon's Focus Sash and make it easy to outspeed and revenge kill. Paralysis from Pokemon such as Thundurus and Klefki also ruins Vivillon's high Speed, allowing it to be easily KOed. Trick Room makes Vivillon easier to outspeed and KO, and users of the move such as Cresselia and Aromatisse often run Safety Goggles, rendering Sleep Powder useless.
