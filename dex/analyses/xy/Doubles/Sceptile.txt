Overview
########

After Mega Evolution, Sceptile gains a strong base 145 Special Attack and an amazing base 145 Speed, allowing it to outrun almost every major threat in the metagame. Its unique Grass / Dragon typing along with its ability, Lightningrod, grants it an immunity to Rage Powder, Spore, and Thunder Wave, making it a good choice on certain offensive teams, such as those that really appreciate an Electric immunity, redirection of Electric-type moves, and sleep-inducing moves, or are especially susceptible to Thunder Wave. However, Sceptile is hurt by its mediocre defenses, as well as its weaknesses to common moves such as Ice Beam, Draco Meteor, and Pixilate Hyper Voice, meaning it has few opportunities to switch in. It is also fairly linear in its options due to a limited movepool.

Moves
========

Leaf Storm and Dragon Pulse are powerful STAB moves that provide good neutral coverage. Giga Drain can be used in place of Leaf Storm to provide some longevity, though the drop in power is noticeable. Focus Blast is used in order to beat bulky Steel-types which resist both Leaf Storm and Dragon Pulse, as well as doing heavy damage to threats such as Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Kangaskhan without dropping Special Attack. Hidden Power Ice can be used to OHKO Landorus-T and Shaymin-S 100% of the time, while Leaf Storm can only OHKO the former with prior chip damage. Protect is used to safely Mega Evolve against faster Pokemon that can do heavy damage to Sceptile, such as Shaymin-S, Darkrai, and Landorus-T, as well as being useful for stalling out Trick Room and Tailwind turns and increasing the amount of turns Mega Sceptile can provide Lightningrod redirection for.

Set Details
========

A Timid nature and 252 Speed EVs allow Mega Sceptile to outrun as many opposing threats as possible, notably Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, and Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T. 252 Special Attack EVs allow it to attack as hard as possible. If the extra Speed is unneeded, a Modest nature can be used for the increased power, which grants Mega Sceptile the ability to OHKO Mega Kangaskhan and Kyurem-B. Overgrow allows Sceptile to forgo Mega Evolution in situations where it has lost 66% or more of its HP for the boost to its Grass-type attacks.

Usage Tips
========

Sceptile is best saved for late-game situations where it can use its great Speed and Special Attack to pick off weakened threats. When using Sceptile, it is almost always a KO or be KOed situation, and if Sceptile or its partner cannot get a KO that turn, it is best to Protect or to switch out, as Sceptile's mediocre defences make most neutral attacks a 2HKO and super effective attacks a near-guaranteed OHKO. If the opponent has a faster threat, always use Protect to safely Mega Evolve first turn. Sceptile should avoid super effective moves as best as possible, as well as common priority moves, almost all of which OHKO or 2HKO it. Though Mega Sceptile very rarely has opportunities to safely switch in, switching in on Electric-type moves can be a nice way to pick up a Special Attack boost, though Electric-types commonly have Hidden Power Ice, so be wary.

Team Options
========

Sceptile works well with partners that fear Electric- and Water-types; Talonflame in particular can beat common Ice- and Bug-types for Sceptile and appreciates Sceptile beating bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W as well as redirecting Electric-type attacks. Sceptile also partners well with fast, powerful Pokemon such as Deoxys-A, as they both outrun most common threats and can just force their way past opposing Pokemon. Hyper offensive teams in general appreciate Mega Sceptile's immunity to moves such as Spore, Rage Powder, and Thunder Wave, as well as its ability to break through threats such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Terrakion in addition to Dragons such as Latios and Hydreigon. Pokemon such as Terrakion and Keldeo work well with Sceptile, as they appreciate having bulky Water-types beaten, and in return they can provide Quick Guard support to keep priority moves away and can beat threats such as Heatran, Charizard, and Mamoswine. Bulky Steel-type Pokemon such as Heatran and Aegislash work well with Sceptile, as Sceptile readily beats threatening Ground-types, as well as Water-types for Heatran, and in return they can beat Fairy- and Ice-types, and Aegislash can also provide Wide Guard support for temporary protection against threats such as Heatran, Abomasnow, and Charizard. Jirachi can easily redirect threatening Ice-, Dragon-, Fairy-, and Flying-type moves, while Sceptile can easily beat Ground-types for Jirachi. Volcarona is also a good partner, as it can beat Bug-, Steel-, Ice-, and Grass-types and appreciates Rock- and Water-types being taken out. Boosting attackers such as Gyarados and Volcarona can beat Pokemon that threaten Sceptile; Gyarados provides Intimidate support and beats Fire-types, whereas Volcarona roasts Steel-, Grass-, and Bug-types, and both appreciate Thunder Wave being redirected. Discharge users such as Thundurus, Zapdos, and Rotom-A can be used to quickly boost Mega Sceptile's Special Attack.

Other Options
########

Sceptile can run Substitute to avoid potentially fatal attacks. Safeguard can be used to protect teammates from status moves, though the move is best reserved for bulkier Pokemon. Quick Guard is an option, as Sceptile tends to encourage priority moves, and can create mind games. Hidden Power Ground hits Steel-types more reliably than Focus Blast does but comes with significantly less power and coverage. Hidden Power Fire can be used to beat Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Scizor, but it lowers Sceptile's Speed by 1 point and has little use outside of beating them.

Checks & Counters
########

**Typing Advantage**: Fairy-type Pokemon such as Sylveon and Mega Mawile can switch in on Sceptile and either force it out or KO it. Flying-types such as Togekiss and Talonflame can beat it, with Togekiss resisting every move of Sceptile's, bar Hidden Power Ice, and Talonflame circumventing Sceptile's high Speed with Gale Wings. Ice-type Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Weavile can beat Sceptile with priority Ice Shard, though neither can switch in on Leaf Storm. Bulky Steel-types such as Aegislash, Scizor, and Escavalier can switch in on any of Sceptile's standard moves and proceed to 2HKO or OHKO it. Due to its mediocre defences, Sceptile can be OHKOed or 2HKOed by any strong neutral attack, such as Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave.

**Speed**: Weather sweepers such as Venusaur, Ludicolo, Kingdra, and Mega Swampert can outrun and KO Sceptile with super effective moves such as Sludge Bomb, Ice Beam, and Ice Punch under their respective weather conditions, though standard Mega Swampert is slower than Timid Mega Sceptile. Faster Choice Scarf users such as Genesect or Thundurus-T can outrun Sceptile and OHKO it with U-turn, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power Ice.

**Speed Control**: Sceptile's high Speed all but guarantees that it will be the last Pokemon to move in Trick Room, allowing Pokemon that Sceptile can normally pick off to beat it. For example, under Trick Room, Cresselia can outrun and OHKO Sceptile with Ice Beam. Tailwind allows Pokemon that Sceptile normally outruns to outspeed it and hit it hard. Pokemon such as Talonflame and Togekiss can beat Sceptile on their own or set up Tailwind to allow their teammate to do so.

**Utility Moves**: Common Follow Me users such as Jirachi and Togekiss can easily shrug off any attack Sceptile can throw at them, allowing their partner to handle Sceptile.
