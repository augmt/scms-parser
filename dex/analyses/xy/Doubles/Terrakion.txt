Overview
########

Terrakion's Speed, power, and coverage are very effective in Doubles. With STAB Rock-type attacks and Close Combat, it is able to maintain offensive pressure against most of the metagame, including common threats such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Kangaskhan, and Tyranitar. However, Intimidate and burns are very common in Doubles, so until those users are gone, Terrakion won't do much damage unless it lands asuper effective hit. In addition, Terrakion's great offensive typing is terrible defensively, leaving it vulnerable to many common attackers, such as Scizor, Latios, and Azumarill. Many strong attacks can KO Terrakion, so one bad prediction can waste Terrakion's teamslot.

Moves
========

Rock Slide is Terrakion's main STAB because it's a spread attack, has decent Base Power, and has a nifty flinch chance. However, Stone Edge is an option to hit threats much harder at the loss of covering both opponents. Close Combat hits very hard as well, granting Terrakion the option to snipe particular Pokemon. Protect helps Terrakion scout for attacks, stall field conditions, and ruin double-targeting strategies. Quick Guard is used to protect itself and its teammate against many priority attackers in Doubles, including Talonflame, Bisharp, and Azumarill. Terrakion also outspeeds, and therefore blocks, every common Fake Out user in the tier bar Weavile. Substitute allows Terrakion to set up on many status inducers, making its sweep much easier. However, Taunt can be used to reliably stop Trick Room, a playstyle that hurts Terrakion badly.

Set Comments
========

Life Orb is the most reliable item because of the damage output and should be used with Substitute; the extra damage doesn't bother Terrakion much because it won't survive many hits anyway. Terrakion can use a Focus Sash decently as well to guarantee survival against any attack, but it must use Quick Guard in that set. A Lum Berry can easily fit into the set as well, as it allows Terrakion to take a Will-O-Wisp and switch into Heatran's or Mega Charizard Y's Heat Waves more reliably.

Usage Tips
========

They best way to use Terrakion in battle is to keep constant offensive pressure on the opponent. Use Close Combat or Stone Edge to snipe particular Pokemon and Rock Slide to get key spread damage on the opponents. If neither attack is able to KO the opponents, use Protect and let Terrakion's partner deal some damage first. Terrakion is difficult to use because it is easily damaged beyond repair, so unless the damage is worth it, keep it out of play. This is why Terrakion works well as a late-game sweeper; once its opponents are sufficiently damaged, Terrakion can just use Rock Slide and wipe them out. However, if a Focus Sash is being used, Terrakion can revenge kill almost any opponent with little fear. Quick Guard is for situational threats, such as Prankster users and priority attackers. With a Focus Sash and Quick Guard, Terrakion makes a very good lead. Taunt should pretty much only be used when obvious Trick Room leads are present, because if Terrakion uses Taunt and the opponents attack, Terrakion's teamslot is wasted. Terrakion can set up Substitute on status users or use it as a makeshift Protect against slower opponents. With Substitute, it is better to play more cautiously, because if the opponent doesn't break Terrakion's Substitute on the turn it sets it up, Terrakion will have a field day attacking. Lastly, remember that Terrakion attracts Intimidate users and faster sweepers like flies, so some smart double-switching is needed to get momentum up against these threats.

Team Options
========

Cresselia is a fantastic partner for Terrakion because it can take almost every attack aimed at it, boost the power of its attacks with Helping Hand, and neuter threats such as Hitmontop and Landorus-T with Psyshock and Icy Wind, respectively. Amoonguss can dispose of key threats with its great bulk and Spore, as well as direct attacks aimed at Terrakion towards itself with Rage Powder. Azumarill is a good offensive partner because its STAB attacks threaten almost every Intimidate user that plans on switching into Terrakion. Mega Charizard Y can eliminate the Grass- and Fighting-types that threaten Terrakion. Lastly, Tyranitar and Excadrill can handle the bulky Psychic-types that wall Terrakion.

Other Options
########

Quick Attack is an option to pick off faster threats, but its damage output is severely lacking. X-Scissor is a good option to hit bulky Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Reuniclus for good damage. Terrakion can boost its stats with Swords Dance and Rock Polish, but both sets require a lot of support to work. A Choice Band or Choice Scarf set is usable, but Terrakion doesn't enjoy being locked into one move. Lastly, Helping Hand allows Terrakion to support its teammate, but bulkier Pokemon can use it many more times.

Checks & Counters
########

**Attack Control**: Both the burn condition and Intimidate severely hinder Terrakion's performance in battle. Pokemon such as Rotom-W can take a hit and use Will-O-Wisp to check Terrakion. Ghost-types such as Dusclops can switch into Close Combat and take little from Rock Slide. Also, most Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Hitmontop and Landorus-T, don't take much from Terrakion's attacks, so they can easily switch in, lower its Attack, and threaten it with their super effective STAB attacks. Fortunately, Will-O-Wisp is avoidable with Substitute, but if an Intimidate user switches in before Terrakion can set Substitute up, then the damage output will be almost laughable.

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Most bulky Pokemon that can switch into a Close Combat and take little damage from Rock Slide can stop Terrakion. This includes Pokemon such as Cresselia, Amoonguss, Aegislash, and Mega Heracross. Venusaur and Conkeldurr can also take a hit and restore HP with their STAB attacks. Gallade is a great check, as it resists both of Terrakion's STABs and can KO Terrakion.

**Speed**: Many fast Pokemon can outspeed and severely damage Terrakion. Common threats include Latios, Mega Gengar, and Shaymin-S. Without Quick Guard, Azumarill and Mega Scizor can switch in and hit it with super effective priority. Talonflame also can do a lot of damage with a neutral, powerful Brave Bird before Terrakion has the chance to attack. Tailwind is a good check to Terrakion, because with Tailwind up, many more threats can outspeed and KO it. Lastly, Pokemon holding a Choice Scarf such as Rotom-W and Genesect can surprise and KO Terrakion.

**Speed Control**: Trick Room strategies stop Terrakion cold, as they expose its poor defensive typing, allowing most threats to take it out before it can attack. Popular users include Cresselia and Dusclops, which have no trouble setting up Trick Room against Terrakion. Paralysis similarly cripples it because Speed is no longer its strength. Popular Thunder Wave users include Thundurus and Whimsicott, which have Prankster to hit first, and Cresselia, which cannot be broken by Terrakion.
