Overview
########

Sylveon's Pixilate ability coupled with its access to Hyper Voice makes it a formidable special attacker in Doubles. Its typing and good special bulk give Sylveon several switch-in opportunities, but unfortunately, its movepool is quite bare, forcing it to basically solely rely on its STAB attacks in order to deal damage. Its Speed is also pretty low, making it relatively easy to revenge kill outside of Trick Room. Stronger physical attackers can target its weak Defense and muscle past it.

Moves
========

Hyper Voice is the main STAB attack because of the immediate damage it deals to both foes. Moonblast can be used to bypass Wide Guard and deal more damage to individual threats. Hidden Power Ground is used to surprise Pokemon that resist Fairy, mainly Heatran; however, without Hidden Power Fire, Escavalier and Ferrothorn wall Sylveon. Psyshock hits Poison-types such as Amoonguss harder than Hidden Power Ground. Shadow Ball is to hit Aegislash, a common switch-in to Sylveon, harder than Hidden Power Ground or Hidden Power Fire.

Set Details
========

56 EVs in HP and 200 EVs in Defense give Sylveon enough bulk to take some physical moves such as Mega Kangaskhan's Return and Bisharp's Iron Head. Choice Specs gives Sylveon a massive power boost. Sylveon mainly relies on its STAB moves to deal damage anyway, so it won't suffer much from the inability to switch moves. Life Orb can be used to give Sylveon a boost in power without forcing it into one specific move undesirable to be locked into, such as Hyper Voice versus an opposing Wide Guard strategy. Pixie Plate can be used to fake a Choice Specs set while still boosting its power (Sylveon doesn't really use anything but its STAB moves anyway). If Choice Specs is not used, Protect is an option over coverage moves.


Usage Tips
========

Sylveon's sole focus with this set is to deal as much damage as quickly as possible, so care must be taken to send it in at the right time. It has a lot of special bulk, so it can be switched in against special attacks quite easily. Once in, simply use Hyper Voice to apply offensive pressure to the opponent's team and deal lots of damage. Be careful, as Sylveon is sure to move last against most offensive Pokemon with its low Speed, meaning it will have to take a few hits. Moonblast is mainly for Wide Guard users; most of the time, Hyper Voice is the better option because of its power and reliability.


Team Options
========

This set is reliant on team support, but can still easily tear through teams that lack solid counters to Fairy-types; as such, Pokemon that can remove those counters are really important. Ground-types are awesome partners because they hit almost all Pokemon that resist Fairy hard. Heatran, Landorus, and Shaymin-S are cool because they can provide Ground-type coverage that won't end up hitting Sylveon as well. Follow Me/Rage Powder support helps Sylveon's sweep with Hyper Voice or Moonblast, as does Fake Out support. Landorus-T, Scrafty, and Hitmontop provide Intimidate support. Speed control is extremely useful to help cover for Sylveon's low Speed; Trick Room pairs extremely well with this set, so Cresselia is great, as it also provides Helping Hand support, which makes Sylveon's attacks even more powerful. If Sylveon has Trick Room support, it should run 0 Speed IVs and a Quiet nature.


Other Options
########

Sylveon has few other offensive options, but it does have an extensive support movepool. Calm Mind is the only other option for offensive Sylveon. Choice Scarf is a gimmick, but on such a set, maximum Speed investment should be used.


Checks & Counters
########

**Type Advantage**: Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-types all wall Sylveon easily, as it is generally locked into Hyper Voice. Steel-types such as Scizor, Aegislash, and Bisharp can easily OHKO Sylveon before it attacks. Charizard and Talonflame get a special mention, as Sylveon cannot hit them with a super effective coverage move due to their immunity to Hidden Power Ground. Charizard has the bulk to sponge two Hyper Voices and retaliate with sun-boosted STAB attacks. Unfortunately, Talonflame is easily 2HKOed by Hyper Voice, so it is a shaky check. Heatran can sponge anything from Sylveon but Hidden Power Ground.

**Faster Pokemon**: Most offensive Pokemon can outspeed Sylveon, so they have plenty of time to attack it. Physical attackers can aim for its weaker physical bulk and gradually wear it down. Physical threats such as Mega Kangaskhan, Talonflame, and Life Orb Bisharp shine in this category, as all of them can hit Sylveon's weaker Defense hard.

**Utility**: Wide Guard blocks Hyper Voice, Sylveon's main STAB move. Good Wide Guard users include Aegislash, Aerodactyl, and Hitmontop. Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Breloom, and Venusaur can put Sylveon to sleep.
