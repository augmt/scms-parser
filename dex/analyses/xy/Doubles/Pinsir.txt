Overview
########

Mega Pinsir sports fantastic offensive stats. After Mega Evolving it hits 105 Speed and 155 Attack, giving it the power and speed to tear through unprepared teams. Upon Mega Evolution, it also gains a fantastic ability in Aerilate, which further boosts Mega Pinsir's damage output. Mega Pinsir has access to Feint, a versatile move that, unfortunately, sees low distribution. This helps it support teammates by breaking through Protect and also gives it a useful priority attack. Unfortunately, lackluster defensive stats and a poor defensive typing means that Mega Pinsir is fairly easily picked off by threats that outspeed it. Another problem Mega Pinsir faces is that it falls just short of OHKOs on a huge variety of common threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Garchomp. This means Mega Pinsir requires chip damage support so it can finish them off. Its mediocre bulk means it can't go for 2HKOes since it will most likely be KOed itself.

Moves
========

Aerilate-boosted Return provides the real power for the set. Flying-type attacks provide super effective coverage against common Bug-, Grass-, and Fighting-type Pokemon. This helps make it a solid deterrent to common support Pokemon that rely on Spore and Rage Powder, as well as powerful Fighting-types like Conkeldurr. Feint is a great move that can break through Protect and Wide Guard. This is useful, as with Mega Pinsir's partner, you can take down threats that would otherwise have survived behind Protect or Wide Guard. In addition to this, it hits with +2 priority meaning it can be used to pick off weakened threats, even if they're faster. Thanks to Aerilate, Mega Pinsir is the only Pokemon capable of breaking through a Protect from a Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gengar or Chandelure. Close Combat is typically used since it lets Mega Pinsir handle threats such as Tyranitar, Mega Kangaskhan, and Heatran. It also lets Mega Pinsir hit Rotom-W for decent damage. Alternatively, Earthquake can be used in this slot. It helps Mega Pinsir handle Pokemon such as Aegislash which otherwise walls the set completely; however, it will not 2HKO Aegislash without prior damage. It also deals more damage against Heatran. Protect is essential so Pinsir has time to Mega Evolve and gain the boost to its Speed, which is needed to handle threats that lie in the base 100 Speed area like Mega Charizard Y. It also improves longevity.

Set Details
========

The EVs ensure Mega Pinsir can switch into the field with Stealth Rock in play twice, whilst also maximizing its offensive capability. Pinsirite is required for Pinsir to Mega Evolve so that it can the most effective. Given how common Intimidate is, Hyper Cutter is the best ability for Pinsir since it nullifies the its effect as its Attack will not be lowered so long as it has not Mega Evolved. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon, but Adamant can be used for the boost in power. An alternative spread of 24 HP / 252 Atk / 232 Spe can be used to provide a little extra bulk whilst still outspeeding Garchomp.

Usage Tips
========

Mega Pinsir functions as a powerful attacker that can break down teams with its Aerilate-boosted STAB attacks and powerful coverage options. In addition to this, Mega Pinsir can be used to deter strategies such as Wide Guard and Quick Guard by using Feint. This helps your partner spam powerful spread or priority moves without having to worry about anything blocking them. Pinsir should utilize Protect to Mega Evolve safely so that it has enough Speed to handle certain threats. Its poor defenses means that it's forced to play a hit-and-run role as it cannot afford to stay on the field and take hits.

Team Options
========

Thanks to its immunity to Ground-type moves, Mega Pinsir is a good partner to Pokemon that use Earthquake such as Landorus-T. Mold Breaker Excadrill is a particularly notable user since it can deal with Rotom-W. Pokemon such as Hitmontop can help protect Mega Pinsir from moves such as Terrakion's Rock Slide through the use of Wide Guard. It also provides Fake Out or Quick Guard support to protect Mega Pinsir from Talonflame's Brave Bird. Heatran has good defensive synergy with Mega Pinsir, as it resists many of the types that Mega Pinsir is weak to, such as the Ice- and Flying-types. Flash Fire also provides an immunity to any Fire-type attacks aimed at Mega Pinsir. Pokemon that can handle Rotom-W such as Shaymin-S or Venusaur make for good partners. Fire-type Pokemon such as Volcarona and Rotom-H are appreciated to help Mega Pinsir deal with Aegislash. A slow Volt Switch from Pokemon such as Rotom-W can get Mega Pinsir an opportunity to switch in for free and pick off weakened threats. Cresselia is a good partner, as Helping Hand helps Mega Pinsir secure OHKOs whilst Icy Wind helps Mega Pinsir outspeed faster threats such as Terrakion and Shaymin-S.

Other Options
########

Double-Edge provides a more powerful STAB attack at the cost of some recoil. In addition to this, it is incompatible with both Feint and Quick Attack, meaning that Mega Pinsir will be left without a priority move. Facade provides an alternate STAB move that means Mega Pinsir does not have to worry about being afflicted with a burn. X-Scissor provides Mega Pinsir with a secondary STAB move, but it does not provide much useful coverage and barely hits for more damage than a neutral Return, even when it is super effective. Knock Off lets Mega Pinsir deprive opposing Pokemon of recovery items like a Sitrus Berry and other potentially dangerous items such as a Choice Scarf. Swords Dance can be useful to boost its damage output or nullify the effect of a burn or Intimidate, but it is risky as Mega Pinsir struggles to find opportunities to use it.

Checks & Counters
########

**Burns**: Pokemon that commonly carry Will-O-Wisp are an issue for Mega Pinsir. After being burned by threats such as Mega Gengar or Rotom-W, its damage output is severely reduced.

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Rotom formes can come in on everything Mega Pinsir has to offer and OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Other Electric-type Pokemon such as Thundurus-I and Mega Manectric also have an easy time dealing with Mega Pinsir. Talonflame can use its priority Brave Bird to OHKO Mega Pinsir with ease.

**Speed**: Faster threats can handle Mega Pinsir fairly easily. Pokemon such as Terrakion can outspeed Mega Pinsir and OHKO it with Rock Slide. Common Choice Scarf users such as Genesect and Landorus-T can also handle Mega Pinsir with their super effective coverage moves.

**Speed Control**: Mega Pinsir relies on its Speed to strike first and avoid taking hits. This makes Trick Room, Thunder Wave, Tailwind, and Icy Wind great options for dealing with it. Pokemon such as Cresselia, Togekiss, and Thundurus can all take a hit from Pinsir and set up some form of speed control to handle it with ease.
