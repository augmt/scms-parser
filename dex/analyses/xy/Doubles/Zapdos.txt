Overview
########

Zapdos has an excellent typing for the Doubles metagame, with only two weaknesses, complimented by great defensive stats. It also has a respectable base 125 Special Attack. Its main competition in Doubles comes from both Thundurus formes: Incarnate forme for support and Therian forme for attacking. However, Zapdos has greater bulk and access to the move Tailwind. Its movepool is enough for it to fulfill its role effectively and allows for several different viable sets. Its great Speed tier is especially useful for its role as a Tailwind user, as under Tailwind Zapdos outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame.

Bulky Tailwind
########
name: Bulky Tailwind
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Hidden Power Ice
move 3: Heat Wave / Protect
move 4: Tailwind
ability: Pressure
item: Sitrus Berry
evs: 252 HP / 144 SpA / 112 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Thunderbolt is Zapdos's main STAB move, hitting Water-types such as Politoed, Suicune, and Jellicent and Flying-types such as Talonflame, Togekiss, and Mega Charizard Y super effectively. Hidden Power Ice hits Ground- and Grass-types that are immune to or resist Thunderbolt, such as Landorus-T and Shaymin-S. Protect is for preventing damage for a turn, which will allow a partner to remove a threat or weaken it to KO range. An option to use over Protect is Heat Wave, as it allows Zapdos a chance to OHKO Pokemon such as Breloom and Mega Scizor. Tailwind is used to provide your team with doubled Speed for four turns, allowing you to go on the offensive and gain some momentum by making your slower Pokemon more threatening.

Set Details
========

252 HP EVs and a Sitrus Berry make sure Zapdos will always survive three Rock Slides from Adamant Landorus-T and a Double-Edge from Mega Kangaskhan. The 112 Speed EVs let Zapdos outspeed Jolly Breloom so it can Tailwind before it gets put to sleep by Spore, and even Timid Mega Sceptile once Tailwind is up. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack with a Modest nature to allow Zapdos to hit hard once it sets up Tailwind. Sitrus Berry allows Zapdos more freedom to switch in on Pokemon and take advantage of its bulk.

Usage Tips
========

This set makes for a great lead, as having a Tailwind set up by turn two can dramatically swing the game in your favor. Its bulk paired with a great typing allows Zapdos to switch in on a majority of Pokemon and scare them out, buying turns for a chance to set up multiple Tailwinds throughout the game. The bulk also means Zapdos can be switched out and brought back in later. The Special Attack investment gives Zapdos great offensive presence, making sure that it can continue being useful after Tailwind is set.

Team Options
========

Pokemon with already-present bulk or middling Speed tiers, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Heracross, make for great partners, as Tailwind allows them to become much harder to deal with. Pokemon that can provide Fake Out support pair well with Zapdos, as Fake Out gives it more freedom when setting up Tailwind. Mega Kangaskhan fits this role well, whereas Scrafty and Hitmontop bring Intimidate alongside Fake Out to aid Zapdos's bulk. Fire- and Ground-types are a good choice, as they handle Ice- and Rock-types, respectively, while Zapdos beats the Water-types that would give them issues. Ground-types such as Garchomp and Excadrill appreciate being able to use Earthquake freely while Zapdos is on the field. Breloom with a Focus Sash makes for an awesome partner, as it can Protect while Zapdos sets up Tailwind and provide fast Spore support.

Other Options
========

Other options include using a Life Orb to increase damage output, as it guarantees KOs on Pokemon such as Breloom, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Choice Specs has a similar effect, but removes the option of Tailwind. A Choice Scarf variant with an EV spread of 252 HP / 72 SpA / 184 Spe and a Modest nature can be used to counter Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T; the given spread ensures that Zapdos outspeeds the most common variant. The Life Orb, Choice Scarf, and Choice Specs variants can use Hidden Power Flying as a way to hit Fighting-types, as well as still hitting Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, although this will mean forgoing Hidden Power Ice. Roost is an option to give Zapdos some more longevity throughout the game. Thunder Wave is available if you want a more permanent solution to a fast threat, although Tailwind allows your team to benefit immediately. Discharge is an option when paired with Ground-types or Lightning Rod users. Volt Switch should be carried on the Choice item variants, and is an option on the Tailwind set to allow Zapdos to switch out and bring in a Pokemon that can take better advantage of Tailwind. Swagger gives Zapdos an option to potentially avoid taking hits from threats that its coverage doesn't extend to.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Type Advantage**: Kyurem-B resists Thunderbolt and takes little from both Hidden Power Ice and Heat Wave. Mamoswine and Tyranitar take little damage from Zapdos's attacks and can cause considerable damage with their STAB moves. Terrakion can outspeed and cause massive damage to Zapdos with its STAB Rock Slide. Mega Diancie comes very close to a OHKO with Diamond Storm and is able to KO Zapdos if it has received a small amount of chip damage.

**Defensive Type Advantage**: Rotom-H is a large problem for Zapdos, as it resists Electric, Fire, and Ice. Mega Venusaur is a problem as well because it resists Thunderbolt, takes neutral damage from Hidden Power Ice and Heat Wave thanks to Thick Fat, and is able to use Leech Seed to heal back any damage Zapdos inflicts. Latios can tank a Hidden Power Ice and hit back hard with Draco Meteor. Mega Swampert and Mega Camerupt are immune to Thunderbolt, neutral to Hidden Power Ice, and resist Heat Wave. The former is also bulky enough to survive over three Hidden Power Ices and can hit back hard with an Ice Punch or a rain-boosted Waterfall. The latter can hit Zapdos hard with Sheer Force-boosted Heat Waves, and usually carries Hidden Power Ice as well.

**Speed Control**: Trick Room is an issue for Zapdos and teams based on Tailwind. Cresselia can easily stand up to any of Zapdos's attacks and set up Trick Room. Other bulky Trick Room setters such as Aromatisse, Eviolite Porygon2, Reuniclus, and Dusclops can take a Thunderbolt with ease and use Trick Room.

**Bulky Attackers**: Zapdos is threatened by Pokemon that can take hits well and still hit back hard, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Hydreigon, Mega Gardevoir, Ludicolo, Sylveon, Scrafty, Mega Latias, and Conkeldurr. All of these Pokemon have access to either super effective coverage or incredibly hard-hitting neutral STAB moves.

**Utility**: Taunt will prevent Zapdos from setting up Tailwind, wasting a turn. Most Taunt users are faster than Zapdos too, so be careful. Prankster Taunt from Thundurus or Whimsicott is also something to look out for. Lightning Rod users such as Manectric and Rhyperior can redirect Zapdos's Thunderbolt and get a Special Attack boost.
