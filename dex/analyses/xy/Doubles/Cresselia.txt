Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Icy Wind / Thunder Wave
move 2: Helping Hand
move 3: Psyshock / Moonblast
move 4: Rest / Protect
ability: Levitate
item: Chesto Berry / Leftovers
evs: 240 HP / 12 Def / 60 SpA / 196 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========
- Icy Wind is a great spread move for speed control so that your partner will be able to outspeed. Thunder Wave is also useful for speed control and you can also have that occasional 25% paralysis hax.
- STAB Psyshock hits Hitmontop and Venusaur hard and is useful against specially defensive walls. Moonblast can also be a viable option as it is 4x super effective against Scrafty and gives Cresselia the ability to deal decent damage to Dark-types.
- Helping Hand assists in giving your partner Pokemon a 1.5x boost, which can be lethal in most situations.
- ChestoRest can keep Cresselia alive for a longer period of time for further support. Protect is convenient against incoming super effective attacks such as Shadow Ball and Crunch, and also gives Cresselia a free turn to restore health when using Leftovers.

Set Details
========
- A Calm nature with 240 HP and 196 SpD EVs allows Cresselia to be a specially defensive wall that's difficult to take down. Can take 4 hits of Heat Wave from Timid Charizard Y in the sun.
- 60 SpA EVs let Cresselia 2HKO max HP Hitmontop and Venusaur, while guaranteeing 80% damage against Landorus-T and Garchomp. Invest the remaining EVs in defense for a little added bulk.
- Chesto Berry + Rest lets Cresselia live longer for further support. Leftovers is a solid alternate option together with Protect for a free turn for restoring HP.

Usage Tips
========
- Main purpose of this set is for support and to provide partner Pokemon with Speed advantage and added offensive firepower.
- Cresselia is also extremely useful in switching into most incoming attacks thanks to her impressive bulk.
- Cresselia usually slows the opposing team down with Icy Wind until her partner is able to outspeed. She then proceeds to spam Helping Hand to assist her partner in dealing major damage.
- Psyshock and Moonblast should only be used if they are super effective against the opposing Pokemon or if it is low enough to KO.

Team Options
========
- This set is most effective on offensive teams looking for a little bulk and Speed advantage to be able to outspeed foes and sweep.
- Sweepers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Mawile, Landorus, Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, Azumarill, and Keldeo enjoy speed control.
- Cresselia can fit into virtually any team looking for support.
- Fighting-types such as Hitmontop and Scrafty are good partners, as they can eliminate Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon who pose a threat to Cresselia. Fire-types such as Heatran and Talonflame are also useful for taking care of Scizor and Mega Mawile.
- Earthquake users such as Landorus-T and Garchomp can Earthquake freely thanks to Levitate.

Trick Room
########
name: Trick Room
move 1: Trick Room
move 2: Psyshock / Moonblast
move 3: Reflect / Helping Hand
move 4: Protect / Light Screen
ability: Levitate
item: Mental Herb / Light Clay
evs: 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Sassy

Moves
========
- Trick Room allows the slower Pokemon to move first, which helps slow sweepers gain an advantage.
- STAB Psyshock hits Fighting-types pretty hard, but Moonblast enables Cresselia to deal decent damage to Dark-types, notably Scrafty.
- Helping Hand gives the partner Pokemon, preferably a Trick Room sweeper, a significant Attack boost.
- Protect is useful for stopping incoming super effective attacks, although Light Screen and Reflect give the team a little added bulk.
- Reflect and Light Screen are interchangeable; use the screen your team benefits from the most.

Set Details
========
- A Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs allow Cresselia to function effectively in Trick Room.
- Mental Herb guarantees that Trick Room will be set up, as Taunt will be ineffective.
- 252 HP and 80 Def EVs let Cresselia take three Knock Offs from Adamant max Attack Scrafty and three Brave Birds from Adamant max Attack Life Orb Talonflame.
- Light Clay is also a great option as it lets Reflect and Light Screen last for 8 turns, which can provide your team with significant bulk.
- Sitrus Berry is an effective alternative if you want to increase Cresselia's durability.

Usage Tips
========
- The best way to use Trick Room Cresselia is in, well, Trick Room. Protect with your partner Pokemon, and set up Trick Room with Cresselia.
- Attempt to keep Cresselia and a partner sweeper alive for a possible late-game sweep.
- Use Light Screen or Reflect immediately after Trick Room to provide your team with a lot of bulk.
- Cresselia is great for switching into due to her ability to take multiple hits thanks to her amazing bulk.
- Use Cresselia as a support in dealing a little bit of damage along with your partner, or use Helping Hand to give your partner an offensive boost.

Team Options
========
- Again Cresselia is great for Trick Room teams as it is almost guaranteed you can set up Trick Room with its impressive bulk.
- Partner Cresselia with slow sweepers such as Mega Mawile, Rhyperior, and Mega Ampharos.
- Pair Cresselia with a Fake Out user such as Scrafty or Hitmontop to flinch potential threats to increase chances of getting Trick Room up. Fighting-types also handle the common threats Cresselia has to deal with such as Tyranitar and Bisharp.
- Earthquake users such as Rhyperior are a great match with Cresselia, as she carries Levitate.
- Amoonguss can also be viable as Rage Powder is able to redirect Taunt and guarantee a Trick Room setup. It can also put a potential threat to sleep with Spore.
- Lead with Cresselia + either a physical or special sweeper, as leading with two support Pokemon isn't really effective.

Bulky Offensive
########
name: Bulky Offensive
move 1: Psyshock
move 2: Hidden Power Ground / Moonblast
move 3: Ice Beam / Icy Wind
move 4: Protect / Rest
ability: Levitate
item: Expert Belt / Chesto Berry
evs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD
ivs: 30 SpA / 30 SpD
nature: Modest

Moves
========
- STAB Psyshock deals significant damage to common Fighting-type threats such as Hitmontop and Conkeldurr. Moonblast is a great alternate option, as you can hit threats such as Scrafty and Sableye hard, with Cresselia OHKOing Scrafty with Expert Belt.
- Hidden Power Ground Cresselia is the best check to Heatran, as it is 4x super effective and Cresselia's bulky defenses allow her to survive numerous hits from Heatran.
- Ice Beam takes care of huge threats such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, but Icy Wind is also viable if you want to have speed control.
- Protect stops incoming super effective attacks, such as Knock Off, Crunch, Shadow Ball, and Bug Bite. Rest can also be utilized for increased durability.

Set Details
========
- Max HP Cresselia increases her survivablity and her ability to wreak havoc against the opponent.
- Expert Belt gives Cresselia's attack a nice little boost, but you can use a ChestoRest combo if you want to keep her on the field longer.
- Modest nature and max Special Attack maximize Cresselia's attacking power. Icy Wind is also a great spread move that can lock down Landorus-T and the Dragons running around.
- Trick Room can be viable as it can turn Cresselia into a bulky sweeper, as well as assist your partner in gaining the Speed advantage if it is slower than the opposing team.

Usage Tips
========
- The best way to use Bulky Offensive Cresselia is on a offensively oriented team looking for a little bulk and damage support.
- This set can have an unexpected surprise factor, as most Pokemon switch into her with the idea that Cresselia will only set up.
- Wide movepool allows Cresselia deal significant damage to numerous threats in the metagame.
- Cresselia can also be switched multiple times thanks to her excellent defensive stats.
- Hidden Power Ground is specifically for Heatran and other Pokemon that are 4x weak to it. STAB Psyshock is more reliable as it hits with just about the same power and is more useful to spam constantly.

Team Options
========
- Life Orb Terrakion is amazing paired alongside Cresselia, as Terrakion can take care of threats to Cresselia such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Scrafty.
- Dark-type killers, such as Scrafty, Mega Gardevoir, Sylveon, and Keldeo, are great for helping keep Cresselia alive.
- Intimidate users paired with Cresselia's Icy Wind can lower both the Attack and Speed of foes, which can be pretty useful in the long run.
- Steel-types wall this Bulky Offensive Set so Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Landorus-T are great partners.
- Earthquake users such as Landorus-T and Garchomp are free to attack thanks to Cresselia's Levitate.

Other Options
########

- Psychic is viable to hit harder against Pokemon that aren't specially defensive.
- A max HP and max Defense Cresselia with a Bold Nature + Calm Mind can sweep unaware teams.
- Access to both Sunny Day and Rain Dance makes Cresselia a great weather supporter.
- Hidden Power Fire lets Cresselia put up a fight against Scizor and Ferrothorn.
- Skill Swap is also an amazing option; you can give Heatran Levitate and not have to worry about Earthquake or Earth Power. Not to mention that Cresselia gains a Fire-type immunity in return.
- Magic Coat bounces back the incoming status conditions Cresselia hates, such as Taunt and Toxic.
- Safeguard can also be used to prevent annoying status conditions.
- Gravity can raise the accuracy of moves, but it makes Cresselia and Flying-types vulnerable to Ground-type moves.
- Cresselia also has access to Swagger, and can be paired with a physical sweeper carrying Lum Berry for a +2 attack boost.
- Dual screens are useful even outside of Trick Room.

Checks & Counters
########

- Cresselia despises Knock Off and Dark-types can counter Cresselia if it is not carrying Moonblast.
- Bulky Steel-types wall Cresselia if it does not have Hidden Power Ground, but some Steel-types, such as Scizor, Air Balloon Heatran, Aegislash (STAB Shadow Ball), and Escavalier (STAB Megahorn), wall Cresselia even with Hidden Power Ground.
- Cresselia absolutely hates bulky Ghost-types such as Cofagrigus and Dusclops, which wall Cresselia with Pain Split + Will-O-Wisp.
- Bisharp can switch into Icy Wind, gain a +2 Attack Boost due to Defiant, and proceed to sweep your team.
- Pokemon carrying Substitute, such as SubTran, can set up on Trick Room and Support Cresselia.
- STAB Technician Bug Bite from Scizor is a huge threat to Cresselia, as you can even get your precious Chesto or Sitrus Berry eaten.
- Without Mental Herb, Taunt absolutely demolishes Cresselia, as Taunt prevents it from performing its role as a supporter or a Trick Room setter.
