Overview
########

Cresselia possesses outstanding bulk and an amazing movepool, making it a top-tier threat in Doubles with the ability to take hits well and run many different sets. Cresselia is an effective fit on various types of teams, providing support or offensive presence with moves such as Trick Room, Psyshock, and even Helping Hand. However, it is prone to becoming setup bait, especially for threatening sweepers carrying Substitute. Furthermore, Knock Off is a commonplace move that is very threatening to Cresselia due to the fact that it takes a significant amount of damage from the attack and loses its precious item.

Support
########
name: Support
move 1: Icy Wind / Thunder Wave
move 2: Helping Hand
move 3: Psyshock
move 4: Light Screen / Protect
ability: Levitate
item: Sitrus Berry / Safety Goggles
evs: 252 HP / 100 Def / 44 SpA / 112 SpD
nature: Calm

Moves
========

Icy Wind is a spread move that provides speed control and is 4x super effective against Landorus-T, Shaymin-S, and Salamence. Thunder Wave is also great for permanent speed control and the possibility to immobilize a foe. Helping Hand assists in giving Cresselia's partner a 1.5x power boost, which can be helpful in many situations. Psyshock is a reliable STAB move because more of the Doubles metagame has bulkier Special Defense. Light Screen boosts the team's overall Special Defense significantly or Protect can be used to add more survivability.

Set Details
========

A Calm nature with maximum HP investment and 112 Special Defense EVs enable Cresselia to be a specially defensive wall that's difficult to take down. With the assitance of a Sitrus Berry, Cresselia can avoid getting 2HKOed by a Shadow Ball from Modest Mega Gengar. Furthermore, the 100 Defense EVs with the Sitrus Berry ensure that Cresselia will survive a Pin Missile from Adamant Mega Heracross, an extremely strong attack, and also let it avoid being 2HKOed by a Double-Edge from Mega Kangaskhan. Safety Goggles can assure Cresselia is not shut down by Spore or Sleep Powder.

Usage Tips
========

The main purpose of this set to provide Cresselia's partner with speed control and a boost to its attacks. However, Cresselia is also extremely useful in switching into most attacks thanks to its impressive bulk. Cresselia should slow the opposing Pokemon down with Icy Wind until its partner is able to outspeed them, before spamming Helping Hand to assist its partner in dealing major damage. Psyshock should only be used if it is super effective against the opposing Pokemon or if the enemy is within KO range.

Team Options
========

This set is most effective on offensive teams looking for a Pokemon that can take hits and provide speed control to aid with sweeping. Powerful attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Mawile, Landorus, Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, Azumarill, and Keldeo all enjoy speed control for beating faster checks. Speedy Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Keldeo or those with priority moves make good partners, as they can eliminate Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon before they inflict damage towards Cresselia with their powerful Dark-type STAB attacks. Fire-types such as Heatran and Talonflame are also helpful for taking care of annoying Steel-types that will support Cresselia such as Scizor. Earthquake users such as Landorus-T and Garchomp are able to spam Earthquake thanks to Levitate, while also taking care of Steel-types, notably Heatran. Garchomp appreciates speed control as well to outspeed and beat Latios.

Offensive Trick Room
########
name: Trick Room
move 1: Psychic
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Hidden Power Ground / Hidden Power Fighting
move 4: Trick Room
ability: Levitate
item: Expert Belt / Sitrus Berry
evs: 252 HP / 12 Def / 228 SpA / 16 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
nature: Sassy

Moves
========

Trick Room gives slower allies a chance to sweep. Cresselia's STAB-boosted Psychic does respectable damage to things which are not weak to its coverage moves, such as Rotom-W. Cresselia should always run Psychic, not Psyshock, because only the former breaks Kyurem-Black's Substitute. Ice Beam gives Cresselia extra coverage, dealing 4x super effective damage to common threats such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Hidden Power Ground lets Cresselia 2HKO Heatran, a threat that would normally wall Cresselia, as it resists Psychic- , Ice-, and Fairy-type attacks. Hidden Power Fighting allows Cresselia to deal 4x super effective damage to Bisharp.

Set Details
========

The main purpose of this set is to set up Trick Room and hit common threats hard. A Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs allow Cresselia to function as effectively as possible in Trick Room. The EV spread lets Cresselia survive a Life Orb-boosted Knock Off from Bisharp while OHKOing 0 / 4 Landorus-T with Ice Beam. Expert Belt lets Cresselia deal more damage to the Pokemon it hits for super effective damage without compromising its bulk as Life Orb would do. Sitrus Berry increases Cresselia's longevity and lets it set up Trick Room more times and deal extra damage to foes. 

Usage Tips
========

Trick Room should be set up as early in the battle as possible, as Cresselia functions best under it and it can aid slower partners. You should also attempt to keep Cresselia and a partner that can sweep under Trick Room alive for a possible late-game sweep when the opponent's checks have been removed. Cresselia is great for switching into attacks because its amazing bulk allows it to take multiple hits. Cresselia should also be used to support its partner by getting surprise KOs on checks such as Bisharp and Landorus-T.

Team Options
========

As the moveset suggests, Cresselia is great for Trick Room teams, as you will find many opportunities to set up Trick Room with its impressive bulk and hit foes that are weak to Cresselia's attacks for good damage with Expert Belt. You should partner Cresselia with slow, powerful Pokemon such as Mega Mawile, Rhyperior, and Mega Ampharos to get the most out of the Trick Room turns provided. A Fake Out user such as Scrafty or Hitmontop can flinch potential threats to increase the chances of setting Trick Room. Fighting-types also handle the common threats Cresselia has to deal with such as Tyranitar and Bisharp. Earthquake users such as Rhyperior pair well with Cresselia, as they can freely use their STAB attack without hitting Cresselia. Amoonguss can also be a viable partner, as Rage Powder redirects Taunt and aids in setting up Trick Room. It can also put a potential threat to sleep with Spore and benefits greatly from Trick Room.

Other Options
########

Psychic is an option over Psyshock to hit physically defensive Pokemon harder. A Calm Mind set with maximum investment in HP and Defense EVs and a Bold Nature can catch teams off-guard and potentially sweep. Cresselia makes a great weather supporter with access to both Sunny Day and Rain Dance. Reflect is a useful support option if you want to increase your team's overall physical defense. Light Clay can be used to lengthen the time screens last. Hidden Power Fire lets Cresselia hit Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn for 4x super effective damage, as they take very little from any of its other attacks. Skill Swap is also a notable choice, as you can pass Levitate to Heatran and not have to worry about opposing Ground-type attacks while Cresselia gains an immunity to Fire-type attacks. You are also able to strip enemies of their useful abilities, such as Huge Power on Azumarill or Parental Bond on Mega Kangaskhan. Moonlight is a solid recovery move that replenishes 50% health and even more in sun. However, it is not recommended on sand or rain teams, as it will only heal 25%. Safeguard can be used to prevent crippling status conditions like Sleep and Paralysis as well as stop physical attackers from being burned by Will-O-Wisp. Gravity can raise the accuracy of moves such as Hydro Pump, but it also makes Cresselia and Flying-types vulnerable to Ground-type moves. Cresselia also has access to Swagger, and can be paired with a physical sweeper carrying Lum Berry for a +2 attack boost while disrupting the opposing team with confusion. Lunar Dance enables a crippled Pokemon to regain all of its HP with no status for a potential late-game sweep, although this is at the cost of Cresselia.

Checks & Counters
########

**Typing Advantage**: Dark-types such as Bisharp, Scrafty, and Hydreigon can counter Cresselia if it is not carrying Moonblast, as they are immune to its STAB Psychic-type attacks. Bisharp and Scrafty can also run Knock Off, which Cresselia despises. Bisharp can even switch into Icy Wind and gain a +2 Attack boost due to Defiant. Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Mega Gengar can deal a lot of damage with their super effective STAB Shadow Ball. Mega Gengar must be careful though, as it takes a lot of damage from Cresselias STAB Psychic-type attacks. STAB Bug Bite from Scizor with a Technician boost is a huge threat to Cresselia, and it can potentially take Cresselia's Sitrus Berry. Mega Heracross also OHKOes Max HP Cresselia with Pin Missile if it has less than 100 Defense EVs. Genesect can constantly hit Cresselia with STAB U-turns while avoiding a possible Hidden Power Fire. Download can also give Genesect a +1 Attack boost, increasing U-turn's damage. Bulky Steel-types wall Cresselia without Hidden Power Ground, and some Steel-types, such as Scizor, Air Balloon Heatran, Aegislash, and Escavalier, wall Cresselia even with it. Scizor, Aegislash, and Escavalier can also hit back hard with super effective STAB attacks, but need to be wary of a potential Hidden Power Fire. Mega Mawile is an extra scary threat because it can take advantage of the Trick Room turns Cresselia provides and hit very hard.

**Utility Moves**: Pokemon that carry Substitute such as Heatran can set up on Trick Room Cresselia and support Cresselia with ease. Without a Mental Herb, Taunt completely shuts down Cresselia, as it is unable to fulfill its role as a supporter or a Trick Room setter. Spore completely shuts down a Cresselia without Safety Goggles.
