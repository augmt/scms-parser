Overview
########

Diancie is a big threat in the Doubles metagame because its Mega Evolution allows it to outspeed much of the metagame, it has a great offensive typing along with an outstanding STAB spread attack in Diamond Storm, and access to Earth Power and a STAB Moonblast to hit the Steel- and Fighting-type Pokemon that resist Diamond Storm. Mega Diancie has an advantage as a late-game cleaner thanks to Magic Bounce protecting it from Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, Swagger, and sleep attacks, all of which can stop other sweepers cold. However, because it has to run mixed coverage to hit every relevant threat, Diancie's attacks often fall short of KOing, and Pokemon can take advantage of Diancie's many common weaknesses and lackluster defenses and severely damage it. Intimidate limits its sweeping potential as well, but it does have Clear Body before Mega Evolving to mitigate that somewhat.

Mixed Attacker
########
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Diamond Storm
move 2: Moonblast
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Protect
item: Diancite
evs: 208 Atk / 48 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Hasty

Moves
========

Diamond Storm is Diancie's primary STAB attack because it has good Base Power, hits both foes, and has very good coverage type against much of Doubles. In addition, if Mega Diancie can accumulate many Defense boosts, it has an easier time getting past many of its checks, such as Landorus-T and Azumarill. Moonblast is its second STAB attack, hitting Fighting-types, which can switch into Diamond Storm, hard. Earth Power hits Steel-types such as Heatran and Aegislash, which resist Diancie's STAB attacks. Lastly, Protect keeps Diancie safe while Mega Evolving and can be used to stall out Tailwind and Trick Room in addition to keeping it healthy while partners take out its checks.

Set Details
========

The EVs maximize Speed because Mega Diancie needs to outspeed common threats such as Terrakion and Keldeo and has crucial Speed ties with Latios and Mega Metagross. The rest of its EVs go towards powering up Diamond Storm, with the exception of 48 Special Attack EVs to KO Bisharp and non-Shuca Berry Heatran. Hasty is the preferred nature because Diamond Storm can patch up the Defense drop.

Usage Tips
========

You should typically use Protect to safely Mega Evolve Diancie the first turn it's out and acquire its high Speed. From there, you can proceed to spam Diamond Storm, using coverage moves when necessary or using Protect while Diancie's partner damages the foes enough for Diamond Storm to KO. However, there are rare cases when it may be better not to Mega Evolve Diancie, such as when facing semi-Trick Room teams and wanting to out-slow certain threats, being forced to stay in and wanting to survive attacks, or waiting for Intimidate users to be taken out. Diancie works best late-game when everything on the opponent's team has accumulated damage, because Diamond Storm misses out on many KOs. Lastly, keep an eye out for lures such as Shuca Berry Heatran.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that can take out Diancie's checks make for good partners. For example, Life Orb Bisharp and Choice Scarf Kyurem-B can take out Choice Scarf Landorus-T, which can be a pain to Diancie. Wide Guard support from Aegislash or Hitmontop helps Diancie against Ground-types as well. Partners that can take out Steel-types, such as Landorus-T and Rotom-H, make for good partners as well. Helping Hand support, particularly from Pokemon such as Politoed and Cresselia, powers up Diancie's attacks, allowing it to nab KOs it would miss out on otherwise. Grass-types such as Shaymin-S can remove bulky Water-types that annoy Diancie, while Diancie takes out the Fire-types that threaten them. Tailwind support from Pokemon such as Suicune and Talonflame allows Diancie to get past its faster checks and be useful against other Tailwind teams. Redirection support is very helpful to it as well. Amoonguss can tank Water-type attacks aimed at Diancie, such as Azumarill's Aqua Jet. Rage Powder Volcarona can handle checks such as Bullet Punch Scizor and Mega Metagross.

Other Options
########

Diancie can run Substitute to deal with Intimidate easier and to protect itself for an extra turn. It can invest more into its Special Attack and use attacks such as Dazzling Gleam and Hidden Power Fire, which beats Ferrothorn and Escavalier, but the utility of Diamond Storm is hard to pass up. Diancie can set up dual screens easily thanks to Magic Bounce blocking Taunt, but it is outclassed in this role by Pokemon that can hold Light Clay, and using a Mega Pokemon as support is a waste of its power. Diancie has access to Skill Swap, which could pass Magic Bounce to setup sweepers, but that is rather niche and hard to accomplish. Lastly, Diancie can use an okay non-Mega Trick Room set, as it does have decent bulk and a good ability in Clear Body.

Checks & Counters
########

**Typing Advantage**: Many bulky Water-type Pokemon can check Diancie fairly easily. For example, Rotom-W, Milotic, Suicune, and Politoed can all take multiple hits and KO it with Hydro Pump. Azumarill can take it out quickly with Aqua Jet, and Ludicolo can outspeed and KO it in the rain. Bulky Steel-type Pokemon are also threatening. Aegislash (which can protect its partner from Diamond Storm with Wide Guard), Jirachi, and Shuca Berry Heatran can all switch in on three of Diancie's moves, take an Earth Power, and KO it with their STAB attacks. Scizor can KO it quickly with Bullet Punch. Mega Metagross Speed ties with it and can KO with Bullet Punch as well. Ferrothorn and Escavalier aren't even weak to Earth Power and can easily beat Diancie.

**Intimidate**: Choice Scarf Landorus-T can easily switch in on most of Diancie's attacks and force it out with a super effective Earthquake. Even if Diancie has Wide Guard support, it won't be doing much damage with a -1 Diamond Storm. Scrafty and Hitmontop can also switch in and out of Diamond Storm, which Diancie primarily uses, to weaken its power. They just need to be careful of Moonblast. Note that they all need to switch in after Diancie Mega Evolves, as it has Clear Body as an ability beforehand.

**Speed**: Faster threats, such as Shaymin-S, Choice Scarf Genesect, and Choice Scarf Excadrill, can easily outspeed and KO Diancie. However, they are unable to switch in easily.

**Speed Control**: Tailwind and Trick Room teams are a pain to Diancie because they allow threats to outspeed and dent Diancie before it has a chance to respond. Common Trick Room users include Cresselia, Aromatisse, and Gourgeist. Common Tailwind users include Suicune, Hydreigon, and Talonflame.
