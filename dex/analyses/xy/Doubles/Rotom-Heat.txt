Overview
########

Rotom-H's unique Electric / Fire typing and ability, Levitate, allow it to reliably check several major threats in Doubles such as Mega Charizard Y, Genesect, and Shaymin-S as well as BoltBeam coverage sweepers such as Thundurus and Mega Manectric. In addition, Rotom-H has a great support movepool, decent mixed bulk, decent Special Attack, and good STAB coverage, making it a reliable offensive supporter. However, its only Fire-type STAB move, Overheat, comes with a nasty Special Attack drop, making it difficult to use. In addition, Rotom-H is often overshadowed by Rotom-W which boasts the same stats and movepool, but has a much more reliable STAB attack in Hydro Pump and only one weakness to Grass as opposed to Rotom-H's common weaknesses to Rock and Water.

Offensive Support
########
name: Offensive Support
move 1: Overheat
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Will-O-Wisp / Thunder Wave
move 4: Protect
item: Sitrus Berry / Safety Goggles
evs: 200 HP / 88 SpA / 220 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Overheat is a powerful STAB move that allows Rotom-H to hit Shaymin-S and Genesect super effectively while doing good damage to neutral threats at the cost of -2 Special Attack. Thunderbolt lets it hit Mega Charizard Y and other Flying-types and is a more reliable STAB attack due to its lack of a Special Attack drop. The next moveslot depends on what the team needs; Will-O-Wisp lets Rotom-H cripple almost every physical attacker, and Thunder Wave provides easy speed control with the chance of free turns. Lastly, Protect keeps it alive by allowing it to stall out field conditions, scout for attacks, and ruin offensive strategies.

Set Details
========

The EV spread allows Rotom-H to outspeed Jolly Breloom and Bisharp while surviving a Stone Edge from an Adamant Landorus-T. A Modest nature and 88 Special Attack EVs grant it some decent firepower. However, the 88 Special Attack EVs can be moved into Special Defense and the nature can be changed to Calm in order to survive a Hydro Pump from a positive-natured 132 SpA Rotom-W, but there are more benefits for focusing on offenses, like the ability to always break Heatran's Substitute with Thunderbolt. Sitrus Berry adds much-needed longevity to Rotom-H, allowing it to support its team longer, but Safety Goggles can be used, making Rotom-H a perfect switchin to every sleep-inducing threat in the Doubles metagame.

Usage Tips
========

Rotom-H typically uses its typing, ability, and bulk to switch into threats that cannot hurt it, such as Doubles' many Flying-type Pokemon. Once switched in, it can proceed to cripple threats with status depending on which of the opposing Pokemon threatens its team the most. It can offer chip damage support with its STAB attacks, but Rotom-H's damage output is somewhat lacking, so it cannot be relied on for KOs unless it can hit super effectively; even then, despite being super effective, Thunderbolt will generally not KO bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune, and they can react with powerful Water-type attacks. It is also important to note that although Rotom-H resists Mega Charizard Y's coverage, the combination of Heat Wave and Overheat will KO it in the sun. Lastly, keep in mind that Rotom-H can get worn down quickly, even with a Sitrus Berry, so try to limit the amounts of damage it takes.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that like Shaymin-S, Talonflame, or Mega Charizard Y swiftly taken out include Amoonguss, Breloom, Suicune, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Heracross, making them good partners. Almost every Pokemon in Doubles appreciates Rotom-H's Will-O-Wisp support, and in conjunction with Intimidate partners such as Landorus-T and Gyarados, physical attackers are hard-stopped. Pokemon that appreciate Thunder Wave support such as Genesect, Hydreigon, Mega Heracross, and Mega Kangaskhan make great teammates as well. Fighting-types such as Terrakion, Conkeldurr, and Scrafty take out the Rock-types that scare Rotom-H, and Pokemon such as Breloom, Mega Charizard Y, Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Thundurus take out the Water-types that threaten it. In addition, Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir appreciate Rotom-H's ability to handle Steel-type Pokemon. Mamoswine, Mega Mawile, and Azumarill can handle the Dragon-types that wall Rotom-H's coverage moves. Lastly, Rotom-H enjoys Wide Guard support from Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Aegislash to protect it from Rock Slide, Muddy Water, and Mold Breaker Earthquake.

Other Options
########

Electroweb can be used in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp so there are no conflicting status conditions; however, Thunder Wave is a much more reliable and permanent choice in a typical battle. Rotom-H can use a Choice Specs or Choice Scarf set to KO or outspeed a certain threat, but Overheat's Special Attack drop limits any Choice set's viability. Volt Switch is a good option for momentum gain, and Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit annoying Dragon-types. Other options include ChestoRest and Pain Split, which grant decent recovery. Charti Berry lets Rotom-H take a Stone Edge or Rock Slide from Pokemon including Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Landorus-T, even with passive damage, and respond with a Will-O-Wisp. Lastly, Rotom-H has the ability to set up dual screens to support its team.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Pokemon such as Terrakion and Choice Scarf Tyranitar can outspeed Rotom-H and KO with STAB Stone Edge, only having to worry about avoiding a status attack on the switch-in. Landorus-T commonly carries Stone Edge as well, but it needs some prior damage on Rotom-H to KO it. Water-types such as Rotom-W and Gastrodon can take any of its moves and respond with their super effective STAB attacks. Dragon-types such as Latios, Goodra, and Hydreigon also wall its coverage and can respond with a Draco Meteor, only having to worry about Thunder Wave. A quick method to dispose of Rotom-H is Mold Breaker Earthquake, which is commonly used by Choice Scarf Excadrill and Mega Gyarados; however they both have to avoid several of Rotom-H's attacks when they enter battle. Some powerful tanks, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Tyranitar, and Mega Heracross can potentially overpower Rotom-H even if burned.

**Opposing Weather**: Rain teams consisting of threats such as Politoed, Kingdra, Ludicolo, and Manaphy completely power through Rotom-H with their rain-boosted, super effective, Water-type STAB attacks. Rain also weakens Rotom-H's Overheat, preventing it from KOing many of the Grass-types that it is supposed to take out. Sandstorm teams also wear it down quickly and have many Rock-types to threaten it with their STAB attacks, though Safety Goggles helps by preventing Sandstorm damage.

**Utility Pokemon**: Taunt users such as Thundurus and Mew and Safeguard users such as Cresselia and Klefki can prevent Rotom-H from spreading status around the opposing team, making it much easier to deal with. Assault Vest Pokemon, such as Guts Conkeldurr (which doesn't have to worry about status), Ludicolo, and Snarl Raikou can easily shrug off its attacks and wear it down. Lastly, faster Substitute users that don't mind Thunderbolt, such as Landorus-T and Kyurem-B, can easily steal momentum from Rotom-H.
