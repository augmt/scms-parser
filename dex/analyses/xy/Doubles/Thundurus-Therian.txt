Overview
########

Boasting a high 145 Special Attack stat, Thundurus-T cements itself as a strong attacker in the Doubles metagame. Its capability to fire off powerful Thunders makes it a natural pick for rain-based teams. Volt Absorb lets it absorb Thunder Waves aimed at its Swift Swim partners and soak up Electric-type attacks for Politoed. However, Thundurus-T is frail, so it can't often switch in without taking significant damage. Though Thundurus-T is faster than base 100s such as Mega Kangaskhan, its base 101 Speed is only decent and leaves it outrun by the likes of Terrakion and Mega Diancie. Another note is that as an attacker, it doesn't have many useful coverage options outside of Hidden Power and Focus Blast. Finally, outside of Choice sets, Thundurus-T is outclassed by Thundurus, which is faster and has more useful abilities.

Choice Scarf
########
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Thunderbolt
move 3: Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Focus Blast
ability: Volt Absorb
item: Choice Scarf
evs: 24 HP / 252 SpA / 232 Spe
nature: Modest

Moves
========

Volt Switch is a STAB move that hits decently hard while letting Thundurus-T switch out, allowing it to function as a scout early-game and put in some chip damage. Thunderbolt is a strong Electric-type STAB move that lets Thundurus-T secure KOs and clean up late-game. Hidden Power Ice is a useful coverage move that lets Thundurus-T hit Pokemon that resist or are immune to its Electric-type STAB moves, such as Amoonguss and Landorus-T. Focus Blast covers Excadrill and Ferrothorn and lets Thundurus-T deal massive damage to Heatran and nab a KO on Tyranitar. If Thundurus-T is used in the rain, Thunder is an option to hit foes harder.

Set Details
========

Choice Scarf lets Thundurus-T outspeed and significantly damage or KO threats it wouldn't be able to otherwise and lets it be a fast Pokemon in general; it also lets Thundurus-T function as a revenge killer when needed. Volt Absorb is useful for letting it switch into opposing Electric-type attacks and absorb them for nifty recovery. The EV investment lets Thundurus-T outspeed Modest Choice Scarf Hydreigon and gives it maximum power, with the leftover EVs put into HP. A Modest nature is used to maximize offensive potential, as Thundurus-T already outspeeds the majority of the metagame with Choice Scarf. However, a Timid nature can be used to outrun Swift Swim Ludicolo in rain, but it misses out on some power.

Usage Tips
========

As Thundurus-T is quite fast, it can function as a lead most of the time and scout moves with Volt Switch. However, when against the threat of a Fake Out, it's best to switch out to an appropriate Pokemon. Thundurus-T can be useful to get some chip damage early-game using Volt Switch. Be wary of opposing Protect, however, as Thundurus-T's frailty means that it can't afford to not be able to switch out. It can also function as a cleaner late-game once most of its checks are gone or weakened, as its Speed can make it hard to hit while it gets KOs.

Be wary of opposing switch-ins to Pokemon that resist or are immune to Thundurus-T's STAB moves and predict accordingly; for example, if predicting a Landorus-T switch-in, using Hidden Power Ice can nab an easy KO. Another example of predicting is using Volt Switch on a predicted resisted switch-in. Don't recklessly switch in Thundurus-T, since it's frail and can't really afford to take a hit. Only do so when predicting an Earthquake or an Electric-type attack is coming its way. In particular, it can be a nifty switch-in on incoming Thunder Waves, protecting its teammates from paralysis while giving it recovery. In a pinch, Thundurus-T can function as a revenge killer thanks to its Speed, power, and coverage.

Team Options
========

Pokemon that appreciate the luring and removal of Landorus-T enjoy Thundurus-T as a partner. Physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Terrakion appreciate being able to come in without Landorus-T neutering their Attack and forcing them to switch out. A Pokemon with Fake Out can pair well with Thundurus-T to function as a scouting lead. Mega Kangskhan can use Fake Out while forcing some switches thanks to its strong offensive presence, which pairs well with Volt Switch. Ludicolo also has Fake Out and can take out annoying Ground-types with Hydro Pump. Since opposing Latios is a huge thorn in Thundurus-T's side, Thundurus-T appreciates partners that can consistently threaten to KO Latios. Aegislash can switch into both Draco Meteor and Psyshock and threaten to KO with Shadow Ball, while also having Wide Guard to shield Thundurus-T from opposing Rock Slide and other powerful spread attacks. Thundurus-T also appreciates partners that can remove opposing Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, which can both soak up Thundurus-T's Electric-type STAB moves and take a Hidden Power Ice, threatening to cripple or significantly damage Thundurus-T afterward. Shaymin-S and Talonflame can both net a KO on most Grass-types with their Flying-type STAB moves, the former being notable for also being able to handle opposing Ground-types, which can soak up Thundurus-T's Thunderbolt and Volt Switch. Pokemon that Thundurus-T can fall back on to take the omnipresent Rock Slide make for viable partners as well. Keldeo can switch in while threatening Rock Slide's major users Landorus-T and Terrakion, and Ferrothorn can safely switch in to take numerous hits and slowly whittle away at the foes, though it can't switch in on Terrakion. If using Thunder instead of Thunderbolt, Politoed makes for a viable partner to make said move more accurate.

Choice Specs
########
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Volt Switch
move 2: Thunder / Thunderbolt
move 3: Hidden Power Flying / Hidden Power Ice
move 4: Focus Blast
ability: Volt Absorb
item: Choice Specs
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Volt Switch is the first STAB move, which hits hard and deals significant chip damage while scouting for moves. Thunder, the second STAB move, packs a strong punch with Choice Specs and lets Thundurus-T significantly damage or KO opponents. However, it should only be used while rain is present, as it is inaccurate otherwise. Thunderbolt makes for a fine alternative, but it loses out on a notable amount of power. Hidden Power Flying hits Grass-type Pokemon troublesome to the rain archetype such as Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur for significant damage. Hidden Power Ice is an option to be able to hit predicted Landorus-T and Garchomp switch-ins while still hitting Amoonguss. However, it misses out on Mega Venusaur because the weakness is negated by Thick Fat. Focus Blast rounds out the moveset, covering Excadrill and Ferrothorn while netting quick KOs on Heatran and Tyranitar.

Set Details
========

Choice Specs boosts Thundurus-T's already high Special Attack to greater levels, letting it do significant damage with its attacks; it boasts so much power that it can even net a 2HKO on Latios with Thunder. Volt Absorb lets it safely switch into opposing Electric-type attacks for recovery in a pinch. Using the given combination of nature and EV investment, Thundurus-T outruns positive-natured base 100s such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y while having maximum offensive potential.

Usage Tips
========

Choice Specs Thundurus-T should only be used in rain, as it can't safely use its powerful Thunder without it. Any team without rain should be using another set instead. Thundurus-T can function early-game by dealing decently strong chip damage with Volt Switch, which is useful for letting its teammates clean later on. Be wary of opposing Protect, however, as Thundurus-T can't afford to not be able to switch out, due to its frailty. Use Thunder when you need something KOed or broken down, since it's really strong and deals significant damage even to switch-ins that resist it. It's also the move to use generally, as it's really powerful and can significantly weaken most threats. Thundurus-T can be paired with a Fake Out user such as Ludicolo to safely net chip damage and possibly maintain momentum with Volt Switch.

Be wary of opposing switch-ins to Pokemon that resist or are immune to its STAB moves and predict accordingly; for example, if predicting a switch-in that resists Thundurus-T's other moves, use Volt Switch to maintain momentum. Use the appropriate coverage move for the threats they were meant for; use Hidden Power Flying to break down Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, and use Focus Blast to hit Ferrothorn. Finally, don't blindly switch in Thundurus-T, as it can't really afford to take a hit, due to its frailty. Only do so when predicting an opposing Earthquake or Electric-type move. In particular, it can switch into incoming Thunder Waves, protecting its teammates, especially its Swift Swim sweeper partners, from paralysis while giving it nifty recovery.

Team Options
========

Politoed is an excellent partner for this particular set, as the rain it brings lets Thundurus-T fire off its monstrous Thunder with never-miss accuracy. Partners that can eliminate opposing Ground-types that may soak up Thundurus-T's Electric-type moves serve well as partners. Swift Swim Ludicolo and Mega Swampert can outspeed and KO the omnipresent Choice Scarf Landorus-T, the most notable Ground-type, while being staples on rain teams in general. Keldeo can remove Ground-types as well, while also netting a KO on Ferrothorn, another thorn in Thundurus-T's side. If not running Hidden Power Flying, Thundurus-T appreciates Pokemon that can remove opposing Grass-types, which wall it. Both Shaymin-S and Kyurem-B can net a KO on common Grass-types with their respective super effective STAB moves. Pokemon that Thundurus-T can fall back on to take the omnipresent Rock Slide make for viable partners. Physically defensive Politoed can safely come in while threatening the move's major users, Landorus-T and Terrakion, and Ferrothorn can safely switch in to take numerous hits and slowly whittle away at the foes, though it can't switch into Terrakion. To patch up Thundurus-T's only decent Speed, a Tailwind setter could be a viable partner. Both Latios and Shaymin-S can set it while being able to take out faster threats to Thundurus-T such as Terrakion and Keldeo.

Other Options
########

Superpower can be used over Focus Blast for a more accurate alternative. However, it's significantly weaker, as it comes off of the notably lower Attack stat while compounding Thundurus-T's physical frailty. A boosting set with Agility can be used, as the merit of outrunning the majority of the metagame while hitting decently hard and being able to run a Modest nature is tempting. However, it doesn't find much room for setup, nor does it have the bulk to do so. Nasty Plot is another usable move that can be used to power up Thundurus-T's offensive capabilities to monstrous levels, but it holds the same flaws as the Agility set while also being outclassed as a user of the move by Thundurus. Discharge is a usable move that lets Thundurus-T ignore redirection. It can be taken advantage of as well by pairing Thundurus-T with Mega Sceptile to boost its Special Attack with Lightning Rod. Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp can also be paired with Thundurus-T to safely use the move without hitting a teammate.

Checks & Counters
########

**Typing Advantage**: As Thundurus's main sets are Choice-locked, Thundurus-T can easily be taken advantage of by the following Pokemon, as it can't switch moves to cover them. Both Latios and Latias can safely take any attack, even one Hidden Power Ice at full health, and KO with Draco Meteor. Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mega Swampert can easily switch in on its Electric-type attacks and KO with an appropriate move. The former has to be wary of switching into a Hidden Power Ice, however. If Thundurus-T is not carrying Hidden Power Flying, Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur can safely ignore or cripple Thundurus-T; in particular, Amoonguss can redirect and soak up its Electric-type STAB moves with Rage Powder, effectively making Thundurus-T a non-factor in play. If Thundurus-T is not locked into Focus Blast, both Kyurem-B and Ferrothorn can safely come in, the former netting the KO with Ice Beam. Most Pokemon bar Ground-types have to be wary of switching into Volt Switch, as Thundurus-T can switch out to the appropriate answer and maintain momentum.

**Speed**: If not using Choice Scarf, Thundurus-T can easily get KOed by other users of the item, such as Landorus-T and Genesect. It is also outrun and easily KOed by faster threats such as Terrakion and Mega Diancie.

**Speed Control**: Since Thundurus-T is naturally fast, Trick Room puts it at a disadvantage by making it move slower than most Pokemon, which also makes its frailty more pronounced. Cresselia can safely set up Trick Room while taking most of Thundurus-T's attacks. Cresselia's Icy Wind also lowers Thundurus-T's Speed, which makes it vulnerable to more threats, while also dealing super effective damage. Keldeo can use Icy Wind to deter Thundurus-T from switching in, but it has to be careful when against it.

**Opposing Weather**: If rain is not present, Thundurus-T can't use Thunder accurately. Abomasnow, Tyranitar, and Mega Charizard Y can change the weather to Thundurus-T's displeasure. Mega Charizard Y has to be careful when switching in, however.
