Overview
########

Keldeo's unique Water / Fighting typing allows it to check many common threats in the metagame. This includes, but is not limited to, Heatran, Landorus-T, Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Mega Kangashkan. Keldeo also sports a very high base 108 Speed and strong base 129 Special Attack, allowing it to not only outspeed the aforementioned threats but OHKO them as well when holding a Life Orb, a rarity in this metagame. Keldeo's base 91 / 90 / 90 defenses aren't that bad either, helping it take a neutral hit or two and retaliate hard. It also has a few solid support options, including Icy Wind and Quick Guard. While all this makes Keldeo seem amazing, it does have its flaws. The Water typing which gives Keldeo such a large offensive presence also gives it a weakness to common Electric-types in the metagame, such as Rotom-W and Thundurus. While its bulk isn't bad, it is not amazing either, which, when coupled with Keldeo's reliance on its high Speed stat, leaves it vulnerable to speed control. Keldeo also has a very limited movepool, making it predictable and therefore easier to play around.

Moves
========

This is Keldeo's most viable set, and it uses it very well. Hydro Pump is the chosen Water-type STAB, and it deals a lot of damage to any non-resisting opponent, of which, due to the great neutral coverage of Water-type attacks, there are many. However, because of the shaky 80% accuracy of Hydro Pump, Scald is also a viable option. It is 100% accurate and also comes with a nice 30% chance to burn the target, which is good for crippling physical attackers. The power drop is noticeable, however, as 4 / 0 Heatran avoids the OHKO from Scald. Secret Sword is Keldeo's most reliable Fighting-type STAB attack, and it scores an OHKO on 4 / 0 Mega Kangaskhan. It can also hit opposing Water-types which resist Hydro Pump, like Rotom-W and Ludicolo, as well as hitting Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Icy Wind gives Keldeo a spread attack that slows the opposing Pokemon down, letting Keldeo's ally outspeed them. Quick Guard is another support option here, as it blocks incoming Fake Out and Talonflame's Brave Bird, which is super effective against Keldeo. Finally, Protect is a staple move in Doubles, as it can stall out weather conditions and Trick Room turns, as well as protect Keldeo from any attack while its partner takes its turn.

Set Details
========

The 24 HP EVs in minimize the amount of damage Keldeo takes from Life Orb recoil, and the 252 Speed EVs allow Keldeo to Speed tie with Terrakion and opposing Keldeo. The remaining 232 EVs are then invested in Special Attack for as much power as possible. A simpler EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe can be run as well. It doesn't get any more OHKOs or 2HKOs, but the extra power is nice if you aren't too worried about Life Orb recoil. Life Orb is the preferred item for this set, as it allows Keldeo to get several OHKOs it couldn't achieve otherwise. Focus Sash is also a plausible option here if you want Keldeo to survive at least one hit, though its defenses are high enough that it can usually survive most neutral hits and even weaker super effective hits without a Focus Sash. The power loss is also noticeable without a Life Orb.

Usage Tips
========

Keldeo should be brought in against Pokemon that it can threaten, such as Heatran, Landorus-T,  Mega Kangaskhan, and Bisharp. However, Keldeo should not be played recklessly, and it must be brought in on an expected attack that it resists or after a teammate has fainted, or else Life Orb recoil and switch in damage will build up quickly. If Quick Guard is used over Icy Wind, then Keldeo should be mainly used against Fake Out users such as Kangaskhan so its partner can attack without fear of getting flinched. It can also be used to block powerful priority attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird, and can stop Prankster Thunder Wave, among other things. However, this often requires proper prediction, as the opponent might expect it and use an attack without priority instead, wasting your turn. If carried, Icy Wind can be used to slow down opposing threats for a partner or to hit both opponents when a Follow Me / Rage Powder supporter like Togekiss or Amoonguss, respectively, is on the field. It can also help Keldeo slow down a faster threat, such as Shaymin-S, and pick it off afterwards. Once Keldeo has defeated the opponents it was meant to check, it can then proceed to hit anything and everything as hard as possible. As long as its teammates can handle the remaining members of the opposing team, keeping Keldeo alive won't be a major issue.

Team Options
========

Because of its ability to counter multiple major Doubles threats, Keldeo can find a spot on almost any team. Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Gourgeist-S make good teammates, as they can switch into common Electric- and Grass-type attacks that are super effective against Keldeo. In particular, they are great for being able to handle Rotom-W, which is probably the most common threat to Keldeo. Electric- and Rock-types are also good teammates, being useful for dealing with Talonflame and other Flying-types that Keldeo is weak to. A notable choice here is Mega Manectric. Before Mega Evolving, it has the ability Lightningrod to draw in super effective Electric-type attacks for Keldeo. Once it has Mega Evolved, it gains the useful ability Intimidate to weaken physical attackers. It also acts as a good Talonflame switch-in, resisting its priority Brave Bird. Dark-types, such as Bisharp, make good teammates as well, handling Psychic-types for Keldeo. Those with access to Sucker Punch are particularly helpful for dealing with Latios, a very common threat to Keldeo which resists both of its STAB attacks. Fire-types that beat Pokemon like Amoonguss and Venusaur are particularly helpful, as those two resist both of Keldeo's STAB attacks too. Heatran and Rotom-H are especially effective as they also wall Talonflame, though Chandelure, Talonflame, and others are also very effective. Rage Powder / Follow Me support from Amoonguss or Togekiss is a useful asset to Keldeo, redirecting particularly threatening attacks and helping it stay around for longer to check the Pokemon it needs to.

Other Options
########

A Substitute set with Leftovers, where Substitute is used over Icy Wind, is a solid option, making use of the switches Keldeo tends to force to protect itself from an incoming attack. Focus Blast can be used over Secret Sword due to its higher Base Power of 120, but usually the risk of it missing 30% of the time is not worth the increase in power, as Keldeo still gets the OHKOs it needs to with Secret Sword. Stone Edge is an incredibly surprising move that Keldeo can use to hit Mega Charizard Y. It OHKOes Charizard without any investment, something that Hydro Pump cannot do when Drought is active. Calm Mind can be used, because, if given the opportunity to use it, Keldeo can hit even harder while also finding it easier to take special attacks. Reflect is an option if your team has trouble with physical attackers. Taunt can shut down Trick Room and Tailwind among other support moves. Helping Hand can give an ally a 50% boost in power for their next attack, which is useful if Keldeo cannot do much damage to the opposing side or has removed all of the Pokemon it needed to, though these situations rarely occur. Safeguard can protect allies from status moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, Sleep Powder, and Spore. Mystic Water is also an item option because it gives Keldeo's Water-type moves of choice a 20% boost in power without the harmful recoil effect from a Life Orb. Coba Berry is a nifty item that Keldeo can make use of, as it helps it survive a Brave Bird from a 252+ Choice Band Talonflame, proceeding to OHKO it with a Water-type attack. Wacan Berry can help Keldeo live a Thunderbolt from Thundurus before hitting it hard with a Hydro Pump. However, this will not KO without a Life Orb, and so is not recommended. Lum Berry allows Keldeo to have a safety net against Thundurus's Thunder Wave, following it up with a Hydro Pump, but yet again, this won't KO. Choice Specs is another item Keldeo can use, as it hits much harder than Life Orb without its harmful recoil effect. However, as a result, Keldeo cannot switch moves, forcing it to switch out if an opponent that resists its attacks switches in.

Checks and Counters
########

**Speed Control**: Opposing speed control shuts down Keldeo, as its Speed is its most important trait and without it Keldeo becomes very easy to 2HKO, if not OHKO. Thunder Wave, Tailwind, and Trick Room will all halt Keldeo's offensive capabilities.

**Speed**: Talonflame can come in on a Secret Sword or Icy Wind and OHKO Keldeo with a priority Brave Bird, ignoring any Speed drops. Fast Electric-types such as Thundurus, Thundurus-T, Raikou, and Mega Manectric can deal heavy damage with Thunderbolt / Volt Switch. However, these Pokemon must be wary of switching into a Hydro Pump, as this will always OHKO Talonflame and deal a lot of damage to the Electric-types as well, Raikou and Mega Manectric of which must also be careful of Secret Sword.

**Typing Advantage**: Latios can switch into Keldeo's STAB attacks and proceed to OHKO it with Psyshock. It must be wary of a super effective Icy Wind which makes it slower than Keldeo, though. Bulky Rotom-W can tank two Secret Swords when factoring in Sitrus Berry and deal heavy damage with Thunderbolt. Bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Trevenant, Gourgeist-S, and Amoonguss can comfortably sit in front of Keldeo as they resist both of its STAB attacks, and because Icy Wind has a very low Base Power, it will be doing very little to them. These Grass-types can then proceed to hit Keldeo with their Grass-type STAB attacks or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder or Spore. Jellicent is a complete wall to Keldeo, as it is immune to both of Keldeo's STAB attacks and resists Icy Wind, and can chip away at it with Shadow Ball, burn it with Will-O-Wisp, or simply set up Trick Room for its teammates. Cresselia and other bulky Psychic-types are similar to Jellicent in that they can comfortably take multiple Hydro Pumps while hitting Keldeo with Psyshock, Icy Wind, Thunder Wave, or simply setting up Trick Room to "slow it down" for 5 turns, crippling Keldeo.
