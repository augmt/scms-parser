Moves

- Giga Drain is the secondary STAB on the set, giving Venusaur recovery while attacking.
- Sleep Powder gives it a supporting option for it's teammates and allows it to abuse the lack of sleep clause
- Protect allows Venusaur to protect from super effective damage while teammates deal with the problem.

Set Details
========

- The EV spread makes Venusaur to be the fastest Pokemon in the Metagame while sun is up, allowing it to outspeed the most common Choice Scarf users. It's also faster than common Pokemon like Heatran without sun.
- Thanks to Chlorophyll, Venusaur doesn't need many speed EVs to be fast, so you can invest in HP to be a very bulky attacker.
- Modest nature paired with Life Orb gives Venusaur the power to deal major damage.

Usage Tips
========

- Pair Venusaur with Mega Charizard-Y, Sun should be up to ensure Venusaur's success.
- Not only does Venusaur apply a lot of pressure with its STABs, but access to sleep powder means it can put Pokemon to sleep at will. It can use this option to support teammates.
- Venusaur's Grass-typing also allows Venusaur to be immune to powder moves. Venusaur can bully Amoonguss and all other Grass-types in the tier by switching into them at will and threatening them with Sludge Bomb.
- Venusaur should be used in the early game to apply a lot of pressure on the opposing teams and potentially set up something for a teammate in the later game.

Team Options
========

- Venusaur should always be used in tandem with Mega Charizard-Y.
- Heatran is also a good partner for Venusaur, as it has the ability to switch into all Fire-type attacks, and removes Steel-type Pokemon.
- Pokemon that use Sunny Day can set up sun for a potential sweep for Venusaur.
- Pokemon with a powerful Ground-type STAB like Landorus-T also remove Steel-type Pokemon that would potentially be a problem for Venusaur.

Other Options
========

- Mega Venusaur can be used. It is very bulky and doesn't rely on sun to succeed.
- Earthquake and Growth are two interesting options for Venusaur to run. Earthquake allows it to hit Heatran for super effective damage, while Growth gives it a +2 stat boost in sun.
- Wide Lens could be used to raise the accuracy of Sleep Powder.

Checks and Counters
========

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: 

Two of the most common Pokemon in the tier, Charizard-Y and Heatran, are both Fire-type and can use their powerful STAB to scare Venusaur.

** Defensive Typing Advantage**: 

Since Venusaur only runs its two STAB moves, it has no way to hit Steel-type for any damage other than Giga Drain. It can put them to sleep but nothing will happen other than that.

** Speed Control**: 

Pokemon like Thundurus and Cresselia aren't going to take much from Venusaur, and they will be able to slow it down with Thunder Wave and Icy Wind respectively, making Chlorophyll less of a factor in the battle.

**Opposing Weather**: 

Venusaur wants sun up at all times, as if the weather war is lost Venusaur's success will be hindered.
