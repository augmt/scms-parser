Overview
########

With great Special Attack and Speed, an amazing ability in Serene Grace, and good coverage to back that all up, Shaymin-S is a great special attacker in the Doubles metagame. Seed Flare in conjunction with Serene Grace make it so very few Pokemon want to switch in on Shaymin-S for fear of an 80% chance of having their Special Defense lowered by two stages. With Air Slash, Shaymin-S has a great 60% chance to flinch the opponent, and its large Speed stat makes it easy to continually pull off flinches. To top it all off, threats such as Heatran are easily brushed aside by Earth Power.

However, Shaymin-S has many flaws that hold it back from being one of the best Pokemon in Doubles. It is very predictable, having one viable set. Its STAB moves also have serious accuracy issues, making it hard for Shaymin-S to perform well consistently. Its Grass / Flying typing leaves it vulnerable to many common attacks such as Rock Slide, Ice Beam, and Heat Wave. It is also very vulnerable to different forms of speed control, such as Trick Room and Tailwind. Combine this with its bad defenses, and Shaymin-S can have a hard time staying alive on the battlefield. Despite this, Shaymin-S is a great asset for many teams, and is capable of putting serious offensive pressure on the opponent.

########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Seed Flare

move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Protect
item: Life Orb
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Modest / Timid

Moves
========

Seed Flare is Shaymin-S's main STAB move for its monstrous power as well as an 80% chance to sharply lower the opponent's Special Defense. Air Slash is an excellent secondary STAB attack, which, when combined with Serene Grace, allows Shaymin-S to easily net flinches against the opponent. Though Air Slash's power is nothing to write home about, Shaymin's base 120 Special Attack can still let it tear apart many Fighting-, Bug-, and Grass-type Pokemon. Earth Power is very useful against Steel- and Fire-types, such as Heatran, who would otherwise wall this set. Protect is a staple in Doubles, and Shaymin-S is no exception; it allows Shaymin-S to scout for priority or status, avoid double targeting, and stall field effects such as Tailwind and Trick Room.

Set Details
========

The EV spread gives Shaymin-S the most power and Speed possible. While a Timid nature allows Shaymin-S to outspeed Thundurus and Choice Scarf Tyranitar, a Modest nature is recommended for the massive power it provides; for instance, Air Slash gets a guaranteed OHKO on 252 HP / 4 SpD Hitmontop, while Seed Flare gets a guaranteed OHKO on 0 HP / 0 SpD Landorus-T. Life Orb is the recommended item for Shaymin-S because the extra power boost is extremely valuable.

Usage Tips
========

With proper support, Shaymin-S can easily be used as a lead. It can also be brought out mid-game to punch holes in the opponent's team, or used later in the game as a late-game cleaner. Due to Shaymin-S's low defensive stats, it doesn't get many opportunities to switch-in, so try to keep as much offensive pressure on the opponent in order to avoid being KO'd. However, Shaymin-S can be switched in on a predicted Ground- or Water-type move, as well as Sleep Powder and Spore due to its Grass typing.

Team Options
==========

Follow Me support is highly recommended, as drawing attacks away from Shaymin-S can easily extend its lifespan. Jirachi can use Follow Me and resists Flying-, Rock-, Poison-, and Ice-type moves, while Shaymin-S can take down most Ground- and Fire-types with Seed Flare and Earth Power, respectively. Hitmontop can use Wide Guard, an extremely helpful move, to help protect Shaymin-S from super effective moves like Rock Slide and Heat Wave. It can also use Quick Guard to protect Shaymin-S from attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird and Ice Shard. Fake Out support from the likes of Hitmontop and Scrafty is also helpful, as it can immobilize a threatening opponent for Shaymin-S. Offensive Fire-types like Mega Charizard and Heatran make great partners, as they appreciate Shaymin-S's ability to deal with bulky Water- and Rock-types. They also can take out the Steel-types that wall both of Shaymin-S's STAB attacks. Finally, Ground-types such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Garchomp appreciate Shaymin-S's Ground-type immunity, as it allows them to spam Earthquake more easily.

Other Options
########

Shaymin-S has some other notable options. The first is Sitrus Berry, which gives it some slight recovery. However, Shaymin-S's frailty makes Life Orb the superior option most of the time. If you're more worried about Seed Flare's shaky accuracy, Energy Ball is the way to go, though its not as strong as Seed Flare and only has a 20% chance to lower Special Defense by one stage. Different Hidden Power types can be used for additional coverage: Hidden Power Fire hits Scizor and Ferrothorn, Hidden Power Ice hits Flying- and Dragon-types such as Thundurus and Salamence, and Hidden Power Rock OHKOes Mega Charizard Y with a Modest nature and Life Orb. However, the loss in a normal coverage move or Protect makes it hard to fit onto the set. Substitute can be used to evade status, though is usually inferior to Protect. Focus Sash is an option, as it can allow Shaymin-S to survive a powerful hit that would normally OHKO it. Choice Specs can be used for extreme power, though the inability to switch moves makes Life Orb the better option most of the time. Finally, Yache or Charti Berry can be used to survive a super effective Ice- or Rock-type attack, though it is very situational, making it generally inferior to Life Orb.

Checks and Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Pokemon with a powerful super effective move can usually take out Shaymin-S with little to no problem. Such Pokemon include Air Balloon Heatran, Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, Togekiss, Thundurus, Kyurem-B, Weavile, and Mamoswine. Neutral priority from the likes of Bisharp or Mega Mawile can also revenge kill a weakened Shaymin-S with ease. However, it should be noted that a lot of these Pokemon cannot directly switch into Shaymin-S, and even ones that can may be flinched by Air Slash. While other Pokemon such as Ice Beam Cresselia would normally be a great switch-in to Shaymin-S, Seed Flare's 80% chance to lower Special Defense means that they cannot reliably switch in.

**Speed**: Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Genesect can hit Shaymin-S with a super effective Rock Slide or Ice Beam to revenge kill it. Other fast Pokemon, such as Mega Gengar and Mega Manectric, can outspeed and heavy damage with Sludge Bomb and Flamethrower, respectively.

**Speed Control**: Moves that control Speed can cripple Shaymin-S easily. Thunder Wave from the likes of Togekiss or Jirachi can slow it down considerably, and moves such as Icy Wind from Cresselia or Jirachi will lower its Speed. Tailwind and Trick Room both alter the Speed of Pokemon on the field, allowing the opponent's Pokemon to outspeed and take out Shaymin-S quickly. Common users of Tailwind include Togekiss, Talonflame, and Tornadus, while common users of Trick Room include Cresselia, Aromatisse, and Reuniclus.
