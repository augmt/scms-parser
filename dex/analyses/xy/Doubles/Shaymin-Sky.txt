Overview
########

Shaymin-S's high Special Attack and Speed make it an offensive powerhouse in Doubles OU. Its Speed tier is extremely important, allowing Shaymin-S to beat many of the ORAS Mega Evolutions, particularly Diancie. Shaymin-S also gets the typing advantage over several new Mega Evolutions, particularly Diancie. Serene Grace makes Seed Flare and Air Slash very annoying to face, whether Shaymin-S is wearing down special walls for its teammates or constantly causing the foe to flinch. Shaymin-S's Grass typing prevents Spore and Rage Powder from hindering it; its typing is also great offensively, granting Shaymin-S a niche as the best offensive Grass-type in the metagame, while access to Earth Power allows it to KO Steel-types, which otherwise wall Shaymin-S. However, Shaymin-S is quite frail and has a a poor defensive typing. It also relies heavily on its Speed; as such, opposing speed control heavily cripples it.

Moves
========

Seed Flare is a powerful STAB attack that has an 80% chance to halve the foe's Special Defense. Air Slash is used as a secondary STAB attack; Shaymin-S's high Speed means it can easily take advantage of the move's 60% flinch rate. Earth Power is important to prevent Steel-types from walling this set. Protect is used to allow Shaymin-S to scout, avoid damaging moves, and stall out opposing speed control.

Set Details
========

Maximum investment in Speed and Special Attack make Shaymin-S as fast and powerful as possible. Life Orb significantly boosts Shaymin-S's damage output. At a crucial moment, Focus Sash allows Shaymin-S to stay in on a Pokemon it would normally lose to. It also works as a safeguard if its Air Slash fails to cause the foe to flinch. A Timid nature helps Shaymin-S outspeed Thundurus, Darkrai, Weavile, and Greninja.

Usage Tips
========

Spam Seed Flare to land Special Defense drops unless you need to use one of Shaymin-S's other moves. Air Slash and Earth Power are for coverage or, in Air Slash's case, for when you need a foe to flinch. Due to Shaymin-S's frailty, you should keep offensive pressure on the opponent and use free switches to bring it into the battlefield whenever possible. It can be switched in on weaker attacks such as Rotom-W's Thunderbolt, but even so, you cannot afford to mispredict. You can safely switch Shaymin-S into Spore thanks to its Grass typing, which allows it to heavily damage Pokemon that rely on Rage Powder support. When in doubt, scout with Protect in order to give Shaymin-S's partner a chance to remove an opposing threat, and to stall out the speed controlling field effects of Tailwind and Trick Room; most importantly, avoid opposing speed control at all costs.

Team Options
========

Fire-types, such as Heatran and Rotom-H, have great offensive synergy with Shaymin-S, as Shaymin-S super effectively hits the Ground-, Rock- and Water-types that threaten them with Seed Flare, while Fire-types cover the Steel-types that wall its STAB attacks. Nearly any fast offensive Pokemon works well alongside Shaymin-S, including Keldeo, Latios, and Mega Diancie. Shaymin-S excels in 1v1 matchups but needs a partner to take down the remaining foe. Choice Scarf Landorus-T is a good offensive partner, being able to force out Fire- and Steel-types with its STAB Earthquake. It can also Intimidate priority attackers and use Rock Slide against airborne Fire- and Electric-types, in addition to using the move alongside Air Slash to increase the chance of making the foe flinch. Quick Guard users such as Terrakion prevent super effective priority attacks such as Ice Shard or Talonflame's Brave Bird from OHKOing Shaymin-S before it has a chance to attack.

Other Options
########

Tailwind can be used over Earth Power to support Shaymin-S's teammates, but Shaymin-S lacks room for the move and is fast already, so it is better off using its STAB attacks. Substitute can be used in place of Earth Power to absorb status-inducing moves. A Modest nature with Life Orb allows Seed Flare to always OHKO standard Landorus-T, but Timid is almost always the better choice.

Checks & Counters
########

**Speed Control**: All forms of speed control are devastating to Shaymin-S because it needs its Speed in order to be effective. If it cannot outspeed its foes, it is mostly useless. In particular, Thundurus has priority on Thunder Wave due to Prankster and resists all of Shaymin-S's moves, making it easy for Thundurus to cut Shaymin-S's Speed.

**Speed**: Priority attackers with super effective STAB attacks, such as Weavile, Mamoswine, and Talonflame, force Shaymin-S out. Neutral priority can pick it off when it is weakened, particularly from Bisharp, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Mawile. Naturally faster Pokemon such as Mega Gengar and Mega Manectric and Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Victini can outspeed Shaymin-S and seriously damage it. When weather is on the battlefield, weather sweepers such as Venusaur, Ludicolo, Mega Swampert, and Excadrill can outspeed Shaymin-S.

**Typing Advantage**: Anything offensive that can take a hit from Shaymin-S threatens it. Rotom-H, Thundurus, Kyurem-B, and Zapdos can tank Shaymin-S's attacks and deal serious damage in return. However, none of them can switch into Shaymin-S's Seed Flare, as they risk having their Special Defense cut in half.

**Miscellaneous**: If Shaymin-S gets frozen, it will revert to regular Shaymin for the rest of the battle. This is a rare occurrence, but it is highly detrimental. Also, Sand and Hail damage will break Shaymin-S's Focus Sash, lessening its longevity.
