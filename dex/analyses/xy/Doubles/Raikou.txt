Overview
########

At first glance, there seems very little reason to use Raikou over Mega Manectric in Doubles. This is because Mega Manectric boasts Intimidate, Flamethrower, and higher Speed and Special Attack stats. However, Raikou does have a lot of redeeming qualities over Mega Manectric, such as better special bulk and the fact that it doesn't take up a Mega slot. Raikou's Electric typing makes it a great answer to many of the Flying- and Electric-types in the tier, such as Togekiss and Thundurus. Snarl, when combined with Raikou's already good special bulk, helps it wall a good amount of special attackers without much trouble. However, while Raikou does have good special bulk, it unfortunately has very low physical bulk, making it quite easy to take out on the physical side. It is also outclassed by Mega Manectric a good amount of the time, and it should only really be chosen if your team is already utilizing a Mega Evolution.

Special Attacker
#########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Hidden Power Ice
move 3: Snarl
move 4: Protect / Volt Switch
item: Shuca Berry / Assault Vest
evs: 24 HP / 252 SpA / 232 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Thunderbolt is Raikou's main STAB attack, hitting Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Politoed hard. Hidden Power Ice forms a pseudo-BoltBeam combination with Thunderbolt, hitting Pokemon such as Garchomp that can take a Thunderbolt. Snarl is a great move for weakening the attacks of common special attackers, allowing Raikou to more easily take special hits. Protect is great in the last spot for avoiding spread moves such as Earthquake, punishing double targeting, stalling field conditions, and scouting. If Assault Vest is used, Volt Switch should be used in the last spot to help switch out of unfavorable situations while also getting off chip damage and gaining momentum.

Set Details
========

The EV spread with a Timid nature is used for as much power as possible, ensuring that Raikou will outspeed Pokemon such as Mega Lucario and Thundurus. Shuca Berry is the preferred item, as it allows Raikou to comfortably take an Earthquake and attack. It also allows Raikou to lure Garchomp and Choice Scarf Landorus-T and hit them with Hidden Power Ice, as well as safely switch into the latter. Assault Vest can also be used, as it gives Raikou even more special bulk. It does mean that Raikou can't use Protect, however, leaving it susceptible to Earthquake. Life Orb, while not on the set, can be used to guarantee certain OHKOs, such as Hidden Power Ice OHKOing non-Yache Berry Garchomp, Thunderbolt OHKOing Mega Charizard Y, and Hidden Power Ice OHKOing Landorus-T. It does, however, cut into Raikou's health and make it take Life Orb recoil every time it uses Snarl.

Usage Tips
========

Raikou is best brought in on Flying- and Electric-types such as Togekiss and Thundurus, as it can wall these Pokemon with relative ease. Snarl should be used often if your opponent has special attackers out, as it can cripple them and make it easier for your teammates to attack or set up. Be careful of Defiant users such as Bisharp, however, as they will receive a +2 Attack boost from Snarl. Residual damage can rack up quickly due to Raikou's lack of reliable recovery, so try to keep Raikou as healthy as possible during the match. If Assault Vest is being used, you need to know when to Volt Switch and when to switch out directly. You also must be wary of Earthquake, as you can no longer use Protect to block it.

Team Options
=============

Pokemon such as Shaymin-S and Breloom appreciate Raikou's ability to threaten Flying-types. Pokemon such as Talonflame and Gyarados appreciate Raikou's ability to wall Electric-types and lower their Special Attack with Snarl. Wide Guard support from Hitmontop or Aegislash is helpful, especially if Raikou is holding an Assault Vest, as it allows Raikou to avoid Earthquake. Mega Evolutions are usually partnered with Raikou, as Mega Manectric is a better option for a fast, offensive Electric-type otherwise. Mega Kangaskhan can provide Fake Out support, while Mega Charizard Y likes Raikou's ability to deal with Electric-type Pokemon such as Thundurus. Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Rotom-W can deal with the Ground-types such as Mamoswine and Excadrill that threaten Raikou, making them very helpful partners. Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp support from the likes of Hitmontop, Scrafty, Mega Gengar, and Talonflame helps Raikou take physical attacks much easier.

Other Options
########

Sitrus Berry is a good option, as it can heal off residual damage Raikou takes throughout the match. Light Screen and Reflect can be used for a fast, offensive dual screen set. Substitute can be used to avoid status and allow Raikou to take a hit, though Protect usually offers overall better utility. Hidden Power Grass hits normal counters to Raikou such as Gastrodon and Rhyperior, though it has little utility outside of that. Discharge is a spread move that has a good chance to paralyze, though it hits Raikou's partner Pokemon as well. Calm Mind can boost Raikou's Special Attack and Special Defense to make it both powerful and bulky, though it's hard to set up with such poor physical bulk, and it is easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Thunder Wave cripples faster attackers, though Thundurus does this better thanks to Prankster. Choice Specs can be used for serious power, though it misses out on the utility of Snarl and Protect. Rain Dance can be used in combination with Thunder for great power, though Thundurus tends to do this better thanks to Prankster.

Checks & Counters
########

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Excadrill, Mamoswine, Rhyperior, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T can easily hit Raikou with a STAB super effective Earthquake and are immune to Thunderbolt. However, Choice Scarf Landorus-T will come out severely weakened and sometimes even KOed from an encounter with Shuca Berry Raikou. Ground-types holding a Yache Berry such as defensive Landorus-T and Garchomp can also take a Hidden Power Ice and OHKO back with Earthquake. Ferrothorn can take any of Raikou's attacks and retaliate with Power Whip. Kyurem-B also takes nothing from Raikou's attacks and can set up a Substitute, though it doesn't like Snarl.

**Speed Control**: Trick Room can use Raikou's high Speed stat against it, allowing for slow, powerful attackers to outspeed and KO it. Good Trick Room setters include Cresselia, Aromatisse, and Gourgeist. Tailwind from the likes of Zapdos, Togekiss, and Suicune can also allow for other Pokemon to outspeed and KO Raikou. However, do note that Raikou can hit the majority of Tailwind users for super effective damage, and most dislike Snarl. Finally, Icy Wind from the likes of Cresselia can also slow Raikou down to the point where other Pokemon can outspeed and take it out.

**Defensive Pokemon**: Pokemon with high Special Defense such as Tyranitar, Assault Vest Conkeldurr, Mega Kangaskhan, and Assault Vest Scrafty can sponge an attack with relative ease and fire back with a STAB attack. Amoonguss can use Rage Powder to redirect Raikou's attacks, making it a very reliable check. Rotom-H resists both of Raikou's attacks and can beat it 1v1 thanks to Will-O-Wisp, though it hates Snarl. In general, though, Raikou's lack of reliable recovery means two or three neutral hits will take it down.
