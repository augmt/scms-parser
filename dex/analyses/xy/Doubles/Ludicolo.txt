Overview
########

While the loss of permanent rain was a negative, Ludicolo is still a potent rain attacker; its immunity to powder moves allows it to switch into Spore and ignore Rage Powder, meaning it can get around Amoonguss, a common check to rain teams. In addition, its 4x resistance to Water-type attacks coupled with its Swift Swim ability makes it a great check to opposing rain teams; it can thus be used on non-rain teams as well. Fake Out is an excellent move that lets Ludicolo disrupt opposing strategies, and when rain is up, Ludicolo becomes the fastest Fake Out user in the metagame. However, it does have some problems of its own. For example, while its Water / Grass typing allows it to handle Pokemon such as Rotom-W that normally check rain sweepers, this typing also causes Ludicolo to miss out on some resistances that would've been useful, such as ones to Fire-, Ice-, and Electric-type attacks. In addition, although Ludicolo isn't frail, it's not especially bulky either, so more powerful attacks from Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan can deal heavy damage to it.

Moves
========

This set is by far the most effective one to use on Ludicolo. Fake Out can disrupt strategies by rendering an opposing Pokemon immobile for a turn, potentially allowing a partner to KO them. Hydro Pump is the main STAB attack and is great due to its neutral coverage, high power, and the fact that it gets a 50% boost from rain. Giga Drain is an accurate secondary STAB attack, hitting Water-types that resist Hydro Pump such as Rotom-W or Azumarill; the passive recovery it provides also helps improve Ludicolo's longevity. Ice Beam is a good coverage option to hit the Grass- and Dragon-types that can sponge Ludicolo's STAB attacks. If those Pokemon aren't a problem for you, then Protect is another option, letting Ludicolo selectively shield itself from damage when needed and dodge potential KOs.

Set Details
========

The EV spread grants Ludicolo as much power as possible as well as the ability to outspeed everything up to Choice Scarf Landorus-T when under rain. Assault Vest is the main option for an item as it boosts Ludicolo's special bulk, something that proves even more useful due to the fact that Ludicolo typically lacks room for Protect. Lum Berry is also usable to shield Ludicolo from Thunder Wave, particularly from Thundurus. Life Orb is a nice option to grant Ludicolo even more power, but the recoil can wear Ludicolo down quickly, especially without Protect.

Usage Tips
========

A good idea is typically to bring in Ludicolo late-game once the opponent's team is weakened, where it can clean up with its Speed granted by Swift Swim and Water-type attacks. Also, if your opponent is carrying a Thunder Wave user such as Thundurus, play cautiously, as a paralyzed Ludicolo is infinitely less threatening than a healthy one. Fake Out is a great tool to use selectively to apply pressure on your opponent, force them into making certain plays, and create free turns for a partner, so make sure you use the move wisely. If you're not planning on using Ludicolo for a late-game sweep (or if you're sure you can keep it in good enough health to achieve said sweep), it makes for a great early-game pivot with its bulk (augmented by Assault Vest) and access to Fake Out.

Team Options
========

Politoed makes for an amazing partner for Ludicolo, as the rain from Drizzle activates Ludicolo's Swift Swim ability and gives Hydro Pump a 50% power boost. Also, Politoed has Helping Hand to boost the power of attacks coming off of Ludicolo's middling base 90 Special Attack. Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Garchomp appreciate having Ludicolo as a partner due to its ability to handle Water-types such as Rotom-W that are problematic for them. Anything that appreciates the free turns bought by Fake Out, such as Substitute Heatran, could make for a good partner to Ludicolo. Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Rotom-W that threaten Talonflame are excellent partners as well, as Talonflame can get around Ludicolo's Swift Swim with Gale Wings and KO with a priority Brave Bird. Other good partners are Intimidate users such as Landorus-T, Scrafty, and Hitmontop that can patch up Ludicolo's lower Defense stat.

Other Options
########

Moves such as Energy Ball or Grass Knot are alternative STAB options for Ludicolo due to their higher power than Giga Drain (although in the case of Grass Knot the power depends on the target). However, the healing from Giga Drain usually makes it a better move to use than Energy Ball, and it has a more reliable damage output than Grass Knot as well. Scald could be a replacement for Hydro Pump due to its 100% accuracy and 30% chance to burn the target, but a significantly lower damage output than Hydro Pump typically makes it the less desirable choice. A set with Sitrus Berry could work as a bulky pivot, but loses out on Ludicolo's ability to be a threatening sweeper. Substitute is an interesting  option to shield Ludicolo from priority and status, but Ludicolo must then lose out on Assault Vest as well as a potential attacking move, making it hard to justify on a moveset. A set with Leech Seed and Rain Dish could be used, but it lacks much in the way of offensive presence and will usually be KOed by powerful attackers before it can hope to stall one out. Sunny Day is an option on Ludicolo to counter rain teams, as Ludicolo's typing lets it set up Sunny Day easily while threatening most Pokemon commonly used on rain teams. Finally, Teeter Dance can be used as a way to disrupt opposing Pokemon through confusion. However, the fact that it's luck-based and hits Ludicolo's partner makes it unreliable.

Checks & Counters
########

**Opposing Weather**: Abomasnow is an excellent counter as it has no problem dealing with Politoed to set up hail, stripping Ludicolo of its preferred weather condition. In addition to this, Abomasnow can comfortably sponge all of Ludicolo's attacks and respond with a powerful attack of its own. Mega Charizard Y is a good check as Drought stops Swift Swim from working while simultaneously weakening one of Ludicolo's main STAB moves.

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Bulky attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Heracross can tank a hit from Ludicolo and deal heavy damage back, making them good checks. Assault Vest users such as Scrafty, Conkeldurr, and Goodra are able to tank powerful hits from Ludicolo and respond with attacks of their own.

**Speed**: Talonflame is an excellent check to Ludicolo as it has a priority Brave Bird to get around Ludicolo's Swift Swim and OHKO it. Choice Scarf Genesect is able to outspeed Ludicolo even under rain and hit it with a powerful Bug-type attack.

**Speed Control**: Thundurus is a good check as it can hit Ludicolo with a priority Thunder Wave, crippling it for the remainder of the match. Bulky Trick Room setters such as Cresselia can turn Ludicolo's high Speed under rain into a major liability, making them excellent checks to it.
