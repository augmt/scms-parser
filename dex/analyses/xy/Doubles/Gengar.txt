Overview
########

Gengar is able to stand out of the crowd due to its unique set of traits. The first is its Mega Evolution, which comes with a powerful ability in Shadow Tag. Shadow Tag allows Mega Gengar to trap threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Hitmontop with ease, meaning its teammates can sweep more easily. Mega Gengar also has one of the fastest Will-O-Wisp's in all of Doubles, which, when combined with Shadow Tag, allows it to cripple many top-tier threats and gain momentum. Furthermore, Mega Gengar does very well against Trick Room leads, as most setters are weak to Shadow Ball and are trapped by Shadow Tag. Top it all off with great Speed and Special Attack and a superb offensive typing in Ghost, and Gengar is sure to leave its mark on the opposing team.

Unfortunately, Gengar does have some key flaws. The first is its very poor bulk, which means that any decently powerful neutral hit will deal considerable damage, while any super effective hit will most likely OHKO Gengar. Gengar is also very vulnerable to speed control; Tailwind, Trick Room, Thunder Wave, Icy Wind, and Electroweb all make it much less effective.

Special Attacker
##########
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Shadow Ball
move 2: Sludge Bomb / Substitute
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Protect
item: Gengarite
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Shadow Ball is the main move of this set, hitting Pokemon such as Latios and Chandelure extremely hard and also having a good chance to 2HKO standard Cresselia. It has great neutral coverage too, which is why it's chosen over Sludge Bomb even with its lower Base Power. Sludge Bomb is a secondary STAB move that has good neutral coverage with Shadow Ball, and it also allows Gengar to deal with Fairy-types. Substitute is an option, however, for Gengar to avoid status, take an attack that would otherwise KO, and even stall for burn damage. Will-O-Wisp neuters powerful physical threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Terrakion, making them much less of a problem for the team. Protect is used in the last slot for scouting, punishing double targeting, and protecting Mega Gengar from moves such as Earthquake from teammates. It's also helpful in aiding a safe Mega Evolution. Taunt, while not on the main set, provides great utility and allows it to do even better against Trick Room. Unfortunately, there isn't much room on the set for it, though it's still a very good move.

Set Details
==========

The EVs with a Timid nature make Mega Gengar as fast and as strong as possible, allowing it to outspeed the likes of Shaymin-S. Gengarite gives Gengar Shadow Tag to trap its opponents, making it very important.

Usage Tips
==========

Will-O-Wisp tends to be a good option against Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, as Mega Gengar can trap Pokemon with Shadow Tag and make them deadweight. Mega Gengar tends to be a great Trick Room counter, as most setters of Trick Room are Psychic- and Ghost-types. Do note, however, that if Trick Room is set up, Mega Gengar is put at a serious disadvantage. It's important when using Gengar to know when to Mega Evolve. If you need the Earthquake immunity, don't Mega Evolve; if not, you should most likely Mega Evolve. When using Mega Gengar, switch in teammates according to what it has trapped. For example, if Amoonguss and Scizor have been trapped, switch Volcarona in to take them out. Mega Gengar should also have its set customized accordingly to counter threats that your team has trouble with, since it can easily remove these Pokemon through trapping. Some Pokemon it can deal with easily include Mega Kangaskhan, Terrakion, and Hitmontop, as well as almost all Trick Room setters. Mega Gengar also has an easy time setting up Substitutes on these Pokemon, though Terrakion needs to be burned first so that it can't break them. Mega Gengar can steal momentum from defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Aromatisse with ease, assuming it doesn't get Spored on the switch.

Team Options
=============

Setup sweepers and weather abusers, such as Gyarados and Swords Dance Excadrill, appreciate Mega Gengar's ability to trap and remove their counters. It also traps Pokemon which are unable to touch its partner, allowing them to set up with ease. Fighting-types also make amazing partners to Gengar, as Mega Gengar can trap and KO the Ghost-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types they hate. Pokemon such as Conkeldurr, Terrakion, and Hitmontop can also deal with Dark-types, notably Tyranitar and Bisharp, which trouble Gengar. Hitmontop also has Wide Guard and Quick Guard to protect Mega Gengar from incoming attacks, most notably Earthquake and Sucker Punch. Scrafty can also provide similar Quick Guard support and switch into Psychic- and Dark-type attacks aimed at Gengar. Fake Out support is especially helpful with a frail Pokemon such as Gengar, as it means it won't have to fear a second attacker. Good users of the move include Hitmontop, Scrafty, and Ludicolo. Follow Me and Rage Powder support from the likes of Togekiss, Jirachi, and Amoonguss fall in a similar boat as Fake Out, ensuring  Gengar won't have to fear incoming attacks. Finally, Pokemon such as Darkrai can form a powerful offensive core with Mega Gengar that's capable of cleaning up quite easily late-game.

Perish Trap
##########
name: Perish Trap
move 1: Perish Song
move 2: Protect
move 3: Disable / Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Shadow Ball
item: Gengarite
evs: 224 HP / 252 Def / 32 Spe
nature: Timid

Moves
========

Perish Song is the main move of this set, as it allows Mega Gengar to put its trapped targets on a three-turn timer. Protect is an important move that stalls for Perish Song turns while also performing its normal duties, such as punishing double targeting and allowing for a safe Mega Evolution. Disable, when used in tandem with Protect, allows Gengar to stop an incoming super effective move from being used, such as Bisharp's Knock Off, allowing Mega Gengar to stay alive even longer. Will-O-Wisp can be used in the third spot, however, in order to allow Gengar to function better against physical attackers. Shadow Ball is used in the last spot for an attacking move that can finish off weakened threats reliably due to Mega Gengar's large Speed and Special Attack stats.

Set Details
===========

HP and defensive investment is used to let Mega Gengar survive Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake, while the Speed EVs allow Mega Gengar to outspeed Garchomp. Gengarite is necessary for this set, as Shadow Tag allows Mega Gengar to trap threats and slowly take them down with Perish Song. With Mega Gengar's high Speed, Substitute can be used to stall for Trick Room turns as well. It can also allow Gengar to avoid status and take a hit safely. It does, however, cut into Gengar's health and tends to be outclassed by Disable and Will-O-Wisp.

Usage Tips
===========

This set isn't meant to be offensive and is instead used to stall Perish Song turns in order to KO the opponent's Pokemon. As such, Protect and Disable should be used most often after Perish Song is used. Once there is one turn left of Perish Song, it is best to switch Mega Gengar and its partner out in order to avoid fainting to the same. Teams utilizing Perish Trap should generally be using Encore + Disable to prevent the opponent from doing anything. Mega Gengar can also use Protect to scout for a super effective move and then Disable it the next turn. Try to set up Perish Song on a predicted Protect or when a move is being used on your teammate. Ghost-types are unaffected by Shadow Tag and, as such, shouldn't be set up on with Perish Song. They are, however, weak to Shadow Ball, meaning Mega Gengar can do a lot of damage to them should they decide to stay in. Mega Gengar's partner usually faces heavy pressure to keep Mega Gengar alive, so it should try to add its own offensive pressure or use support moves such as Sleep Powder.

Team Options
============

Encore users such as Liepard are helpful, as they can lock the opponent into a move Disabled by Mega Gengar. Pokemon that apply a lot of offensive pressure such as Substitute Kyurem-B and Choice Specs Sylveon, make good partners, as they can force the opponent to attack them instead of Mega Gengar. Follow Me and Rage Powder support can also allow Mega Gengar to stall for Perish Song turns more easily, with good users of the move being Togekiss and Amoonguss. Amoonguss can also put Pokemon to sleep, making Mega Gengar's job even easier, and Regenerator allows it to perform this role multiple times, too. Quick Guard and Wide Guard are very helpful moves for protecting against priority and spread moves, with Hitmontop and Terrakion being good users.

Other Options
#############

Focus Blast hits Dark- and Normal-types a lot harder than Sludge Bomb, but has terrible accuracy. Destiny Bond is a great last-resort move for taking out an opposing Pokemon, but it's hard for it to find room on the set. Hypnosis can put a Pokemon to sleep, but it has terrible accuracy. Thunderbolt deals super effective damage to Politoed and Mega Charizard Y, two common weather setters. Hidden Power Ice or Icy Wind can be used to take care of Landorus-T and Garchomp, but they are very situational. Disable can be used on the special attacking set to prevent your opponent from using a move, though it's hard to find room for it there. Finally, Focus Sash or Life Orb can be used if your Mega slot has been taken up, though Gengar is nowhere as effective as Mega Gengar due to its lower Speed and generally worse ability.

Check & Counters
##############

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Dark-types are a huge pain unless Gengar is running Focus Blast, as Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Bisharp completely wall it otherwise. However, they must be wary of Will-O-Wisp. Powerful or super effective priority attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird or Sucker Punch are very problematic for Gengar, as they can easily exploit its weak Defense stat. Aegislash can take a hit and OHKO back with Shadow Ball, and it also doesn't have to worry about being trapped by Shadow Tag.

**Speed Control**: Tailwind and Trick Room are two moves that can easily shut Gengar down, as they allow the opponent's Pokemon to outspeed Gengar and prey on its weaker defensive stats. Suicune, Zapdos, Talonflame, and Togekiss are good Tailwind users, though Sludge Bomb hits Togekiss for super effective damage. Trick Room can be very problematic for Gengar, though most Trick Room setters are weak to Gengar's STAB attacks. Porygon2 and Aromatisse, if Gengar is not carrying Sludge Bomb, are some of the only Pokemon that can safely set up Trick Room on Gengar, but even Porygon2 must be wary of Taunt. Thunder Wave, Icy Wind, and Electroweb are also problematic for Gengar, with Thundurus, Politoed, and Rotom-W, respectively, all being notable users of the moves.

**Speed**: While Mega Gengar is quite fast, anything faster than it can take it out with relative ease. This includes Pokemon such as Deoxys-A, Swift Swim Ludicolo and Kingdra, and Sand Rush/Choice Scarf Excadrill.

**Defensive**: In general, bulky Pokemon that are not weak to Mega Gengar's STAB moves have a general advantage; Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Rotom-W, and Assault Vest Conkeldurr have no problems taking an attack from Mega Gengar and KOing it in return.

**Utility Moves**: For the Perish Trap set specifically, Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Genesect can all use Volt Switch or U-turn in order to escape the effects of Perish Song. Taunt from the likes of Thundurus can also prevent Perish Trap Mega Gengar from executing its strategy correctly.
