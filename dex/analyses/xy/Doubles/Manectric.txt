Overview
########
Mega Manectric is lightning fast, and with a base Speed of 135, it can outspeed some of the fastest threats in the Doubles metagame, including Mega Gengar and Shaymin-S. Its Electric typing means it can't be slowed down by Thunder Wave, which is often an issue for fast, frail threats. The combination of Intimidate and STAB Volt Switch allows Mega Manectric to maintain momentum very well throughout battle. Unfortunately, Mega Manectric has fairly subpar bulk and finds itself easily KOed after taking just a few hits, even with the help of Intimidate. Another shortcoming of Mega Manectric is that it faces stiff competition from other Mega Pokemon such as Charizard, Kangaskhan, and Mawile, which are often easier to fit onto a team.

Moves
========
Volt Switch allows Manectric to build up momentum and pick off weakened threats. Thunderbolt provides a more powerful Electric-type STAB move for when more power is needed to break through an opposing Pokemon. Hidden Power Ice provides great coverage alongside Manectric's Electric-type moves, as it lets Manectric hit Ground- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Shaymin-S. Protect is a staple move in Doubles and allows Mega Manectric to stall out field conditions and avoid damage whilst its partner deals with the threat. Overheat is a useful move which allows Manectric to handle Steel- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Aegislash, which are hard to beat otherwise.

Set Details
========
The EV spread is designed to allow non-Mega Manectric to outspeed Garchomp so that it can safely go for the KO with Hidden Power Ice. If outspeeding Garchomp before Mega Evolution is not a problem, there are other possible EV spreads; 192 Speed outruns all variants of Shaymin-S, 216 outruns base 130 Speed Pokemon such as Mega Gengar while outrunning base 100s such as Salamence before Mega Evolution. Regardless of Speed investment, the remaining EVs should be invested in Special Attack first to do as much damage as possible, and the last several into HP to take hits better. A Modest Nature is an option over Timid for the higher power, while still letting 236 Speed Mega Manectric outspeed Choice Scarf Tyranitar; the inability to outspeed Shaymin-S and Mega Gengar can prove to be an issue, though. While it will change as soon as Mega Evolution occurs, Lightningrod is by far the best ability to use on Manectric's base form, because it allows Manectric to redirect Electric-type moves like Thunder Wave to support its teammates and give itself a boost to its Special Attack in the process.

Usage Tips
========
Due to Manectric's low defenses, it is advised that Volt Switch is used, unless the power of Thunderbolt is needed, to avoid taking too many hits. Manectric likes a free switch so that it can act as a hit-and-run attacker and thus take minimal damage. Unlike other Intimidate users, Mega Manectric is much harder to switch into the field to provide the Attack drop. This strategy should only be used as a last resort, as Manectric will often take heavy damage in the process. Through the use of Lightningrod, Manectric can easily switch into Pokemon such as Thundurus and gain a boost to its Special Attack, which enables it to become a large threat. Late-game, Manectric is easily capable of cleaning up a weakened team with its high Speed and decently powerful Thunderbolt. Due to its frailty, it may require some support even at this point in the battle, but a healthy Mega Manectric late-game is a force to be reckoned with.

Team Options
========
Mega Manectric is most at home on teams with minimal speed control that face issues with fast, frail attackers. Because it generally doesn't take hits very well, Manectric appreciates support from users of Follow Me and Fake Out, which can buy it extra turns on the field. Wide Guard from the likes of Hitmontop and Aegislash is also welcomed, as this protects Manectric from Earthquake. One particularly potent partner is Landorus-T; while it may seem redundant and somewhat risky due to Landorus-T's Earthquake, the two complement each other well, and can shut down not only threats to the other Pokemon, but almost every physical attacker in the tier through double Intimidate. However, if using Mega Manectric with Landorus-T or another Intimidate user, Bisharp poses a serious threat with its Defiant ability and strong priority. Fast Fighting-types such as Keldeo therefore make excellent partners, as do bulkier Pokemon like Heatran that can take a hit and KO in return.

Other Options
########
Thunder is a more powerful option for rain teams. Users should be wary that the low accuracy outside of rain makes it a risky choice. A supporting set with Thunder Wave and Snarl is also an option. This faces heavy competition from Raikou, which is typically the better choice thanks to its better bulk, movepool, and ability to use an item such as Sitrus Berry or Light Clay. Flamethrower is a usable option which avoids the issue of the Special Attack drop from Overheat, but it is noticeably weaker.

Checks & Counters
########

**Speed Control**: While Manectric is immune to paralysis, it is vulnerable to other methods of speed control. Icy Wind from Pokemon such as Jirachi and Tailwind from Pokemon such as Suicune and Hydreigon both allow Pokemon it would usually outspeed to outrun it, while under Trick Room it rarely gets the chance to move before taking serious damage.

**Type Advantage**: While it can often remove more offensive Electric resists with Hidden Power Ice, bulkier resists such as Mega Venusaur, Rotom-Heat, and Kyurem-Black all pose significant threats to Mega Manectric, as they can take anything it throws at them with ease and often OHKO in return. Offensive Ground-types not weak to Ice, such as Mamoswine and Sand Rush Excadrill, can still deal heavy damage after Intimidate, often still OHKOing Manectric regardless of their lowered Attack. Bisharp is a major threat because it gains an Attack boost from Intimidate and can KO Manectric with a Life Orb-boosted Sucker Punch.

**Bulky Pokemon**: Despite Manectric's power and Speed, several Pokemon can mostly shrug off its attacks and threaten it with either powerful attacks of their own or moves such as Icy Wind. Tyranitar, Mega Kangaskhan, and Cresselia spring to mind, although other Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Ludicolo, and Assault Vest Conkeldurr can also pose a threat in this manner.

**Utility Moves**: Because Manectric attacks primarily with single-target attacks, it is prone to having its moves redirected. Amoonguss, Jirachi, and opposing Manectric are the biggest threats in this regard.
