Overview
########

Garchomp's unique typing not only gives it resistances to common Fire- and Rock-type moves, but is also amazing offensively, giving nearly perfect neutral coverage with its STAB attacks alone. This is further complemented by Garchomp's excellent Speed and Attack stats, as well as its respectable bulk, allowing it to withstand powerful attacks and retaliate equally hard. Garchomp's movepool contains a wide variety of powerful attacks, such as Earthquake, Stone Edge, Fire Blast, and Dragon Claw, limiting its number of potential checks and counters. Garchomp is also one of the few Pokemon blessed with a Mega Evolution, which not only has attacking stats comparable to Kyurem-B, but an excellent ability in Sand Force, allowing Mega Garchomp to utilize Sandstorm more efficiently.

Unfortunately, Garchomp has several flaws. Like many other physical attackers, Garchomp is susceptible to common methods of Attack control&mdash;Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp&mdash;making it vulnerable to threats such as Rotom-W and Landorus-T. The newly introduced Fairy-types also limit Garchomp's success in Doubles, as they are not only immune to Garchomp's Dragon STAB, but can threaten Garchomp with their super effective STAB attacks. Garchomp's typing also gives it a weakness to Dragon- and Ice-type moves, two very common attacking types in the metagame. Mega Garchomp also has a lowered Speed stat, which can be detrimental against Pokemon such as Salamence and Genesect. Despite these flaws, Garchomp still remains the monster that it was in BW Doubles.

Physical Attacker
########
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Dragon Claw / Substitute
move 3: Rock Slide / Stone Edge
move 4: Protect
ability: Rough Skin
item: Life Orb / Rocky Helmet / Leftovers
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
nature: Jolly

Moves
========

Garchomp's high Attack and Speed stats, along with its excellent typing, enable it to run a very efficient physical attacking set. Earthquake is Garchomp's main STAB move due to its high Base Power, spread effect, and all around great coverage. Dragon Claw is Garchomp's secondary STAB move and finds its utility in defeating bulky Dragon-types such as Salamence and Zygarde, as well as having decent Base Power and not hitting Garchomp's partner. However, if Dragon Claw's low Base Power is unappealing, Substitute can be used in its place to protect Garchomp from Will-O-Wisp and Intimidate, giving Garchomp a better chance to beat Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Rotom-W. Garchomp's excellent bulk and typing make it relatively easy for it to set up multiple Substitutes. Rock Slide and Stone Edge are primarily used to hit Flying-types for super effective damage. Rock Slide is preferred for its spread effect, though Stone Edge may be more useful in certain scenarios due to its higher Base Power, as well as its ability to go through Wide Guard. Both moves also receive perfect coverage with Earthquake. Finally, Protect is used because it allows Garchomp to scout for super effective coverage attacks, Will-O-Wisp, and Fake Out.

Set Details
========

Rough Skin is chosen as the main ability, as it is a more reliable ability than Sand Veil and deters physical attackers from using contact moves. The item of choice depends on your personal preferences. Life Orb allows Garchomp to hit as hard as possible and makes up for the mediocre Base Power of Dragon Claw and Rock Slide. Rocky Helmet, on the other hand, works well in conjunction with Rough Skin and makes Garchomp a decent check to priority users and Pokemon carrying contact moves, most notably Mega Kangaskhan. Leftovers is an option if using Substitute, increasing the amount of times Garchomp can make Substitutes.

Garchomp has several options that can be considered on this set. An Adamant nature can be used to further increase Garchomp's power, but it is inferior to a Jolly nature, as the latter allows Garchomp to outspeed Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y. A Lum Berry can also be used to protect Garchomp from status moves, though it is rather redundant with Substitute. Finally, Garchomp can use Fire Blast to defeat Pokemon such as Bronzong and Skarmory.

Usage Tips
========

Due to Garchomp's high Speed and powerful attacks, it is advised that it be used mid- to late-game, once Pokemon with Intimidate or Will-O-Wisp are eliminated. Garchomp can be used early game too, as Garchomp's spread attacks and Rough Skin ability weaken threats such as Mega Kangaskhan and Tyranitar, making it easier for other Pokemon to clean up the foe's team later in the match.

Garchomp's decent defensive typing also allows it to switch into moves from Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast, Heatran's Heat Wave, and Tyranitar's Rock Slide. Due to the threat of Earthquake and Rock Slide, Garchomp can force these threats out and receive a free turn to either use its powerful coverage moves or set up a Substitute. Garchomp's vulnerability to Will-O-Wisp makes it a wise idea to switch out from a Will-O-Wisp user that it cannot OHKO or immediately use Substitute if the Will-O-Wisp user is slower. If Garchomp has not set up a Substitute, Pokemon with Intimidate, such as Hitmontop and Landorus-T, will give Garchomp trouble and should be removed before attempting to clean up the foe's team.

Team Options
========

Steel-types such as Scizor, Genesect, Bisharp, and Aegislash are excellent partners, as all four have nearly perfect defensive synergy with Garchomp, can defeat the Fairy-, Dragon-, and Ice-types that give Garchomp trouble, and are able to defeat Cresselia with their secondary STAB moves. Bisharp stands out as a partner, as it deters Pokemon with the Intimidate ability from switching in with its own ability, Defiant. In return, Garchomp is able to defeat the Fire-type Pokemon that give these Steel-types trouble. However, it should be noted that all of these Pokemon take large amounts of damage from Garchomp's Earthquake. Garchomp also appreciates any form of speed control, as it allows Garchomp to outspeed and OHKO threats such as Latios, Latias, and Terrakion, as well as threaten the opposing team even more with its powerful spread attacks. Good partners that can provide Garchomp with speed control include Togekiss, Zapdos, Cresselia, and Thundurus, as many of these Pokemon are immune to Garchomp's Earthquake. Flying-types and Pokemon with the ability Levitate are great partners in general, as they are immune to Garchomp's Earthquake, allowing Garchomp to freely use the move without any drawbacks. Mega Charizard Y is another excellent partner, as it can deal a massive amount of damage to Rotom-W with Solar Beam, defeat Pokemon with the ability Intimidate, such as Non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Hitmontop, is immune to Earthquake, allowing Garchomp to freely use the move without repercussion, and can even provide speed control with Tailwind. Venusaur is also a good partner, as it can defeat bulky Water- and Fairy-types with Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb, respectively.

Sand Sweeper
########
name: Sand Sweeper
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Draco Meteor / Swords Dance
move 3: Stone Edge / Rock Slide
move 4: Protect
ability: Rough Skin
item: Garchompite
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Jolly

Moves
========

Mega Garchomp's increased attacking stats and ability, Sand Force, allow it to take advantage of Sandstorm more efficiently than regular Garchomp and surprise some of its checks and counters. Earthquake remains as Garchomp's main STAB move thanks to its excellent coverage, spread effect, and power, while also receiving a potential power boost from Sandstorm. Draco Meteor takes the role as Garchomp's secondary STAB attack, as it deals a massive amount of damage to several of Garchomp's usual counters such as Landorus-T, Hitmontop, and Rotom-W, is unaffected by Will-O-Wisp, and still hits Dragon-types for super effective damage. However, if you would rather have Garchomp clean up the foe's team later in the the game, Swords Dance is the recommended option over Draco Meteor to bolster Garchomp's attack power. Stone Edge and Rock Slide are both used to defeat Flying-types immune to Garchomp's STAB Earthquake. Stone Edge is the recommended choice if using Draco Meteor, as the combination of a -1 Stone Edge and Draco Meteor is able to KO Landorus-T. Rock Slide, on the other hand, is the better choice if using Swords Dance, as its spread effect is more useful than Stone Edge's greater power in this scenario. Finally, Protect is used in the fourth slot, as it allows Garchomp to scout for super effective coverage attacks, status moves, and Fake Out.

Set Details
========

Garchompite is the only viable item on this set, as it allows Garchomp to run special attacks such as Draco Meteor and take advantage of Sandstorm more efficiently. Fire Blast can be used on this set, as it hits Bronzong and bulky Grass-types such as Trevenant for super effective damage, but it has little use beyond this. An Adamant or Naughty nature can be used if speed control is provided. However, the ability to outspeed threats such as Jolly Landorus-T, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Charizard Y if Garchomp has not Mega-Evolved is rarely worth passing up for a small amount of extra power.

Usage Tips
========

Swords Dance variations of Mega Garchomp are better used late-game to clean up the foe's team with its high-powered spread attacks. Draco Meteor variations of Garchomp are better used early-game to lure and defeat its common checks such as Landorus-T and Rotom-W, making it easier for Pokemon such as Swords Dance Scizor and Choice Scarf Tyranitar to clean up the foe's team later in the match. Although this set does better against Will-O-Wisp users, Garchomp should still switch out in such a matchup, as Garchomp does not like taking residual damage and having its main STAB move weakened.

It should be noted that Garchomp does not have to Mega Evolve immediately, as regular Garchomp's higher Speed is more useful than Mega Garchomp's increased power against some specific threats such as Salamence, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Charizard Y.

Team Options
========

Tyranitar is a mandatory partner for this set, as the Sandstorm it provides bolsters Mega Garchomp's power to incredible levels due to Mega Garchomp's ability, Sand Force. Tyranitar can also defeat Flying-types such as Togekiss with Rock Slide and can put Cresselia in a checkmate position with Crunch. In return, Garchomp is able to defeat Steel-types that genuinely give Tyranitar trouble, such as Bisharp, non-Wide Guard Aegislash, and Heatran. Garchomp also enjoys any form of speed control, even more so than the previous set due to Mega Garchomp's lowered Speed stat. Good partners that can provide Garchomp with speed control include Cresselia, Togekiss, Zapdos, and Jirachi. Steel-types such as Genesect, Scizor, and Bisharp are also great partners, as they have nearly flawless defensive synergy with Garchomp, can defeat Cresselia with their secondary STAB moves, and are able to defeat Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-types that Garchomp dislikes facing. Flying-types and Pokemon with the ability Levitate are also good partners, as they allow Garchomp to use Earthquake without any repercussion.

Other Options
########

Due to Garchomp's excellent movepool, it has many alternative options to choose from. A Choice Band or Choice Scarf can be used to greatly increase Garchomp's Attack and Speed stats, respectively. However, Garchomp's STAB attacks are risky moves to be locked into, making Choice sets rather gimmicky. Garchomp also has access to a wide range of physical coverage moves, such as Fire Fang, Aqua Tail, Iron Head, and Crunch, but many of these moves do not get any notable coverage or are simply too weak to be of any use. Garchomp can also use a Yache or Haban Berry to avoid an OHKO from super effective Ice- and Dragon-type attacks, respectively. However, strong attackers such as Latios and Genesect still have a chance to OHKO Garchomp with their super effective attacks, so a bulkier EV spread would be needed to properly utilize these berries.

A fully specially based set with Draco Meteor, Earth Power, Fire Blast, and Protect can be used because of Mega Garchomp's high base Special Attack. While such a set is outclassed by faster and more powerful specially based Dragons such as Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Latios, Mega Garchomp's surprise factor allows it to defeat many of its physically defensive checks and counters.

Checks & Counters
########

**Attack Control**: Attack control is the best overall method of countering Garchomp, as Garchomp can do very little to common Pokemon with Intimidate or Will-O-Wisp unless it is using Draco Meteor and becomes noticeably weaker once affected by Attack Control. Good Pokemon for this role include Hitmontop, Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Gyarados. All of the previously mentioned Pokemon are immune to Garchomp's Ground-type STAB, or, in Hitmontop's case, bypass it completely with Wide Guard and take neutral damage from its Dragon-type STAB. However, Rotom-W and Landorus-T must watch out for Substitute and Draco Meteor variations of Garchomp, respectively, as Rotom-W cannot burn Garchomp behind a Substitute and takes massive damage from Stone Edge, while Landorus-T loses to the combination of a Sand Force-boosted Stone Edge and Draco Meteor from Mega Garchomp.

**Offensive Typing Advantage**: Bulky Fairy-types, such as Azumarill and Togekiss, are able to switch into Garchomp's Dragon STAB and deal a massive amount of damage in return with their respective Fairy-type STAB attacks. However, a Sand Force-boosted Stone Edge and Earthquake deal a massive amount of damage to Togekiss and Azumarill, respectively. Cresselia, on the other hand, completely counters Garchomp due to her impressive bulk and Levitate. Cresselia can also threaten Garchomp with either Icy Wind or Ice Beam.

**Speed Control**: Garchomp mostly relies on its speed to be effective, making speed control a great way to keep it in a checkmate position. Icy Wind in particular deals a large amount of damage to Garchomp while lowering its Speed stat, making Pokemon that utilize this move such as Cresselia great checks. Trick Room also hinders Garchomp's effectiveness, making Garchomp's excellent Speed stat a detriment instead of a benefit.

**Utility**: Due to a majority of Garchomp's attacks being spread moves, Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Hitmontop make solid checks. A fast Encore from Pokemon such as Whimsicott and Sableye also threaten Garchomp if it used Substitute, Swords Dance, or Protect in the previous turn.
