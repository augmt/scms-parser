While losing a great ability in Regenerator upon Mega Evolution might seem detrimental, Mega Audino definitely has a great niche. A physically defensive spread with a Calm Mind set, as shown here, can prove to be quite the wall as well as quite the offensive juggernaut after it manages to stick around for a while. Dazzling Gleam is a solid STAB option that nothing is immune to and can overwhelm the opposition after having gathered Calm Mind boosts; Draining Kiss is noticeably weaker but provides Mega Audino with additional recovery while dealing damage. Wish is essential for staying power and is also useful for keeping the team in good health as Mega Audino switches in and out to keep Knock Off from depriving teammates of their items. Protect is an obvious complement to Wish for assuring that the recovery is successful but can also be used to scout the enemy's moves. Heal Bell can be used alternatively to let Mega Audino serve as a cleric to its team, ridding its comrades of status conditions.
