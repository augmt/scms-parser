Pretty straightforward all out attacker or offensive Stealth Rock setter. Max SpA is good as most of your moves are special, and you want to hit Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Mega Metagross as hard as possible on the switch, but max Atk has merits in order to 2HKO Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, 30% chance to 2HKO 4 HP / 252 Def+ Chansey after Stealth Rock, and 2HKO Stealth Rock Clefable. Naive is preffered to check Talonflame, Mega Altaria, and Mega Charizard X better, but Hasty is ok to tank Surf and Thunderbolt from Latios and Latias easier.

name: 2 [ORAS Doubles] Diancie
item: Diancite
ability: Clear Body
evs: 208 Atk / 48 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive
move 1: Diamond Storm
move 2: Moonblast
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Protect
 
Diancie is blessed with an amazing offensive typing and the exact right speed tier to use it, allowing it to nail most of the faster threats in the tier with Super Effective STAB. Diancie's primary move is Diamond Storm because of its spread damage and 50% chance per hit to raise Defense (so a 25% for a double raise and 75% for at least one raise assuming two hits!), and Rock is a great coverage type with so much of the metagame weak to it. Diancie's coverage moves decimate a good portion of other switchins.

- 48 SpA Diancie Moonblast vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Terrakion: 348-410 (107.4 - 126.5%)
- 48 SpA Diancie Earth Power vs. 180 HP / 0 SpD Heatran: 384-456 (104.3 - 123.9%)
- 48 SpA Diancie Earth Power vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Bisharp: 272-320 (100 - 117.6%)
- 48 SpA Diancie Moonblast vs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Garchomp: 366-432 (102.5 - 121%)
- 48 SpA Diancie Moonblast vs. 24 HP / 0 SpD Keldeo: 348-410 (105.7 - 124.6%)
- 48 SpA Diancie Moonblast vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Latios: 294-348 (97.3 - 115.2%)

Diancie's typing is actually passable defensively, giving it some glaring weaknesses but also providing it with unique resistances to things like Kangaskhan's attacks and Salamence's STAB moves. In short, Diancie terrorizes speedy offensive Pokemon.

name: 3 [ORAS Ubers] Diancie
item: Diancite
ability: Clear Body
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe
nature: Naive / Timid
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Moonblast
move 3: Earth Power / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Diamond Storm / Hidden Power Fire / Psyshock
 
Diancie has enough Speed and power to make use of Calm Mind, and Magic Bounce prevents any status moves from ruining its setup, which can make it difficult to stop. Moonblast is Diancie's obligatory Fairy-type STAB attack, and Earth Power hits all three Fairy-resistant types for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fire is an option on the set specifically for getting a big hit against Scizor and Ferrothorn. Diamond Storm is Diancie's physical Rock-type STAB move, which hurts special walls and makes sure Ho-Oh doesn't wall the set. Psyshock is also nice for hitting Arceus-Poison as well as Gengar before it Mega evolves. Naive nature should be used if Diamond Storm is in the fourth slot, so as to maintain decent physical offense with this attack; Timid nature can be used if Diamond Storm is not included.
