name: 1 [ORAS] Steelix
item: Steelixite
nature: Sassy
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD
ivs: 0 Spe
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Gyro Ball
move 4: Roar / Dragon Tail

This Mega Steelix set is designed to support its team by phazing out the opposing one and dragging their Pokemon through entry hazard damage. Sassy nature and maximum special bulk maximize Mega Steelix's rather average ability to take special attacks. Stealth Rock is a staple here for punishing switches and assisting the team with getting KOs. Earthquake is the obligatory STAB attack, which does considerably more damage coming from the increased Attack power that Steelix gains upon Mega Evolution. Gyro Ball is the secondary STAB move that takes advantage of Steelix's low Speed and negative Speed nature to be as powerful as possible. Roar is the primary option in the final slot for shuffling the opposing team, forcing enemies to take hazard damage and preventing them from benefiting from any stat boosts they may have attained; Dragon Tail is an option that doesn't get rid of Substitutes like Roar does, but it provides additional damage to Stealth Rock when shuffling the opponent's team, and the only Pokemon that are immune to this move, Fairy-types, are deterred by Steelix's inherent offensive and defensive advantage against them.

name: 2 [ORAS Doubles] Steelix
item: Steelixite
nature: Brave

move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Rock Slide

move 4: Protect

Mega Steelix isn't going to be the most popular new Mega Evolution, but thanks to its extremely high bulk and good Attack, it could catch opponents by surprise on Trick Room teams alongside Tyranitar. This set is fairly obvious, maximizing HP and Attack to boost bulk while fully minimizing Speed for Trick Room usage. Steelix's moves all gain a Sand Force boost, giving them fairly significant power, and it can use Protect to shield itself while Trick Room is being set or when it finds itself in a bad situation.
