name: 1 [ORAS] Mega Metagross
item: Metagrossite
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
nature: Hasty / Jolly
move 1: Meteor Mash 
move 2: Earthquake / Ice Punch
move 3: Zen Headbutt
move 4: Grass Knot / Pursuit 

Metagross makes a comeback with the new Mega Evolution it gets from ORAS. Meteor Mash is the obligatory Steel-type STAB move that also gets a nice Tough Claws boost. Earthquake smashes the Electric-, Fire-, and Steel-types that resist Meteor Mash, while Tough Claws-boosted Ice Punch gets a huge hit against the likes of Dragon-types and Gliscor. Zen Headbutt is Mega Metagross's secondary STAB option that also gets the Tough Claws boost and punishes the Poison- and Fighting-types foolish enough to stay in against it. Grass Knot may seem like an odd option, but it gets boosted by Tough Claws and hits Slowbro considerably harder than Thunder Punch while also not having its damage output hindered by potential Scald burns. Pursuit traps and severely damages the Psychic- and Ghost-types that might switch to avoid being walled or outright destroyed.

name: 2 [ORAS Doubles] Mega Metagross
item: Metagrossite
move 1: Meteor Mash
move 2: Hammer Arm
move 3: Ice Punch / Zen Headbutt
move 4: Protect

With Tough Claws, increased bulk, and good Speed, Mega Metagross is a very threatening Pokemon in the Doubles metagame. Very few Pokemon can KO it, and even fewer Pokemon can switch in safely on its extremely powerful STAB attacks and coverage moves. With Clear Body stopping Intimidate before Mega evolving, it's hard to stop Mega Metagross from doing some major damage early in the game, and with a little speed control, it's hard to prevent it from sweeping later on as well.
