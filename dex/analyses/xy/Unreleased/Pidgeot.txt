name: 2 [ORAS Doubles] Mega Pidgeot
item: Pidgeotite
nature: Timid
evs: 60 HP / 252 SpA / 196 Spe
move 1: Hurricane
move 2: Heat Wave
move 3: Tailwind
move 4: Protect

The main reasons to use Mega Pidgeot are the powerful and accurate Hurricane and being a faster Tailwind setter. However, it's definitely a more niche Mega Evolution when other powerhouse Megas with better coverage, more versatility, more bulk, and better defensive typings should be considered first.
