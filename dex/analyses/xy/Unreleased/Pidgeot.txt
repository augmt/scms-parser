item: Pidgeotite
ability: Big Pecks

move 1: Hurricane
move 2: Heat Wave
move 3: Roost
move 4: Defog / U-turn / Hidden Power Ground

The forgotten Pidgeot swings back with a vengeance in ORAS with its new specially inclined Mega Evolution. STAB Hurricane in tandem with Mega Pidgeot's No Guard ability provides a reliable Flying-type attack that destroys the competition without worrying about the typically shaky 70% accuracy. Heat Wave roasts the Steel-types that resist Hurricane and provides decent coverage otherwise. Roost provides Mega Pidgeot with the longevity it needs to stay in the game and keep annihilating its enemies with Hurricane. The last move option depends on the needs of the team. Defog provides hazard removal support, U-turn can be used for scouting and keeping up offensive pressure, and Hidden Power Ground, while on the weak side, can prove useful for nailing all three types that resist Flying.

name: 2 [ORAS Doubles] Mega Pidgeot
item: Pidgeotite
nature: Timid
evs: 60 HP / 252 SpA / 196 Spe
move 1: Hurricane
move 2: Heat Wave
move 3: Tailwind
move 4: Protect

The main reasons to use Mega Pidgeot are the powerful and accurate Hurricane and being a faster Tailwind setter. However, it's definitely a more niche Mega Evolution when other powerhouse Megas with better coverage, more versatility, more bulk, and better defensive typings should be considered first.
