name: 1 [ORAS] Mega Dragon Dance
item: Altariaite
ability: Natural Cure
evs: 64 HP / 192 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant
move 1: Dragon Dance
move 2: Return
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Roost

This set takes a physical approach to Altaria's newfound offensive prowess that comes with its new Mega Evolution. The set is fairly straightforward: Dragon Dance is there to boost Mega Altaria's Speed and power to allow it to sweep. Return is the obligatory STAB attack, powered up by Pixilate, that wields nearly unresisted physical coverage alongside Earthquake. Roost helps to complement Mega Altaria's ability to tank hits and allows it to keep itself healthy while dishing out damage if necessary.

Set

name: 2 [ORAS] Mega Special Attacker
item: Altariaite
move 1: Hyper Voice
move 2: Draco Meteor
move 3: Fire Blast 
move 4: Roost
ability: Natural Cure
nature: Modest
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

Though Altaria lacks a move that boosts its Special Attack, a special Mega Altaria set is also viable. Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice is the main STAB attack, and Draco Meteor, while not as spammable, provides Mega Altaria with a raw Dragon-type offensive presence. Fire Blast is almost mandatory coverage for this set because both of Mega Altaria's STABs are walled by Steel-types, and so this covers that drawback. Roost affords Mega Altaria staying power to complement its great bulk and slew of important resistances.

name: 3 [ORAS] Bulky Mega Altaria
item: Altariaite
ability: Natural Cure
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe
nature: Bold / Impish
move 1: Hyper Voice / Return
move 2: Roost
move 3: Heal Bell
move 4: Roar / Flamethrower / Earthquake

This set takes advantage of Mega Altaria's typing, increased bulk, and great supportive movepool to assist its allies. Mega Altaria's typing gives it unique resistances and an immunity to Dragon-type attacks. Hyper Voice and Return are your primary attacking moves as they lack Pokemon immune to the attacks while gaining a Pixilate boost. Roost helps keep Altaria alive while Heal Bell cures status ailments that could otherwise plague Mega Altaria and its teammates. The final moveslot has a lot of potential options. Roar is a great option for preventing Mega Altaria from being set up on. You can complement Mega Altaria's Fairy-type STAB with either Flamethrower when using Hyper Voice or Earthquake when using Return.
