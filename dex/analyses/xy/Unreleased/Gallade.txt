Mega Gallade puts its blade arms to use with this set by way of Swords Dance, which boosts its Attack to sky-high levels. The Fighting-type STAB attack of choice is a matter of power vs longevity; Close Combat absolutely shreds the opposition with brute force, while Drain Punch is not as strong but provides Mega Gallade with much needed recovery. Knock Off provides excellent coverage alongside Fighting and is also useful for removing items from its targets. Zen Headbutt is an alternative secondary STAB option that knocks Fighting- and Poison-type foes for a loop. Taunt can be used to prevent setup, hazards, or disruptive moves, while Substitute can provide Mega Gallade a damage shield if used while the active foe is forced to switch and can also work well with Drain Punch. Jolly nature is used so that Mega Gallade has the absolute highest Speed possible.
