Sableye gains some much needed bulk and the Magic Bounce ability when it Mega evolves, which makes it into a defensive behemoth of sorts, deterring attacks and status moves alike while still having only one weakness. Calm Mind allows Mega Sableye to boost its special offense as well as its ability to put up with special hits, and Recover greatly eases setup. Shadow Ball vs Dark Pulse as the attack is dependent on what you want to be able to handle with this thing alone. Shadow Ball gets a neutral hit against Fairy-types and Fighting-types but leaves Mega Sableye totally walled by Normal-types; Dark Pulse, on the other hand, hits all types for at least some damage but is resisted by Fairy-, Fighting-, and other Dark-types. Will-O-Wisp further assists Mega Sableye with its ability to tolerate physical damage, and is also useful for wearing down troublesome foes. Sableye can wait before Mega Evolving if having a priority Will-O-Wisp might be ideal in a match.
