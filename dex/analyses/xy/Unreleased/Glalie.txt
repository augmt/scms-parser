move 4: Explosion

Mega Glalie makes its debut as a new offensive entry hazard setter, which can work as a lead. Getting Spikes down early can benefit Mega Glalie's whole team for the entirety of a match and is very important for the set. Refrigerate-boosted Return deals considerable damage even against neutral targets, with Earthquake slamming the Fire- and Steel-types that resist Ice. Taunt is an option that allows Mega Glalie to also serve as an anti-lead of sorts, preventing the opponent from setting up or laying entry hazards of their own. Ice Shard is a nice alternative that finishes off weakened targets. Finally, with the first ever Ice-type Explosion in the game, Mega Glalie can go out with a frigid boom after its job is done. Jolly nature provides it with the Speed necessary to fulfill its duties as best as possible.

name: 2 [ORAS Doubles] Mega Glalie
item: Glalite
ability: Inner Focus
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant
move 1: Return / Double-Edge
move 2: Explosion
move 3: Ice Shard / Earthquake
move 4: Protect / Ice Shard

The only reason to use Glalie is that it packs the two strongest physical Ice-type moves in the metagame in Refrigerate Return and the mindbogglingly powerful Refrigerate Explosion. If you can play around Protect or force your opponent not to Protect at crucial times, you can basically put two of their Pokemon out of commission, guaranteed:

- 252+ Atk Refrigerate Glalie Explosion vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Mega Kangaskhan: 412-486 (99.5 - 117.3%)
- 252+ Atk Refrigerate Glalie Explosion vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Cresselia: 352-415 (79.2 - 93.4%)
- 252+ Atk Refrigerate Glalie Explosion vs. 4 HP / 0 Def Bisharp: 206-243 (75.7 - 89.3%)
- 252+ Atk Refrigerate Glalie Explosion vs. 228 HP / 0 Def Kyurem-B: 412-486 (91.9 - 108.4%)
- 252+ Atk Refrigerate Glalie Explosion vs. 252 HP / 84 Def Ferrothorn: 306-360 (86.9 - 102.2%)

That's not to mention whatever damage Glalie dealt with Return before it got low on HP and exploded. Glalie is simply a grenade meant to punch massive holes in the opposition.
