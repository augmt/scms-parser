Set
###########
name: 2 [ORAS Doubles] Mega Glalie
item: Glalite
ability: Inner Focus
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe
nature: Adamant
move 1: Return / Double-Edge
move 2: Explosion
move 3: Ice Shard / Earthquake
move 4: Protect / Ice Shard

The only reason to use Glalie is that it packs the two strongest physical Ice-type moves in the metagame in Refrigerate Return and the mindbogglingly powerful Refrigerate Explosion. If you can play around Protect or force your opponent not to Protect at crucial times, you can basically put two of their Pokemon out of commission, guaranteed:

- 252+ Atk Refrigerate Glalie Explosion vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Mega Kangaskhan: 412-486 (99.5 - 117.3%)
- 252+ Atk Refrigerate Glalie Explosion vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Cresselia: 352-415 (79.2 - 93.4%)
- 252+ Atk Refrigerate Glalie Explosion vs. 4 HP / 0 Def Bisharp: 206-243 (75.7 - 89.3%)
- 252+ Atk Refrigerate Glalie Explosion vs. 228 HP / 0 Def Kyurem-B: 412-486 (91.9 - 108.4%)
- 252+ Atk Refrigerate Glalie Explosion vs. 252 HP / 84 Def Ferrothorn: 306-360 (86.9 - 102.2%)

That's not to mention whatever damage Glalie dealt with Return before it got low on HP and exploded. Glalie is simply a grenade meant to punch massive holes in the opposition.
