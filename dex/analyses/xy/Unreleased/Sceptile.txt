Mega Sceptile is probably the best check to VoltTurn teams in OU you could design: it shuts down Rotom-W and Mega Manectric and gains a free special attack boost in the process. In addition, it cannot be shut down through Thunder Wave, meaning it both absorbs status and most likely will not have its excellent speed hindered thoughtout the battle. Its coverage is actually unresisted in OU currently (Togekiss isn't OU) which is a plus, though most of its moves have a major drawback. Giga Drain is the preferred Grass-type STAB move because it gives Sceptile some staying power and allows it to use Substitute and heal off the damage. Dragon Pulse is Sceptile's only special Dragon-type STAB move, but it allows Sceptile to deal heavy damage to Lati@s and Mega Charizard-X, as well as hitting every type except for Steel at least neutral. Focus Blast, while it does have an unfortunate tendancy to miss when you need it most, rounds out the coverage nicely by hitting the aforementioned Steel-types super effectively (or in Scizor's case, neutrally). The last slot goes hand in hand with the first slot. If you want Sceptile to stick around longer, use Substitute so you can avoid Ice-type attacks and hit back with the appropriate move. However, if you're going to use Sceptile as a hit-and-run type attacker, then Hidden Power Fire is better so that you can OHKO Mega Scizor. Leaf Storm should also be used over Giga Drain, since the increase in power is quite drastic and Sceptile can afford the special attack drop if it's not staying in.

name: 2 [ORAS Doubles] Mega Sceptile
item: Sceptilite
nature: Modest
evs: 46 HP / 252 SpA / 208 Spe
move 1: Leaf Storm
move 2: Dragon Pulse
move 3: Focus Blast / Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Protect

Sceptile gains additional Dragon typing after Mega Evolution, giving it a unique and powerful STAB combination in the form of Leaf Storm and Dragon Pulse. Additionally, it also gains Lightning Rod, enabling it to absorb and benefit from the ubiquitous Electric-type moves in Doubles. Notably, Mega Sceptile can make a decent offensive core with Electric-type teammates, as it can absorb Discharge and provides spectacular coverage against Ground- and Dragon-types. While Leaf Storm is the most powerful attack on this set, it must be used with caution as it sharply drops Sceptile's offense and can force it to switch out. Focus Blast and Hidden Power Fire further improve Mega Sceptile's coverage, especially against Steel-types. The former is more powerful and hits Heatran super effectively, while the latter is a more effective and accurate option against the likes of Ferrothorn and Scizor. As usual in Doubles, Protect is mandatory in that it offers a method of scouting against Fake Out and other predicted attacks, while enabling Sceptile to Mega Evolve to its faster and more powerful form safely. The given spread allows Mega Sceptile to outrun max Speed Shaymin-S while maintaining a considerable amount of offense.
