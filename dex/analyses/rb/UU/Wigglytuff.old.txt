[Overview]

<p>Use Clefable. It's a better version of Wigglytuff. If you still want to use this, though, it can do decent damage with its STAB Normal moves, and one thing it has over Clefable is that it's better at using Counter; it can, for example, OHKO a Persian using Slash.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Thunder Wave
move 2: Body Slam / Double-Edge
move 3: Hyper Beam
move 4: Blizzard / Bubble Beam

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Wigglytuff should primarily attack with Body Slam. Thunder Wave is useful in paralyzing opposing Pokemon, which supports the rest of your team. Wigglytuff also can serve as a physical sweeper late in battles. Bubble Beam will always 2HKO Golem and will 2HKO Rhydon most of the time. Blizzard is much less likely to 2HKO them, but is more useful against Gengar, Dragonite, and a lot of UU Pokemon. Otherwise you should use physical attacks because Wigglytuff's Special is sub-par.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Use Rest if you want, but most of the time Wigglytuff won't live long enough to wake up again. Thunder and Blizzard are options, but shouldn't be bothered with due to its low Special. Thunderbolt can sometimes be a good fourth move in UU battles where Omastar is common. Sing is inaccurate but it has to be mentioned. Flash is annoying, Seismic Toss works if you don't want to predict, and Counter works well with Wigglytuff with its low Defense and high HP.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Almost any special attacker can counter it, especially when it is faster than Wigglytuff. Gengar is the best Wigglytuff counter in the game. Snorlax and Tauros can also hurt it, but then again, Wigglytuff can surprise them with Counter. If Machamp is in UU play, it will destroy Wigglytuff. Poliwrath, although it would obviously dislike being paralyzed by Body Slam, might look to Wigglytuff as an opportunity to switch in, get up an Amnesia, and destroy you with Surf.</p>
