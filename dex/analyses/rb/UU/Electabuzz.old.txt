[Overview]

<p>He's a pretty good UU lead, and one of the few Electric-types that can do some damage to Ground-type Pokemon (thanks to Psychic). His movepool is on the small side and he's not going to take hits well, but nonetheless a good option for your UU team. In OU however, there are better special attackers around.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Attacker
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Thunder Wave
move 3: Psychic
move 4: Seismic Toss

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Use Thunderbolt for STAB, and Thunder Wave because paralysis is always a plus. Psychic is good for those half Poison-types that hover around in UU, and Seismic Toss is nice for a consistent 100 damage. Electabuzz can't do that much, so be grateful.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Body Slam is good against Ground-types for paralysis, and Submission is super effective against Normal-types. Electabuzz also gets Reflect and Light Screen, which might prove useful.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Exeggutor, Chansey, Golem, Rhydon, Sandslash, and Alakazam are all OU counters. Exeggutor and Chansey will shake off anything that Electabuzz throws at them. Golem, Rhydon, and Sandslash are all immune to its Electric-type attacks, but don't want to switch into a Special fall Psychic. Alakazam doesn't want to be paralyzed, but if it has the chance to kill Electabuzz (~40%), it should take that opportunity. In UU, Dugtrio and Marowak destroy it if you can't score a Psychic on the switch-in. Electabuzz is generally useless when paralyzed, and doesn't take physical hits well at all.</p>
