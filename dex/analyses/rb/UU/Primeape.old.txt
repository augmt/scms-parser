[Overview]

<p>Primeape is in his prime in UU. He can wreak havoc against the UU metagame, even if he is a little on the fragile side. He's a sweeper, and a darn good one for UU.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Sweeper
move 1: Submission
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Body Slam
move 4: Focus Energy / Hyper Beam

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If you're playing on Stadium, just Focus Energy and blow them away with a slew of Submissions, Rock Slides, and Body Slams (or Hyper Beam if you prefer). If not, replace it with Hyper Beam, since Focus Energy only works in Stadium.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>If you don't like Submission because of its recoil, try Low Kick. It's weaker, but has less of that nasty aftertaste, and can flinch too. With Focus Energy and a little luck, Thunderbolt or Thunder will do quite some damage to Water-types, especially Starmie. Dig is cool against Muk, Nidoking, or Nidoqueen. Remember that while it has 100 Base Power, Dig is easily countered.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Primeape's defenses are weak, so most opponents that resist Fighting and won't die immediately to the other moves will do as counters. For instance, Psychic-types (especially Slowbro and Exeggutor) and Gengar are completely impenetrable to Primeape, as are Poison-types like Muk and Weezing. Flying Pokemon that aren't 4x weak to Rock Slide and have Flying-type moves, such as Zapdos in OU and Fearow in UU, also work.</p>
