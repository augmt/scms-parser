[Overview]

<p>Beedrill is really, really weak, but it just might work as a late-game sweeper if Rhydon/Golem are gone and the other Pokemon are paralyzed or weak enough for Beedrill to kill. However, that can be said about almost any Pokemon. In the end, Beedrill's low all around stats, poor typing, and poor movepool condemn it to being very rarely seen in any sort of competitive play, even UU.</p>

[SET]
name: Agility + Swords Dance
move 1: Twineedle
move 2: Hyper Beam
move 3: Swords Dance
move 4: Agility

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Switch in when you predict the opponent is about to use Rest on a Pokemon that either has a weak Defense stat or is weak to Bug-type attacks. Use one Agility to increase Beedrill's Speed so it'll go first, and follow up with a single Swords Dance. Finally, use either Twineedle or Hyper Beam, depending on which you think has the best chance of wiping out the opponent. A prepared Beedrill can, on occasion, wipe out a full-HP Alakazam.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Mega Drain can be used to surprise Golem/Rhydon. Focus Energy also becomes a viable move choice if you're playing on Stadium.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Pretty much everything that doesn't have a quadruple weakness to Bug-type attacks. Beedrill is a weak Pokemon in Attack, Defense, and Special, so it doesn't scare much off and doesn't take many hits.</p>
