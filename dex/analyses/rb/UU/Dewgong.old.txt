[Overview]

<p>Dewgong is like Lapras, except its HP and Defense stats are lower. On the flip side, Dewgong's Attack and Speed stats are higher. Too bad Lapras's HP and defenses outweigh the differences between them. Dewgong also has the problem of a limited movepool. If it had a better movepool, it might be a bit better. If you use Dewgong in a UU environment, it's actually quite good.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive 
move 1: Surf
move 2: Blizzard
move 3: Body Slam
move 4: Mimic

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Dewgong's main objective with this set is quite obvious. It's meant to attack using special moves. Dewgong's Special stat is equal to that of Lapras and Jynx, which is good, so it's safe to say that both Surf and Blizzard will do a sizable amount of damage. Body Slam won't be doing so much damage as its base Attack stat is 70 (238), but paralyzing is a godsend for Dewgong because its Speed is equal to its Attack. Mimic is on this set to hope for the best and get a useful move.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>If you want, Dewgong can learn Double-Edge in order to do a bit more damage on the physical point. This isn't recommended though. If you are really paranoid of missing attacks, then you use Ice Beam over Blizzard. You can use Horn Drill on Dewgong if you're battling in an environment that allows OHKO moves, but it's just too slow to make any effective use out of it. However, if you're in an environment that allows for evasion moves, then Dewgong can pull off a Double Team + Rest combo. You can even turn it into a Pandora set (attack move, Double Team, Substitute, Rest) and it'd still get by.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>If it's a fully evolved Pokemon that learns Thunderbolt, then Dewgong won't enjoy it. Dewgong doesn't get Thunderbolt, so it can't handle other Water-types very well either, especially Slowbro, Lapras, and Starmie. High HP Pokemon like Snorlax can also handle Dewgong's attacks and battle back with devastating Body Slams.</p>
