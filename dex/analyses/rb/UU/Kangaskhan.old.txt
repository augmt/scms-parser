[Overview]

<p>Kangaskhan is pretty much a mini-Tauros and in battle should be treated as such. But everything it can do, Tauros can do better. Tauros is lot faster (with a much better critical hit ratio), is stronger, and can take more special attacks. The only reasons to use Kangaskhan over Tauros are Surf and novelty.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Kangaskhan should Body Slam most of the time, and try to finish things off with its STAB Hyper Beam. Earthquake is mainly for Gengar, to avoid Counter, and for the odd Electric- and Poison-types.</p>

<p>Surf is for Golem and Rhydon--it shouldn't be used on anything else--to take advantage of their 4x weakness (it will do about 70% to both of them).</p>

<p>Counter makes it interesting. With the right predictions and perhaps the element of surprise, it may end up making a difference in a Kangaskhan vs Tauros / Snorlax war.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Although Kangaskhan works similarly to Tauros, Blizzard shouldn't be an option on Kangaskhan, as it isn't backed up by a decent Special stat, and hence Body Slam is still better against Grass-types. This means that Kangaskhan really doesn't have any other reasonable options; Submission hurts some Pokemon, like Ice- and Normal-types, a little more than Body Slam, but the recoil and inaccuracy aren't worth it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Slowbro are good counters due to their good defensive capabilities. If Kangaskhan has shown its moveset and it doesn't pack Earthquake, Gengar will be unaffected by anything Kangaskhan would be using except Surf, which does negligible damage on it, and is thus an excellent counter. In general, although Kangaskhan can hurt special attackers, it's also horrible at taking special hits, so it will be 2HKOed by most powerful special attackers that are able to take physical hits relatively well.</p>
