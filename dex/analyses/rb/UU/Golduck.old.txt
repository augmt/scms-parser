[Overview]

<p>Golduck has all-around pretty solid stats, making it a good Water-type. It's pretty decent in UU, and if played right, he can harm some OU teams. It may not have the best stats in the game, but it does have decent move selection.</p>

[SET]
name: Amnesia
move 1: Amnesia
move 2: Blizzard / Ice Beam
move 3: Surf
move 4: Body Slam / Rest

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>The moveset is pretty simple, just Amnesia once or twice and sweep. Golduck should always have Amnesia; that's the only reason to ever use it. Golduck can also make use of Body Slam for its paralysis chance with its decent Attack, which might help set up Golduck. Rest helps him to last a little longer, and would work better in the UU metagame, where he should be used; just make sure common counters like fast Electric-types have been already taken care of if you decide to Amnesia early, otherwise you'll be forced to switch, fearing a critical hit. It can still be decent in OU, though. Amnesia takes away its weaknesses, but it still needs to watch out for critical hits and mostly Razor Leaf users while it's either paralyzed or has been put to sleep. It's faster than both Venusaur and Victreebel, which is a good thing, and can OHKO them after an Amnesia with Blizzard.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Counter can work against things such as Snorlax. Substitute is nice, especially once you've powered up, since a special attacker might not be able to break it. Disable is interesting but inaccurate. Submission is unreliable but can hurt Chansey. Golduck can also learn Mimic, which could be pretty awesome if it somehow Mimics a Thunderbolt. Hydro Pump is useful for higher damage if you don't mind the miss rate.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Lapras and Starmie are its main counters in OU. Zapdos can also counter it (2 Amnesias then Blizzard would OHKO it, though). Critical hits would KO Golduck while it sleeps. Poliwrath is Golduck's main counter in UU, being able to Amnesia and hit it hard with STAB Submissions. Other UU Electric-types also counter it well, as even if they don't land a critical hit, they can usually weaken Golduck enough for another fast Pokemon to finish it. Faster Grass-types will also be a thorn in Golduck's side, namely Venusaur with its high critical hit rate Razor Leafs.</p>
