[Overview]

<p>Farfetch'd is a pretty horrible Pokemon in RBY. Unless you have some sort of a theme going on, or you just want to use bad Pokemon, don't include him in your team.</p>

[SET]
name: Staller?
move 1: Sand Attack
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Slash / Swords Dance
move 4: Toxic / Body Slam

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>You know things are bad when you have to resort to Toxic in RBY. Watch out for Gengar and just try to do something such as stalling while the opponent destroys you.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Mimic is an option because Farfetch'd's movepool is horrible, but he probably doesn't have the stats to use whatever he could get from it. Agility and Fly, just to mention something else.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything that has moderate Defense, and especially Gengar since it cannot be touched by Farfetch'd at all, will easily counter the duck. Golem and Rhydon are also at the top of the counters list, as are Rock-, Electric-, and Ice-type Pokemon. Snorlax is a counter as well since it has high HP, and can cripple Farfetch'd.</p>
