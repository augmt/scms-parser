[Overview]

<p>Tangela is only an UU alternative for Exeggutor, and only good to counter it. It rarely damages much, but it does have its good points. It gets Growth and can use it fairly nicely. It's a decent counter for Slowbro, but then again most Grass-types are. It's sad that it has such a terrible movepool, because its stats are nice.</p>

[SET]
name: Double Powder
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Stun Spore
move 3: Growth
move 4: Mega Drain

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Really, if Tangela learned Razor Leaf, it would be awesome. It has decent HP, bad Attack, below average Speed, and great Defense and Special. Simply put, Tangela takes less percentage damage from physical attacks than Exeggutor, which means Persian owns it just a little less.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Body Slam
move 3: Sleep Powder / Stun Spore
move 4: Mega Drain / Hyper Beam

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is mostly a novelty set. You can mix and match the moves and it will work about as well. Sleep Powder is to put something to sleep and give you a free turn to Swords Dance. Stun Spore makes enemies slower than you as long as you're not paralyzed as well. Mega Drain kills Rhydon and Golem (or Onix if you play UU), while Hyper Beam is more powerful than Body Slam and should be used as a finisher.</p>

[SET]
name: Bind
move 1: Bind
move 2: Sleep Powder / Hyper Beam
move 3: Stun Spore
move 4: Mega Drain

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Bind is a slightly more inaccurate Wrap. If you're lucky, you will kill something with this. Sleep something, then try to paralyze something else. Repeatedly Bind as your opponent cannot move, and then kill with Hyper Beam when they're on low health. Again, Mega Drain is to be used against Rock / Ground Pokemon.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Articuno, Chansey, Jynx, and Moltres all take little damage from Mega Drain and can hit Tangela hard with super effective damage. Bind may be annoying if they're paralyzed, or in Chansey's case, when Tangela is not paralyzed. Lapras tortures Tangela with its STAB super effective Blizzard, but may not enjoy being Mega Drained.</p>

<p>In UU, Arcanine is an asset when countering Tangela. Most other Fire-types fare well too, such as Ninetales, Flareon, and Magmar.</p>
