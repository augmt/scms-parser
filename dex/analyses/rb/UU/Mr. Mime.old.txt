[Overview]

<p>Mr. Mime is almost like a mini-Alakazam--although he has a better base Defense stat than Alakazam, its lower base HP stat counteracts it, and its lack of Recover greatly diminishes its usefulness. If you play in an UU environment, Mr. Mime is very useful since Poison-types are frequently used there. However, using it in OU is not recommended.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive
move 1: Psychic

move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Seismic Toss

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Psychic is Mr. Mime's STAB attack and is well supported by its 100 base Special. Its Speed is decent enough for it to use Thunder Wave. However, if you choose to use Thunder Wave, make sure to use it against a special attacker (such as Alakazam) because Mr. Mime has bad Defense. Thunderbolt is there so Mr. Mime can hurt Water-type Pokemon like Slowbro and Starmie, while Seismic Toss hurts Pokemon that it can't deal a lot of damage to, like Exeggutor.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Using Barrier on Mr. Mime is an option since it helps its poor Defense. However, he has to be sure to set it up on a special attacker rather than a physical one. Mimic can be used too, and might pick up something to supplement Mr. Mime's limited movepool. If you play in an environment where you are allowed to play with Pokemon traded to and from GSC, then add Hypnosis over Seismic Toss. Mr. Mime can suffice as a cheap parasleeper if that's the case.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Exeggutor takes little from Mr. Mime's attacks, although it can't do much in return if Sleep Clause is already in effect. Chansey is more reliable in that she can fearlessly switch in and Thunder Wave Mr. Mime and Soft-Boiled off any damage. Really, though, since Mr. Mime's defensive capabilities are poor, any physically-based Pokemon, regardless of metagame, that can survive a STAB Psychic and in turn hit Mr. Mime with a powerful STAB move serves as a reliable counter.</p>
