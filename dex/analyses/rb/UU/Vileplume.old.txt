[Overview]

<p>Vileplume gets neglected most of the time because Venusaur and Victreebel have the same typing and are generally better in all aspects. Overall, keep Vileplume in the UU environment, where it's pretty good. At least in UU it outspeeds Lickitung and Wigglytuff, and you have a 50/50 chance to outspeed Muk.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Swords Dance
move 3: Body Slam
move 4: Mega Drain

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>At first glance, you'd think this set would be cool. But Vileplume's Speed, second lowest of the fully-evolved Grass-types, ensures that it can't outspeed Exeggutor. Vileplume has decent stats otherwise: okay HP, decent Attack and Defense, and nice Special. It really is a pity it doesn't get Razor Leaf. Basically, you play it like a weaker Venusaur. Sleep Powder is for that nice sleep effect, Body Slam for paralysis, Swords Dance to help boost Body Slam's damage, and Mega Drain for STAB and healing ability.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Stun Spore is good if you want to go with a double powder set. Hyper Beam could work as well over Body Slam, coupled with Swords Dance. Petal Dance is an OK STAB attack, but since it lasts for 2 to 3 turns, it's not very good and allows a switch-in. Although Acid is fairly weak, it destroys Parasect and can also lower Defense.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Psychic Pokemon like Exeggutor and Alakazam wreck Vileplume. Vileplume's type coverage isn't particularly good, so many Flying-, Poison-, and Bug-types get the jump on it and win one-on-one, even in UU. Boosted Ice attacks are no fun to face either. Solid Normal-types in general can take Vileplume's attacks well, like Tauros and Snorlax--just be careful of status effects. As with any other Pokemon that can utilize status moves, it's important to guard your counter from it. This can be done by letting another Pokemon on your team take the status condition, then bring in your Vileplume counter.</p>
