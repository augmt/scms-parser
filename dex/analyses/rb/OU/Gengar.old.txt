[Overview]

<p>Gengar is very useful in many respects. He is the fastest sleep user in the game, has a Normal immunity and very good Special, and can Explode when the timing is right, making him very difficult to deal with. While Gengar is the fastest sleeper in the game, Hypnosis will miss almost half the time. However, despite this shortcoming, Gengar is still a very good lead to sleep the opposing Pokemon. His Normal immunity comes in handy quite often as it's the only surefire way to stop Wrap and can cause the opponent to lose a Pokemon if you predict Explosion/Self-Destruct correctly. Gengar also packs the second fastest (behind Electrode) Explosion in the game, thus allowing him to put a stop to any threats causing your team problems before they get out of hand. Overall, he is a pretty good choice despite his weakness to Psychic and Earthquake, as he is difficult to predict and can screw up quite a few common Pokemon in the metagame.</p>

[SET]
name: Standard
move 1: Hypnosis
move 2: Explosion
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Mega Drain

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sleep the first Pokemon, switch out, and save Gengar for later purposes as his Normal immunity comes in handy quite often. When your opponent least expects it, Explode for pretty good damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Mega Drain 2HKOes Golem and Rhydon, and when they are not around, Thunderbolt deals a decent chunk of damage to everything else.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Confuse Ray can be used to prevent the opponent from attacking if you get lucky&mdash;using it against a paralyzed Pokemon can increase that luck in your favor. Psychic is really only useful for hitting other Gengar, but is still an option. Night Shade is a decent choice for consistent damage to Pokemon that would otherwise take very little from Gengar's attacks, such as Exeggutor.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Alakazam is the best counter--he's faster and Psychic will do 63-75% damage. Rhydon will OHKO Gengar with Earthquake, and Golem will most of the time--they need to watch out for Mega Drain, though. Starmie will do a decent amount of damage with Psychic, but Psychic isn't used very often on Starmie, and Gengar's Thunderbolt will hurt it very much. Hypno and Exeggutor both do a ton of damage with Psychic, but won't OHKO. Tauros ties Gengar in Speed and will 2HKO him with Earthquake. The best way to beat Gengar is to hit him with a strong Earthquake or Psychic, as they will usually 2HKO Gengar.</p>
