[Overview]

<p>Sceptile's excellent Speed and vast movepool allow him to perform a variety of jobs well. Sceptile can slowly wear down the enemy using Leech Seed or can go the more offensive route and attempt to KO the opposing team. However, Sceptile faces problems due to his poor defenses. He takes large amounts of damage even from neutral hits and is especially weak to priority and opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon. Despite these shortcomings, when used correctly, Sceptile can be a nuisance to your opponent's team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sceptile's position as the fastest SubSeeder was at one point usurped by Shaymin-S. However, with Shaymin-S being banned to Ubers, Sceptile can once again do what he does best: slowly wear down the opponent with Leech Seed. This set works similarly to his UU counterpart.</p>

<p>Substitute not only scouts for attacks, but can also protect Sceptile from taking heavy damage because of his mediocre defenses. Leech Seed serves a twofold purpose: to restore Sceptile's HP, allowing him to create more Substitutes and slowly to drain the opponent's HP. Grass Knot is the preferred STAB attack, scaring away bulky Water-type Pokemon like Swampert and Suicune. Alternatively, Energy Ball can be used, as it hits lighter enemies like Vaporeon and Rotom-A for more damage. Leaf Storm also deserves a mention as Sceptile should be spending most of its time setting up Substitutes, and two Leaf Storms will out-damage two Grass Knots or Energy Balls unless Grass Knot is hitting for 120 Base Power. Unfortunately, Leaf Storm does leave Sceptile's Hidden Power severely weakened. The last moveslot is mainly used to hit Sceptile's primary checks, along with Grass-type Pokemon who are immune to Leech Seed. Hidden Power Fire hits Scizor, Forretress, and Skarmory, while Hidden Power Ice targets Dragonite and Flygon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With a 7 HP IV, Sceptile attains the lowest Leftovers number + 1 possible, maximizing the percentage gained from Leech Seed. The EVs listed let Sceptile outspeed Choice Scarf Tyranitar and also attain an OHKO on Choice Band Scizor after Stealth Rock. 4 additional Speed EVs are required due to the IV drop from Hidden Power Fire, though. The remaining EVs go into Special Defense to take Surfs and Thunderbolts better. If you choose to use Hidden Power Ice, then an EV spread of 252 SpA / 32 SpD / 224 Spe should be used to OHKO Gliscor after Stealth Rock damage with it. An EV spread of 32 HP / 220 SpA / 28 SpD / 228 Spe with a 31 HP IV can also be used to prevent his Substitutes from being broken by Vaporeon's, Suicune's, and Swampert's Surfs along with defensive Rotom-A's Thunderbolts.</p>

<p>This set is notorious for causing switches, which means entry hazard support is useful to further wear down your opponent's team. Heatran is a good choice to set up Stealth Rock as he resists all of Sceptile's weaknesses while Sceptile resists all of Heatran's except for Fighting. Both Forretress and Skarmory can be used to set up Spikes. Forretress has the additional benefit of setting up Toxic Spikes and removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin, while Skarmory has Roost to lengthen its longevity and Whirlwind to scout the opponent's team and rack up more entry hazard damage. Toxic Spikes are especially helpful as it allows Sceptile to beat Blissey. As with all entry hazard abusers, a good partner would be a Ghost-type Pokemon to block Rapid Spin. Rotom-A is a good choice as it can use its super effective moves to scare away Rapid Spinners. If you choose to use Hidden Power Ice, then Rotom-H would be a good choice to smash Scizor and Forretress.</p>

<p>Sceptile likes switching in on Water-type Pokemon. As previously mentioned, Heatran is a good partner because he can lure out Water-type Pokemon and hit them with Toxic. Depending on which Hidden Power you use, you will have problems with either Dragon-type Pokemon or Steel-type Pokemon. With Hidden Power Fire, Dragonite with Roost are problematic because they can heal away the Leech Seed damage. Mamoswine works as a failsafe to beat these Pokemon, but he doesn't bring any useful resistances to the table. Scizor can hit a weakened Dragon with a powerful Bullet Punch. A bulky Water-type such as Swampert or Suicune can also work provided it doesn't sustain too much damage beforehand. If you opt to use Hidden Power Ice, Steel-types become an issue. Forretress and Skarmory can come in and set up entry hazards while Scizor has no fear of U-turning out. Magnezone can be used to trap and KO these Pokemon while maintaining good synergy with Sceptile. Heatran can come in and threaten them with a STAB Fire move, while Substitute Gengar can lure them in and KO them with Hidden Power Fire or Thunderbolt. Tentacruel and Starmie are both good partners for their ability to Rapid Spin away any entry hazards, most notably Toxic Spikes as they can reduce Sceptile's effectiveness.</p>

[SET]
name: Life Orb
move 1: Leaf Storm
move 2: Earthquake / Focus Blast / Protect
move 3: Dragon Pulse
move 4: Hidden Power Fire
item: Life Orb
nature: Hasty / Timid
evs: 28 Atk / 252 SpA / 228 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set abuses Sceptile's blazing Speed along with high-powered moves in order to decimate the opponent's team. With Sceptile's wide type coverage, many teams without Blissey or Snorlax will have problems switching into it safely.</p>

<p>Leaf Storm is Sceptile's main attack on this set, hitting for 210 Base Power including STAB. Combined with Life Orb and a potential Overgrow boost, anything that doesn't resist it is going to get slaughtered. Earthquake with the given Attack EVs allows Sceptile to always KO 0 HP Heatran after Stealth Rock. Focus Blast can be used as it isn't affected by Intimidate and doesn't diminish Sceptile's Defense with a Hasty nature. It also hits Blissey and Snorlax harder than Earthquake would. Protect is an option to scout against Scizor and either OHKO him with Hidden Power Fire or switch out depending on his selected move. Dragon Pulse hits Dragon-types and any weakened Pokemon, while Hidden Power Fire hits Steel-types bar Heatran, who is hit by both Earthquake and Focus Blast.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs of this set allow Sceptile to outspeed everything up to Choice Scarf Tyranitar and still hit as hard as possible. The remaining EVs are put into Attack in order to OHKO 0 HP Heatran 100% of the time. If using a Timid nature, then those EVs can be moved into HP in order to soften some attacks.</p>

<p>With his great type coverage, only dedicated tanks can take a hit and retaliate. Both Blissey and Snorlax can take a Focus Blast and cripple Sceptile, while Cresselia can sponge a Leaf Storm and hit back with Ice Beam. Choice Band Scizor can threaten all three with either U-turn, Superpower, or Pursuit, making him a valuable teammate. Tyranitar can also scare away all three provided that he has the moves with which to hit them, but brings sandstorm along with him, which reduces Sceptile's longevity. Heatran and Infernape are also good choices to get rid of Blissey and Snorlax because not only do they threaten to OHKO them, but Sceptile can switch into the Water- and Ground-type moves aimed at them.</p>

<p>Scizor appears to be a safe switch, as it resists Leaf Storm, taking no more than 25%, and will likely either Pursuit a weakened Sceptile, or U-turn, not fearing a -2 Hidden Power Fire. However, if Scizor takes damage from Leaf Storm and Stealth Rock, Hidden Power Fire, even at -2 will KO it, making Bullet Punch Scizor's best option. Magnezone is a good partner because it easily removes a Scizor locked into any of the moves that Sceptile will lure. With Scizor gone thanks to Magnezone and bulky Water-types gone due to Sceptile, Dragonite can exploit these holes, as many teams rely on bulk or Scizor to stop him.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sceptile can use a Swords Dance set composed of Leaf Blade, Earthquake, and Rock Slide. Unfortunately, Sceptile's defenses are poor so he is easily revenge killed. Additionally, he has no effective way to hit Skarmory, who can easily Brave Bird or outstall the Life Orb Damage. Also, because he has no way of boosting both his Attack and Speed in one move, virtually any Choice Scarf user faster than base 65 Speed will outspeed him. Additionally, Scizor can bypass Sceptile's impressive Speed by using Bullet Punch. Sceptile can also use a Choice Scarf set consisting of Leaf Storm, Focus Blast, and your choice from Dragon Pulse and Hidden Power Fire or Grass Knot and Hidden Power Ice. However, Sceptile's poor Defense means that he takes a lot of damage from Pursuit. Sceptile can also use a Choice Specs set with the same attacks as the Life Orb set, but it is less efficient because of the constant switching needed and Sceptile's low defenses.</p>

<p>An Endeavor set can also be used with Sceptile using either Substitute or Endure to bring his HP down. This will activate Overgrow, making Leaf Storm extremely powerful. Quick Attack can be used with Endeavor to finish off any opponents. However, due to the prevalence of sandstorm and priority moves in the metagame, Sceptile has difficulty pulling this off. Sceptile's other options aren't very viable.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Sceptile without a Substitute is very fragile because his defenses are so poor. Choice Scarf Heatran can switch into a Grass-type move and KO Sceptile with his STAB Fire-type attacks. Scizor can come in on anything except for Hidden Power Fire and either U-turn out, Bullet Punch for the KO, or use Pursuit if he predicts a switch. Tyranitar fears Sceptile's Grass-type moves along with Focus Blast, but sandstorm wears Sceptile down faster and also hinders its SubSeeding strategy.</p>

<p>For the SubSeed set, either Dragon- or Steel-type Pokemon wall it, depending on the Hidden Power type. Dragonite can set up in front of Sceptile and heal away any Leech Seed damage. Forretress and Skarmory can set up entry hazards while Scizor and Jirachi can proceed to use U-turn to leave Sceptile without a Substitute.</p>

<p>Blissey is a major problem for any set that doesn't have Leech Seed or Toxic Spikes support. She can come into any of Sceptile's special attacks and cripple him with Toxic or Thunder Wave. Snorlax also causes problems and can Rest off any damage he might have taken. For Sceptile without Focus Blast or Earthquake, Heatran is a good counter because Sceptile has nothing that he can hit Heatran for heavy damage with.</p>
