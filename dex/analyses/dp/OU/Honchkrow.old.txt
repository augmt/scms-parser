[Overview]

<p>Honchkrow is the much-needed evolution for his pre-evolved form, Murkrow. With base 125 Attack and strong STAB moves, Honchkrow can be a force to be reckoned with. This, combined with one of the strongest priority moves in the game, Sucker Punch, makes Honchkrow a dangerous offensive threat. However, what holds him back are his nasty Stealth Rock weakness, low defenses, and lack of moves to switch in on. Honchkrow is extremely weak to Scizor, as Bullet Punch OHKOes him after Stealth Rock damage. Furthermore, Honchkrow takes quite a bit of prediction to use, due to the mind games that Sucker Punch causes. However, with proper support, Honchkrow can be a huge threat to the opposing team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Honchkrow can pull off a very simple yet effective Life Orb set, due to his sheer power and type coverage. STAB Brave Bird hits extremely hard, capable of 2HKOing Swampert. Sucker Punch allows Honchkrow to bypass his low Speed and hit faster Pokemon before they have a chance to strike back. Many faster Pokemon, such as Jolteon and Aerodactyl, have low defenses, meaning Sucker Punch will decimate them. Both Superpower and Heat Wave strike the Pokemon who resist Honchkrow's STAB moves. For example, Superpower hits Tyranitar and Heatran, while Heat Wave prevents Forretress and Skarmory from setting up entry hazards. It also hits Scizor and Metagross, although Scizor can strike first with Bullet Punch and Metagross can survive one Heat Wave and KO Honchkrow back with Meteor Mash.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Night Slash can also be used over either Superpower or Heat Wave in order to hit Rotom-A, who can wall this entire set if it has Will-O-Wisp. Roost is a viable alternative over one of those two moves in order for Honchkrow to heal off any residual damage from Stealth Rock, Life Orb, and Brave Bird. Pursuit can also be used to finish off a weakened enemy should it choose to switch out. If running any move over Heat Wave, an Adamant nature is more useful. However, replacing one or both of the last two moves means giving up type coverage, which isn't recommended.</p>

<p>A Naughty nature allows Honchkrow to hit as hard as possible without sacrificing his Special Attack. Additionally, it helps if Honchkrow has to take a Crunch or Pursuit from Choice Scarf Tyranitar and also cushions him against physical priority moves. Max Speed EVs allow Honchkrow to outspeed Naive non-Choice Scarf Magnezone, while a Naughty nature also secures the 2HKO on Skarmory with Heat Wave. Either ability may work, as Honchkrow can only really come in on Breloom's Spore and Roserade's Sleep Powder if he has Insomnia. Super Luck can help if you're feeling lucky, and combines well with Night Slash's high critical hit ratio should you use it.</p>

<p>Honchkrow is weak to Stealth Rock, and with Life Orb and Brave Bird factored in, the passive damage really hurts his longevity. Therefore, a Rapid Spinner would be helpful to pair with Honchkrow. Starmie is a great choice, as it keeps up the offensive tempo and also resists Honchkrow's Ice-type weakness. Honchkrow can also take a Crunch or Pursuit from Choice Scarf Tyranitar and begin retaliating. Another useful partner is Magnezone, who can help Honchkrow defensively, as it resists all three of Honchkrow's weaknesses. It can also set up Substitute on Scizor's Bullet Punch and KO him with either Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fire. Honchkrow is also immune to any Ground-type moves that might be directed at Magnezone.</p>

<p>If Superpower is to be replaced by either Night Slash or Roost, then Swampert is a good choice to check Heatran and Tyranitar. Swampert can set up Stealth Rock for Honchkrow, as well as lure in Breloom, whom Insomnia Honchkrow can freely switch into his Spore. Swampert also resists Scizor's Bullet Punch. If Heat Wave is replaced, then Heatran is a good partner for Honchkrow to scare away Skarmory and Forretress. Honchkrow can also come in on Ground-type moves directed towards Heatran.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Due to Honchkrow's wide movepool, a Choice Scarf set can be useful to him. Choice Scarf bypasses Honchkrow's low base Speed and lets him strike potentially first with a quick Brave Bird. However, his Stealth Rock weakness and lack of useful resistances prevents him from switching frequently. Additionally, being locked into Sucker Punch can be dangerous, as it can easily turn Honchkrow into setup fodder.</p>

<p>Honchkrow can also run a Nasty Plot set with Dark Pulse and Heat Wave, along with Superpower to hit Blissey, but Honchkrow's viability is limited by his low Speed and weakness to the omnipresent priority attacks and Choice Scarf users. Honchkrow also has access to both Perish Song and Mean Look, but his low defenses make Perish Trapping unviable.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Honchkrow really has problems with opposing Pokemon who resist Sucker Punch and are faster than him. Choice Band Scizor can easily switch into Sucker Punch and OHKO Honchkrow with Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock damage. Jirachi can outspeed Honchkrow and Iron Head for the 2HKO, while Choice Scarf Tyranitar resists Brave Bird, Sucker Punch, and Heat Wave, and can strike Honchkrow back with Stone Edge. Metagross can survive one Heat Wave from Honchkrow and retaliate back with Meteor Mash. Substitute Gengar can force Honchkrow into a Sucker Punch mind-game and strike him from behind a Substitute with Focus Blast.</p>

<p>Honchkrow's biggest enemy is residual damage, though. Stealth Rock, sandstorm, and recoil damage from Brave Bird and Life Orb all significantly decrease Honchkrow's lifespan.</p>
