[Overview]

<p>With incredible defensive stats and a plentiful amount of supporting moves such as Reflect, Light Screen, Thunder Wave, and Memento, Uxie can take many hits and assist its team with ease. Furthermore, it can utilize Trick in order to cripple the opposing Pokemon and Yawn to shuffle the opposing team. However, Uxie is weak to common attacking types from most standard Pokemon, such as Scizor and Tyranitar. Additionally, Uxie is generally outclassed by Cresselia, as Cresselia has recovery outside of Rest + Sleep Talk and is bulkier on both sides. Nevertheless, Uxie is a great addition to any team due to its ability to support its teammates in a variety of effective ways.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Due to Uxie's great bulk and decent Speed, it can utilize a Choice Scarf set in order to cripple opposing Pokemon and set up Stealth Rock. Uxie can generally last long enough during a battle to set up Stealth Rock again if it gets removed, while still being capable of weakening the opposing team. Trick cripples the opposing lead by swapping its item with a hindering Choice Scarf, locking it into either Stealth Rock or an attacking move. From there, you have two choices; setting up Stealth Rock helps by slowly chipping away at the opposing team, while using U-turn after Trick lets Uxie switch after seeing what the opponent brings in. Additionally, U-turn lets Uxie switch out and break Aerodactyl's and Azelf's Focus Sash at the same time if they decide to Taunt it. Alternatively, Uxie can use Thunder Wave to cripple the Tricked Pokemon or an incoming opponent. Psychic lets Uxie hit back, while Yawn can work with U-turn to scout the opposing team.</p>

[Additional Comments]
<p>The listed Speed EVs allow Choice Scarf Uxie to outspeed Aerodactyl and Azelf and Trick them before they can Taunt Uxie. If you choose to use Psychic in the last moveslot, 24 EVs should be moved from Defense to Special Attack in order to break 252 HP Rotom-A's Substitutes 100% of the time. Knock Off can be utilized in the last moveslot in order to further cripple the opposing team.</p>

<p>Uxie is bad against entry hazard users, such as Smeargle and Forretress, because they can freely set up entry hazards against Uxie due to its inability to dish out much damage. Therefore, a Rapid Spinner is a good teammate to remove those entry hazards. Forretress resists Ghost- and Dark-type moves, while Hitmontop resists Bug- and Dark-type moves and can execute a guaranteed Rapid Spin due to Foresight. Alternatively, Starmie is a splendid Rapid Spinner as it can scare away Spikes users with its powerful STAB moves. Although it lacks Rapid Spin, Heatran is great at destroying most entry hazard users due to its impressive typing and raw power.</p>

<p>Choice Scarf Uxie lures in Choice Scarf Tyranitar very often, so you should be careful not to immediately Trick and force Uxie to take Pursuit damage while switching out. However, there are certain Pokemon that can capitalize on that switch. Machamp can freely set up a Substitute and immediately wreak havoc against the opposing team, while Lucario 4x resists Dark- and Rock-type moves and can set up a Swords Dance.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens Lead
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Stealth Rock
move 4: U-turn
item: Light Clay
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 HP / 40 Def / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Although Azelf seems better suited for this task due to its greater Speed and access to Explosion, Uxie can still perform this duty well since it possesses much more bulk. This extra bulk allows Uxie to come in and set up dual screens frequently throughout a match, but Uxie's Speed should also not be forgotten, as if EVed properly, it can still outspeed base 90 Pokemon. Based on the lead match-up, Reflect should be used against physical attackers, while Light Screen should be employed against special attackers. Stealth Rock aids Uxie's teammates in sweeping, while U-turn can help scout your opponent's switches.</p>

[Additional Comments]
<p>The given EVs allow Uxie to outspeed Roserade and other base 90s in order to get off another move before it takes a hit. Being slower than Gliscor also means that Uxie can U-turn out after Gliscor uses Taunt, which allows your next Pokemon to freely set up. Alternatively, an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe can be used in order to at least Speed tie with opposing Gliscor and set up another defensive screen.</p>

<p>Similar to the previous set, Uxie often draws in entry hazard users because it can't do much back to them. Heatran and Starmie both deter entry hazard users in their own ways: Heatran has powerful STAB attacks while Starmie can Rapid Spin away any entry hazards. Additionally, Heatran has good defensive synergy with Uxie because it resists all of Uxie's weaknesses.</p>

<p>This type of Uxie is better suited for offensive teams because of the momentum it provides with dual screens and U-turn. Many opposing teams rely on powerful moves to take down Pokemon like Suicune and Dragonite, but with the reduced damage that they take thanks to dual screens, these Pokemon can set up additional boosting moves and proceed to sweep the opposing team. Alternatively, Machamp is a good partner because its Substitutes can survive more hits and let it wreck the opposing team easier. Additionally, Machamp resists two of Uxie's weaknesses: Dark and Bug.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Uxie can utilize a defensive spread that takes advantage of an asset that the other pixies don't have access to: Memento. That, combined with Light Screen and Reflect, makes it extremely difficult for the opposing team to penetrate your team's defenses. Once again, Reflect and Light Screen are used to reduce the damage output from physical and special attacks respectively, while Memento is Uxie's coup de grace. Using it effectively leaves your opponent at -6 Attack and Special Attack at the cost of Uxie's life. U-turn allows Uxie to escape from the foe as you find a more appropriate opportunity for Uxie to use dual screens. However, you may choose to use both U-turn and Yawn in order to shuffle around the opposing team and have more of an advantage while setting up, which also means you don't have to sacrifice Uxie's life for Memento.</p>

[Additional Comments]
<p>An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe can be used in order to Speed tie or beat opposing Gliscor and get off another screen or Memento before it Taunts Uxie; however, Uxie then loses out on great bulk. Additionally, Uxie can utilize Stealth Rock to aid in sweeping, but generally Uxie has better things to do. Safeguard is another potential choice: it prevents your sweepers from crippling statuses.</p>

<p>Gliscor is a great partner to Uxie as it can counter Tyranitar, a common switch-in for Uxie. Furthermore, dual screens make Gliscor exceptionally difficult to take down Gliscor. After setting up several Swords Dances and Rock Polishes, Gliscor can then Baton Pass them to a sweeper such as Metagross or Lucario. Alternatively, sweepers mentioned in the previous set, such as Suicune, Jirachi, and Dragonite, all appreciate the additional bulk, as it makes them much harder to take down.</p>

<p>Taunters such as Gliscor and Gyarados have a field day with this set, as they can prevent Uxie from setting up dual screens. Starmie and Vaporeon can switch in and threaten them with their STAB attacks in order to deter them. If Uxie is able to set up at least Reflect, then the Water-types will become harder to take down. Vaporeon can also pass Wishes to Uxie in order to let it set up more screens later in the match.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Due to its access to three different field effect types, Uxie is a great transition Pokemon. It has both the Speed and the defenses to successfully set up the field effects multiple times. Depending on what your team's based around, the appropriate field effect move is chosen. Yawn and U-turn work hand in hand for switching to an appropriate Pokemon to take advantage of the field, while Psychic prevents Uxie from being Taunt bait. Alternatively, Thunderbolt can be used to prevent Pokemon like Skarmory and Empoleon from freely setting up on Uxie.</p>

[Additional Comments]
<p>The given EV spread allows Uxie to break max HP Rotom-A's Substitutes while retaining maximum bulk. If Thunderbolt is used over Psychic, then an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD should be used. Reflect, Light Screen, and Memento can be utilized in order for your Pokemon to set up more easily. A 0 Spe IV U-turn can let your sweepers come in unharmed as Uxie will take the opponent's attack before it switches out.</p>

<p>Obviously, appropriate Pokemon should be used with the appropriate field effect. Sweepers such as Kingdra, Kabutops, and Ludicolo all make excellent Rain Dance abusers, while slower Pokemon such as Machamp, Snorlax, and Rhyperior all work as Trick Room sweepers. Pokemon with Chlorophyll, such as Tangrowth, Victreebel, and Exeggutor, are all great sweepers under Sunny Day because of their additional Speed. However, both rain- and sun-based teams will have to be wary of Tyranitar, as it loves coming in on Uxie. Fortunately for rain teams, Tyranitar fears Surf and Waterfall, but sun teams should have a Pokemon like Infernape that can scare away Tyranitar with a Fighting-type move.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>With a movepool as wide as Uxie's, there are several unmentioned moves. Uxie has the defenses and the Speed to utilize a Calm Mind set, but is generally too weak to actually deal much damage. Grass Knot can hit Pokemon like Swampert and Tyranitar, but you're better off just letting Uxie use U-turn to a partner when faced with such threats. Toxic is an option over Thunder Wave, but Thunder Wave is generally better due to the importance of Speed in OU. Heal Bell can rid the team of status effects, but Uxie frequently has better things to do and is hard pressed for time and moveslots to do so.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gengar, Scizor, and Tyranitar are all Pokemon that can threaten Uxie with their STAB attacks. Gengar can utilize Substitute to block status moves and then attack with Shadow Ball, while Scizor and Tyranitar can hit hard with U-turn and Crunch, respectively. Jirachi also threatens Uxie, as it can use Substitute to block paralysis and has a 4x resistance to Psychic. From there, it can set up Calm Minds to threaten Uxie's team.</p>

<p>Fast Taunters can also handle Uxie with ease. Both Gliscor and Gyarados can utilize Taunt to prevent Uxie from setting up dual screens. from there, Gliscor can spread Toxic over Uxie's team while Gyarados can set up threatening Dragon Dances. Status effects such as poison and paralysis also cripple Uxie, as it really dislikes status. Lastly, any Pokemon that utilizes Brick Break, such as Weavile, can stop Uxie's attempts to set up Reflect and Light Screen.</p>
