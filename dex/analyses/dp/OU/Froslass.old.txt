[Overview]

<p>Froslass is a unique Pokemon, as she is the only Ghost-type Pokemon who can set up Spikes. With this combination, she can set up entry hazards while blocking Rapid Spin at the same time. What also separates her from other supporters is her blistering Speed coupled with Taunt, which effectively blocks attempts to keep Froslass from setting up while preventing opposing Pokemon from setting up their own entry hazards. Froslass also works well on hail teams, as Substitute, Thunder Wave, and Snow Cloak will surely annoy the opponent. Despite all of these advantages, Froslass isn't well equipped to handle the OU metagame due to her common weaknesses and the prevalence of priority moves, especially Bullet Punch. Nevertheless, Froslass is a great choice for offensive teams that require Spikes at the beginning of the game without resorting to the slower Skarmory or Forretress.</p>

[SET]
name: Spikes Lead
move 1: Spikes

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Froslass is a good lead in today's metagame, as her base 110 Speed and immunity to Fake Out and Explosion allow her to fare well against some of the more commonly seen leads. Opposing leads who attempt to set up entry hazards are stopped by Taunt, enabling Froslass to set up her own entry hazards.</p>

<p>Spikes is the main move in this set, causing residual damage whenever the opponent switches Pokemon. Taunt serves the same purpose as in the previous paragraph, while Destiny Bond works well with Taunt to take down the opposing Pokemon. Ice Beam rounds out the set, allowing you to 2HKO Aerodactyl, Azelf, and Hippowdon leads.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Froslass has other viable attacking moves as a lead. Shadow Ball may be used as an alternative STAB attack, allowing you to 2HKO Infernape leads 80% of the time. However, you do lose the KOs on Aerodactyl and Hippowdon. Ice Shard may be used to 2HKO Aerodactyl, and its priority will cause Aerodactyl to either Taunt or set up Stealth Rock before dying; however, KOs on Azelf and Hippowdon are lost. If using Ice Shard, use 252 Attack EVs instead of Special Attack and a Jolly nature. Alternatively, Froslass may set up Spikes mid-game. With an EV spread of 248 HP / 8 SpD / 252 Spe along with Leftovers, she can survive various weaker attacks, such as unboosted Surfs from bulky Water-type Pokemon. She's also different from other Spikes users in that losing her doesn't mean you're losing a key defensive member of your team. Additionally, with Taunt and Ice Beam, opposing Pokemon will be hard pressed to set up, whereas Forretress and Skarmory can be forced out.</p>

<p>Against leads who are slower than Froslass like Swampert and Heatran, leads who try to debilitate you like Roserade and Smeargle, or leads who set up such as Ninjask, Froslass can either Taunt and set up a minimum of one layer of Spikes, gain a Destiny Bond kill, or both depending on if the opponent tried to set up Stealth Rock the first turn. If you forgo the Taunt on the first turn, Froslass gets up a minimum of two layers of Spikes or one layer of Spikes and a Destiny Bond kill. If any lead decides to set up Stealth Rock, that's a minimum of three layers as Froslass goes down, or two layers of Spikes and a kill with Destiny Bond.</p>

<p>Froslass has problems with leads such as Aerodactyl, Azelf, and Jirachi, as their higher Speed allows them to stop Froslass from setting up Spikes. Leads with priority, such as Metagross and Mamoswine, also cause problems for Froslass, as they force Froslass to either Taunt or set up a single layer of Spikes. If he attacks, Tyranitar can kill Froslass in one turn since the sandstorm nullifies Focus Sash. To combat these opposing leads, a variety of Pokemon may be used. To handle Aerodactyl and Azelf, you could attack immediately with Ice Beam, but they'll have accomplished their goal: Taunt the opposing lead and set up their own Stealth Rock. Magnezone and Swampert can handle Jirachi and Metagross. Swampert can also help against Mamoswine, Aerodactyl, and Tyranitar by hitting them with Surf, Earthquake, or Ice Beam. He can also set up Stealth Rock and provide Froslass with Fire-, Steel-, and Rock-type resistances.</p>

<p>While Froslass is a Ghost-type Pokemon, she usually cannot last long enough to switch back later on in the match. This allows Rapid Spinners like Forretress and Starmie to switch in and Spin away your Spikes. Rotom-H makes a good partner to Froslass, as it not only blocks Rapid Spin, but can scare away both Forretress and Starmie with Overheat and STAB Thunderbolt respectively.</p>

[SET]
name: Hail Stall
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Thunder Wave
move 3: Spikes
move 4: Blizzard / Ice Beam / Taunt
item: Leftovers / BrightPowder
nature: Timid
evs: 248 HP / 228 Def / 32 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Froslass can make a reliable lead, you cannot forget about her ability: Snow Cloak. This set combines Snow Cloak and paralysis to cause plenty of stress for your opponent. For example, with the opposing Pokemon paralyzed and hail falling, Froslass will only be hit by a 100% accuracy move 60% of the time. If you can confuse the opponent, either through Froslass running Confuse Ray or some other means, then that brings the chance down to 30%, allowing Froslass to either set up Spikes or attack with her STAB move with near impunity.</p>

<p>Substitute allows you to stall until the opposing Pokemon misses an attack. Thunder Wave slows down the opponent so Froslass can set up a Substitute before it can move and can prevent the opponent from attacking. It also prevents opposing Pokemon who try to use stat up moves from sweeping due to their lower Speed. While Froslass has a Substitute up, she can set up Spikes, which, alongside hail, slowly wear down the enemy. The last slot is for either attacking or more utility if you feel it is necessary. Blizzard takes advantage of the hail due to the accuracy boost it receives. Ice Beam is there for the extra PP and accuracy outside of hail, but is weaker. Taunt is an interesting choice on Froslass, as it prevents opponents from setting up, such as opposing Calm Minders. It also prevents Forretress and Skarmory from setting up entry hazards but prevents Froslass from dealing any damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Leftovers is the recommended item to use on this set. With it, Froslass will be able to recover HP in order to create more Substitutes and restore HP while setting up Spikes. 248 HP EVs give her maximum defensive capabilities and allow her to switch into Stealth Rock four times from full health. 32 Speed EVs allow Froslass to outspeed neutral base 95s such as Electivire and positive base 81s such as Gyarados. The remaining EVs go into Defense to increase Froslass's physical bulk.</p>

<p>Although Leftovers is the main option for this set, BrightPowder may be used as an alternative item. However, it is generally inferior to Leftovers because it does nothing if your opponent is taking the time to set up their own entry hazards or stat boosts. Leftovers allows you to continue healing while your opponent is attempting to set up, letting you make more Substitutes. Confuse Ray can also work in the last slot in order to lower the chance of the opponent hitting Froslass even further.</p>

<p>In order to effectively use this set, pairing Froslass with Abomasnow is absolutely required. His ability, Snow Warning, brings permanent hail onto the battlefield and activates Froslass's ability. However, both Abomasnow and Froslass have trouble with Steel-, Fire-, and Rock-type moves. While Froslass may be able to Thunder Wave Pokemon carrying these moves, she cannot do much else against them. For this reason, Abomasnow should be of the SubPunch variant to take out Steel-type Pokemon or may choose to carry Earthquake to deal with both Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon.</p>

<p>Having both Abomasnow and Froslass on one team creates many weaknesses. Furthermore, basing a team around hail possesses problems in the forms of Tyranitar and Hippowdon, as their ability replaces hail with sandstorm. Fortunately, a bulky Water-type Pokemon can help mitigate these problems, as Water-types resist Fire- and Steel-type moves and scare Tyranitar and Hippowdon away with STAB super effective Surfs. Swampert can set up Stealth Rock, Roar out the opposing Pokemon, and resists all three common weaknesses of Abomasnow and Froslass. Suicune's impressive defenses let it wall both special and physical attacks and can also utilize Roar. Vaporeon can pass Wishes to Froslass and Abomasnow, which is helpful due to the shared Stealth Rock weakness. Tentacruel can easily sponge Fire-type attacks thanks to his Water typing and high Special Defense, as well as Rapid Spin away entry hazards and set up Toxic Spikes. Heatran can use his ability to switch into Fire-type attacks and also resists Steel-type attacks, while Froslass's Ghost typing allows her to switch into Fighting-type moves like Close Combat.</p>

<p>Because this set is not a lead, Froslass can switch in later on in the game to block Rapid Spin. However, she cannot do much against Forretress and Starmie offensively because both of them resist Ice-type attacks and Thunder Wave actually makes Forretress's Gyro Ball stronger. Once again, Rotom-H would make a good partner for reasons mentioned in the previous set. Additionally, Rotom-F would make a good partner due to hail boosting the accuracy of its Blizzards to 100%. However, it has trouble hitting Forretress effectively.</p>

[SET]
Name: Choice Scarf Lead
Move 1: Trick
Move 2: Spikes
Move 3: Destiny Bond
Move 4: Ice Beam
Item: Choice Scarf
Nature: Timid
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Froslass has an excellent Speed stat, which when combined with access to Spikes, makes her an excellent lead. Although she is generally slower than Aerodactyl and Azelf, this set attempts to remedy that by using a Choice Scarf. With the Choice Scarf, she can either cripple the opposing lead or proceed to set up several layers of Spikes.</p>

<p>Trick is a powerful move on this set, as it cripples your opponent's lead. If Froslass is up against Aerodactyl or Azelf, she can Trick the Choice Scarf and lock them into either Taunt or Stealth Rock. If it's a bulky lead, then you've deprived your opponent of a useful late-game tank. Spikes is to take advantage of bulky leads as they switch out if they're locked into Stealth Rock or a weak attacking move. Destiny Bond gives you a free kill when you die, potentially allowing Froslass to cripple one Pokemon and KO another. Ice Beam is a reliable STAB option for 2HKOing Azelf and Aerodactyl leads, along with unboosted Dragon-type Pokemon. Furthermore, it ensures Froslass doesn't become useless if opposing leads Taunt her.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball deserve a mention due to being able to hit Skarmory and Gengar for super effective damage. Thunderbolt can also be used to revenge kill Gyarados should Froslass still have her Choice Scarf. Feel free to use them over Destiny Bond. Additionally, if you keep the Choice Scarf later on in the game, Froslass can be a makeshift revenge killer, KOing +1 Dragon Dance Dragonite along with outspeeding Gengar.</p>

<p>This set is heavily reliant on prediction, and if played incorrectly, can give your opponent an early advantage. Furthermore, several opposing leads cause problems for it. Metagross can just Bullet Punch twice or use Meteor Mash, as Froslass doesn't have a Focus Sash to protect herself from a hit. This means that you either get up one layer of Spikes, face an opposing Choice Scarf Metagross, or begin the game 5-5 with a Destiny Bond KO. Heatran can also be annoying, as Fire Blast OHKOes Froslass. Scizor is also a threat to this set, as Bullet Punch will bypass Froslass's outstanding Speed and Pursuit places Froslass in a checkmate position.</p>

<p>Magnezone is a great partner to this set, as it can kill opposing Metagross who are locked into Meteor Mash or Bullet Punch along with Scizor. Swampert is a handy partner, as its Water typing grants it a resistance to Fire-type moves. It can also get up Stealth Rock for more residual damage. Both of them also resist several types that Froslass fears.</p>

<p>Furthermore, an additional Ghost-type Pokemon is helpful to help keep Spikes on your side of the field. Rotom-H is a great partner to Froslass as it can hit Starmie and Forretress with super effective moves. It also helps scare away Metagross. Rotom-W can be used to scare away Heatran also, but don't go switching it into Fire Blast.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>When considering a Hidden Power type, remember that an unresisted STAB Ice Beam does slightly more than a 2x Hidden Power. Hidden Power Fighting may be used to combat Tyranitar, 2HKOing 0 HP / 0 SpD neutral natured Tyranitar with Stealth Rock down. Unfortunately, it does leave Froslass with a 30 Speed IV, which means she loses to other base 110s like Gengar. Hidden Power Ground can be used for Heatran, as it has a 79% chance of OHKOing 0 HP / 0 SpD negative natured Heatran with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes down. Hidden Power Grass can be used for Swampert, 2HKOing the 252 HP / 0 SpD neutral natured MixPert set. Hidden Power Fire snags an OHKO on any unsuspecting Forretress and Scizor who try to Pursuit, but also leaves Froslass with a 30 Speed IV. Thunderbolt allows you to hit Water-types who resist Ice Beam along with Skarmory, although Starmie would be hit harder by Shadow Ball due to its weakness to Ghost-type moves.</p>

<p>Froslass can also use an offensively oriented set, composed of Ice Beam, Shadow Ball, Thunderbolt, and a Hidden Power or Trick if Froslass is holding a Choice item. However, Gengar is generally a better Pokemon for this, as its higher Special Attack allows it to deal more damage. Froslass can also use a set with Trick to debilitate her opponents and then begin to set up Spikes, but her low defenses make it hard to do so effectively.</p>

<p>As for support options, Light Screen may be used, but Froslass is generally too frail to continuously set them up. Block can be used along with Destiny Bond and Taunt to force a kill, but it is a one-time deal. Snatch can steal a Substitute or stat boosts from your opponent if they try to set up in front of Froslass to avoid Destiny Bond. Swagger can be used over Confuse Ray on the Snow Cloak set in order for the opponent to deal more damage to itself if it hits itself, but its 90% accuracy and the +2 Attack boost it gives to the opposing Pokemon can be dangerous.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Froslass's main counter is Tyranitar, as Sand Stream immediately removes any hail falling on the field, while he can threaten Froslass with Pursuit, Crunch, or Stone Edge. His ability causes a sandstorm, gives him a Special Defense boost and allowing Tyranitar to shrug off any Ice Beams Froslass may try to use. Scizor and Metagross can both come in on Ice Beam or Shadow Ball and bypass Froslass's Speed with Bullet Punch or catch her switching out with Pursuit. Snorlax can Pursuit or Crunch Froslass, depending on if she stays in or not. Also, any faster Taunter can force Froslass to attack and stop using support moves as Substitute does not block Taunt. Slower Taunters have to watch out for Thunder Wave.</p>

<p>As a lead, Azelf and Aerodactyl both shut her down, as their higher Speed coupled with Taunt prevents Froslass from setting up any Spikes. Although Froslass can 2HKO them with Ice Beam, they will have still managed to set up Stealth Rock. On the Snow Cloak set, however, Swampert is a good counter to Froslass because of his immunity to Thunder Wave and neutrality to Blizzard and Ice Beam. Swampert can either Roar away Froslass or attack her with Earthquake or Surf.</p>

<p>Froslass's success is tied to her Speed. If you can inflict paralysis upon her, Froslass will be effectively neutered. Barring that, Bullet Punch, Shadow Sneak, and Sucker Punch all have priority, bypassing Froslass's impressive Speed and scoring super effective damage. Stealth Rock also prevents Froslass from switching in too many times. Since her defenses are not that impressive, hitting Froslass with any neutral attack will cause severe damage to her, most likely causing her to die from another switch-in.</p>
