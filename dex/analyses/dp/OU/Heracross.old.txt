[Overview]

<p>Heracross can be seen as the herald of a dying age, as his basic game style has not changed drastically from when he was first introduced. He has always been offensively-oriented with his base 125 Attack stat, excellent ability in Guts that takes advantage of the burns that terrify most physical sweepers, and high-powered STAB moves. Although his main role has not changed much, he has been blessed with new tools for the job with every generation, such as Close Combat in DPP, and can now fill more roles than ever before.</p>

<p>Despite this, Heracross usage has been constantly spiraling downward as fewer and fewer people use him. Heracross's base 85 Speed is simply not high enough in such a fast-paced metagame, and he is not able to stand up to super effective attacks from omnipresent, faster foes. More and more battlers are choosing faster or more versatile sweepers such as Infernape and Lucario, who both have access to strong priority and higher Speed stats. However, regardless of these shortcomings, Heracross remains one of the very best physical sweepers in the game and should under no circumstances be underestimated. He wasn't banned in Japan during the ADV generation for no reason!</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Heracross's mediocre Speed is a letdown as a sweeper, especially because so much of the metagame can revenge kill him. With a Choice Scarf, Heracross can switch in with his numerous resistances and immediately threaten the opposing Pokemon. However, Heracross's power is relatively limited without either Swords Dance or Choice Band, so predicting appropriately and switching into Toxic or Will-O-Wisp is advisable. With a Guts boost, Choice Scarf Heracross can rip through much of DPP OU like a chainsaw through a loaf of bread.</p>

<p>Close Combat and Megahorn are the high-power STAB attacks for which Heracross is famous. Stone Edge is essential on Heracross, as Heracross's STAB attacks mainly draw in Flying-types such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Gyarados, all of whom are weak to Rock. Heracross has a lot of interesting options available to him for his final attack. Because Heracross is not as powerful when holding a Choice Scarf, bulky Pokemon have no trouble switching into him and forcing him out; Toxic is a nasty surprise for these Pokemon, especially on a Choice set. Night Slash is an option because Rotom-A is one of Heracross's most common switch-ins due to its immunity to Close Combat and resistance to Megahorn. Though Sleep Talk may seem unreliable because it only works if your opponent has a sleep-inducing Pokemon, Heracross can be a dangerous threat with his Guts-boosted attacks when asleep. However, like with Toxic, being locked into Sleep Talk opens up opportunities for the opponent to set up, so use it with caution. Note that Sleep Talk only works once per switch-in with a Choice item.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A simple EV spread of 252 Attack and 252 Speed is standard for a set like this. Jolly is the recommended nature to outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Heatran, Jolly Gyarados after a Dragon Dance, and Modest Empoleon after an Agility, among others. If these threats can be dealt with elsewhere, then Adamant is perfectly acceptable for the Attack boost.</p>

<p>It's important to capitalize on Heracross's unique traits, the most important of those being his Guts ability. For this reason, Pokemon that attract burn or poison status make excellent teammates to consider. Metagross and Swampert are good candidates to fit this role, as the former commonly lures Will-O-Wisp and the latter Toxic. Both of them can also set up Stealth Rock, which helps against the many Flying-types switching into Heracross. Rotom-A and Flying-type Pokemon are issues Heracross will come across frequently, so packing a Pokemon that can easily defeat them is highly recommended. Tyranitar can punch through Zapdos and opposing Rotom-A with relative ease. As an added benefit, most people won't risk Will-O-Wisp with Heracross around, so Tyranitar can generally get in safely. A Rotom-A of your own will help tremendously with Gyarados and Skarmory, while Starmie will help with Flygon and Dragonite.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Close Combat
move 2: Megahorn
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Pursuit / Sleep Talk
item: Choice Band
ability: Guts
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Once Heracross's flagship set, Choice Band Heracross has since lost much of his popularity in favor of variants running Choice Scarf in order to keep up with a faster-than-ever metagame. Unlike Choice Scarf Heracross, however, Choice Band Heracross functions as a wallbreaker that can hopefully open up holes with his massively powerful attacks so that other Pokemon can sweep. Unlike other Choice Band attackers, such as Tyranitar, Heracross actually enjoys being burned by Pokemon like Rotom-A. After a Guts boost, Heracross's Attack stat hits a massive 861 with Adamant or 784 with Jolly.</p>

<p>Close Combat and Megahorn return to form the core of Heracross's attacking options. Stone Edge is mandatory for the Flying-type Pokemon that will inevitably switch into Heracross. Unlike the Choice Scarf set, Pursuit sits comfortably in the last slot, maiming Psychic-types as they flee from Megahorn or Rotom-A after it accidentally burns you. Sleep Talk returns with this set so that Heracross can make a decent switch-in to sleep-inducing moves and subsequently take advantage of the status with Guts-boosted attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Jolly nature is recommended to outspeed Timid Heatran, Jolly Gyarados, and Adamant Lucario, but Adamant can be used for the substantial boost to Attack it provides. This set should always run 252 Speed EVs to at worst tie with Suicune and Kingdra. 252 Attack EVs are mandatory to hit as hard as possible, while carrying a Choice Band should hopefully go without saying.</p>

<p>Luring status for Heracross to switch into is encouraged, as almost nothing can switch into a Guts-boosted attack safely. Rotom-A is the primary user of Will-O-Wisp, and so by using Pokemon that lure it in, such as Metagross or Jirachi, Heracross can absorb the Will-O-Wisp and proceed to Pursuit Rotom-A to death. Stealth Rock support is basically necessary as it helps Heracross wear down the typical Flying-type Pokemon that will inevitably switch into him. Tyranitar is also a very good teammate for Heracross, as he can beat both the Ghost- and Flying-type Pokemon that like to switch into Heracross's STAB attacks. Revenge killing tactics are popular for breaking Heracross, as he's not the fastest Pokemon around. For this reason, it's important to have checks to Pokemon like Choice Scarf Heatran and Infernape. Good examples of such Pokemon are Vaporeon and Starmie.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Close Combat
move 3: Megahorn
move 4: Facade / Night Slash
item: Flame Orb / Toxic Orb
ability: Guts
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Using this set on your team is akin to making a pact with the devil. With a one turn setup that involves tripling Heracross's Attack stat from 349 to 1047 and two 120 Base Power attacks, even things that used to switch into Heracross with impunity can be brutally massacred. Not simply hoping that Guts will activate, and instead activating it yourself, means that this Heracross has considerably more raw power, thus exchanging survivability for the potential to crush his standard counters.</p>

<p>Swords Dance, Close Combat, and Megahorn are all standard fare for Heracross. As this set is guaranteed a status affliction, though, Heracross can use a deadly new weapon: Facade. After a Swords Dance, it OHKOes Weezing, Gliscor, and even bulky Gyarados after Intimidate with Stealth Rock damage. Night Slash is an option for the last slot because it is necessary to beat Rotom-A; Facade is the superior option against basically everything else, though.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Flame Orb activates Guts, which is necessary for this set. Toxic Orb can be used for a more hit-and-run approach to using this set, whereas Flame Orb is less damaging over many turns. As a sweeper, Heracross is just begging for 252 Attack and Speed EVs. A Jolly nature is best here for outspeeding Timid Heatran. If, for some reason, you don't feel like abusing a Herculean 1047 Attack stat, you can give Heracross a Life Orb. If by God's good graces Heracross gets burned with a Life Orb equipped, even Pokemon like defensive Rotom-A are OHKOed by a resisted Megahorn at the cost of 22.5% of Heracross's HP per turn.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock is utterly necessary for guaranteeing OHKOs against max Defense Skarmory, Forretress, Hippowdon, Bronzong, and all bulky Water-type Pokemon. Dual screen support can ease Heracross's setup as well. Pokemon like Uxie, Azelf, and Jirachi are good candidates for the job as they can accomplish any of these things. Since Heracross is a slow beetle, having switch-ins for the omnipresent faster threats is important. Pokemon like Choice Scarf Heatran, Flygon, and Jirachi are all issues, as well as priority abusers like Scizor. A Heatran of your own makes a good partner for his ability to switch into Fire-type attacks with impunity, his 4x resistance to Scizor's Bullet Punch and Jirachi's Iron Head, and his resistance to Flygon's Outrage. Tyranitar makes another good partner for his ability to beat Rotom-A if you pass on Night Slash. Tyranitar can also take on Fire-type attacks with relative ease, although he should be wary of Steel-type attacks from Scizor and Jirachi.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Megahorn
move 3: Low Kick
move 4: Stone Edge
item: Leftovers
ability: Guts
nature: Jolly
evs: 208 HP / 104 Atk / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Heracross has another stat-boosting move available to it in the form of Bulk Up. While this set is not as immediately threatening as the Swords Dance or Choice Band varieties, it can still become a dangerous sweeping force that is very difficult to stop when played correctly.</p>

<p>Megahorn is an excellent STAB attack and goes without saying, while Close Combat is not used on this set despite its power. Close Combat reduces Heracross's defenses, which is counterproductive to the goal of this set. Instead of Close Combat, Low Kick is recommended to hit most of DPP OU fairly hard. Brick Break is an option over Low Kick for hitting certain Pokemon like Blissey harder and breaking screens, but Low Kick is almost always superior. Stone Edge finishes off the set by beating those pesky Flying-types that always seem to like switching into Heracross. Rotom-A is hit fairly hard by a boosted Stone Edge as well.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs on this set offer Heracross his highest Leftovers threshold and enough Speed with a Jolly nature to outrun Adamant Lucario and Timid, non-Choice Scarf Heatran. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack for higher damage output. An Adamant nature can be used with less Speed, but being able to outspeed Heatran means one less counter to eliminate before attempting a sweep. Leftovers is the primary item for giving Heracross more durability over time and an easier time setting up over multiple turns.</p>

<p>Many of Heracross's common counters are defeated by this set because of its ability to switch moves and power up Heracross's defenses. Gyarados, Zapdos, and Gliscor are among the most common switch-ins, and are unable to defeat this set (without running uncommon Flying-type attacks) because Bulk Up and Stone Edge will break through their defenses. Rotom-A is defeated as well, provided it does not carry Overheat, as it will be unable to dispatch Heracross before he gets too many Bulk Ups. Scizor will also have more trouble revenge killing Heracross with the added Defense. This set still has problems with faster sweepers that have super effective special attacks, though, such as Infernape, Choice Scarf Heatran, and Azelf. A bulky Gyarados will handle the former two, while Azelf can be dealt with by Tyranitar or Starmie. In general, like most slower sturdier sweepers, paralysis support and residual damage are both highly recommended.</p>

[SET]
name: Mono-Attacker
move 1: Megahorn
move 2: Bulk Up
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
item: Leftovers
ability: Guts
nature: Careful
evs: 252 HP / 40 Atk / 216 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>It is amusing that a clearly offensive Pokemon like Heracross can have such a successful defensive set. Heracross has respectable special bulk, and with Bulk Up, Rest, and Sleep Talk, can keep himself healthy and continue to set up or attack while asleep. This Heracross is surprisingly difficult to break without super effective attacks, and that can turn him into a deadly sweeper if he is allowed to gather multiple Bulk Up boosts.</p>

<p>Heracross's attack of choice for a set like this is Megahorn. Megahorn is a high Base Power, respectable PP attack that nothing is immune to, which goes a long way in explaining why it is chosen as Heracross's only attacking move. Bulk Up is the crux of what makes this set viable, as it compensates for Heracross's weak physical bulk and simultaneously boosts his attacking power. Rest and Sleep Talk combine to keep Heracross healthy as he continues to boost in his sleep. Serendipitously, Rest putting Heracross to sleep activates Guts and boosts his Attack further. After a couple of boosts, Guts can function as the equivalent of a +2 or even a +4 boost, making Megahorn absolutely eviscerate whatever it hits, even if it is resisted.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is geared towards maximizing Heracross's unboosted special bulk. With 252 HP and 216 Special Defense along with a Careful nature, Heracross has the ability to survive two Heat Waves from defensive Zapdos. The remaining 40 EVs are placed into Attack to give Heracross's Megahorn a bit more power. If you want even more power, using an Adamant nature instead of a Careful nature is acceptable, but the lost Special Defense prevents Heracross from setting up as easily against special threats.</p>

<p>Heracross is capable of setting up on many popular special attackers, such as Rotom-A, Vaporeon, and defensive Starmie. Despite that, the largest threats to this set are those Pokemon that 4x resist Bug-type attacks. It is therefore imperative that teammates are chosen to beat Heatran, Skarmory, and Lucario. An offensive Suicune with Hydro Pump and Hidden Power Electric can handle all three of these Pokemon and resists Heracross's Fire-type weakness. A well-played Infernape can also deal with the aforementioned threats, while a Rotom-H can deal with both Skarmory and Lucario. Paralysis support from the likes of Jirachi, Celebi, and Snorlax also goes a long way in helping this Heracross set up and sweep more easily.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute + 3 Attacks
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Close Combat
move 3: Megahorn
move 4: Stone Edge / Night Slash
item: Leftovers
ability: Guts
nature: Jolly
evs: 16 HP / 240 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Heracross has a lot of trouble with prediction, especially considering that such a diverse array of Pokemon can reliably switch into and threaten him. Once Heracross sets up a Substitute as the opponent switches to a response, Heracross can pick his poison to beat whatever was sent out.</p>

<p>Substitute affords Heracross the buffer of a free turn to pick an appropriate attack against the opponent's switch-in. Close Combat and Megahorn form the crux of Heracross's offensive presence. The last move, one of either Stone Edge or Night Slash, allows Heracross to beat a specific subset of his common switch-ins. Stone Edge will hit Flying-types like Gyarados, Dragonite, and Zapdos for massive damage, while Night Slash will hit Rotom-A and Gengar hard.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>16 HP EVs sit Heracross comfortably at a Leftovers number, while 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow him to outpace Timid Heatran, Jolly Gyarados, neutral-nature Rotom-A, and Speed tie with offensive Suicune. The remaining 240 EVs are placed in Attack for Heracross to pack the punch he's known for. Leftovers adds to Heracross's survivability and also replenishes the HP that Substitute steals away when used, enabling Heracross to keep utilizing his strategy over the course of a match.</p>

<p>Depending upon the move taken in Heracross's last slot, this set will run into trouble with the Pokemon that would be covered by the other move choice. If Stone Edge is chosen, strong Pursuit users such as Tyranitar and Scizor are recommended to help dispose of Rotom-A and Gengar. If, however, Night Slash was taken, Tyranitar is again recommended for his ability to beat down Flying-type Pokemon. Defensive Zapdos and Rotom-A also work well for this purpose, although they will have trouble with Zapdos and Gliscor depending on their movesets. A bulky Water-type, like Vaporeon, can function well with a Night Slash variant of Heracross for her ability to beat Gyarados and Gliscor.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Heracross lacks anything else impressive in his movepool besides what is listed in his sets. Earthquake is great move, but has mostly redundant coverage with STAB Fighting-type attacks. Shadow Claw is pretty much the same as Night Slash, but Night Slash is always better because a type is immune to Shadow Claw. Other than these two attacks, just use what the sets suggest for moves.</p>

<p>Swarm can be used over Guts on any of the listed sets, especially those that use Substitute. Swarm is almost always inferior to Guts, though, simply because one of Heracross's greatest assets is his benefiting from burn status. Leftovers can also be given to basically any set to increase Heracross's durability, but the loss of power allows many more Pokemon than usual to check Heracross, reducing his usability to almost unbearable levels.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Heracross is cursed with one of the largest checks and counters list in all of DPP OU, and this is reflected in his ever-dropping usage. Zapdos, Gliscor, Gyarados, Dragonite, Rotom-A, Tentacruel, and Gengar all resist both of Heracross's STAB moves. Beyond that, there exist many Pokemon that can switch into a predicted Close Combat or Megahorn with impunity and immediately threaten Heracross before he can change attacks. Choice Scarf Heatran and even Infernape can come in on Megahorn and end him harshly with Fire Blast. Skarmory can come in on Megahorn and either threaten to OHKO Heracross with Brave Bird or set up on him if he doesn't have Attack boosts. Faster Psychic-type Pokemon like Azelf can come in on Close Combat and threaten a Fire Blast or an Explosion. One of the most important things to know when facing a Heracross is that despite his low usage and his easily walled STABs, it is a fool's mistake to discredit him offensively. He is one of the strongest Pokemon around, and under no circumstances should you forget that.</p>
