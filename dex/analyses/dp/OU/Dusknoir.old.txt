[Overview]

<p>Probably the most unnecessary evolution of DPP, Dusknoir is about as good as Dusclops was in the previous generation. The extra Attack helps it in a few places, such as in countering Gyarados by using Thunder Punch, but Dusknoir sorely misses good STAB. Generally, it is relegated to Dusclops's old duties, namely spinblocking, spreading burn with Will-O-Wisp, and countering a few specific sweepers. However, Spiritomb and Rotom-A give it significant competition for the role of a spinblocker, and it generally loses to Rotom-H.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Dusknoir faces serious competition for the role of spinblocker from Rotom-A, it is more than capable of functioning as an effective spinblocker on its own merits. It boasts some significant advantages over the electronic appliance, most notably better defenses. There are three effective Rapid Spin users in the OU metagame: Starmie, Forretress, and Tentacruel. The latter two have no hope of breaking through Dusknoir's impressive defenses; it is only Starmie that needs special consideration. Starmie doesn't threaten Dusknoir much unless it is carrying Choice Specs, as Dusknoir can otherwise hit Starmie with Thunder Punch or STAB Shadow Sneak, both of which are super effective, or leech Starmie's HP whilst replenishing its own with Pain Split.</p>

<p>Dusknoir also makes a handy counter to many physical attackers, as it can either burn them with Will-O-Wisp or take them down with the appropriate attack. In particular, Will-O-Wisp cripples common Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar and Metagross. Pain Split is a rather poor method of healing, but it's all Dusknoir has outside of the very risky Rest. Nevertheless, Dusknoir can use its ridiculously low HP and Speed to its advantage by taking hits from high HP opponents and sapping their health while recovering its own.</p>

<p>Earthquake is one of Dusknoir's strongest attacks and provides good coverage overall. Specifically, it easily deals with Heatran, who would otherwise happily switch in on Will-O-Wisp and Fire Punch for a Flash Fire boost, and also 2HKOes Infernape. Ice Punch helps with Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Flygon, and has great type coverage alongside Earthquake; the combination of Earthquake and Ice Punch is resisted only by Bronzong in OU. Alternatively, Fire Punch takes out Weavile and prevents Heracross from utilizing Guts to sponge Will-O-Wisp and eliminating Dusknoir with Pursuit. It hits Steel-types--especially Scizor and Forretress--super effectively as well, but note that it will neither OHKO the former nor 2HKO the latter. Thunder Punch, as previously mentioned, 2HKOes Gyarados.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs focus on Defense as most of the Pokemon Dusknoir should look to counter are physical attackers, such as Heracross and Gyarados. 28 Attack EVs guarantees that Dusknoir's Earthquake OHKOes 4/0 Heatran with Stealth Rock support.  Shadow Sneak is another good option here. By bypassing Dusknoir's awful Speed stat, it can help finish off weakened frail Pokemon, and most notably 2HKOes Gengar. However, due to low Base Power, it will do little damage to even frail sweepers unless they are weak to Ghost-type attacks. Nonetheless, if running Shadow Sneak, you might wish to consider a spread of 252 HP / 172 Def / 84 SpD, which guarantees Dusknoir survives Timid Life Orb Gengar's Shadow Ball.</p>

<p>If Tyranitar and Weavile switch in and manage to avoid Will-O-Wisp, Dusknoir will be in for a world of a pain; Choice Band Tyranitar's Crunch has about a 20% chance to OHKO Dusknoir. Scizor, Machamp, and Thick Fat Hariyama make good back-ups as they take little from the duo's STAB attacks, though Machamp will have to watch out for Weavile's Ice Punch. Forretress and Metagross completely wall Weavile as well, and fare decently against Tyranitar. Bulky Ground-types also counter Tyranitar well, and Swampert can beat both Tyranitar and Weavile. Heatran and Zapdos can beat Scizor reliably. Heracross is very problematic if it gets a Guts boost from Dusknoir's Will-O-Wisp. Gliscor and bulky Gyarados work well here, and the latter also helps against Weavile and Scizor. Heatran makes another great counter to Weavile and Scizor as long as it avoids Superpower and Brick Break from the duo. Note that it is often wise to double switch against Pursuit users so that Dusknoir doesn't have to eat a Pursuit while switching out. Lastly, If Dusknoir lacks Earthquake, Heatran will be its biggest problem. Blissey and bulky Water-types patch up this hole, as they wall even Flash Fire-boosted Heatran.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Trick Room sets Dusknoir apart from other Ghost-types. Dusknoir is an excellent Trick Room supporter, as it is both slow and extraordinarily bulky. The strategy is straightforward enough: switch in on something that poses little threat to Dusknoir, such as bulky Fighting-types and most defensive Pokemon, set up Trick Room, then switch out to a slow sweeper that can take advantage of the three remaining turns of Trick Room.</p>

<p>Will-O-Wisp is a great move to have on a Trick Room team, as it not only weakens defensive Pokemon so that your sweepers can break through them, but also cripples threatening attackers, most notably Tyranitar, who is an extremely common switch-in to Dusknoir. In Trick Room, Dusknoir can always use Will-O-Wisp before Tyranitar can use Crunch. Pain Split provides Dusknoir with some instant, albeit unreliable, recovery, and if Dusknoir chooses its Pain Split targets carefully, it should be able to stick around for quite a while and set up Trick Room multiple times. Earthquake and Shadow Punch are both solid attacking moves, and the latter in particular hits Heatran that might come in to steal a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With a Relaxed nature and a Speed IV of 0, Dusknoir sits at a very slow 85 Speed, meaning it will outspeed the vast majority of opponents in Trick Room and can get some quick recovery with Pain Split. Move 28 EVs from Defense into Attack if Dusknoir selects Earthquake in order to land the OHKO on Heatran after Stealth Rock. There are many other attacking that can go in the last slot, though. Shadow Sneak's priority is still sometimes useful in Trick Room, and it is definitely preferable to Shadow Punch in normal field conditions. However, the greater Base Power of Shadow Punch is preferable in Trick Room. Otherwise, if Scizor, Dragonite, or Gyarados gives your team trouble, you can use the appropriate elemental punch in that slot to help deal with the specific threat.</p>

<p>As with the Tank set, this Dusknoir fears Pursuit users and Dark-types, particularly Tyranitar, Weavile, Scizor, and Heracross, as well as Heatran. Worse still, only a few Pokemon who can wall these threats gain a major benefit from Trick Room. A Tyranitar of your own is your best choice against Heatran, while Scizor, Machamp, and Rhyperior work well against Tyranitar and Weavile. Metagross can survive any of Heracross's attacks and outspeed it in Trick Room, and comfortably beat Tyranitar and Weavile as well. Finally, Wish support is a good idea if Dusknoir forgoes Pain Split.</p>

[SET]
name: Gravity
move 1: Gravity
move 2: Dynamic Punch / Earthquake
move 3: Will-O-Wisp
move 4: Pain Split / Shadow Sneak
item: Leftovers
nature: Relaxed
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Gravity is Dusknoir's biggest niche move. Not only is it the only Ghost-type Pokemon and one of the very few Pokemon overall that have access to the move, Dusknoir can also use it well, especially if given Spikes and Toxic Spikes support. Dynamic Punch is Dusknoir's main attacking move. Under Gravity, it has 82% accuracy, and therefore an 82% chance to cause confusion in addition to a solid 100 Base Power. The confusion works well with Will-O-Wisp, which has 100% accuracy in Gravity, as a turn of confusion damage means another turn of burn damage, even if burn does halve confusion damage. However, Earthquake is an option over Dynamic Punch as it hits every single Pokemon under Gravity, and it has double the PP of Dynamic Punch. Pain Split is the recommended last move as it helps keep Dusknoir alive, but Shadow Sneak remains an option to finish off weakened Pokemon and hit frail Psychic- and Ghost-types for decent damage. Shadow Sneak also has perfect type coverage alongside Dynamic Punch.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Tyranitar and Weavile will have to think twice before switching in thanks to Dynamic Punch, but they are still problematic, especially as Dusknoir has to first set up Gravity. Swampert can wall them, nonetheless. Heracross and Scizor, on the other hand, are even more threatening as this Dusknoir lacks Fire Punch. Heatran can take Bug-type attacks from the latter two, and Dusknoir's typing deters the two from using the Fighting-type moves Heatran fears. Finally, Blissey can wall Heatran. If Dusknoir lacks Shadow Sneak, it will have a hard time with Ghost- and Flying-types, as well as Levitate users. Blissey can wall Ghost-types, although it must watch out for Trick and Rest, while Tyranitar can beat Ghost-types, most Flying-types, and most Levitate Pokemon; Choice Band variants can punish Trick users severely with Pursuit. As a bonus, all of the aforementioned teammates can take advantage of Gravity in one way or another.</p>

[SET]
name: SubPunch

evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Once again, this is a set that sets Dusknoir apart from its bulky Ghost brethren. This set uses Dusknoir's immunities to easily switch in and set up a Substitute, and then deal large damage to Dusknoir's usual counters from Dusknoir's often-underestimated Attack stat and its impressive physical movepool. In particular, Focus Punch outright OHKOes Tyranitar, a common switch-in to Dusknoir.</p>

<p>The choice between Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak is difficult. Despite the lack of STAB on Sucker Punch, it is still more powerful than STAB Shadow Sneak, and Sucker Punch's greater power allows Dusknoir to OHKO the likes of Gengar and Alakazam. However, Sucker Punch will fail if your opponent chooses not to attack Dusknoir, and it has a maximum of 8 PP. The choice between Fire Punch and Ice Punch, on the other hand, depends on who you want Dusknoir to beat: Heracross or Dragonite. As Heracross almost will never hesitate to switch in, Substitute + Fire Punch can be used to severely cripple it. Substitute will force the frequently Choice-locked Heracross to reveal its hand, and Fire Punch will OHKO it after a bit of residual damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An Attack stat of 323 is needed to always OHKO 4/252 Blissey with Focus Punch, always 2HKO 252/216+ Forretress with Fire Punch, and always OHKO 4/0 Alakazam with Sucker Punch, the former two with Stealth Rock support. This Dusknoir has 328 Attack, which is slightly more than necessary, but the EVs are better invested in Attack than Defense as this Dusknoir wants to deal as much damage as possible with Focus Punch. One could run 84 Speed EVs to outpace uninvested Blissey so as to put up a Substitute before Blissey can use Toxic. Thunder Punch can be considered if you fear Gyarados setting up on Dusknoir. Pain Split is also an option to stall your opponent, and can be useful to recover HP lost from creating Substitutes.</p>

<p>This set will never break strong physical walls. Cresselia, bulky Ground-types, and bulky Water-types all laugh at Dusknoir thanks to their gigantic defenses. Tyranitar and Scizor can take out Cresselia, and Celebi the Ground- and Water-types. Skarmory shrugs off Focus Punch and Fire Punch, and can simply set up Spikes on Dusknoir, so Magnezone support is recommended. Dusknoir has nothing to take out Gyarados if it lacks Thunder Punch, so Porygon2 and Celebi are helpful. If Fire Punch is absent, Heracross and Forretress will have no problems against this set; bulky Gyarados can beat them both. Without Ice Punch, Dragonite is problematic. Swampert checks it well, and also walls the Ground-types that Dusknoir cannot beat.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Focus Punch
move 2: Shadow Sneak / Sucker Punch
move 3: Fire Punch / Ice Punch / Thunder Punch
move 4: Trick
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Dusknoir's movepool and respectable base Attack stat make it a viable user of Choice Band. Although slow, Dusknoir packs quite a punch and has the ability to counter many Pokemon depending on its choice of moves. Focus Punch lands an easy OHKO on Tyranitar, Weavile, and Heatran, and is Dusknoir's strongest attack, but requires good prediction. Shadow Sneak gives Dusknoir a STAB priority move with which to OHKO Gengar, Azelf, and Alakazam. Alternatively, Sucker Punch has good synergy with Focus Punch and makes your opponent struggle to decide whether or not he should attack. However, Sucker Punch's usage is very situational and could easily backfire, especially considering its meager 8 PP.</p>

<p>The last two moves should depend on how you want Dusknoir to function. The elemental punches will all hit specific targets depending on your needs: Fire Punch Heracross, Forretress, and Scizor; Ice Punch Dragon-types and Gliscor; and Thunder Punch Gyarados and bulky Waters. Trick is an interesting option that Dusknoir can use to cripple some of its counters, most notably Spiritomb. Most of Dusknoir's counters aren't physical attackers and hence don't fear Will-O-Wisp, and many will not enjoy the burden of the Choice Band. Trick also forces switches, which might allow Dusknoir to fire off a free Focus Punch. However, it is worth noting that Dusknoir's power will be reduced after it Tricks its Choice Band onto an opposing Pokemon. Do not feel that Dusknoir has to use Trick, though; another elemental punch can viably go in the last slot.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Brick Break and Earthquake are usable alternatives to Focus Punch if you don't like prediction, but they come with huge drops in power.</p>

<p>This set possesses more power than the SubPunch set does, but it still can't break physically defensive walls outside of Trick. Good teammates are, once again, Tyranitar and Scizor for Cresselia, Celebi for bulky Ground- and Water-types, Magnezone for Steel-types, and Porygon2 for Gyarados. The locking effect of a Choice item makes Dusknoir very susceptible to Pursuit users, so it's important that you can reliably deal with these. Swampert, Hariyama, and Metagross fare well against Tyranitar and Weavile, Gliscor and bulky Gyarados work similarly against Heracross, as do Magnezone and Swampert against Metagross.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Dusknoir can use a Rest + Sleep Talk combo to good effect, but Rotom-A boasts better typing, movepool, and stats for such a set. Toxic can take the place of Will-O-Wisp on any of the sets, but Toxic can be used on almost any defensive Pokemon, and Dusknoir desperately needs Will-O-Wisp to keep opposing physical attackers at bay. Calm Mind is usable, but Spiritomb is more suited for this job thanks to its typing and higher Special Attack. Counter can surprise powerful physical attackers, such as Heracross looking to 2HKO Dusknoir. Just don't overuse it, as Dusknoir isn't an ideal user of the move with its pitiful HP.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Dusknoir might be able to cripple them with Will-O-Wisp or a super effective attack, but if they get in unscratched, Dusknoir has real trouble with Pursuit users, namely Tyranitar, Weavile, and Heracross. As Dusknoir is often without Brick Break or Focus Punch, Tyranitar can usually switch in more safely than the others. Heracross, however, can get a Guts boost from Will-O-Wisp and do some serious damage. Houndoom's Pursuit is a lot less threatening due to its lower Attack stat, but it can absorb Fire attacks and hammer Dusknoir with either Dark Pulse or a Flash Fire-boosted attack.</p>

<p>Heatran is a significant problem for Dusknoir that lack Earthquake or Focus Punch, as it can come in on any other attack and deal high damage with its Fire attacks, especially if it gets a Flash Fire boost. Spiritomb won't take much damage from any of Dusknoir's attacks and can easily beat it with Dark Pulse. Taunt + Dragon Dance Gyarados can set up on Dusknoir that lack Thunder Punch. In fact, most Taunt users can cause problems if they aren't weak to Dusknoir's attacks. Finally, Toxic and Will-O-Wisp will greatly hinder Dusknoir's tanking capabilities if it doesn't have Rest.</p>
