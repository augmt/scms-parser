[Overview]

<p>Jolteon has blisteringly good Speed and great Special Attack, although he is often overlooked due to being easily stopped and having a weakness to Earthquake. However, if you play to his strengths, he can be a very effective sweeper, even in today's metagame.</p>

<p>Jolteon can pull off a variety of different sets, ranging from an all-out sweeper to a slightly less offensive team support set, or anything in between. With access to one of the fastest Baton Passes, as well as one of the strongest Electric-type attacks in OU, Jolteon can be very effective if he is used correctly.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Thunderbolt

item: Choice Specs

evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Jolteon's high Speed and good Special Attack allow him to utilize a Choice Specs set effectively. With maximum EV investment and Choice Specs, Thunderbolt can OHKO max HP / Max SpD Calm Togekiss 80% of the time with Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Grass is used to OHKO the likes of Swampert and Mamoswine, since Thunderbolt can always 2HKO Specially Defensive Dragonite.</p>

<p>Baton Pass may seem like an odd move for a Choice sweeper, but combined with Jolteon's high Speed, it makes for an effective scouting maneuver. Being able to switch Jolteon out for free and bring in an appropriate response to your opponent's switch-in is very helpful. This will help ease prediction the next time Jolteon switches in, which is vital considering Jolteon's frailty.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Hidden Power Ice can be used over Hidden Power Grass to hit Flygon and Gliscor, since neither is 2HKOed by any of your other moves and pose a threat with their STAB Earthquake. Hidden Power Ice also guarantees an OHKO on all Dragonite, even specially bulky variants, although Swampert and Mamoswine become bigger problems since you lack Hidden Power Grass. Signal Beam can be used over Shadow Ball to do more damage to Celebi and Tyranitar, although Shadow Ball is generally more effective since it has better power and coverage.</p>

<p>As with any special sweeper, Jolteon is stopped by Blissey and Snorlax due to their high Special Defense. Tyranitar is also a threat, as he can come in on Shadow Ball or Hidden Power Ice and threaten an OHKO with Earthquake. Electivire can also prove problematic, taking a Thunderbolt and potentially sweeping your team afterwards. A Tyranitar of your own can be beneficial with his ability to Pursuit the likes of Blissey and Celebi while outright OHKOing Electivire. Swampert, on the other hand, can set up Stealth Rock, counter Gliscor and Flygon with Ice Beam, and beat Electivire with Earthquake so long as it doesn't carry Hidden Power Grass.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Charge Beam

move 4: Shadow Ball

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Jolteon can abuse Charge Beam to raise his Special Attack 63% of the time when he uses the move. Life Orb, if he gets a Special Attack boost, makes him stronger and more versatile than the Choice Specs set with the ability to change attacks. Despite this, you shouldn't be spamming Charge Beam haphazardly, since Jolteon is only aiming to grab one boost. This set is very much like a normal Life Orb attacker; when you bring Jolteon in on a revenge kill, that's the best time to use Charge Beam. Thunderbolt is your main STAB attack, so you shouldn't be using Charge Beam all of the time.</p>

<p>Life Orb is what defines this set, since after a Charge Beam boost, Jolteon will have a 1.95x boost to all of his attacks. The recoil isn't much of a problem either, since in OU, Jolteon is outsped only by Ninjask and random Choice Scarf users, while he ties with other Jolteon and Aerodactyl. Hidden Power Grass is the main option since the likes of Mamoswine and Swampert will provide the most trouble. After a Charge Beam boost, Shadow Ball will 2HKO Gliscor and Flygon, although you must watch out for Earthquake on Choice Scarf Flygon, since he outspeeds you.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Again, Blissey and Snorlax are problems, and trying to accumulate more Charge Beam boosts to break through isn't recommended without Substitute. Electivire also troubles this set, since if he absorbs Charge Beam, you don't earn a Special Attack boost and he gains a Motor Drive boost instead. Weakened Tyranitar can be dealt with after by a boosted Thunderbolt, but full health Tyranitar is still threatening. Starmie is a great partner since it can OHKO Swampert using Grass Knot and with Hydro Pump, can OHKO and 2HKO Gliscor and Tyranitar respectively. Naturally, avoid Ground-types switching in on Charge Beam.</p>

<p>Hidden Power Ice is once again an option over Hidden Power Grass to hit Flygon and Dragonite on the switch and to try and OHKO Gliscor. If you want to try and beat Pokemon like Blissey, Substitute can be used over Thunderbolt. Substitute also provides a buffer against status and allows Jolteon to scout for Flygon or Electivire before trying to score a boost; however, it leaves the inaccurate and weaker Charge Beam as your only STAB attack.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Grass
move 4: Thunderbolt
item: Leftovers

evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Jolteon is the second fastest user of the Substitute + Baton Pass strategy, and he can provide great support to many sweepers, since the buffer of a Substitute gives them a better chance to set up. Thunderbolt is the mandatory STAB attack of choice. Hidden Power Ice is chosen for exceptional coverage with Thunderbolt and because with a Substitute, you will have a better chance of removing Flygon and Gliscor before Baton Passing. In addition to this, the standard targets of Hidden Power Grass, Swampert and Mamoswine, aren't OHKOed without a boost.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set is a lot harder to counter since Hidden Power Ice can OHKO the likes of Flygon and Dragonite, and if Mamoswine or Swampert comes in, Jolteon can easily Baton Pass away. However, if you manage to Roar Jolteon before he can Baton Pass, then the strategy is disrupted. If Jolteon doesn't use Substitute on the switch, most Choice Scarf Pokemon can make quick work of it. The set can opt for 252 HP / 24 SpD / 232 Spe, as this allows the Substitute to survive Celebi's Grass Knot or Blissey's Ice Beam, but the drop in power is generally not worth it.</p>

<p>Generally, the best receivers for Jolteon's Substitutes are Pokemon who either resist or are immune to Earthquake, since that is the most common attack aimed at Jolteon. Dragon Dance Gyarados and Dragonite are especially great partners since they benefit from the lack of Flygon and Gliscor. Breloom and Lucario also make good recipients, being able to scare away Blissey and Snorlax.</p>

<p>Despite being outclassed by Hidden Power Ice, Hidden Power Grass can be used since the removal of Swampert will benefit the above sweepers when they set up. Charge Beam and Wish can be used for more support, but generally will have trouble finding a spot over Thunderbolt or Hidden Power.</p>

[SET]
name: Yawn
move 1: Yawn
move 2: Protect / Substitute
move 3: Thunderbolt
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Ice
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although a respectable force in OU, Jolteon is often quickly shut down by Blissey, or other Pokemon who resist or are immune to his attacks. This set aims to avoid being put in an awkward position by forcing the opponent to fight Jolteon with their secondary checks. The strategy is simple, force a switch using Jolteon's offensive presence and use Yawn on the switch-in. Normally, this will be a faster, Choice Scarf-equipped Pokemon aiming to gain momentum or KO Jolteon. Use Protect after Yawn to block any attacks. If, instead of Protect, you are using Substitute, only use it if Jolteon is faster than your opponent's Pokemon. If Jolteon is slower, switch out. Substitute is particularly useful if your opponent switches a second time to avoid falling asleep from Yawn. If your opponent stays in, however, they will fall asleep and be easily taken advantage of by Jolteon or one of your other Pokemon. Teams only tend to carry one solid check for Jolteon, so if said check gets slept, Jolteon's usefulness increases tenfold.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Yawn and Protect form the sleep-inducing combo that is key to this set, while the rest of Jolteon's moves are dedicated to capitalizing on his good power and coverage. Thunderbolt is the obligatory STAB attack, while Hidden Power Grass is used to hit Swampert. Hidden Power Ice can be used instead to hit Flygon and Gliscor, but it is often better to let another one of your Pokemon take advantage of these sleeping foes instead of going for the kill. The EVs are as simple as can be, with investment focused in Special Attack and Speed, as is standard for most Jolteon. Though all variations of Jolteon are made more potent with entry hazard support, this set becomes especially destructive. Yawn will undoubtedly force many switches, racking up entry hazard damage and enabling a clean late-game sweep. Baton Pass can be used to switch to an appropriate counter to whomever your opponent switches in. This is especially useful if Jolteon can safely set up a Substitute. Shadow Ball can be used over Hidden Power to hit Rotom-A for decent damage, but it is often not worth the loss in coverage. Another option is Wish, but due to Jolteon's general frailty, it is not recommended.</p>

<p>Dragonite makes a fantastic partner for this set. Choice Scarf Flygon is a primary check for Dragon Dance Dragonite, and with it fast asleep, Dragonite is free to sweep. Jolteon can also easily eliminate problem Pokemon for Dragonite, such as Skarmory and, if using Hidden Power Grass, Swampert. Dragonite also has a handy immunity to Ground-type attacks, Jolteon's sole weakness. Lucario also benefits from this set's sleeping capabilities, though it lacks the type synergy that Dragonite and Jolteon possess. Jolteon can put Hippowdon to sleep, who would otherwise reliably check Lucario. As with every Jolteon set, Blissey utterly walls it. As if to make matters worse, Blissey also has Natural Cure to get rid of sleep as it switches out. Blissey can be dealt with by powerful Pursuit users such as Scizor and Tyranitar. If using Hidden Power Ice, Swampert will cause some problems, even if it gets put to sleep. RestTalk Rotom-A can also absorb sleep and is not 3HKOed by any of Jolteon's attacks.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Wish, Agility, and Charge Beam are all options Jolteon can Baton Pass, but Jolteon is severely outclassed when attempting to pass each of these. Jolteon also has Roar, but its negative priority coupled with Jolteon's frailty makes it an unattractive option. Yawn can be used to support the team and help with passing Substitutes, but it is hard to find room for it. Jolteon can even run its own Substitute + 3 Attacks set, although this has lackluster power and is easy to work around without Charge Beam. Thunder can be used in tandem with a Rain Dance team, since Jolteon learns Rain Dance and has an Electric-type immunity. In terms of EVs, Jolteon can afford to slip down to 392 Speed, since that puts it above +1 Adamant Gyarados, although the leftover EVs aren't better placed anywhere else. Jolteon can run 232 Speed EVs to hit a stat of 374, outspeeding everyone who isn't Choice Scarfed bar Weavile and Aerodactyl, but again, there isn't much use for the extra EVs. </p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The Baton Pass set is difficult to counter directly since it will just Baton Pass at the first sign of danger; however, the sweeper sets are easier to stop. It depends on which Hidden Power Jolteon is carrying - Hidden Power Ice means Swampert and Mamoswine can stop him with ease, while Hidden Power Grass means Flygon and Gliscor will have no problems. Any Jolteon without Signal Beam or Shadow Ball is stopped by Celebi. Electivire can switch into Jolteon easily, and if he grabs a Motor Drive boost, can outspeed and threaten him with Earthquake. Porygon2 can Trace Volt Absorb and stall Jolteon out, as can Gardevoir, although she must be wary of Shadow Ball.</p>

<p>Jolteon himself--or any other Electric-type, for that matter--can easily wall Jolteon, as can any dedicated special wall. Jolteon also has very poor defenses, so even neutral attacks from faster Choice Scarf users will maim him.</p>
