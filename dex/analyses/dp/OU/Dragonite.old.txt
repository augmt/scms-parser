[Overview]

<p>With Salamence banished to the Uber tier, Dragonite once again becomes the most powerful Dragon-type in OU. With a fantastic base 134 Attack stat, respectable base 100 Special Attack, and a huge movepool that includes Outrage, Draco Meteor, Extreme Speed, Superpower, and Roost, Dragonite's sheer power and versatility is sure to keep your opponent on their toes.</p>

<p>Dragonite's biggest weakness is its mediocre Speed; even after a Dragon Dance boost, it is easily revenge killed by the likes of Choice Scarf Jirachi. Dragonite also has an unfortunate weakness to Stealth Rock, which often strips it of 25% of its health simply as it switches in. Furthermore, its 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks leaves it vulnerable to the omnipresent bulky Water-types that can tank its attacks. Luckily, Dragonite is equipped with all the tools it needs to overcome these flaws. Agility and Extreme Speed allow it to beat faster Pokemon, while Roost enables it to heal off residual damage and temporarily remove its Flying typing. It isn't a stretch to say that Dragonite is one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the OU metagame and should always be accounted for when building a team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Mixed Dragonite is an excellent stallbreaker thanks to its ability to break common defensive cores, including Blissey, Forretress, Skarmory, and Hippowdon. Draco Meteor will disintegrate all Pokemon except Steel-types and Blissey. Flamethrower easily takes down the former, while Superpower handles the latter. Earthquake is an option over Superpower as it allows Dragonite to defeat Heatran and Tyranitar without the Attack and Defense drops, but it will only deal around 34% - 40% to 252/252+ Blissey. The last slot is up to personal preference. Roost gives Dragonite a much longer lifespan, which is important considering that Stealth Rock, sandstorm, and Life Orb all wear it down. However, Extreme Speed gives Dragonite a useful priority attack that can potentially stop an opponent's sweep, and compensates somewhat for Dragonite's lower Speed.</p>

<p>This set can also function as an effective lead. Inner Focus lets Dragonite come out on top against leads that focus on causing flinches, such as Infernape and Jirachi, while Extreme Speed allows it to quickly finish off suicide leads such as Aerodactyl. Slow, physically bulky leads, such as Hippowdon, are dispatched of by Draco Meteor, and with a Lum Berry, Dragonite can also beat sleep leads such as Roserade. Even the popular Machamp will fall to a combination of Draco Meteor and Extreme Speed if it doesn't pack Ice Punch.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Speed EVs enable Dragonite to outspeed positive-natured Tyranitar, as well as defensive Zapdos and Celebi, while the Attack investment lets it OHKO Calm Blissey with Superpower. Maximum Special Attack and a positive nature grants it maximum wallbreaking power, but a Lonely nature can be used to give Extreme Speed an extra kick. If running a Lonely nature, consider using 108 Attack EVs to OHKO Bold Blissey with Superpower after Stealth Rock damage. A Hasty nature can let Dragonite outrun neutral-natured Gyarados and positive-natured Heatran, but this Dragonite is primarily a stallbreaker, and the loss in power is rarely worth it. A Quiet nature and a spread of 252 HP / 56 Atk / 196 SpA / 4 Spe  sacrifices Dragonite's ability to outrun positive-natured Tyranitar and certain defensive Pokemon, but gives greater overall bulk, and is thus useful if running Roost. Specifically, it can survive a Adamant Lucario's +2 Close Combat after Stealth Rock on average. Fire Blast is a good alternative to Flamethrower as it secures several important KOs, such as the OHKO on specially defensive Skarmory, defensive Celebi, and Metagross, although the accuracy can be a let-down. Thunderbolt is also a usable option as it 2HKOes standard Suicune, who is a common switch-in to Dragonite, while still 2HKOing most Steel-types.</p>

<p>Due to Dragonite's huge vulnerability to priority attacks, such as Scizor's Bullet Punch and Weavile's Ice Shard, a bulky Steel-type is a valuable partner; Heatran in particular also attracts Ground-type attacks for Dragonite to switch into. Additionally, this set can potentially lure in Skarmory and Forretress, which Heatran can deal with. Scizor is a useful partner too, as it can scout the opposing team with U-turn to ease prediction. Furthermore, it greatly appreciates the removal of Forretress and Skarmory, and can take down Flygon and Cresselia, who can cause major problems for Dragonite. Considering Dragonite's mediocre Speed, paralysis support from the likes of Jirachi and Celebi can give it a much easier time sweeping. The former has perfect type synergy with Dragonite, while the latter--despite also being weak to Ice--can defeat the bulky Water-types that trouble Dragonite. Finally, Dragonite appreciates entry hazards support. Stealth Rock is practically necessary for all Dragonite, but this Dragonite loves Spikes support as well, because it improves Dragonite's chances to OHKO Hippowdon, Swampert, and even Vaporeon with Draco Meteor. Forretress has surprisingly nice defensive synergy with Dragonite, and can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin in between setting up Spikes.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With the second highest Attack stat in the OU tier, usable Speed, and a great STAB, it's no surprise that Dragonite can run a successful Dragon Dance set. Five resistances and an immunity give Dragonite plenty of opportunities to set up Dragon Dance. Dragon Claw and Outrage are both excellent STAB attacks; The former is the more reliable option thanks to its lack of drawbacks, but the latter has 50% more power and secures several crucial OHKOs, such as against offensive Suicune after a Dragon Dance. Earthquake gives Dragonite a way to hurt grounded Steel-types that resist its STAB, and Extreme Speed allows Dragonite to deal with faster Pokemon that would normally be a problem. To illustrate, after a boost, it deals 76.4% - 90% to Choice Scarf Flygon. Alternatively, as Skarmory and Bronzong wall Dragonite even after multiple Dragon Dance boosts, Fire Punch is an option over Extreme Speed to take them out.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With the given EVs and an Adamant nature, Dragonite reaches 604 Attack and 388 Speed after a boost, which let it hit hard while outspeeding all unboosted base 125 Speed Pokemon and below. If forgoing Extreme Speed for Fire Punch, Jolly is the superior nature to get the jump on base 130 Speed Pokemon. This has consequences, however; without Extreme Speed, Dragonite is easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users such as Flygon.</p>

<p>As Skarmory and Bronzong completely wall Dragonite that lack Fire Punch, Magnezone is arguably Dragonite's best partner. Its ability to trap and remove opposing Steel-types allows Dragonite to freely use Outrage; furthermore, it sponges Ice-, Rock-, and Dragon-type moves for Dragonite while luring Fire- and Ground-type attacks for Dragonite to switch into. Heatran too can keep its fellow Steel-types in check and fares better against Mamoswine and Weavile, who can revenge kill Dragonite with Ice Shard. On the other hand, if Dragonite lacks Extreme Speed, its teammates must have a way to deal with Choice Scarf Flygon, while Cresselia poses a threat to all Dragonite. Scizor can 2HKO Flygon with Bullet Punch and severely damage Cresselia with U-turn. Rapid Spin support is heavily recommended for this Dragonite as it lacks Roost. Starmie and Tentacruel are good spinners due to their respectable bulk, resistance to Ice, and good offenses. Tentacruel can also set up Toxic Spikes to severely cripple defensive Suicune, which can survive a boosted Outrage and OHKO back with Ice Beam.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set makes use of Dragonite's excellent bulk to set up as many Dragon Dances as possible and attempt a sweep. Roost allows Dragonite to heal when needed, and lets it set up on the likes of Heatran, Zapdos, Scizor, and Suicune that lack Ice Beam. Dragon Claw is generally the safer option for STAB, as the locking effect of Outrage can mean imminent death, but Outrage is still viable for its sheer power. The choice between Earthquake and Fire Punch is a difficult one; Fire Punch and Dragon Claw together have perfect neutral coverage against every Pokemon in OU bar Heatran, while Earthquake has higher Base Power and leaves Dragonite walled only by Skarmory and Bronzong.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs grant Dragonite enough bulk to set up multiple Dragon Dance boosts, and enough Speed to outrun base 120s at +1; the rest are dumped into Attack so it hits a little harder. Leftovers is the recommended item; while a Life Orb offers much more power, it somewhat contradicts the bulky nature of the set. An EV spread of 216 HP / 80 Atk / 212 Spe is recommended if using a Life Orb as it allows +1 Dragonite to OHKO Metagross with Earthquake after Stealth Rock. If you're not concerned about base 120 Speed Pokemon, namely Dugtrio and Alakazam, feel free to drop down to 224 HP EVs and 204 Speed EVs, which achieves a good Life Orb number while still beating base 115 Speed Pokemon. Brick Break gives Dragonite a way to hit both Heatran and the levitating Steel-types, but as most Steel-types have a secondary typing that renders them neutral to Fighting, it is more often than not a rather weak attack to complement Dragonite's STAB.</p>

<p>While this set is bulky enough to set up on many opponents, it is both easily walled and revenge killed. Without Fire Punch, Skarmory and Bronzong will have no trouble handling Dragonite, and without Earthquake, Heatran will defeat the set. For this reason, having a Magnezone on your team is crucial. Additionally, Magnezone can switch in on Flygon as it uses Outrage, as well as Heatran as it tries to revenge kill Dragonite with Hidden Power Ice or Dragon Pulse, and take both down with Hidden Power Ice. Good prediction is needed, however, as both of these Pokemon can easily beat Magnezone with the appropriate move. A Heatran of your own is also a useful partner as it can keep Bronzong and Skarmory in check with its STAB Fire Blast. A spinner such as Starmie or Tentacruel is recommended too, especially if Dragonite opts for a Life Orb, as Stealth Rock can make it difficult for Dragonite to set up.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>By equipping a Choice Band, Dragonite trades its ability to sweep for the power to hit extremely hard right off the bat. Choice Band-boosted STAB Outrage is ridiculously powerful and can easily 2HKO any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, allowing Dragonite to bypass its usual counters such as Suicune and Cresselia. Earthquake will obliterate every Steel-type except Skarmory and Bronzong, while Fire Punch ensures at least a 2HKO on all Steels except Heatran. Extreme Speed is key to this set's success, as it makes up for Dragonite's low Speed and has similar power to Scizor's Bullet Punch, 2HKOing Gyarados, Infernape, Jolteon, and many other faster threats.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs are simple and straightforward and ensure that Dragonite hits like a truck while staying ahead of Scizor and Tyranitar. A Jolly nature may be used to outspeed Adamant Gyarados, Adamant Lucario, and Heatran lacking a Choice Scarf, although the loss in power is substantial and stops Dragonite from beating some of its common switch-ins like Suicune. There are a few viable moves for the last slot; Dragon Claw is generally the best choice for a reliable STAB, but Superpower may be used as a way of hitting Heatran if you are running Fire Punch. Earthquake and Fire Punch may be used together to achieve perfect coverage, although the loss of a reliable STAB just to hit one or two Pokemon that can be easily handled by teammates is often not worth it. Finally, Waterfall may also be used in the last slot as it offers great neutral coverage, eases prediction, and can 2HKO Hippowdon and Gliscor without locking Dragonite into Outrage.</p>

<p>Since Dragonite can 2HKO every Pokemon in the OU tier, its only true concern is being revenge killed. Scizor, Jirachi, and Flygon can all come in and revenge kill Dragonite with impunity, especially if it locks itself into Outrage. For this reason, Magnezone once again makes a good partner, as it can trap the former two and possibly catch Flygon with Hidden Power Ice. Hippowdon or Skarmory can also be used to deal with these Pokemon on a more balanced team. Starmie is another useful partner to have around, as it can provide Rapid Spin support while simultaneously handling some of the Pokemon that threaten Dragonite. Finally, Heatran can keep Scizor and Jirachi in check and greatly appreciates the removal of bulky Water-types that Dragonite may lure and 2HKO with Outrage.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A common problem with the Dragon Dance sets is that even after a boost, common Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Flygon and Jirachi will outspeed Dragonite and prematurely end its sweep. This set remedies that problem by using Agility to let Dragonite outrun all Choice Scarf base 100s. It can often surprise opponents that expect a Dragon Dance set and end up sweeping entire teams, especially after bulkier Pokemon have been weakened late-game. Outrage is the STAB move of choice for its high Base Power. Earthquake and Fire Blast make short work of any Steel-types that attempt to wall Dragonite's STAB, but Thunderbolt is a viable option over Fire Blast if you're worried about bulky Water-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb is the ideal item for this set, as its power boost helps compensate for the lack of an Attack boost. 204 Speed EVs let Dragonite outspeed base 100 Choice Scarf users after an Agility boost, 52 Special Attack EVs allow Dragonite to 2HKO offensive Rotom-A with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock, and maximum Attack investment enables it to sweep. Some EVs can be moved from Attack to Special Attack if you feel it's necessary to boost the power of Fire Blast or Thunderbolt. Naughty is the recommended nature as it increases Dragonite's Attack without lowering its Special Attack, but an Adamant nature can be used if you want more bulk. However, note that hindering-natured Dragonite loses the ability to 2HKO offensive Rotom-A with Fire Blast. If you are worried about the reliability of Outrage and Fire Blast, Dragon Claw and Flamethrower can be used in their place, but the loss of power will make a sweep difficult. Focus Blast is viable for power and good neutral coverage, but keep in mind that its accuracy is terrible.</p>

<p>As Dragonite is a good lure of Choice Scarf revenge killers such as Flygon and Jirachi, Pokemon that appreciate their removal, such as Heatran, Gyarados, and Tyranitar, are the most effective partners for this set. Magnezone support is heavily recommended, especially if opting for Outrage over Dragon Claw, as Steel-types would have a field day switching in on Outrage and beating Dragonite down. A teammate that can deal with bulky Water-types and Hippowdon is also recommended. Grass-types such as Shaymin and Celebi can easily dispose of both with their STAB attacks, but they share an unfortunate weakness to Ice-type attacks with Dragonite. Toxic Spikes are an alternative method of dealing with them. Tentacruel can set up Toxic Spikes and provide Rapid Spin support while offering a crucial resistance to Ice. Finally, Starmie can also provide Rapid Spin support and beat bulky Water-types that lack Hidden Power Electric by alternating between Thunderbolt and Recover.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Dragonite is often crippled by status as it attempts a sweep, this set uses Heal Bell to negate status and set up freely against defensive variants of Blissey, Cresselia, Heatran, Rotom-A, and Dusknoir. With both Roost and Heal Bell, Dragonite can often set up multiple Dragon Dance boosts against stall, balanced, and offensive teams alike, and proceed to sweep once opposing Steel-types are gone. This Dragonite is also a surprisingly effective team support Pokemon, as Heal Bell lets it cure its teammates of unsavory paralysis, poison, or burn.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The heavy Special Defense investment allows Dragonite to set up on defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Cresselia, even if they carry Ice Beam, while the Speed investment allows Dragonite to outspeed positive-natured Lucario and neutral-natured base 100s after a Dragon Dance. The Special Defense EVs can be shifted into Defense to give Dragonite a good chance to survive standard Choice Scarf Flygon's Outrage even after Stealth Rock damage, but this will leave Dragonite vulnerable to many defensive Pokemon it could otherwise set up on. Due to the lack of Attack investment, Outrage can be used over Dragon Claw; it is much more powerful, and the confusion can be removed with Heal Bell. However, Dragon Claw is the more reliable option as a Dragonite locked into Outrage will be unable to Roost or switch out, and will thus be easy pickings for revenge killers.</p>

<p>As this Dragonite is completely walled by Steel-types, Magnezone support is required if you want Dragonite to be able to sweep. Paralysis support is also beneficial, as Dragonite is outsped by numerous Pokemon even after a Dragon Dance. Discharge Magnezone and Jirachi can both spread paralysis effectively; the latter can also beat Steel-types down with either Thunderbolt or Fire Punch. Dragonite can set up on defensive Water-types, but offensive variants can beat it, so one should have a way to deal with them. Magnezone's STAB Electric-type attacks will help in this area, but it is outsped and can be worn down by neutral Water-type attacks, so an additional check, such as Roserade, Celebi, or Shaymin, is recommended. Roserade is particularly valuable here as it can set up either Spikes or Toxic Spikes and incapacitate a foe with its status moves. Tentacruel can also cripple bulky Water-types with Toxic Spikes while providing Rapid Spin support. Flygon outspeeds even +1 Dragonite, so a bulky Water-type or a Steel-type of your own that can switch in on Flygon's Outrage and take it down is recommended.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Dragonite has a humongous movepool and all-rounded stats, so there are naturally many other usable options to consider. On Dragonite's offensive sets, Ice Beam, Stone Edge, Thunder Punch, Surf, and Waterfall deserve a mention for taking care of certain Pokemon, but they are only useful against specific threats, while the listed moves offer much better coverage in general. With Dragonite's solid defenses, typing, and reliable recovery in Roost, it can play a defensive role by stalling with Toxic or disrupting opposing sweepers with Thunder Wave, Roar, or Haze. Similarly, Dragonite can support the team with Light Screen and set up Sunny Day or Rain Dance. Dragonite also gets Rest and Sleep Talk, but considering its access to Roost and Heal Bell, putting Dragonite to sleep is usually an unnecessary risk. Dragonite can run a decent Choice Scarf or Choice Specs set, but with its subpar Speed, average Special Attack, and weakness to Stealth Rock, it is outclassed by many other Pokemon with such a set.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Due to Dragonite's excellent versatility, a universal counter to it does not exist; the trick is to find out what set it's running and to react accordingly. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune give sweeping Dragonite a great amount of trouble, as they can take a hit and retaliate with Ice Beam. A boosted Outrage can break these Water-types after a bit of residual damage, though, so step carefully. Cresselia is a decent counter that can hit Dragonite hard with Ice Beam or cripple it with Toxic or Thunder Wave, but it is setup bait for Dragonite that pack Heal Bell. Skarmory and Hippowdon do a good job countering Dragon Dance Dragonite, but the former must avoid a boosted Fire Punch and the latter is 2HKOed by Outrage. Scizor not only resists Dragonite's STAB attacks, but can also remove over half of Dragonite's HP with Choice Band Bullet Punch. Scizor must be mindful of defensive variants of Dragonite, though, as it can fail to 2HKO those even after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>Common Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Jirachi and Flygon can revenge kill the Dragon Dance sets, but Flygon takes huge damage from a boosted Extreme Speed, while both are outsped and OHKOed by the Agility set. Finally, Weavile and Mamoswine can revenge kill Dragonite with Ice Shard, but they won't have many opportunities to switch in safely.</p>
