[Overview]

<p>With an incredible 130 base Attack and Technician Bullet Punch, Scizor is definitely a force to be reckoned with in the OU metagame. When you take into account the fact that it also boasts a whopping ten resistances with only one weakness, it's easy to see why Scizor has jumped to the top of the usage stats as the number one tank in the metagame. It is capable of revenge killing, scouting, or even sweeping teams after a Swords Dance boost, and its utility makes it easy to drop into pretty much any team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band Scizor's massive 591 Attack, combined with STAB U-turn and priority in the form of Technician Bullet Punch, makes it one of the best revenge killers and scouts in the entire metagame. Factor in 70 / 100 / 80 defenses and its 10 resistances, and it is clear why Choice Band Scizor makes a fantastic tank in the OU metagame.</p>

<p>Bullet Punch is the crux of its set. After STAB and the Technician boost, it sports 90 Base Power, which allows it to pick off many a weakened opposing sweeper. Bullet Punch 2HKOes 4/0 Dragonite, and can OHKO Gengar after SR as well. U-turn hits incredibly hard after STAB and allows Scizor to scout for its counters and bring in a counter of your own. Superpower allows Scizor to OHKO two of its most common "counters", Magnezone and Heatran, as they switch in. It is also Scizor's most powerful option versus opposing Scizor. For the final slot, Pursuit can allow Scizor to pick off opposing Choiced Rotom-A and Gengar locked into resisted moves. On the other hand, Quick Attack provides Scizor with the ability to revenge weakened Zapdos, Gyarados, or Kingdra more effectively. Night Slash is also acceptable to hit Rotom-A on the switch, but U-turning to a suitable counter is often just as effective.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Stealth Rock is Scizor's best friend, as it allows Scizor to revenge kill Pokemon such as Dragonite and Gengar much more easily. It also allows Scizor's team to take maximum advantage of the switches that U-turn commonly induces. Once Stealth Rock is up, the best teammates for Scizor are Pokemon who can switch into its common counters and either eliminate them or force them out. Tyranitar can eliminate opposing Rotom-A, as well as covering opposing Heatran and Zapdos. Heatran can absorb Will-O-Wisp from Rotom or Heat Wave from Zapdos, and possibly lure and Explode on bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Vaporeon, and Swampert. For a more offensive option, effective teammates include frail sweepers such as Gengar and Infernape that can take advantage of free switches scouted by U-turn.</p>

<p>Packing a Rapid Spinner can also be advantageous when using Choice Band Scizor, as Stealth Rock and Spikes can prove to be a nightmare for Scizor, which can find itself switching in often. Starmie is the best spinner to pair with Scizor, as it resists Fire and has access to instant recovery. Meanwhile, if Scizor can eliminate Blissey with Pursuit, Starmie is capable of sweeping late-game. Forretress can also function well, as it reinforces Scizor's resistances and can also provide Spikes support to take advantage of the switches caused by Scizor's power. However, be cautious of doubling up on Fire weaknesses, since Forretress and Scizor have the same typing.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While the last set is meant to be more "glue" for a team, this Scizor is meant to sweep. Swords Dance combines with Bullet Punch to give Scizor massive damage potential alongside powerful priority, hitting harder than Swords Dance Lucario's Extremespeed.</p>

<p>Brick Break is the preferred move here, as after a Swords Dance boost, it has all the power needed to OHKO troublesome Pokemon such as Heatran and Magnezone. However, Superpower is always an option to nail these Pokemon on the switch and also deals significantly more damage to Skarmory. Superpower is capable of 2HKOing a non-roosting Skarmory after Swords Dance, though it comes at the cost of negating Scizor's Swords Dance boost and significantly reducing its defense. The last move is used mostly for utility. Bug Bite is a STAB boosted by Technician, and it is Scizor's strongest attack for eliminating opponents such as Swampert, Suicune, and Vaporeon. Roost plays alongside Scizor's natural bulk and resistances and can allow it to heal and set up on Pokemon such as Forretress or non-Surf MixPert. Finally, Quick Attack gives Scizor a priority option against Gyarados, Kingdra, Starmie, and Zapdos.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb is the preferred item due to the boost in power that it provides, but Leftovers can allow Scizor to passively heal off damage, making it easier to set up or sweep after setting up on a resisted attack. Metal Coat can be acceptable to bluff a Choice item and boost the power of Bullet Punch, but the loss of power on Scizor's coverage moves can be an issue. Since this Scizor runs a more offensive set, a simple max Attack / max Speed spread is preferred. If using Leftovers or Metal Coat alongside Roost, an alternate spread of 212 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Spe can be used. 44 Speed reaches a total of 177 Speed, which outspeeds zero Speed Skarmory and any other base 70 Pokemon with no investment. More can be used to beat faster variants, such as the common 16 Speed Skarmory.</p>

<p>Quicker Water-types such as Starmie or offensive Suicune can cause problems for this set, as well as Rotom, faster Heatran, and Zapdos. Heatran can lure and Explode on the first set of counters while directly countering the second set, and as such makes an excellent teammate for Scizor. Tyranitar variants also do well, as they can eliminate Rotom-A and Zapdos while easily switching into Heatran. It can also wear down Swampert and Suicune, which often switch into Tyranitar. Choice Band Gyarados makes an especially effective ally for this Scizor, as it can lure and eliminate many counters, especially Rotom-A and Starmie. It also easily 3HKOes Suicune with Earthquake and does plenty of damage to Swampert and Vaporeon.</p>

evs: 12 HP / 252 Atk / 244 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Despite having Bullet Punch to overcome his low Speed, Scizor can often find himself requiring more Speed than the Choice Band set provides. This is most notable against Pokemon such as Starmie, Gengar, and Rotom, all of whom have a chance to OHKO you before you can U-turn or Pursuit them. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Scizor is able to outspeed all of the aforementioned Pokemon and OHKO them with the appropriate move. Having such a fast and powerful U-turn also makes Choice Scarf Scizor an effective scout, able to avoid taking damage should the opponent refuse to switch.</p>

<p>This set may lack the power of Choice Band, but it does not attempt to overpower the opponent like the Choice Band set does. Rather, Scizor is scouting the early-game with a fast U-turn before coming back in on a revenge kill to put someone into a checkmate position with Pursuit or Bullet Punch. This set's boosted Speed stat additionally allows it to check threats such as Swords Dance Lucario and non-Choice Scarf Heatran.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs allow it to outspeed positive-nature base 120 Speed Pokemon, which is all Scizor needs. Only 216 Speed EVs are need to beat Starmie, if you'd like to give Scizor a little extra bulk. Bullet Punch is the main option as this allows you to nab some damage on the likes of Mach Punch Breloom and Infernape, Ice Shard Mamoswine, or Extreme Speed Dragonite and Lucario. Iron Head can be used instead for more power if such priority is not a concern. Night Slash is an option for hitting defensive Rotom-A as is Aerial Ace for hitting Breloom, Infernape, and Machamp. Even if you are running Iron Head over Bullet Punch, Technician is still the ability to use, since the power of Scizor's Pursuit rivals that of Choice Scarf Tyranitar's, which is especially important if your opponent does not switch.</p>

<p>Since this set can take out Starmie and Rotom-A with ease, having partners who can sweep with these Pokemon removed is recommended. Heatran, Gyarados, and Dragonite make good partners, since they can switch in on the Fire-type moves aimed at Scizor. Gyarados, in particular, enjoys having Rotom-A removed from the picture. Alternatively, Swampert and Suicune make good choices since they can switch in on Fire-type moves and force the opponent out. Tyranitar earns a special mention since Scizor and Tyranitar have good synergy, and Scizor can U-turn to Tyranitar whose Pursuit can finish off the Rotom-A and Gengar weakened by Scizor. Since the loss of power from Choice Band means that Scizor won't be hitting as hard, bulky walls such as Skarmory, Swampert, and Suicune can often wall it. In the case of Suicune and Skarmory, they can often recover off the damage from Scizor's U-turn or Superpower, although with U-turn you can always switch to a counter without Scizor taking damage. It is good to have high-powered Electric-type attacks to help deal with these threats. Good Pokemon for the job include Jolteon and your own Rotom-A.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Swords Dance / Agility
move 3: Roost
move 4: Bullet Punch / Substitute
item: Leftovers
ability: Technician
nature: Adamant
evs: 248 HP / 88 Atk / 172 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its myriad boosting moves, natural bulk, access to Roost, and numerous resistances, Scizor is an extremely effective Baton Pass user. The two most useful boosts to pass are Swords Dance and Agility, and Scizor passes both extremely well. Roost allows Scizor to set up against weak or resisted attacks, or pass boosts multiple times during a match. The last move is a matter of preference and is mainly used to reinforce Scizor's utility outside of Baton Pass. Bullet Punch can let Scizor pick off certain opponents, or potentially act as a sweeper if Swords Dance is used. Substitute gives Scizor another asset to pass with Baton Pass, and can help its boosts land safely on whatever it passes to.</p>

<p>248 HP EVs are used to improve Scizor's bulk, and 172 Speed EVs allow Scizor to outspeed Choice Scarf Heatran after an Agility. The remainder is dropped into Attack to boost the power of Bullet Punch. However, the EVs used here can be easily tweaked. If using Substitute, investing in Scizor's defenses becomes significantly more important. Similarly, without Agility, the Speed EVs can be invested into Attack to pull off a potential sweep, or Defense / Special Defense to make it easier to pass on its boosts.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>When choosing a partner for this Scizor, decide what would benefit the most from its boosts. Passing Swords Dance to Metagross can give it the punch it needs to break through even the sturdiest wall, and if it carries Agility, it can easily sweep unprepared teams. Similarly, Gyarados, Dragonite, and Tyranitar can do well with a Swords Dance boost and also resist Scizor's only weakness, which can make it possible for them to boost further with Dragon Dance. For Agility, there are many solid choices. Metagross can benefit from improved coverage if it is passed an Agility instead of having to carry it. Tyranitar also benefits from an Agility boost if it intends to sweep, as there are many Choice Scarfed Pokemon capable of outspeeding it. There are many options for Baton Pass Scizor, and it all depends on the rest of its team.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>On the Choice Band set, Night Slash is an option to nail Rotom-A on the switch. It always OHKOs 4/0 Choiced variants of Rotom-A, and deals 61% minimum to 252/168 Bold Rotom-A, the most defensive one around. Scizor can also utilize U-turn on the Swords Dance set. While it may seem peculiar to use a move that forces Scizor to lose its boosts, it can be a great move to scout for counters early-game and effectively wear them down for a Bullet Punch sweep later. Return and Double Hit can provide neutral coverage on opponents such as Zapdos and Gyarados.</p>

<p>Scizor's secondary ability, Swarm, can be used in conjunction with Liechi or Salac Berry in order to pull off a low HP sweep. However, when using Swarm, be sure to use X-Scissor over Bug Bite, as without Technician, X-Scissor is the superior move. Reversal can also be used effectively in tandem with sets sweeping at low HP.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Rotom-A is easily the best counter to Scizor, packing resistances to Bug and Steel as well as an immunity to Fighting. However, Choice variants will have to be wary of Pursuit when locked into a resisted attack, and the odd Night Slash can catch Rotom-A off guard. Gyarados also does extremely well, being able to switch into almost any move Scizor could possibly carry with no repercussions due to Intimidate. Zapdos is in the same boat as Gyarados, and while it may not have Intimidate on its side, it can Roost off any damage incurred or retaliate with Heat Wave, something Gyarados can't do.</p>

<p>Heatran's 4x resistances to Bug- and Steel-type attacks makes it a good choice for countering Scizor. However, switching into Superpower can mean a quick death for Heatran, so be wary. Magnezone works extremely similarly, and if it can get in on a Pursuit or Bullet Punch, it guarantees Scizor's elimination due to Magnet Pull. Scarf Magnezone with Hidden Power Fire is especially notable for doing this, as it cannot be outsped by non-Choiced Scizor.</p>

<p>The majority of physical walls can perform relatively well against the Choice Band set, such as Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Skarmory. Skarmory specifically packs a 4x resistance to U-turn and a 2x resistance to Bullet Punch, so it can take advantage of Scizor to lay down Spikes. Forretress can do the same, but lack of instant recovery makes it a slightly more unreliable choice, as it can be worn down more easily by Superpower or random hits. However, note that these Pokemon do not do nearly as well against Swords Dance Scizor, which can pack Roost to turn these Pokemon into setup fodder. They are also reliably 2HKOed by Scizor's moves, be it Bullet Punch or Bug Bite for Gliscor and Hippowdon or Brick Break / Superpower for Forretress and Skarmory.</p>
