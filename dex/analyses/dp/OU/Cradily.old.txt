[Overview]

<p>At first glance, Cradily might seem handicapped as a Curse sweeper due to its relatively large number of weaknesses and only average stats. While Cradily's Rock typing might trouble it to some extent, it does increase Cradily's Special Defense stat by 50% in a sandstorm. Combined with its access to Recover, a move that other Curse users, such as Swampert, Tyranitar, and Regirock, wish they had, Cradily can become quite a formidable threat.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Cradily is an effective Curse user that has several advantages over Tyranitar and Regirock, namely Suction Cups, which prevents it from being phazed, and a Grass typing, which eliminates its weaknesses to Water and Grass. Curse is a great move that boosts Cradily's average Attack and Defense stats and enables it to both hit harder and take hits more easily. Rock Slide is Cradily's main attack as it gains STAB and hits most Pokemon that don't resist it quite hard after a few boosts. Recover allows Cradily to heal without going to sleep and becoming setup bait; however, Rest completely heals Cradily and cures it of status as well, especially Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. Earthquake is the recommended move if using Recover as it gives Cradily better coverage, while Sleep Talk is the preferred option if Cradily carries Rest; it allows Cradily to attack or set up while asleep.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread and nature maximizes Cradily's HP and Special Defense stats to let it take most special attacks with ease, especially when sandstorm is in play. Special Defense investment is preferred to physical bulk because Cradily will be boosting its latter defense with Curse. The remaining EVs are put into Attack to enable Cradily to hit a bit harder.</p>

<p>A Sand Stream Pokemon is needed for Cradily to reach its full potential. Tyranitar and Hippowdon are both great options; both can provide Stealth Rock support as well. A teammate that can switch into Bug-, Steel-, and Fighting-type attacks, such as Gyarados or Zapdos, is also appreciated as Cradily will often attract attacks of these types.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Seed Bomb is by far the best move not mentioned above. It can replace Earthquake to provide Cradily with a secondary STAB attack that also nails common physical walls, namely Swampert and Hippowdon. Cradily can make use of a set consisting of Stockpile and Swords Dance, but it has limited coverage as it only has room for two attacks; one if it opts for a healing move. Stone Edge is an alternative to Rock Slide that trades accuracy for power, but it is not recommended due to Stone Edge's low PP. Mirror Coat reflects special attacks for double the damage, but also reduces Cradily's coverage. Toxic cripples bulky opponents, but is generally not worth a moveslot. Finally, Pain Split can be used over Recover to heal Cradily while damaging the opponent, but if the opponent does not have relatively high HP, Recover will be the more effective move.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Most of Cradily's counters are Pokemon that pack a super effective attack. Scizor is the number one threat to Cradily, as three of its common moves hit Cradily for super effective damage, while Swords Dance lets Scizor boost its Attack faster than Cradily can boost its Defense with Curse. Metagross is another counter thanks to its powerful Meteor Mash, which hurts Cradily a lot even after one or two Defense boosts. Similarly, Infernape has a powerful STAB super effective Close Combat with which to dispose of Cradily; however, it can be taken out by a well-timed Earthquake. Jirachi can often flinch Cradily to death with STAB Iron Head, or Trick it a Choice Scarf to render it useless for the rest of the match. Finally, Breloom not only resists anything Cradily can throw at it, but can also use Spore to incapacitate it, set up a Substitute, and knock it out with Focus Punch.</p>
