[Overview]

<p>Heatran is the anti-metagame Pokemon, capable of keeping top threats, such as Scizor, Lucario, Infernape, and Dragonite, in check with its popular Choice Scarf set. With the ability to counter some of the biggest threats in the game and a neutrality to Stealth Rock, Heatran is far beyond the level of any other Fire-type in Pokemon. The secondary Steel typing gives it a lot of good resistances, and Flash Fire allows it to take on its fellow Fire-types quite easily. While the weaknesses to extremely common moves such as Earthquake, Surf, and Close Combat hinder its walling potential, its ability as a defensive Pokemon should not be overlooked. With decent defensive typing and one of the highest Special Attack stats in the Overused tier, Heatran should not be underestimated.</p>

<p>Heatran will be seen on a lot of teams, so be prepared for it. Heatran is a sturdy tank, a great team player, and a frightening sweeper. Its frequent presence near the top of the usage list is for a good reason, and if your team is not prepared to deal with it then you cannot expect to have a healthy winning record.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Heatran can effectively take on the role of revenge killer, outpacing dangerous threats such as Lucario, Dragonite, and neutral-natured Gyarados after a Dragon Dance. Heatran reaches a maximum Speed stat of 417 when wielding Choice Scarf, outspeeding all Pokeon in OU bar Ninjask. Heatran's typing and ability allows it to switch into a lot of attacks relatively unscathed, making it that much more useful as a revenge killer. Heatran also resists almost all of the priority attacks in the game, which makes it incredibly hard to KO unless your opponent is packing a faster Choice Scarf user, or a Pokemon that can resist the attack Heatran is locked into and KO back.<p>

<p>Fire Blast serves as Heatran's main STAB move, allowing it to deal a ridiculous amount of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Pokemon such as Rash Dragonite risk being 2HKOed by Fire Blast with Stealth Rock due to Heatran's impressive Special Attack stat of 359. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast if you prefer accuracy over power, but it should be noted that the power difference is evident if you opt for Flamethrower. Earth Power is necessary on this set because it provides Heatran with a way of disposing of other Fire-types, specifically opposing Heatran. Explosion fills the third slot, giving Heatran an effective way of eliminating Blissey and bulky Water-type Pokemon that dare to switch in. For the last slot, Dragon Pulse, Hidden Power Grass, and Hidden Power Electric are all decent options. Dragon Pulse allows Heatran to revenge kill Dragonite and Kingdra without having to resort to Explosion, while Hidden Power Grass is useful in wearing down Water-types that can otherwise wall Heatran. Finally, Hidden Power Electric lets Heatran revenge kill +1 Adamant Gyarados that rarely suspect it and tend to stay in.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Modest or Rash nature can be considered if you feel the extra power is more beneficial to your team, but Heatran will miss out on outpacing Adamant Gyarados, Adamant Heracross, and at least tying with opposing Choice Scarfed Heatran.</p>

<p>This set has trouble against Water-types and Blissey, so Pokemon that can take down both are effective options for this set. Celebi covers Heatran's weaknesses perfectly and can take down most Water-types with a STAB Grass Knot or Leaf Storm. Specifically, Celebi works best at countering Gyarados, which can set up on Heatran locked into Choice Scarf. Additionally, Heatran also covers Celebi's weaknesses. Scizor is another excellent teammate to Heatran, providing teams with extra insurance against Dragon Dance Dragonite which might have set up on Heatran; not only that, but Scizor is great at luring Fire-type attacks which activate Heatran's Flash Fire ability. Finally, Scizor can dispose of Blissey with Superpower if you are unable to KO her with Heatran.</p>

evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Heatran makes for a fine lead and overall user of Stealth Rock, having the ability to easily take on the ever so common Metagross and Azelf leads. The only commonly seen leads that stand a chance against Heatran are Aerodactyl, Infernape, Machamp, and Swampert, but only the former two can actually prevent Heatran from laying down Stealth Rock. Although this set packs Explosion, Heatran is one of the few offensive leads that are not considered suicide leads, because it can often leave the scene in relatively good health due to its natural bulk, and provide the team with utility later in the game.</p>

<p>Fire Blast provides Heatran with a powerful STAB option to apply offensive pressure while Earth Power is a reliable move for dealing with opposing Heatran (which cannot OHKO your Heatran thanks to Shuca Berry) and finishing off Occa Berry Metagross leads. With a Base Speed of 77, Heatran barely outpaces Smeargle, making Taunt a solid option over Explosion. Taunt will also allow Heatran to prevent any slower Pokemon from using Stealth Rock, which can be very useful if it has teammates that are weak to Rock-type attacks. Taunt can also stop certain Pokemon from setting up against Heatran, such as non-Jolly Gyarados, Kingdra, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Hidden Power Grass should also be considered over Explosion, as it allows Heatran to do a considerable amount of damage to Swampert, making the list of leads that can beat Heatran even shorter. Shuca Berry is the item of choice for this set, as it allows Heatran to stay in on Pokemon that might use Earthquake, such as Metagross and Swampert.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If you decide to not use this set as a lead, players may assume that Heatran is holding a Choice Scarf. Due to this, Heatran can often net surprise kills on Dragonite and Gyarados with Explosion, especially with Shuca Berry ensuring that Heatran survives any Earthquakes coming from the two. Even Blissey can be caught off guard with a well-timed Explosion, which can easily allow other special sweepers on the team to plow through the opponent's team.</p>

<p>Speed and Special Attack are maximized to allow Heatran to function as a special sweeper later in the game, especially with its ability to switch in fairly easily thanks to its handy typing. Running a Timid nature is an option if you want Heatran to be guaranteed to survive Azelf's Psychic + Explosion, but even with Naive, Azelf will need to roll nearly maximum damage from Explosion and above average damage from Psychic in order to score a KO, and the 10% boost to Heatran's own Explosion is often worth the risk.</p>

<p>Despite its low accuracy, Magma Storm may be used over Fire Blast to bypass the ever-common Focus Sash on leads like Azelf. When combined with Taunt, Magma Storm also allows Heatran to trap opposing Pokemon and forcibly open a set up for one of its teammates. If opposing Heatran is of no concern, then Will-O-Wisp can be considered over Earth Power for catching all of the physical attackers that love to try and set up versus Heatran, such as Gyarados, Kingdra, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Dragonite.</p>

<p>This set benefits most from partners that can switch into the leads which Heatran has trouble against, namely Aerodactyl, Infernape, Machamp, and Swampert. Gyarados is a great choice to consider pairing with this set because not only can Heatran set up on Infernape, Machamp, and Swampert with relative ease (especially if it switches in as the opponent uses Stealth Rock), but it also provides Heatran with a good Water- and Ground-type resistance and immunity, respectively. Against Aerodactyl, anything not weak to Rock or Ground will be of decent consideration to pair with this set. Suicune and her bulky defenses allow her to take on all three of the aforementioned leads relatively well and she can also dispose of other Water-types which switch into Heatran with Hidden Power Electric. However, Suicune does not provide Heatran with the same type resistances that Gyarados does.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Fire Blast
move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Toxic / Explosion
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid / Naive
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Heatran is one of the best Pokemon at forcing switches in the game. Because of this, Substitute is a great move choice, as it eliminates the guesswork often needed to nail its switch-ins. Fire Blast and Earth Power provide respectable coverage, and Toxic really hurts the many bulky Water-type Pokemon that tend to switch into Heatran. Explosion is also a great option for a more offensively-paced team, as they usually don't pack any Pokemon that can put Toxic's stacking damage to use.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Heatran should be sent out against something that will likely switch out, such as Celebi or a Steel-type. It is often useful to send Heatran out for the first time after your opponent KOes one of your Pokemon; most players assume it has a Choice Scarf and will switch out. This, along with Heatran's powerful offense and great resistances, allows Heatran to easily get up a Substitute. Then Heatran can stall with Toxic, using Fire Blast and Earth Power for the Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon that are immune to Toxic. Most of Heatran's switch-ins, like Dragonite, Tyranitar, and Water-types, hate being poisoned.</p>

<p>However, Toxic is less effective if your team is not bulky. You can use Explosion, instead, as it takes out most problem Pokemon in one hit. Few players will predict an Explosion coming from a Heatran behind a Substitute, so they are unlikely to bring in something to take it, like a Ghost-type. Alternatively, Heatran can use Hidden Power to take out Pokemon like Dragonite, Gyarados, or Swampert, if you want a more offensive alternative to Toxic. Heatran can also use Roar to help defensive teams that have Stealth Rock and Spikes. Another option is Will-O-Wisp, but it kills even slower than Toxic and has worse accuracy in exchange for weakening physical moves. If you want to use a move other than Toxic, it is helpful to pair Heatran with Toxic Spikes, but keep in mind that they won't hit Gyarados or Dragonite.</p>

<p>It may seem strange to use a +Speed nature without a Choice Scarf, but due to Heatran's popularity, max Speed can be a huge aid. Heatran can attack before +Speed Breloom and Metagross, neutral nature Gyarados, Dragonite, Heracross, and defensive base 100 Pokemon. These can all OHKO Heatran, so being faster is crucial.</p>

<p>This set partners best with Pokemon that can take advantage of a poisoned Water-type. For this reason, a Water-type of your own makes a decent partner to this set. Curse + RestTalk Swampert is one of the best partners to this set because it can take hits repeatedly, due to Rest, while Toxic wears down the opponent's Pokemon. Swords Dance Scizor, albeit not a Water-type, also pairs well with this set because other Water-types, primarily Gyarados, have no trouble walling the set otherwise. This Heatran also benefits from Wish. This is because you'll be wanting to switch into attacks often, and Heatran is losing HP due to using Substitute. Vaporeon is probably the best option for this due to Water Absorb.</p>

[SET]
name: Life Orb
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Earth Power
move 3: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Electric
move 4: Taunt / Explosion / Substitute
item: Life Orb
nature: Timid / Naive
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Heatran is a great candidate for utilizing Life Orb to further boost its already massive Special Attack stat. This set allows Heatran to act as a fluent sweeper without the restrictions of a Choice item, while maintaining the power needed to achieve certain KOs that Heatran would otherwise miss without the boost Life Orb gives. Although Heatran's Speed stat is somewhat low compared to conventional sweepers, this set still outpaces most bulky teams and can effectively blast huge holes in them. Against offensive teams, Heatran provides a unique combination of resistances and immunities which provides it many opportunities to switch in and lay down the hurt.</p>

<p>Fire Blast is Heatran's STAB move for this set, causing decent amounts of damage to common switch-ins such as Gyarados and Dragonite, while also ruining Scizor, Jirachi, and Celebi. Earth Power is essential in providing Heatran with a way of eliminating opposing Fire-types. The third moveslot is used to hit Water-types that might try to wall Heatran and hit back for super effective damage. Hidden Power Grass should be used if Swampert is more of a concern while Hidden Power Electric works best against Gyarados. For the last moveslot, Taunt, Explosion, and Substitute are all great options that benefit this set. Taunt negates any of your opponent's attempts to heal or set up. Explosion is an option that complements this set by providing a surefire way of taking out Blissey, OHKOing even max Defense versions after Stealth Rock, and other Pokemon that resist your Fire-type attack of choice. Finally, Substitute eases prediction at the cost of 25% of Heatran's HP each time it is used.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Expert Belt can be used over Life Orb to bluff a Choice Scarf. Many players will attempt to set up on what they believe to be a Choiced Heatran only to be promptly KOed by a super effective attack (or Explosion). In any case, a Naive nature is recommended when running Explosion in order to deal as much damage as possible; otherwise, a Timid nature should be used. Special Attack and Speed are maxed to provide Heatran with the best sweeping potential, being able to 2HKO non-bulky Dragonite with Fire Blast after Stealth Rock and outpacing all neutral base 85's and below. It is possible to run a Modest nature along with Overheat over Fire Blast and Stealth Rock in the last slot if you are interested in using Heatran as an effective anti-lead.</p>

<p>This set benefits greatly from Stealth Rock support, ensuring that Heatran gets the 2HKO on 4/0 Gyarados and Dragonite with Fire Blast. Azelf and Swampert can both efficiently lay down Stealth Rock. Azelf is particularly useful because it can Taunt opposing leads that might try to set up Stealth Rock and can use Explosion to create a free switch-in for Heatran, giving it more chances to attack if it comes in unscathed. Swampert is a reliable lead that has much more durability than Azelf, and it is also great for luring out Will-O-Wisps that provide Heatran with a free Flash Fire boost. Heatran also covers Swampert's weakness to Grass.</p>

<p>Paralysis support is also a decent option to consider, giving Heatran a much easier time in taking down opposing Pokemon that otherwise outspeed it. Celebi is a great candidate to take this role, as it can not only use Thunder Wave effectively, but it also provides Heatran with valuable resistances to Fighting, Water, and Ground. Finally, Choice Band Scizor also pairs well with this set as Bullet Punch can take out foes Heatran has weakened. Specifically, Scizor works great at taking out weakened Gyarados and Dragonite that might attempt to set up on Heatran.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Fire Blast / Overheat
move 2: Earth Power
move 3: Hidden Power Grass
move 4: Dragon Pulse / Flamethrower
item: Choice Specs
nature: Modest
evs: 40 HP / 252 SpA / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Heatran's plethora of resistances, natural bulk, ridiculously high Special Attack, and mediocre at best Speed all scream for Heatran to use Choice Specs. With this set, Heatran can come in on many occasions and just blast away, hitting even those that resist its attacks for a lot of damage. Because its Speed stat is not built for sweeping, this set is probably the best way for Heatran to deal immediate and significant damage on offensive teams. The move options provide Heatran with amazing coverage, allowing it to KO any and all of its switch-ins with perfect prediction.</p>

<p>The boost from Choice Specs coupled with STAB in the form of Fire Blast or Overheat provides Heatran with a nearly unmatched level of power. Even Blissey risks being 2HKOed by a Flash Fire-boosted Fire Blast after Stealth Rock damage, and anything that doesn't resist Fire will be permanently destroyed. Between Fire Blast and Overheat, Fire Blast deals more damage over two turns with no Special Attack drop, while Overheats deals much more damage on the first turn and has slightly better accuracy. Earth Power will OHKO opposing Heatran that might try to nab a free Flash Fire boost, and Hidden Power Grass will 2HKO the majority of Water-types. For the last slot, Dragon Pulse and Flamethrower are both decent options to consider. Dragon Pulse can be used to eliminate Dragonite or Kingdra, both common switch-ins to Heatran, while Flamethrower deals consistent damage and also helps you sweep later in the game if you are using Overheat.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>While not as much of a team supporter as the other Heatran sets, Choice Specs Heatran is worth considering as a high powered special sweeper, and will greatly benefit most teams. The Speed EVs allows Heatran to outrun Jolly Tyranitar and Adamant Metagross. Max Special Attack is a must to deal as much damage as possible. Running a +Speed nature can be considered at the risk of some crucial 2HKOes, such as those on bulkier Water-types.</p>

<p>This set, much like the Life Orb set, benefits from entry hazards to further weaken the opponent. Smeargle is a good choice to lay down both Spikes and Stealth Rock early in the game, also having access to Spore to cause further trouble for the opponent. At the very least, Stealth Rock should be used to guarantee a 2HKO on 4/0 Gyarados and Dragonite; Spikes, in turn, will make it easier to land KOes on Blissey and Water-types like Suicune.</p>

<p>Individual Pokemon that pair well with this set are Rotom-A and Scizor. Rotom-A works well at taking out Water-types with its STAB Thunderbolt and respectable 105 base Special Attack stat, while Trick can be utilized to further incapacitate Blissey. Finally, Scizor is a great Pokemon to lure out Fire-type attacks which can nab Heatran a Flash Fire boost. Additionally, Scizor makes a great check to Dragonite and Gyarados (provided Scizor packs Quick Attack), both being threats this set must watch out for.</p>

[SET]
name: Torment
move 1: Torment
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Protect
move 4: Lava Plume / Taunt
item: Leftovers
nature: Calm
evs: 244 HP / 36 SpA / 12 SpD / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Torment, combined with Heatran's impressive set of resistances and considerable bulk, turns Heatran into one of the toughest Pokemon to KO in the game. The idea behind this set is that not many Pokemon carry more than one attack powerful enough to break Heatran's Substitutes. With that in mind, Torment allows Heatran to stay safe by using Protect to prevent its opponent from breaking its Substitute with their STAB or super effective attack. That means that every other turn, Heatran can attack with Lava Plume for free without having to worry about being damaged. This set slowly chips away at Heatran's opponent while maintaining Heatran's Substitute at the end of the duel when they faint.</p>

<p>Lava Plume is the move of choice on this set, due to its high PP and 30% burn rate. Many Heatran switch-ins (such as Gyarados, Tyranitar, and Swampert) do not like getting burned. The chance to burn also helps slowly drain the opponent's HP, meaning Heatran does not even have to attack. Instead, it can alternate between Substitute and Protect to rack up residual damage. Taunt is an interesting option over Lava Plume for dealing indirect damage. It prevents Pokemon from healing and forces them to attack Heatran's Substitutes in vain. When combined with Torment, Pokemon such as mono-attacking Blissey and Suicune will struggle every other turn, allowing Heatran to beat certain Pokemon that would otherwise completely counter it; however, Taunt also makes Heatran lose to other Pokemon which Heatran would normally be able to beat. In fact, any Pokemon with more than one attack, or a faster Pokemon with Taunt will be able to beat this set unless they are afflicted with a status condition.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Although this set is effective on its own, with the proper team support it can single-handedly run through a team. If Heatran's teammates manage to set up two layers of Toxic Spikes before it comes in, Heatran (especially those with Taunt) will beat Blissey, Swampert, Vaporeon, Milotic, Porygon2, and other common switch-ins lacking Rest. This brings up the bane of this set: Rest + Sleep Talk stat uppers. Pokemon such as Suicune, Snorlax, Swampert, and Tyranitar running the aforementioned strategy can walk all over this Heatran. This is why it is suggested that this Heatran is partnered with a Choiced Trick supporter or two to prevent these set up Pokemon from beating it. On top of that, remember that any Choiced Pokemon will Struggle against Torment Tran, which makes Tricking a Choice item an all around superb support option for this set.</p>

<p>The HP EVs allow Heatran to hit its highest Leftovers number, which is very important, considering Heatran will be seeing a lot of Leftovers recovery with this set. The Speed EVs bring Heatran to 244 Speed, beating Jolly Tyranitar at 243. Adding some Speed EVs may not be a bad idea, though, as that will let Heatran set up a Substitute up before being hit by Celebi's or Zapdos's Thunder Wave&mdash;something very important for this set. The Special Defense EVs allow Heatran to take 24% max from a neutral-natured, 0 Special Attack Rotom-A's Discharge, meaning they will never break its Substitute. This is important because Heatran really doesn't want to get randomly paralyzed from Discharge. The Special Attack EVs ensure that Heatran does a minimum of 33% to max HP Machamp, meaning that the Rest + Sleep Talk sets will be 3HKOed. Heatran also doesn't have to worry about Dynamic Punch thanks to Torment. Heatran always 3HKOs bulky Rotom-A, so not even the Rest + Sleep Talk versions can stop it.</p>

<p>The three biggest non-Resting threats to this set are Gyarados, Swampert, and non-Choiced Heatran. The first two usually carry two moves that can break Heatran's Substitutes, while resisting Lava Plume. It is therefore recommended that Heatran be paired up with Celebi, which can handle Gyarados and Swampert. Also, the CeleTran combo is always great in terms of synergy. Tyranitar also makes a great support Pokemon for this set by providing it a reliable Heatran switch-in, while also setting up Sand Stream, which will chip away at opposing Pokemon without damaging Heatran.</p>

item: Shuca Berry / Wide Lens / Passho Berry
nature: Modest
evs: 128 HP / 216 SpA / 164 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The purpose of this Heatran is to trap your opponent's switch-in with Magma Storm and deal with it accordingly. This set is designed to eliminate most of Heatran's common counters, including Swampert, Blissey, and Dragonite. Magma Storm does not only force opposing Pokemon to stay in, but it deals 6.25% of extra damage at the end of every turn, allowing Heatran to do just enough damage to score KOs that it otherwise would not be able to. Much like other baiting sets, the purpose of HeaTrap is to help clear the way for other Pokemon to sweep later on by eliminating common counters. What separates this set from the pack is that once Heatran lands a Magma Storm, Heatran's opponent cannot switch out to scout if it is indeed a bait set or not; the KO is essentially guaranteed.</p>

<p>With the given spread and nature, Swampert and Blissey cannot survive Hidden Power Grass or Explosion, respectively, after Magma Storm and Stealth Rock damage. With Shuca Berry, Heatran can also survive an Earthquake from the standard Swampert, Gliscor, and Hippowdon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Speed EVs allow Heatran to outpace neutral-natured Scizor. Alternatively, a spread of 128 HP / 164 Def / 216 SpA may be used to guarantee that a max Attack Dragonite with Life Orb can never KO Heatran with Earthquake even after Stealth Rock damage. This spread makes for a slower Heatran but still guarantees the same KOs previously listed.</p>

<p>If you are not concerned about Dragonite, which takes a hefty amount of damage switching into Magma Storm anyway, then you may want to consider Wide Lens over Shuca Berry. The biggest drawback to this set is obviously Magma Storm's poor accuracy, which can be somewhat alleviated with Wide Lens, giving it an effective accuracy of 77%. Passho Berry is also an effective item choice, as it allows Heatran to withstand blows from Starmie, Suicune, and other Water-type Pokemon, and KO back with Hidden Power Grass or Explosion.</p>

<p>If you pack a powerful Pursuit user on your team, then you may also want to consider Taunt over Explosion. With Taunt and Magma Storm, Heatran can prevent Blissey from healing, switching, or using a status move. You can then switch in your Pursuit user to seal Blissey's fate without sacrificing Heatran. If eliminating Blissey is your main objective, then running Taunt with Explosion will guarantee a KO on Blissey, which can no longer Protect on your Explosion. Taunt also allows Heatran to beat some of its other counters, such as Vaporeon, which won't be able to heal anymore and takes a hefty hit from Hidden Power Grass. The biggest selling point of Taunt combined with Magma Storm, however, is that it allows you to switch in another sweeper and score a free boost as your Taunted opponent switches out, assuming they can't hurt your sweeper directly. Finally, if you do not pack a solid Heatran counter on your team, Earth Power is a great option for ensuring that enemy Heatran cannot come in for free. However, if you choose to use Earth Power, it is highly recommended that Shuca Berry be your item of choice, as you do not want to lose to an opposing Heatran's Earth Power.</p>

<p>This Heatran set should be used primarily as a support Pokemon; it works very well on teams that have Pokemon that share the same counters as Heatran. Teammates that benefit from this Heatran set include Tyranitar and Dragonite, which enjoy the absence of Swampert. Offensive Suicune, offensive Zapdos, and Sub Petaya Empoleon are also excellent team options because they have a much easier time sweeping once Blissey is gone. You should also consider teammates that can take advantage of Tyranitar, Gyarados and Vaporeon, which are the three most common Heatran counters that this set cannot reliably deal with. Gliscor serves as a great Tyranitar check that also has an easy time switching into Fighting- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Heatran, and Celebi and Vaporeon do an excellent job at covering Gyarados and Vaporeon. It is also recommended that you set Stealth Rock up before getting this Heatran out, as it nets a lot of kills with the extra damage that Stealth Rock provides. If you are looking for a purely offensive Heatran, then other sets might prove more effective. However, when it comes to taking out the threats mentioned, no Pokemon does a better job than HeaTrap.</p>

evs: 248 HP / 56 SpA / 204 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Heatran lacks any form of recovery outside of Rest, its large number of resistances and above average defenses makes it an excellent status absorber and special wall. Typically, it would be better to choose a special sponge that has access to instant recovery, but Heatran is sturdy enough that it doesn't matter. On top of that, its huge Special Attack stat makes it a difficult wall to switch into. With Heatran's decent typing and good defenses it can easily take on special attackers such as Celebi, Rotom-A, Jirachi, Zapdos, and many others. With the help from Lava Plume's Burn and Earth Power's Special Defense drop, this set can even beat Blissey one-on-one, which most other Heatran cannot claim.</p>

<p>Lava Plume makes physical attackers think twice before switching in, as a 30% burn rate is nothing to scoff at. Fire Blast, on the other hand, carries significantly more raw power, and Sleep Talk makes Fire Blast's low PP a non-issue. However, since this is a defensive set, Lava Plume is still the primary option because it provides better team support. Earth Power has excellent coverage with Lava Plume, hitting Fire- and Rock-types that resist it. Additionally, if this Heatran is on a team with Spikes support, Roar makes a great option over Earth Power. Because of its large number of resistances, Roar makes it extremely difficult to take Heatran out, as opponents are forced to rely on luck of the draw to bring out something to deal with Heatran. While asleep, Heatran also loses the negative priority of Roar if it happens to select it with Sleep Talk, allowing it to "speed shuffle."</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A more offensive spin on the Rest + Sleep Talk set is achieved by changing to Timid nature, using an EV spread of 248 HP/ 36 SpA / 224 Spe, and giving Heatran a Life Orb. This outruns Adamant Heracross. This variation functions as a sweeper by giving Heatran back its monstrous Special Attack and decent Speed, and at the same time retaining the ability to shrug off status and heal itself. Note that Fire Blast should be used in this case, as the extra power is significant.</p>

<p>This set has trouble against Pokemon that resist the combination of Fire and Ground, which includes, but is not limited to, Flygon, Dragonite, and Gyarados. As such, Suicune makes a decent partner to this set for her ability to take on all three of the noted Pokemon, to some extent. Particularly, a Suicune with Ice Beam and Hidden Power Electric works best here, as it survives attacks from even Dragonite and Gyarados with +1 Attack while packing enough power to OHKO both.</p>

<p>Toxic Spikes support also works decently with this set to further make use of Heatran's durability. Mainly, Toxic Spikes should be considered to eliminate Water-types which wall this set entirely, while even allowing Heatran to outstall Blissey and cause havoc to Pokemon immune to Toxic Spikes with Lava Plume's 30% burn rate. Roserade is a good candidate for laying down Toxic Spikes which also packs a handy resist to Heatran's weakness to Water-type attacks.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Combine base 130 Special Attack, 120 Base Power Fire Blast, and the Special Defense-reducing Metal Sound, and Heatran becomes an extremely potent threat in the OU metagame. With Metal Sound, Heatran can combat Pokemon that it otherwise cannot, such as Blissey, Tyranitar, and bulky Water-types. Because of this, Heatran can more effectively threaten its common switch-ins, making it harder to check.</p>

<p>After taking a Metal Sound, even Pokemon that resist Fire Blast will take huge amounts of damage. Earth Power and Hidden Power Grass are used for type coverage. The former hits Tyranitar and opposing Heatran, while the latter hits Water-types that constantly shut down Heatran. It should be noted that the majority of Tyranitar hold Choice Scarf, so take caution if you decide to stay in and go for the kill. In OU, only Dragonite resists this combination of moves; however, if Heatran is able to hit it with Fire Blast after a Metal Sound, it is in for a deadly surprise.</p>

<p>Below are several damage calculations demonstrating the power Timid Heatran's Life Orb-boosted attacks have against threatening opponents hit by Metal Sound.</p>

<li>Fire Blast vs 0 HP / 0 SpD Rash Dragonite: 87.3% - 103.1%</li>
<li>Fire Blast vs 0 HP / 0 SpD Jolly Dragonite: 79% - 93%</li>
<li>Fire Blast vs 24 HP / 232 SpD Calm Blissey: 46% - 54%</li>
<li>Earth Power vs 160 HP / 0 SpD Adamant Tyranitar: 89% - 100%</li>
<li>Hidden Power Grass vs 188 HP / 0 SpD Bold Vaporeon: 92% - 100%</li>
<li>Hidden Power Grass vs 252 HP / 0 SpD Bold Suicune: 87% - 100%</li>
</ul>

<p>The strategy to using this set effectively is to switch Heatran in on a Pokemon that it can threaten instantly, such as Rotom-A or Jirachi, and use Metal Sound while your opponent switches out. Once that has been accomplished, proceed to hit the switch-in with the most appropriate attack.</p>

<p>Although Heatran can hit hard after using Metal Sound, it usually will not obtain the KO, as some of its common counters, such as Starmie and offensive Suicune, will outspeed and threaten it. In order to remedy this situation, Heatran can use a Passho Berry so it can withstand a Water-type attack before securing the KO. Dropping some of its Speed EVs for HP EVs gives it enough bulk to withstand these Water-type attacks; an ideal spread to use would be Modest and 88 HP / 252 SpA / 168 Spe. This spread allows Heatran to survive a Timid Life Orb Hydro Pump from Starmie and easily KO back with Hidden Power Grass off of its --2 Special Defense from Metal Sound. Heatran also withstands a Hydro Pump from offensive Suicune and OHKOes it with Hidden Power Grass after Stealth Rock damage and sandstorm in play. Heatran can also outspeed CroCune and 2HKO it. Furthermore, this spread is fast enough to outrun max Speed Adamant Scizor and most Magnezone. Although the suggested spread provides a decent amount of bulk for mid-game survivability, there are other options that can be used. You could opt to use 224 Speed EVs to outspeed defensive Zapdos, defensive Celebi, non-Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and neutral-nature 36 Speed Jirachi; however, you could opt for more bulk and simply settle for outrunning CroCune, which would require a mere investment of 80 Speed EVs.</p>

<p>Since Heatran appreciates the use of lures to bring in Pokemon that it can set up on, that should be taken into account when using this. Jirachi is a great lure for Rotom-A, allowing Heatran to come in without much worry and gain a potential Flash Fire Boost from Will-O-Wisp or, in Rotom-H's case, Overheat. Another great teammate to use is Gengar, which can lure in Choice Scarf Jirachi and Choice Band Scizor. Entry hazard support is also strongly recommended as it helps Heatran score the needed KOs that it otherwise could not achieve, such as against Dragonite. Metal Sound also tends to force switches, racking up entry hazard damage on the opponent. Swampert makes a great Stealth Rock supporter with its overall bulk, and it also lures in Grass-types, such as Celebi, which Heatran can take advantage of. Skarmory is one of the most reliable Spikes users in the OU metagame, making it a prime candidate for setting them up. It also attracts Fire-type attacks and Rotom-A, which Heatran can switch into without much fear.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set focuses more on Heatran's decent bulk and unique typing instead of its offensive power. As such, this Heatran is best used on teams with a stall-based approach. Although Heatran lacks an instant recovery move, which is usually preferred on a special sponge, it is sturdy enough to take a couple of special hits. Besides, Heatran's base 130 Special Attack stat makes it a very difficult Pokemon to switch into, even without EV investment.</p>

<p>Lava Plume is Heatran's preferred attack move, as it has high PP and a 30% chance to burn the opponent, which is always beneficial for specially defensive Pokemon. Flamethrower is also an option due to its higher Base Power. Earth Power is a great move to use alongside Heatran's STAB move as it provides decent coverage, especially against opposing Heatran trying to obtain a Flash Fire boost. Protect has two functions: it allows Heatran to scout Choice users, reducing the need for prediction, and it gives it an additional turn for Leftovers recovery, while in the meantime letting your opponent take extra residual damage. Roar is another useful move on this set, especially with entry hazard support. Heatran forces a lot of switches, so phazing your opponent's team will cause even more residual damage. Roar also allows you to scout your opponent's team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Below are some damage calculations which effectively portray Heatran's amazing special bulk:</p>

<ul class="damage_calculation">
<li>Choice Scarf Heatran Earth Power - 70.5% - 83.9%</li>
<li>Choice Scarf Shaymin Earth Power - 59.1% - 70.5%</li>
<li>Life Orb Shaymin Earth Power - 76.7% - 91.2%</li>
<li>Life Orb Gengar Focus Blast - 61.1% - 72%</li>
<li>Life Orb Jolteon HP Fighting - 31.6% - 37.3%</li>
<li>Choice Specs Jolteon Thunderbolt - 37.3% - 43.8%</li>
</ul>

<p>An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 156 SpD / 100 Spe is usable, and a Calm nature will still give Heatran decent defensive capabilities, while the extra Speed allows it to outrun Rotom-A that run no Speed EVs. With this spread, Heatran can take out weakened versions before they can hit it.</p>

<p>Heatran has a huge number of support moves it can utilize. Either Toxic or Will-O-Wisp can easily fit over Protect or Roar. Take note that if you decide to use Will-O-Wisp, Flamethrower should be your main offensive move. Stealth Rock is an option on Heatran as well if you desperately need someone to lay it down. Taunt is also useful, and can find its way into this Heatran's moveset. Taunt almost completely shuts down opposing stall teams and prevents status moves from being used on Heatran and its teammates. Rest provides Heatran with a somewhat reliable recovery move, but two turns of sleep is a letdown, and makes Heatran setup fodder for a variety of Pokemon.</p>

<p>Offensively, Heatran also has access to a variety of useful moves. Fire Blast or Overheat can be used if you want a more powerful STAB move, but on a defensive Pokemon like this Heatran variant, a reliable move with decent PP is preferred over sheer power. Using Dragon Pulse instead of Earth Power can help against Dragonite and Flygon that are locked into Outrage. Hidden Power Electric and Hidden Power Grass can also help against Gyarados and Swampert, respectively.</p>

<p>Since this is a defensive variant of Heatran, Toxic Spikes are greatly appreciated. A Rapid Spin user is also nice, as Heatran needs as much HP as possible to maintain its defensive capabilities. Forretress does both of these things while also luring Fire-type moves so that Heatran can get a safe switch-in, making Forretress a great teammate. Since Heatran lacks a reliable recovery move, Wish support is a good idea. Vaporeon and Blissey can do this, but, in Blissey's case, watch out for the shared weakness to Fighting-type moves. RestTalk Roar Gyarados also makes a great teammate as it covers Heatran's weaknesses quite well, while its Intimidate also helps in covering Heatran's weaker Defense.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hidden Power Electric can be used to nab a surprise kill on Gyarados, especially if they suspect Heatran is Choiced. Hidden Power Rock gets 2HKOes on both Gyarados and Dragonite while also hitting opposing Heatran for neutral, easing prediction on Choiced sets. However, running either will leave Heatran completely walled by Swampert. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast on most sets if you prefer accuracy at the cost of some important KOes. Dragon Pulse is an option on sets other than Choice Scarf to hit Kingdra, Dragonite, and Flygon for super effective while also maintaining neutrality on Gyarados and other Water-types. As far as items go, Shed Shell can be used to escape Dugtrio and Magnezone's clutches while a Salac Berry can be used on Substitute sets to gain a Speed boost and possibly sweep.</p>

<p>Never underestimate Heatran's bulk and support move options. By using a Modest Nature and Leftovers with the spread 252 HP / 16 SpA / 240 SpD, Heatran can always survive a Life Orb Shadow Ball followed by a Focus Blast from Gengar and OHKO back with Overheat. Utilizing Will-O-Wisp on such a specially bulky set allows Heatran to also cripple physical sweepers as well, making it a very tough Pokemon to take out. Finally, when going the utility route, it could be useful for Heatran to set up Stealth Rock while enduring hits, and even use Roar to shuffle opponents and pile on the entry hazard damage.<p>

<p>Do not be tempted to use moves like Dark Pulse, Flash Cannon, and Ancient Power. Their type coverage is poor, and Heatran's Fire Blast will hit for the same or greater damage on nearly everything in OU.</p>

<p>Always maximize Heatran's Special Attack unless you are running a defensive set. Then decide what you would like to outrun. 128 EVs and a Modest nature beats Adamant Tyranitar. Modest and 216 EVs beats Jolly Tyranitar and Adamant Metagross. On the Scarf set, just maximize Speed. You don't want to lose a Speed tie with another Scarftran if it comes down to it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Vaporeon, Swampert, Milotic, Slowking, and Tentacruel can counter Heatran quite effectively, but Specs boosted Hidden Power Grass and Earth Power can take them down. Suicune is the best of these, as her high defenses allow her to take an Explosion as well as most special attacks, she is faster than the defensive Heatran sets, and her Pressure forces Heatran to watch its remaining Fire Blast PP. Gyarados can handle Heatran on occasion, but Stealth Rock, potential burns, and the occasional Hidden Power Electric are a nuisance. Porygon2 is an interesting counter. It traces Flash Fire and isn't weak to any other moves. Porygon2 can then paralyze Heatran and wear it down with Thunderbolt, using Recover as necessary. Kingdra can come in on Heatran and set up unless it switches into a Dragon Pulse.</p>

<p>Blissey is a fairly good counter to Heatran, provided she has some means of hitting it. With the increase in Fire-type attacks thanks to Scizor, getting a Flash Fire boost is easier, which means Blissey might have to take boosted Fire-type attacks. Explosion also gets rid of Blissey, but at the cost of Heatran's own life. Heatran counters itself as long as it doesn't come into Earth Power. Adamant Choice Scarf Dugtrio can trap and KO Heatran no matter the set, and Magnezone does the same if Heatran is locked into a Hidden Power or Dragon Pulse.</p>

<p>Snorlax can come into Heatran with relative impunity thanks to Thick Fat and can threaten it back with Earthquake. Hariyama does the same, but uses Fighting-type attacks instead. Like Blissey, both will fall to Explosion. A Careful Tyranitar can shrug off any hits not boosted by Choice Specs, even Earth Power, which barely 4HKOes.</p>
