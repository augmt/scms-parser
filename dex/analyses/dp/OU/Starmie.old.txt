[Overview]

<p>Starmie is a fairly diverse Pokemon, capable of filling both offensive and support roles. Its high Speed, great coverage, and immediate power cement it as one of OU's top special sweepers. Starmie can also take advantage of its resistances with a defensive set that supplies Rapid Spin support. Unfortunately, its Psychic secondary typing gives it a weakness to Pursuit, and the move's omnipresence means that Starmie must always be on the lookout. Despite this, Starmie is one of the most effective Pokemon in OU, and is an asset to almost any team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Starmie's blazing Speed and great type coverage make it a fearsome special sweeper that is especially potent as a late-game cleaner against offensive teams. Hydro Pump is a powerful STAB attack that OHKOes most Tyranitar after one Stealth Rock switch-in and Scizor after two. It is so intense that it 2HKOes Swampert, Jirachi, and Metagross, and even some Pokemon that resist Water, such as Breloom and opposing Starmie. Ice Beam and Thunderbolt are used to hit bulkier Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks, such as Celebi, Dragonite, Suicune, and Vaporeon. With Recover, Starmie can switch into Heatran and Infernape with greater ease while being able to heal off damage taken from Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil.</p>

<p>Starmie is also an excellent offensive spinner if it runs Rapid Spin over Recover. Rotom-A, the primary OU spinblocker, will be extremely reluctant to switch into Starmie, as Starmie's Life Orb-boosted Hydro Pump OHKOes offensive variants and 2HKOes defensive versions. Forgoing Recover decreases Starmie's longevity, but it may not get many chances to use Recover against offensive teams in the first place, while a successful spin can be the deciding factor in a battle.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As Hydro Pump has less-than-stellar accuracy, Starmie can instead use Surf as a reliable attack to take down Pokemon like Infernape. The extra firepower that Hydro Pump provides, however, is needed to secure several OHKOs and 2HKOs, specifically against Swampert, Scizor, Tyranitar, and 252 HP Jirachi. If Starmie carries Rapid Spin in the last slot instead of Recover, it makes an effective anti-lead. It resists many of the attacks that common leads use (such as Infernape's Fire Blast and Close Combat, Azelf's Psychic and Fire Blast, and Metagross's Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch) and can use Rapid Spin to simultaneously dispatch of Focus Sash users and their set up entry hazards. This makes Starmie particularly effective in dealing with suicide leads like Infernape, Aerodactyl, and Azelf. Grass Knot is recommended over Thunderbolt or Ice Beam on a leading Starmie in order to OHKO Swampert. If Starmie is using Recover in the last slot, shifting a few EVs into its defenses will let Starmie switch with greater ease into Pokemon like Infernape and Heatran.</p>

<p>Starmie can use both Rapid Spin and Recover on this set, dropping either Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. This allows it to heal with impunity against many Pokemon common to stall teams, such as Blissey, Gyarados, Hippowdon, and Heatran, which increases its chance of spinning away entry hazards. The drawback is that Starmie performs slightly worse against offensive teams; if you drop Ice Beam, Celebi, Shaymin, and Dragonite will have a field day, while losing Thunderbolt means Gyarados and Suicune can set up. If your team can clear out those Pokemon, though, this alternative is a great middle ground between Starmie's two most popular sets.</p>

<p>In spite of Starmie's formidable offensive prowess, it has problems getting past a few specific Pokemon. Blissey and Snorlax are the best counters for offensive Starmie; Blissey can use Seismic Toss and Toxic to wear down Starmie, while Snorlax can hit back with Body Slam, Crunch, and Pursuit. Speaking of Pursuit, Starmie is not as afraid of Pursuit as most other Psychic-types because it can maim or OHKO many common Pursuit users, such as Tyranitar and Scizor, with its STAB Hydro Pump. However, if Choice Scarf Tyranitar manages to switch into Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Rapid Spin, or Recover, it can threaten Starmie with its higher Speed and both Pursuit and Crunch. Scizor survives Hydro Pump as long as it switches into Stealth Rock only once, but it must essentially sacrifice itself to take Starmie out. Finally, Choice Scarf users, such as Jirachi and Rotom-A, do well against Starmie if they switch into a resisted move.</p>

<p>This set is easy to use, especially if Starmie is forgoing the use of Rapid Spin. Stealth Rock is highly recommended since it has wide distribution and will weaken the opposing team, which makes Starmie's late-game sweep easier. While Spikes are harder to set up, they can turn Starmie's Hydro Pump from a 2HKO into an OHKO against bulkier opponents. Finally, Toxic Spikes are valuable primarily because they allow Starmie with Recover to break through Blissey, but also to wear down Pokemon like Swampert, Suicune, and Snorlax.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Starmie is a fine choice for spinning away entry hazards. While Forretress, the other common OU spinner, is slower than Rotom-A and is neutered by Will-O-Wisp, Starmie is faster and can use STAB Surf to combat Rotom-A. Surf also provides a reliable weapon to use against Infernape and Heatran, as their hits are buffered by this set's defensive investment. With Thunderbolt, Starmie is an excellent counter to Gyarados. Recover keeps Starmie at high health, which lets it perform its countering and spinning duties reliably throughout the match.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are tailored for survivability while still taking advantage of Starmie's high Speed. 252 Speed EVs are used to Speed tie with opposing Starmie and Azelf, which gives you a chance to finish them off in a clutch scenario. If you are particularly concerned about Adamant Life Orb Dragon Dance Gyarados, using a spread of 136 HP / 156 Def / 216 Spe will ensure that Starmie is never KOed by +1 Earthquake or Stone Edge after Stealth Rock; this spread maintains Starmie's ability to outpace Gengar and Infernape. Max HP is more effective in most other instances, though, especially for switching into Heatran. If you wish to drop Starmie's Speed further, aim for 300 (Adamant Flygon and Timid Rotom-A), 288 (Jolly Gyarados), or 280 (neutral Lucario and Timid Heatran). In any case, remaining EVs should go in HP.</p>

<p>Grass-type Pokemon can also be particularly annoying since this set gives them a more-or-less free switch-in. Heatran, Skarmory, Forretress, Zapdos, and Flygon can all help deal with Shaymin and Celebi to an extent, but the versatility those Grass-types exhibit means it is impossible to find a perfect switch-in for all situations. Starmie can carry Ice Beam instead of Thunderbolt to ward off these Grass-type Pokemon, but it will no longer be able to counter Gyarados. Oftentimes, just the threat of Thunderbolt will cause Gyarados to switch out. Regardless of whether it runs Ice Beam or Thunderbolt, this set's low damage output gives Dragon Dance Kingdra free reign to set up. Using a few bulky Steel-type Pokemon like Scizor, Metagross, or Skarmory can help patch up this weakness.</p>

<p>Pursuit users are not too bothersome for the Life Orb set due to its heavy investment in Special Attack, but they can prey on bulky Starmie since its Surf is relatively weak. If Tyranitar or Scizor aren't substantially weakened, it's impossible to "escape" from Pursuit. There are a number of Pokemon you can use as teammates to compensate for Starmie's Pursuit troubles, though. The classic example is Lucario, which can take advantage of a Choice-locked Pursuit to set up a potentially game-winning Swords Dance. However, if Starmie gets Pursuited in the early game, Lucario may have a tough time sweeping if it tries to set up immediately. Other Pokemon, such as Substitute Machamp, Skarmory, and Dragon Dance Gyarados, can also set up on Pursuit. If Scizor traps Starmie, Magnezone can turn the tables and trap it in return. Substitute + Will-O-Wisp Rotom-A is a good way to lure and cripple Tyranitar, but Scizor are usually not very eager to switch in until it has scouted Rotom-A's set.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Band Tyranitar and Scizor have historically been able to tank Starmie's hits and retaliate with Pursuit. This Starmie set aims to alleviate this Pursuit weakness that has hampered Starmie and provide considerably more bulk than the standard spin set, allowing Starmie to act as sturdier pivot. The most common Pursuit Tyranitar set is currently Choice Scarf Tyranitar, which always fails to OHKO Bold Starmie after Stealth Rock with Crunch, allowing Starmie to spin in a pinch. The given EVs allow Starmie to outspeed Adamant max Speed Lucario, and, by extension, other neutral nature base 90s and Timid Heatran. An additional 20 EVs in Speed allow Starmie to outpace Jolly Mamoswine and although Starmie should not be used as a primary Mamoswine check, the additional bulk allows Starmie to switch into Mamoswine a couple of times.</p>

<p>The choice between Thunderbolt and Reflect depends on what is a better fit for the team Starmie is being used on. Thunderbolt is more common because it allows Starmie to function as a reliable Gyarados check that can also deal some damage to bulky Water-types such as opposing Starmie or Suicune. Reflect softens the blows from harder hitting Pursuit users such as Choice Band Scizor and Choice Band Tyranitar and can also provide direct team support. The choice between Hydro Pump and Surf lies mainly in personal preference. Hydro Pump is less accurate, but its extra power allows Starmie to quickly wear down Rotom-A, while Surf deals damage more consistently. One major upside of using Hydro Pump is that it allows Starmie to 2HKO Heatran, even if it is holding a Passho Berry, something that Surf cannot do. Although Starmie was once considered the ultimate Infernape counter, Bold Starmie must be careful switching into Infernape because a coverage move followed by Grass Knot will 2HKO Starmie, and Starmie no longer outspeeds Infernape.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As mentioned previously, the added bulk of Bold Starmie helps to alleviate the Pursuit weakness that Starmie has. This has made Bold Starmie an excellent choice to act as both a spinner and a bulky Water-type for stall teams. However, at only 280 Speed, Starmie no longer outspeeds Gengar and does not outspeed most Rotom-A, barring defensive RestTalk sets. In order for Starmie to spin more easily, a Pursuit user makes an excellent teammate. In particular, Choice Scarf Tyranitar can switch into Gengar's Shadow Balls as well as any of Rotom-A's assaults thanks to a buffed Special Defense stat and can remove them from play. If your team does not worry about Gengar, a mixed Tyranitar set is also an excellent choice, because it can still remove Rotom-A from play with Pursuit and, by feigning a Choice Scarf set, can surprise otherwise troublesome Pokemon such as Breloom and Forretress.</p>

<p>Ice Beam can be used on Starmie to deal more damage to Pokemon such as Breloom and Dragonite, but even with the added bulk a Bold nature provides, Starmie has little business switching into either one. If Starmie is being used as the spinner on a hail team, Blizzard is an excellent option, 2HKOing Shaymin and Zapdos as well as OHKOing Breloom. When using an Ice-type attack on Starmie, 287 Speed is more appropriate than 280. As for other teammates, Starmie appreciates having a teammate that can easily switch into Grass-type Pokemon. Specially defensive Skarmory does an excellent job switching into Grass-types and setting up Spikes. Heatran is another Pokemon that can come into Grass-types and can run a variety of different sets, including but not limited to a specially defensive set to handle Electric-types that scare Starmie off and a Choice Scarf set to beat Pokemon like Dragonite and Swords Dance Scizor.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With excellent Speed and respectable Special Attack as well as a diverse movepool, Choice Specs suits Starmie perfectly. STAB Hydro Pump deals massive damage to almost every Pokemon, including those with a resistance to Water-type moves. Tyranitar, Scizor, Lucario, Gengar, and Rotom-A are all OHKOed, while Swampert, Breloom, and Machamp are soundly 2HKOed. Even offensive Dragonite and Gyarados are 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam are fairly obvious choices to hit the Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks. Thunderbolt nets coverage on Vaporeon, Suicune, and Gyarados, while Ice Beam covers Dragonite, Celebi, and Shaymin. Finally, Trick lets Starmie cripple overzealous Blissey.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set's goal and playstyle are similar to those of the Life Orb set, so naturally the sets share teammates and counters. One difference is that while Life Orb Starmie cannot do anything to Blissey, Choice Specs Starmie can cripple her by Tricking its Choice Specs away. Even though that heavily decreases Blissey's effectiveness, it also puts a damper on Starmie's ability to sweep, so Blissey should still be seen as a threat to this set. Although Hydro Pump cleanly OHKOes Tyranitar and Scizor, two common Pursuit users, Starmie is still vulnerable if it is caught while using Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, or Trick. To minimize this risk, Starmie should only use a move other than Hydro Pump or Surf when absolutely necessary. Also, Pokemon that can take advantage of a Choice-locked Pursuit, like Lucario, Infernape, Gyarados, and Machamp, are good teammates.</p>

<p>Since Choice Specs Hydro Pump is considerably more damaging than Life Orb Hydro Pump, Pokemon that appreciate Starmie's ability to wear down common Pokemon that resist the Water-type are good teammates. Infernape, Heatran, and Gyarados benefit if Suicune is weakened, while Kingdra, Suicune, Gyarados, and Swampert appreciate the absence of Celebi and Shaymin. Rotom-A, Kingdra, and Dragonite are good ways to maintain momentum after Starmie has used Trick against Blissey and Vaporeon. Finally, it is still important to pack a few counters or checks to these Pokemon even though Starmie will be nailing them with a Hydro Pump that is more powerful than expected, since the weaken-and-sweep strategy means that your offensive core is especially vulnerable to them.</p>

<p>Starmie will be spamming Hydro Pump or Surf the majority of the time, so Pokemon that set up on those attacks are a distinct threat. Calm Mind Suicune, Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Dragon Dance Kingdra can easily set up if they switch in after Starmie has scored a KO. Celebi and Shaymin are both good answers to most Suicune and non-Bounce Gyarados sets. Breloom is a great counter to Crocune, while Blissey easily takes on offensive Calm Mind sets. All three Grass-types also force Kingdra to use Outrage, which lets you beat it with a Steel-type like Metagross or Scizor. Calm Mind Jirachi is a good answer to offensive Suicune and most Dragon Dance Gyarados, and Scarf Rotom-A can check all three. A Gyarados of your own can buffer hits from opposing Gyarados and Kingdra with Intimidate, which lets another one of Starmie's teammates handle them with greater ease.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Putting a Choice Scarf onto Starmie allows it to effectively revenge kill many of the metagame's largest threats, including Gyarados, Gengar, and Heatran, even after their own Speed boosts. This speed, combined with Starmie's good Special Attack and movepool, makes it a great check to all of these threats by stopping them from sweeping your team. Surf is a reliable STAB attack and lets Starmie revenge kill Gengar and Heatran, while Ice Beam and Thunderbolt let it do the same to Dragonite and Gyarados, respectively. Trick is used in the last slot to cripple such counters as Blissey, Vaporeon, Suicune, and Celebi, and also lets Starmie serve as a last-ditch check to Pokemon threatening to sweep your team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Since Starmie doesn't have access to a boosting item with this set, a Modest nature is recommended in order to compensate for the lost power. However, a Timid nature is an option if you are concerned about outpacing Choice Scarf Gengar and Infernape or Life Orb variants of the two after Starmie has Tricked away its Scarf. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam will still OHKO Gyarados and Dragonite, but Surf and Hydro Pump will be noticeably weaker against neutral targets.</p>

<p>This set can be used effectively in the lead slot. If you decide to do that, using Rapid Spin over either Ice Beam or Thunderbolt will allow Starmie to spin away Stealth Rock after it has Tricked its Choice Scarf onto the opposing Stealth Rock lead; Metagross, Swampert, and even Azelf are good targets for this strategy. Additionally, if Starmie is matched up against Forretress or Hippowdon, using Trick on the first turn will usually let you catch a stall team's Blissey or Vaporeon, crippling it for the rest of the match. If you decide not to immediately use Trick, Starmie will retain its role as an effective revenge killer in the later stages of a match. Unfortunately, leading Choice Scarf Starmie lose to U-turn Azelf, Machamp, and Roserade, so you should also carry Pokemon that can beat those leads.</p>

<p>As with the Choice Specs set, Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks will easily set up on Hydro Pump or Surf. This is made far worse here, however, because of the lack of power behind this set. Breloom and Suicune can now take advantage of Starmie. On the other hand, Dragonite and Gyarados cannot exploit this set as readily. With a Choice Scarf, Starmie will be faster than Dragonite and Gyarados even when they have a Dragon Dance, which means it can switch out then immediately switch back in to revenge kill. However, it is still helpful to have Pokemon that can immediately take on these threats. Swampert beats Dragon Dance Dragonite if it's at full health, and plenty of other Pokemon can force an Outrage so you can take out Dragonite with a Steel-type Pokemon. Choice Scarf Jirachi cleanly outpaces Dragonite and can revenge kill it with Ice Punch, Scizor's Bullet Punch strips off over half of Dragonite's health, and Lucario's Extreme Speed does quite a bit as well. Bulky Calm Mind Jirachi defeats Gyarados, as does Rotom-A. Calm Mind Jirachi beats Suicune, as do Celebi and Shaymin. Various bulky Steel-types, such as Metagross and Scizor, beat Kingdra.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Reflect and Light Screen along with Light Clay can be used to support your team. Thunder Wave is always a great move for crippling switch-ins. It is especially useful on Starmie because Ground-types are deterred by the prospect of a STAB Surf or Hydro Pump. A set with Recover, three attacks (Surf, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam), and defensive EVs can be used to counter various threats, but is usually outclassed by Milotic since it must drop Rapid Spin.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Blissey and Snorlax are the most reliable Starmie counters; their massive special bulk allows them to sponge Hydro Pump with ease while striking back with their typical moves. Snorlax also has Pursuit, which can KO a fleeing Starmie. Both of these Pokemon must be careful not to get Tricked a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs, though. Kingdra also loves switching into Starmie and setting up Dragon Dance, since none of Starmie's commonly used attacks can hit it super effectively. Finally, Lanturn resists Hydro Pump, Thunderbolt, and Surf, and also doesn't take much from the rare Grass Knot due to its low weight.</p>

<p>There are quite a few Pokemon that can't switch directly into one or many of Starmie's attacks, but can check it once they get in unscathed. Although most Shaymin and Celebi are 2HKOed by Ice Beam, they comfortably survive Ice Beam from full health and KO Starmie with STAB Grass-type attacks. It's worth noting that it's possible to EV both of these to survive two Life Orb Ice Beams with specially defensive spreads. Zapdos takes lots of damage from Hydro Pump or Ice Beam, but like the previously mentioned Grass-type Pokemon, can survive a single Ice Beam and OHKO Starmie in return. Even though Vaporeon and Suicune fear Thunderbolt, they can fight back with Hidden Power Electric or stall with Wish and Protect in Vaporeon's case. Common Choice Scarf users in Flygon, Rotom-A, and Jirachi all have super effective attacks to use against Starmie if they manage to switch in on a resisted or immune move. Finally, to block Starmie's Rapid Spin, the best candidate is usually Rotom-A, particularly Choice Scarf variants or defensive sets with Special Defense investment.</p>

<p>It would be remiss to complete a discussion of Starmie's counters without a mention of Pursuit users. Tyranitar, Scizor, and Weavile all scare Starmie with their powerful Pursuits, even though they have issues taking Starmie's powerful Hydro Pump. Equipping a Choice Scarf to Tyranitar or Scizor will let them outpace Starmie, so if they switch into Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Rapid Spin, or Recover, they don't have to worry about surviving the incoming Hydro Pump as well. The higher Speed means they can "checkmate" Starmie; it must guess between staying in and potentially eating a Crunch or U-turn, or switching out and potentially getting trapped by Pursuit. Weavile doesn't need to worry about the Speed issue, since it is naturally faster than Starmie.</p>
