[Overview]

<p>With lackluster stats leaving him seemingly outclassed by other bulky Water-types, you might wonder why anyone would use Blastoise in OU. In particular, Starmie greatly outclasses him as a Rapid Spin user because it can take down Rotom-A; Starmie's higher Speed stat also makes it the more useful Pokemon in general. Furthermore, Blastoise fails to deal heavy damage to both Water- and Grass-types, which lets them easily set up on him. Despite this, Blastoise does have one unique niche: he can function as an effective OU anti-lead.</p>

[SET]
name: Lead
move 1: Hydro Pump
move 2: Aqua Jet
move 3: Rapid Spin
move 4: Ice Beam
item: Life Orb / Lum Berry
nature: Modest
evs: 144 HP / 252 SpA / 112 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Blastoise can make an effective OU lead because of his ability to act as a mesh of two other leads; he combines Starmie's spinning capabilities with Empoleon's bulk and access to priority. Hydro Pump hits many leads extremely hard; it is capable of 2HKOing the likes of Metagross, Swampert, Jirachi, and Machamp. Aqua Jet finishes off frail Focus Sash users such as Azelf, Aerodactyl, and Infernape, while Rapid Spin removes Stealth Rock and other entry hazards set up by opposing leads. Ice Beam rounds out the set as a 100% accurate move that can smash through Gliscor and Dragonite leads.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice of item is an important one: Life Orb allows Blastoise to 2HKO Metagross, Swampert, Jirachi, and Machamp leads 100% of the time, and gives him a chance to 2HKO 8/144 Colbur Berry Lead Azelf with Hydro Pump + Aqua Jet. However, Lum Berry lets Blastoise evade status such as sleep and confusion, and hence beat Smeargle and Machamp assuredly. Furthermore, Blastoise maintains about an 80% chance to nab the aforementioned 2HKOs.</p>

<p>A Modest nature and maximum Special Attack allows Blastoise to hit as hard as possible, while 112 Speed EVs let him outrun maximum Speed Jirachi after being Tricked a Choice Scarf; he can then 2HKO Jirachi with Hydro Pump. The remaining EVs go in HP to boost Blastoise's overall bulk. These HP EVs also let Blastoise survive defensive Rotom-A's Thunderbolt and KO back with Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump. No Attack EVs are needed because Aqua Jet should only be used to finish off frail Pokemon and Focus Sash users. One can replace Ice Beam with Hidden Power Electric to prevent Gyarados from setting up, but Blastoise will then be setup bait for Dragonite.</p>

<p>Blastoise has problems with Grass-type leads, such as Roserade and Celebi, because they can immediately threaten him with a STAB Grass-type attack; a partner that resists Grass is therefore helpful. Heatran is a good choice as it can threaten said Grass-types with its Fire-type STAB moves while resisting their STAB attacks; furthermore, after the Special Attack drop from Leaf Storm, neither Hidden Power Ground nor Earth Power will do much to it. Roar Heatran can also deal with Ninjask leads, removing the accumulated boosts by phazing the opposing Pokemon. Specially defensive Roserade can also work if she switches into Leaf Storm, as she has Natural Cure to counter the effects of Sleep Powder, isn't threatened by a -2 super effective Hidden Power, and can absorb Toxic Spikes. Roserade can also switch into Starmie's Thunderbolt, survive Ice Beam, and retaliate with a Grass-type attack.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>With Choice Specs, Blastoise can make use of his access to Water Spout, which dents anything that doesn't resist it. However, the sheer amount of support required to use it effectively--which comprises of a spinner to remove entry hazards, a Fire-type Pokemon to scare away bulky Grass-types such as Celebi and Shaymin, and a Grass-type Pokemon to force out bulky Water-types, namely Suicune and Vaporeon--makes it an inferior option. Should you choose to use such a set, however, Blastoise should run maximum Speed and a Timid nature to outspeed neutral-natured Lucario, or 208 Speed EVs and a Modest nature to outrun positive-natured Tyranitar.</p>

<p>Blastoise can alternatively attempt a defensive Rapid Spin set. However, unlike Starmie, Blastoise fails to deal heavy damage to the premier spinblocker in the OU metagame: Rotom-A. Foresight enables Blastoise to bypass Rotom-A, but he can only do this once as Rotom-A can 2HKO him with Thunderbolt. Other defensive options include Roar and Yawn, which phaze the opposing Pokemon and remove their boosts, as well as Toxic, which cripples incoming Water-types.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Roserade and Celebi can switch into even Life Orb Ice Beam and KO Blastoise with their STAB attacks. Vaporeon, Suicune, and Blissey can all wall Blastoise's attacks and stall him out with Wish, Calm Mind, Toxic, or Seismic Toss respectively. Gyarados and Kingdra can both set up Dragon Dance boosts on Blastoise with near-impunity; the former fears only the rare Hidden Power Electric. Lastly, Rotom-A can switch into Blastoise's attempts at spinning and deal heavy damage with Thunderbolt, but it should be wary of Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump.</p>
