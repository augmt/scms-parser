[Overview]

<p>While Magneton may appear to be outclassed by its evolution, Magnezone, Magneton's higher Speed stat gives it a specific niche. With a Choice Scarf or a Salac Berry boost, Magneton has the ability to outspeed a much bigger portion of Pokemon in the OU tier than Magnezone, allowing it to both revenge kill more threats and avoid being revenge killed while it's sweeping. Magneton still has the rare ability to trap and remove Steel-types from the game with Magnet Pull. When using Magneton, always remember to abuse its higher Speed, or you are better off using Magnezone.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a Choice Scarf attached, Magneton reaches 393 Speed, enough to outspeed many dangerous threats such as Adamant Dragonite and Gyarados after a Dragon Dance, Jolly Tyranitar after a Dragon Dance, and Starmie. Magneton can then proceed to revenge kill all of them with the appropriate move. Thunderbolt OHKOes Gyarados and Starmie, Hidden Power Ice destroys Dragonite, and Flash Cannon can pick off weakened Tyranitar and OHKOes Weavile. Explosion is always a good move to allow Magneton to go out with a bang, potentially taking down an opposing Pokemon in the process. Hidden Power Fire can be used if you want to quickly kill Scizor and Forretress. Note that Magneton will Speed-tie with max Speed Adamant Gyarados if you choose to use Hidden Power Fire.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Signal Beam can replace Explosion in the last spot if you find sacrificing Magneton unappealing, as it can be used to OHKO Celebi and hit Grass-types harder than Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Ground can be used to KO opposing Magneton, Magnezone, and non-Choice Scarf or Shuca Berry Heatran. Discharge is also an option if you want to spread paralysis, but Thunderbolt is usually always better due to the extra power needed to revenge kill opposing Pokemon. Maximum Speed EVs and a Naive or Hasty nature are used so Magneton is as fast as possible while leaving Explosion's power intact. 252 Special Attack EVs let Magneton hit as hard as possible. If you do not want to use Explosion, Timid is the best nature to use.</p>

<p>Pokemon that appreciate Magneton's intrinsic ability to trap and KO Steel-types make great teammates. Dragonite, which resists all of Magneton's weaknesses, loves Skarmory and Scizor being removed from the battlefield. Flygon and Kingdra also appreciate the removal of Steel-types that otherwise stop them cleaning up late-game. Aside from Dragonite, bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon, Suicune, and Swampert make good partners to Magneton because they can easily switch into Fire-type Pokemon (Heatran in particular). Celebi, Breloom, and Shaymin can switch into Ground-type attacks that plague Magneton. Gyarados gets a special mention, because just like Dragonite, it also resists all of Magneton's weaknesses. Magneton will find itself walled by Blissey if it can avoid Explosion. Lucario and Infernape can force out Blissey and set up for a sweep as long as they avoid Thunder Wave. Gliscor can switch into any attack from Blissey apart from Toxic or the rare Ice Beam and Taunt it. Dugtrio can also trap and kill Blissey. Note that opposing Magneton or Magnezone can trap and kill Magneton if it is not locked into Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ground.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes advantage of Magneton's decent Speed and many resistances (Steel in particular) to set up a sweep. The idea is simple: switch in on a resisted attack from an opposing Steel-type, preferably Choiced (for example, Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch), set up a Substitute, and use Charge Beam to raise Magneton's Special Attack. Once the Substitute is broken, Magneton can continue to use Substitute until it reaches 25% HP or less, where its Salac Berry will activate, shooting its Speed stat to 393. Magneton can then proceed to sweep weakened teams with its boosted Speed and Special Attack. Like Agility SubPetaya Empoleon, Magneton has resistances to common priority attacks used in the standard tier while having immunities to Toxic Spikes and sandstorm, as well as a resistance to Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>Substitute, in conjunction with Salac Berry, and Charge Beam are the core of this set, allowing Magneton to increase both its Speed and Special Attack stats, respectively. In the last two slots, there are quite a few options to use. The preferred combination to use is Charge Beam + Flash Cannon + Hidden Power Grass, which gives maximal coverage while being able to OHKO Swampert (which would otherwise wall Magneton). If you prefer to have a stronger Electric STAB, Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice can be used for maximum coverage between two moves. Finally, Thunderbolt and Flash Cannon can be used if you have Pokemon that can reliably weaken or remove Ground-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are quite simple. Max Speed and a Timid nature allows Magneton to be as fast as possible, outspeeding every Pokemon up to base 125 Speed such as Weavile and Choice Scarf Tyranitar. 12 HP EVs allow Magneton to reach a HP stat that is divisible by 4, allowing Salac Berry to activate after three Substitutes. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack to let Magneton deal as much damage as possible.</p>

<p>When Magneton gets going, it is reasonably hard to stop, but there are still Pokemon that can revenge kill it. Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Flygon, Jirachi, and Heatran can all outspeed and destroy Magneton with their respective moves. Jolteon and Magnezone are also relatively safe from Magneton's attacks, since they resist both of its STABs. While rare, Electivire can switch into an Electric-type attack for a Motor Drive boost and proceed to KO Magneton with Flamethrower or Earthquake. Blissey, Snorlax, and Swampert (if Magneton is not using Hidden Power Grass) can all sponge Magneton's attacks with ease and KO back. Dragonite and Gyarados resist all of Magneton's weaknesses and scare off many of the aforementioned threats for set up time. A Swampert of your own can also check most of Magneton's counters. Dugtrio is another neat teammate to consider because it can trap and kill Magnezone and Blissey, while also KOing Jolteon and Heatran locked into an unfavorable move. Celebi can take Fighting- and Ground-type attacks that hurt Magneton and spread paralysis. Pokemon that benefit from Magneton's Steel-trapping ability make good teammates. Dragonite, Flygon, and Kingdra love the removal of Skarmory and other troublesome Steel-types, as they would ruin their sweep otherwise.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>While Magneton has the same movepool as Magnezone, its lack of bulk makes a lot of other options harder to perform, so they are generally better left to Magnezone. Such options include the traditional Substitute SteelKiller set, Choice Specs, and Dual Screens. Magneton also has other moves at its disposal, such as Discharge and Thunder Wave, but again, these moves are better used by Magnezone, which boasts more impressive bulk.</p>

<p>On the Choice Scarf set, one can sacrifice some Special Attack EVs to power up Explosion a little more. However, if one were to add some Attack EVs onto Magneton, make sure that its Special Attack stat does not fall any lower than 327 (which is no less than 204 Special Attack EVs). This is because Magneton will lose the guaranteed 2HKO on Jolly Tyranitar after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Magneton's counters are essentially the same as Magnezone's. Blissey and Snorlax's massive Special Defense lets them take any attack that Magneton can throw at them with ease (barring Explosion). Celebi can also absorb most attacks that Magneton uses, but must watch out for the occasional Signal Beam, which will OHKO it. Lastly, Rotom-A can also switch into Magnezone without much trouble, but must rely on Overheat or Hydro Pump to do significant damage to it.</p>

<p>Depending on which Hidden Power Magneton runs, Flygon, Gliscor, and Swampert can counter Magneton. Zapdos can OHKO any Magneton with Heat Wave, but will detest taking Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Ice. While Choice Scarf Heatran will not enjoy switching into Thunderbolt or the rare Hidden Power Ground, it can outspeed all forms of Magneton and OHKO with a Fire-type move or Earth Power.</p>

<p>Dugtrio can trap and OHKO Choice Scarf Magneton that are locked into Thunderbolt. Opposing Magneton and Magnezone can also trap and KO Magneton that are not using Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Ground. Electivire can switch into Electric-type attacks, obtain a Motor Drive boost, and proceed to OHKO Magneton with Flamethrower, Cross Chop, or Earthquake. Thanks to Volt Absorb, Lanturn and Jolteon can switch into Electric-type attacks with impunity while resisting most of the other attacks that Magneton can throw at them.</p>
