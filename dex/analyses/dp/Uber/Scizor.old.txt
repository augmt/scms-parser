[Overview]

<p>Despite being an OU Pokemon, it is almost as if Scizor was designed for Uber play. Scizor is a superb scout for offensive teams with U-turn, which it gets STAB on. Scizor's STAB U-turns do a massive amount of damage to the many Psychic-type Pokemon in Ubers as well. Bullet Punch is a powerful priority move thanks to it being a STAB move boosted by Technician, meaning that Scizor is easily able to destroy Deoxys-A, and is also able to pick off weakened Pokemon such as Darkrai and Rayquaza. Scizor is one of the few viable users of Pursuit in Ubers, allowing Scizor to trap and kill Pokemon such as Mewtwo and Latias. To sweeten the deal, Scizor even pairs up well with Tickle Wobbuffet, allowing the duo to smash Blissey and Lugia to pieces. Scizor's excellent Bug / Steel typing allows it to take on the powerful Ice-type and Dragon-type attacks that are common in Ubers. Scizor even has access to Roost to take advantage of these great resistances. Overall, Scizor's amazing typing and wonderful movepool make it a force to be reckoned with in Ubers.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to a combination of Scizor's typing, movepool, and offensive stats, Choice Band Scizor is an excellent choice in Ubers for a variety of reasons, the biggest of which being Scizor's ability to revenge kill with Bullet Punch, and its ability to scout Uber teams with U-turn (which hits a large amount of the Uber metagame super effectively.)</p>

<p>U-turn is what makes Choice Band Scizor such a threat in the Uber tier, as it does a huge amount of damage to several prominent threats who may attempt to switch into Scizor. For example, a 4 HP Kyogre (who may switch in predicting a Bullet Punch) takes 52%-61% from a U-turn from the more bulky Choice Band Scizor, and even maximum HP Kyogre will take over 50% from a U-turn from max Attack Choice Band Scizor! Palkia also takes a large amount of damage, as U-turn will always do over 50%, regardless of the EV spread Scizor is using. U-turn will easily OHKO Darkrai, Latias, Latios, and offensive Mewtwo as well. The biggest benefit U-turn provides, though, is the ability to scout the opponent's switch-in to Scizor due to U-turn's switching ability, and thus allows you to switch to a Pokemon who can take advantage of Scizor's checks.</p>

<p>The other defining move of Choice Band Scizor in Ubers is Bullet Punch, which allows Scizor to revenge kill several prominent threats in the Uber metagame. For example, Darkrai is always 2HKOed by Bullet Punch, taking 54%-64% from the more bulky Scizor spread, while taking 62%-73% from max Attack Choice Band Scizor. Shaymin-S will suffer 52%-61% from bulky Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch, while it will take 59%-70% from a max Attack Bullet Punch. Rayquaza takes 43%-51% from bulky Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch, which means that Rayquaza will always be 2HKOed after taking damage from Stealth Rock. Maximum Attack Choice Band Scizor does not even need Stealth Rock to 2HKO Rayquaza, as it takes 50%-58% from Bullet Punch. When attempting to revenge kill Garchomp, Scizor must have max Attack. This is because Bulky Choice Band Scizor will only have a 3% chance of 2HKOing Garchomp with Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock (dealing 40%-48% to Garchomp), while a max Attack Bullet Punch will always 2HKO Garchomp after Stealth Rock (doing 47%-55%, which means that there is also a 74% chance that Bullet Punch will 2HKO without Stealth Rock). This is not a problem if your team has Spikes and Stealth Rock support, as Bulky Choice Band Scizor will have a 99% chance of 2HKOing Garchomp with Bullet Punch, after Garchomp takes damage from Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Finally, Bullet Punch will allow Scizor to easily revenge kill Deoxys-A.</p>

<p>Superpower's main use is to hit Pokemon who resist both Bullet Punch and U-turn, such as Forretress, Lucario (although Bullet Punch still does a huge amount of damage to Lucario), opposing Scizor, and, most notably, Dialga. Superpower's best quality is that it can make Scizor into an effective Dialga lure, as Dialga will commonly switch into Scizor, due to the rest of its moves hardly even scratching Dialga. Bulky Choice Band Scizor will have a 92% chance of OHKOing a 4 HP Dialga after Stealth Rock, while max Attack Choice Band Scizor will always OHKO a 4 HP Dialga with Superpower, even without Stealth Rock. Most Dialga with only 4 HP EVs are Choice Scarf Dialga and with it out of the way, Darkrai, Garchomp, Shaymin-S, Swords Dance Lucario, and Swords Dance Rayquaza will have a significantly easier time sweeping. Max Attack Choice Band Scizor also has the bonus of being able to OHKO 120 HP mixed Dialga after Stealth Rock, and having a 79% chance of OHKOing 252 HP Dialga after it takes Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>Pursuit can put Deoxys-A, Mewtwo, and Latias in a tough position. Pursuit will spell doom for Deoxys-A regardless of whether it switches or not (unless Deoxys-A is carrying Hidden Power Fire). Both Mewtwo and Latias are 2HKOed by Pursuit if they stay in on Scizor. If Latias attempts to escape, Pursuit and Stealth Rock will put Latias at low enough health to be KOed by Stealth Rock when it switches in next. Max Attack Scizor will always OHKO both Latias and Mewtwo as they switch from Pursuit, as long as they have taken damage from Stealth Rock beforehand. Finally, max Attack Choice Band Scizor has the bonus of being able to destroy a fleeing Choice Scarf Shaymin-S with Pursuit, as long as it as switched into Stealth Rock once, as the combination of Pursuit and two switches into Stealth Rock will destroy Shaymin-S.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With so many Pokemon being eliminated by Pursuit, Scizor can allow several teammates to have an easier time sweeping. For example, the removal of Mewtwo will allow Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar to have a much easier time sweeping. The destruction of Latias allows Kyogre to smash through teams (particularly the Calm Mind set with Sleep Talk and Rest). Choice Scarf Shaymin-S's elimination makes Rock Polish Groudon much harder to stop. Pursuit's utility is further expanded upon when in use with Tickle Wobbuffet. After Wobbuffet uses Tickle 3 times on the Standard 252 HP / 52 Def Bold Lugia, Pursuit will OHKO it as it flees. In a similar manner, 4 Tickles plus Pursuit will destroy a fleeing Blissey (max Attack Scizor will only require 3 Tickles). Destroying Lugia can open up sweeps for physically-based Pokemon, such as Groudon and Rayquaza, while defeating Blissey will allow Choice Specs Dialga and other powerful special attackers to sweep more easily. Pursuit does have a flaw on Choice Band Scizor, and it is that several powerful Pokemon in Ubers can easily set up on Scizor after it uses it. For example, Rayquaza, Darkrai, Garchomp, Groudon, Dialga, and many more Pokemon can use a Choiced Pursuit as set up time. It is impossible to counter all of the Uber Pokemon who can set up on a Scizor that is locked into Pursuit, thus it is best to use Pursuit only when you have nearly full knowledge of the opponent's team.</p>

<p>Something very important to note about Uber Choice Band Scizor is that it has two equally usable EV spreads that have several advantages and disadvantages over each other. The first EV spread is 200 HP / 56 Atk / 252 SpD. This allows Scizor to not only have reasonable attacking power, but it also allows Scizor to survive a +1 Thunder from Latias. Scizor will also take less from special Dragon-type attacks from powerful foes, such as Palkia. The other EV spread is 248 HP / 252 Attack / 8 Spe. While Scizor loses a significant amount of bulk (most notably, it is OHKOed by a +1 Thunder from Latias after Stealth Rock), in return Scizor gains enough power to turn several 2HKOs to OHKOs.</p>

<p>One of Choice Band Scizor's biggest problems in Ubers is dealing with both Stealth Rock and Spikes at the same time. Due to Choice Band Scizor's lack of a recovery move and the constant switching caused by U-turn, Stealth Rock and Spikes will make Scizor's life very short. Because of this, it is best to use a lead who can stop Deoxys-S from setting up both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Choice Scarf Darkrai is an excellent example of this. Choice Scarf Darkrai outspeeds Deoxys-S, and can either 2HKO (due to Focus Sash) it with Dark Pulse or put it to sleep with Dark Void, which also breaks its Focus Sash due to Bad Dreams. At the worst, Darkrai will only let Deoxys-S get Stealth Rock up. Choice Scarf Shaymin-S can also outspeed and 2HKO Deoxys-S with Air Slash. If Deoxys-S flinches, it will often be unable to even set up Stealth Rock. Tyranitar can stop most Deoxys-S from setting up more than Stealth Rock thanks to Crunch destroying Deoxys-S after the eternal sandstorm breaks the Focus Sash. A lead Metagross can defeat Deoxys-S with a combination of Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch, only allowing Deoxys-S to put up Stealth Rock. Finally, although not a lead, Forretress can use Rapid Spin to get rid of entry hazards. Using Forretress and at Scizor together may seem odd, but it can extend Scizor's life span by quite a bit, thanks to the lack of entry hazards harming Scizor. Choice Band Scizor will also appreciate users of Wish. The best two Pokemon for this job are Blissey and Latias. Blissey can take high powered special attacks (such as Surfs from Palkia) that are aimed at Scizor, while Latias and Scizor resist all of each other's weaknesses. Unlike the other Uber Scizor sets, Choice Band Scizor has some serious problems with being revenge killed by Wobbuffet. If Scizor is locked into any move but U-turn, Wobbuffet can use Counter to easily revenge kill Scizor. There is nothing that can be done if Wobbuffet does this, thus it is best to eliminate Wobbuffet before you use Choice Band Scizor's other moves. A good way to do this is to use either mixed Palkia or mixed Dialga, and pose them as Choice Scarf users. As Wobbuffet switches in on a special attack, you can then slam it with Outrage while it tries to use Mirror Coat, often weakening Wobbuffet beyond the point of usability.</p>

[SET]
name: Trapper
move 1: Pursuit
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Roost
move 4: Bullet Punch
item: Life Orb
ability: Technician
nature: Adamant
evs: 176 HP / 100 Atk / 232 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Scizor is a perfect choice for a Pokemon who can put its opponent into a checkmate position. With Technician, Pursuit becomes a 60 Base Power move if the opponent decides to stay and fight. If the opponent decides to flee, Pursuit's Base Power will double from 40 to 80. While this set may lack the power that Choice Band Scizor has, the ability to freely change attacks more than makes up for the power loss. For example, now that Scizor is not locked into Pursuit, Rayquaza and Darkrai will no longer be able to set up on Scizor, as they can be 2HKOed by Bullet Punch after they take Stealth Rock damage. Although Pursuit will never OHKO Mewtwo, it will still do 51%-61% if Mewtwo stays in, and Mewtwo will take 68%-81% if it dares to switch out. Latias will take 55%-66% from Pursuit if it stays in, while 74%-87% is dealt if Latias switches out. Deoxys-A will be OHKOed, regardless of whether it chooses to switch or stay in.</p>

<p>The given EVs allows Scizor a balance of offense and defense. With the Special Defense EVs, Scizor has the ability to switch into Dragon and Dark Pulses from Latias and Darkrai, respectively. Scizor must be aware of Latias in the rain, however, as Thunder will 2HKO Scizor. With only one weakness, it is easy for Scizor to step into many of these threats and force them to switch out. This makes Roost an excellent option to recover damage from switching in to attacks and entry hazards and out again, or from constant Life Orb recoil. Roost, most importantly, allows Scizor to have a much easier time dealing with entry hazards than when it uses Choice Band. The 100 Attack EVs will allow Scizor to easily OHKO Darkrai with U-turn, and to always OHKO both Latias and a 4 HP Mewtwo with U-turn, after they take damage from Stealth Rock. Bullet Punch will not only destroy Deoxys-A, but will also deal 48% - 57% to Darkrai (a guaranteed 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage), since it resists Pursuit anyway. On top of that, a 379 HP / 216 Def Rayquaza suffers 36% -- 43% from Scizor's Bullet Punch, or a 95% chance of a 2HKO with Stealth Rock taken into account. Shaymin-S will take 46%-55% from Bullet Punch, another guaranteed 2HKO after it takes Stealth Rock damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb is the best item for this set. It guarantees the OHKOs and 2HKOs listed above. If the recoil from Life Orb is a problem, Expert Belt is a fine option to remedy it. Unfortunately, not many Pokemon are hit for super effective damage from Bullet Punch. The only residual damage Scizor should really worry about is indirect damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p>

<p>Thanks to this Scizor's ability to freely switch between attacks, using Pursuit becomes much less risky than using it on Choice Band Scizor, thus Trapper Scizor is one of the best teammates for Tickle Wobbuffet. After Wobbuffet uses Tickle on Lugia 5 times, Scizor will OHKO Lugia with Pursuit while it attempts to flee, regardless of the EV spread that Lugia has. With Lugia out of the way, Swords Dance Lucario, Swords Dance Rayquaza, Bulk Up Dialga, Choice Band Garchomp, Groudon, and many other physical attackers will have a much easier time sweeping. After Tickling Blissey 4 times, Wobbuffet will allow Scizor to OHKO a fleeing Blissey with Pursuit. With Blissey eliminated, Choice Specs Dialga, Latios, Latias, Mewtwo, Shaymin-S, and many other hard hitting special attackers will be extremely difficult to wall.</p>

<p>This particular Scizor set will have huge problems with Dialga, as it not only walls this Scizor's moveset, but is also an extremely unpredictable Pokemon who can cost you a game if you make a bad switch in. When dealing with Dialga, always check to see if it recovers any health from Leftovers. If Dialga is holding Leftovers, it is likely using either a Bulk Up set or a support set. Bulk Up Dialga is best handled by Groudon, as Groudon can a 2HKO Dialga who has used Bulk Up once with Earthquake. Although Lucario takes a massive amount of damage from a +1 Outrage, a Life Orb Lucario can set up a Swords Dance on Bulk Up Dialga, and then OHKO it with Close Combat. Both Lugia and Skarmory can take Bulk Up Dialga's assaults, and use Whirlwind to get it out of the way. Support Dialga will often carry either a Fire-type move or Thunder to get rid of Steel-types. A Specially Defensive Groudon can switch into even a support Dialga's Draco Meteor, and do a severe amount of damage with Earthquake. If Dialga is not holding Leftovers, then it is likely to be using on of its offensive sets (usually either a mixed attacker, Choice Scarf, Choice Specs, or Choice Band user). Although a risky choice, a Garchomp equipped with either Life Orb or Choice Band can switch into both the Thunders and Fire-type attacks that Dialga will attempt to hit Scizor with, and then OHKO it with Earthquake, but you must be extremely wary of switching into a Dragon-type move. Blissey is able to easily wall any Dialga set that lacks a physical move, and can cripple Choice Scarf Dialga with Thunder Wave.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is designed to beat several common leads in the Uber metagame. The EVs give Scizor just enough attack to beat common leads, and enough bulk for Scizor to be a useful switch-in to Dragon-type assaults, and restore its health later with Roost. With Bug Bite and Bullet Punch, Scizor is able to defeat Deoxys-S with ease. Because Bug Bite followed by a Bullet Punch that will destroy Deoxys-S, even those who carry Focus Sash, Deoxys-S will be forced to either switch out or only set up Stealth Rock in exchange for its life. Deoxys-S leads that carry Reflect and Light Screen will be foiled by Brick Break destroying its screens, and then Deoxys-S will be destroyed itself via Bug Bite and Bullet Punch. Deoxys-S will also be unable to OHKO Scizor with any move it has; not even Hidden Power Fire and Fire Punch will not OHKO this Scizor! Darkrai leads are also beaten thanks to Lum Berry. Darkrai will be unable to OHKO Scizor with any move it uses, while Scizor will always OHKO Darkrai with Bug Bite (and will be destroyed by Bullet Punch the following turn if holding a Focus Sash). Mewtwo leads will be beaten in a similar manner to the way Darkrai leads are destroyed, as Mewtwo leads will almost never be able to fit a Fire-type attack into their move sets. Choice Scarf Shaymin-S leads are 3HKOed by Bullet Punch, while Shaymin-S is only able to 3HKO Scizor with Air Slash, which means that Scizor will win due to Bullet Punch's priority. Scizor does have a chance against Tyranitar leads as well. Tyranitar will be unable to OHKO Scizor with Flamethrower without a significant EV investment in Special Attack, and will only have a 28% chance of OHKOing Scizor with Fire Punch when using 116 Attack EVs and a neutral nature. Scizor in return, will always outspeed and 2HKO Tyranitar leads with Brick Break. Be warned though, because if the Tyranitar is using a +Attack nature, it will have a much higher chance of OHKOing Scizor with Fire Punch. If you do not want to risk this, Groudon can be switched in to scare off Tyranitar.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>There are several leads who you should be prepared for whenever using Uber lead Scizor. Kyogre can take any of its attacks, and either 2HKO it with Surf (if Kyogre is the Thunder Wave lead) or OHKO it with Water Spout. Lead Groudon can easily take Scizor's attacks, thanks to its massive Defense stat, and can use the time to either 2HKO Scizor with Earthquake, OHKO Scizor with Fire Punch, or lay down Stealth Rock. Lead Dialga resists Bullet Punch, and can easily OHKO Scizor with Flamethrower, or predict the switch and set up Stealth Rock. Scizor can pair up well with a Specially Defensive Groudon, as this type of Groudon can survive even Draco Meteors from Dialga, and threaten to do a severe amount of damage with Earthquake. Like with Trapper Scizor, Life Orb or Choice Band Garchomp can switch into Dialga's Flamethrower, and threaten to destroy Dialga with its STAB Earthquakes. Blissey is able to wall both lead Kyogre and lead Dialga with no problems thanks to its massive Special Defense stat. Palkia and Latias can also be used to defeat lead Kyogre, but be warned that many lead Kyogre carry Thunder Wave for the purpose of crippling Palkia and Latias. Bulk Up Dialga works extremely well with lead Scizor in this case, as it can use most lead Kyogre as set up time. Since most lead Groudon do not carry Fire Punch, Shaymin-S can be switched in to scare off Groudon with the threat of a STAB super effective Seed Flare. Skarmory can switch in on Groudon, and set up Spikes if Groudon lacks a Fire-type attack. A Bulky Kyogre (preferably with a Bold nature, Rest, and Sleep Talk) can scare Groudon off with the threat of hitting it with STAB super effective Surfs boosted by the rain. Finally, Giratina can be used to weaken lead Groudon with Will-O-Wisp.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set may seem odd at first, as unlike all the other Scizor sets, this set focuses on Scizor's defenses. While this may seem like a waste of Scizor's great Attack stat, Scizor's wonderful Bug- / Steel typing and Roost allow it to take on the many Dragon- and Ice-type attacks in Ubers.</p>

<p>U-turn is on this Scizor for a number of reasons. When the opponent sees that a Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Palkia, can not even 4HKO this Scizor with Spacial Rend, they will often switch to a better way to deal with Scizor. U-turn will let Scizor scout and damage the opponent's next switch-in, and let you switch to a Pokemon who will beat your opponent's Pokemon. U-turn will also be Scizor's best weapon against Latias and offensive Mewtwo, who will take 63% - 75% and 59% - 70% respectively. Darkrai will also take 74% - 87% from Scizor's U-turn, weakening to the point where almost any priority move can KO it. Bullet Punch, while being much weaker than usual, is still a great move on Scizor because it lets it easily OHKO Deoxys-A before it can move, and allows Scizor to revenge kill several weakened Pokemon. For example, Bullet Punch will deal 32% - 38% to Darkrai, 30% - 36% to Shaymin-S, and 25% - 30% to Rayquaza. Note that all three of these Pokemon are 3HKOed by Bullet Punch, after taking Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>The final move slot has many viable moves to choose from. The first is Brick Break. Brick Break's main purpose is to break both Light Screen and Reflect. This is extremely useful in Ubers, as users of both Light Screen and Reflect (such as Mewtwo) have the potential to set up not only deadly sweepers (such as Groudon and Rayquaza), but also Baton Pass Mew. Baton Pass Mew is incredibly hard to stop when both Light Screen and Reflect are up, thus Scizor's Brick Break can make teams centered around Baton Pass Mew much easier to stop. Light Screen is another good move to choose. As mentioned before, many Choiced Pokemon who are locked into an unfavorable attack will switch out, thus allowing Scizor to set up Light Screen, which will make the hard hitting Special threats that may switch into Scizor (such as Kyogre and Dialga) much easier for the rest of your team to handle. Knock Off is another viable option on Scizor. Knock Off's item removing effects will annoy common Scizor switch-ins, such as Forretress and Giratina, as neither will like losing their Leftovers recovery, especially since they lack a recovery move, or a reliable one in Giratina's case. More importantly, Knock Off will allow Scizor to potentially reveal the sets of the many unpredictable Pokemon of Ubers. This is especially great against Dialga, who is not only a huge threat to Scizor, but to the rest of your team due to its unpredictability. With its item seen and removed, guessing which set Dialga is using becomes a far less dangerous task. Finally, Toxic can be a useful move for Scizor to use. Toxic can greatly shorten the life of common Scizor switch-ins, such as Kyogre, Groudon, and Palkia, and will also let Scizor beat Lugia. Toxic can be used to poison Pokemon, such as Garchomp and Palkia, who are locked into Outrage, allowing you to rack up some poison damage when they use their most powerful move. Be warned though, several of Scizor's other common switch-ins (such as Forretress, Giratina, and Dialga) will not care about Toxic at all.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs and nature are crucial to how this set plays. The 244 HP EVs and 76 Defense EVs allow Scizor to never be 2HKOed by a Choice Band Outrage from Garchomp after taking Stealth Rock damage and gaining Leftovers recovery. An Adamant Choice Band Dialga will only have a 10% chance of 2HKOing this Scizor with Outrage as well. Thanks to this bulk, Scizor will often be able to take both physical and special Dragon-type assaults, an extremely valuable quality in Ubers. The Special Defense EVs and the Careful nature allow Scizor to survive a Latias's Dragon Pulse followed by a Thunder, even after Stealth Rock. With such a large amount of Special Defense, this Scizor will have no problems taking resisted Choice-boosted attacks, such as Palkia's Spacial Rend and Choice Specs Kyogre's Ice Beam. To makes this even sweeter, the combination of Scizor's heavy investment in Special Defense, HP, and Leftovers allows Scizor to never be 2HKOed by an unboosted Thunder from Timid Palkia, Dialga, or Kyogre. This allows Scizor to switch into half of Choice Scarf Kyogre's moveset (Ice Beam and Thunder), and will keep Scizor safe from any of Choice Scarf Dialga's non Fire-type attacks. Groudon should always be considered as a teammate for bulky Uber Scizor, because, thanks to Groudon's eternal sunlight, even Choice Specs Palkia will be unable to 2HKO Scizor with Surf with Stealth Rock support! Kyogre's rain can also be very useful to this Scizor, as it can let it live through Flamethrower from Dialga or Palkia with enough health left to possibly recover later. Roost furthers Scizor's ability to take these powerful special attacks, and is especially valuable considering that the only other viable Steel-type Pokemon in Ubers with access to an immediate recovery move is Skarmory, who has an unfortunate weakness to Thunder and less Special Defense. The 22 Attack EVs are simply there to let Scizor have an extra bit of power, but feel free to move these EVs to either Defense or Special Defense if you feel the extra power is not needed. Something to note is that as bulky this Scizor is, Latias will have an 80% chance of 2HKOing Scizor with Thunder, if Scizor switches into its Thunder, after Stealth Rock damage. Also, a Modest Choice Specs Dialga has a small chance of doing the same with Draco Meteor. To solve this, you can use the spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD with a Careful nature. With this spread, Latias will only have a 6% chance of 2HKOing Scizor with Thunder after Stealth Rock, while Choice Specs Dialga will never be able to 2HKO Scizor with Draco Meteor. This alternate EV spread comes with a consequence though; Scizor will often be 2HKOed by a Choice Band Garchomp's Outrage after it takes Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>While this Scizor set will take on Choiced Pokemon very well, Pokemon who bluff a Choice item (such as Kyogre, Dialga, and Palkia), but are carrying a different items can cause huge problems for bulky Uber Scizor. Thus, it is best to look for information that can reveal whether or not the opposing Pokemon is carrying a Choice Scarf. For example, if Dialga and Kyogre recover their health via Leftovers, this means that you should switch Scizor back out, as Dialga and Kyogre are bound to do a massive amount of damage to Scizor. Life Orb damage will also give away Kyogre's, Dialga's, and Palkia's item. Palkia will often use Lustrous Orb as well, so it is best to be very careful when facing Palkia. If for any reason these Pokemon are not carrying items, then Latias and Garchomp will prove to be excellent partners for Uber bulky Scizor. Latias will be able to easily take Kyogre's Water-type assaults, and easily set up Calm Minds as Kyogre struggles to do much damage to Latias. Both Life Orb and Choice Band Garchomp can take the Thunders and Fire Blasts Dialga aims at Scizor, and then OHKO Dialga with Earthquake. Both Latias and Garchomp can take the Fire- and Electric-type attacks that Palkia aims at Scizor, and then outspeed and OHKO it with their STAB Dragon-type attacks.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Scizor may be slow, its access to Bullet Punch (which deals more damage than Rayquaza's Extreme Speed), superb typing, and Roost set it apart from Rayquaza and Lucario. Another significant selling point of Swords Dance Scizor as a late game sweeper is that it can easily set up on Forretress, a Pokemon who normally gives Scizor trouble.</p>

<p>After one Swords Dance, Scizor is capable of OHKOing Pokemon such as Darkrai, Shaymin-S, and even Rayquaza with Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock damage. Roost is incredibly useful on this set. Scizor's typing gives it many opportunities to heal against or potentially set up on foes, such as Choice Scarf Pokemon locked into a resisted attack, as well as defensive Pokemon, such as Forretress and Blissey. For the last move, Bug Bite is the main choice, as it ensures that Scizor will easily OHKO Wobbuffet after a Swords Dance, as well as Mewtwo, Latias, and Latios before a Swords Dance. Scizor can also easily 2HKO even the bulkiest Groudon, and will even OHKO 4/0 Groudon after Spikes or Stealth Rock damage (if you have Life Orb). Superpower can be used to hit Dialga, as well as OHKO Heatran on the switch before a Swords Dance. Finally, Scizor can use U-turn to scout with early on in the match before sweeping once the opponent's Steel-type resisters are KOed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Stealth Rock support is highly recommended for Scizor, because it relies on it to gain several KOs after a Swords Dance. Spikes and Stealth Rock support together is also welcome, as this will allow Life Orb Scizor to always OHKO Garchomp with a +2 Bullet Punch, while Metal Coat Scizor will always OHKO Mewtwo with a +2 Bullet Punch.</p>

<p>Scizor has several viable items to choose from: Life Orb, Metal Coat, and Leftovers. Each of them have some specific advantages and disadvantages. Life Orb will grant Scizor the most power. In addition to boosting the power of Bullet Punch, it will also boost the power of Scizor's other attacks. This is especially useful against Lugia, as the extra power Life Orb grants Bug Bite will allow Scizor to sometimes OHKO Lugia after it takes Stealth Rock damage. Even if Lugia puts up Reflect, Bug Bite will still do enough damage to force Lugia to restore its health with Roost, thus allowing you to KO it in its Bug-type-weak state. While Metal Coat won't offer as much power and doesn't boost anything other than Bullet Punch, its main advantage over Life Orb is the lack of recoil, thus allowing Scizor to last longer on the battlefield (which is especially important if Scizor is your main Dragon-type resister). This is particularly useful if you decide to use U-turn, as the recoil from Life Orb and entry hazards can quickly drain Scizor of its health. Finally, if you are content with losing more KOs, Leftovers can be a good choice to give Scizor more survivialbility.</p>

<p>Swords Dance Scizor's biggest foes are Pokemon who resist Bullet Punch and can hit back with a Fire- or rain-boosted Water-type attack. This means that Palkia, Dialga, Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Heatran will usually shut Scizor down effectively. If you use Life Orb Scizor you can use Bug Bite on the switch; it will deal such a massive amount of damage to Palkia and minimum HP Kyogre that they will almost always be in the KO range of Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock damage. In a similar manner, if you decide to use Superpower, you can OHKO Dialga and Heatran switch-ins. Thunder Wave Kyogre can easily switch into Heatran and Ho-Oh's Fire-type attacks with some Speed investment, and OHKO them with Surf. It can also paralyze Palkia, allowing you to OHKO with a +2 Bug Bite or Superpower. In a similar vein, Latias can easily switch into Kyogre, Palkia's non-Dragon-type attacks, or even set up on Choice Scarf Heatran. Garchomp can easily OHKO Heatran, Palkia, and Ho-Oh with Earthquake, Outrage, and Stone Edge respectively, as well as dealing massive damage to Dialga with Earthquake. Finally, a Heatran of your own can defeat most Dialga, and take advantage of Choice Scarf Palkia's Fire-type attacks (watch out for Surf in the rain, though).</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Baton Pass is a very viable move for Uber Scizor, because it allows Swords Dance Scizor to take advantage of Forretress switch-ins, and attempt to pass the Swords Dance to powerful physical attackers such as Groudon, Rayquaza, and Garchomp. Occa Berry is a very viable option in Ubers when paired with Kyogre's eternal rain, because this will let Scizor survive even Fire Blasts from Dialga and Palkia!</p>

<p>The Trapper set can also work with a much more defensive EV spread such as 246 HP / 16 Atk / 248 SpD using an Adamant nature and Leftovers. With this, you're able to take two Thunders from most Latias. This spread, or something similar, can also be beneficial in OU, allowing you to switch in on threats like Gengar much easier and KO with Pursuit. Bullet Punch will still be strong, but isn't going to OHKO like it can with the more offensive sets.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>In the Uber environment, Ho-Oh is one of Scizor's best counters. Even with Stealth Rock on the field, Ho-Oh can easily come in on any of Scizor's attacks, and destroy Scizor with Sacred Fire, regardless of the weather. Giratina will also wall Scizor's entire moveset, and either cripple Scizor with a burn from Will-O-Wisp, or set up Calm Mind. Lugia with Reflect have no problems taking any of Scizor's attacks. Lugia must be careful if it lacks Reflect though, as Scizor's STAB Bug-type attacks will do a huge amount of damage to Lugia when it uses Roost (due to losing the Flying typing when using Roost). Groudon can take Scizor's assaults thanks to its massive 140 base Defense stat, and either 2HKO Scizor with Earthquake or OHKO Scizor with a Fire-type attack.</p>

<p>Dialga can switch into Scizor's Bug-, Steel-, and Dark-type attacks with ease, and either set up with Bulk Up or OHKO Scizor with a Fire-type attack. Dialga must be wary though, as a Choice Band Superpower from Scizor can OHKO Dialga. Kyogre can take a Bullet Punch from Scizor, thanks to its resistance, and threaten to destroy Scizor with its insanely powerful STAB, rain-boosted Water-type assaults. Palkia can also switch into Scizor's Bullet Punch, and either annihilate it with its STAB rain-boosted Surfs, or roast Scizor with a Fire-type attack. Be warned, however, as both Kyogre and Palkia will take a massive amount of damage from U-turn and Superpower.</p>
