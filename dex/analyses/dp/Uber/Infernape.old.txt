[Overview]

<p>Although Infernape may seem to be outclassed by other Uber attackers, it certainly has several key advantages. Infernape's unique Speed stat and offenses combined with its large movepool allow it to become a deadly wallbreaker in the Ubers environment. Although it may not be as powerful as other wallbreakers, such as Rayquaza, Palkia, and Dialga, it still has a number of qualities that many Uber Pokemon would kill for. This includes an immunity to Will-O-Wisp, access to STAB Close Combat which allows it to destroy Blissey without being forced to use Outrage, and U-turn for potent scouting. Infernape can be a real force in the Uber tier if played right and it should definitely be accounted for when making your team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Infernape's high Speed stat, large movepool, and decent offenses turn it into one of the most threatening mixed attackers and wallbreakers in the Uber tier. Once in, the flaming monkey will swiftly deliver a 2HKO to even the toughest of Uber walls, except Giratina.</p>

<p>The set's play style is simple -- get Infernape in on a Pokemon whom it can scare out or on a weak resisted attack and proceed to let loose. Close Combat is Infernape's main attack, and while one might think that it may be ineffective in Ubers with so many Psychic-types running around, it still absolutely mauls quite a few Pokemon. Blissey, Dialga, Tyranitar, and Heatran are all OHKOed, while Palkia, Garchomp, and Kyogre are all 2HKOed. Fire Blast KOes all Groudon after they have switched into Close Combat once, burns most Steel-types to a crisp, and 2HKOes Mewtwo. With Stealth Rock support, Lugia is KOed by a combination of Fire Blast and Stone Edge. Overheat is also a viable option. It almost always OHKOes Mewtwo if the sun is shining, and it will also OHKO Lugia after Stealth Rock damage provided Blaze is activated. Speaking of Blaze, with it activated, Infernape's Fire Blast/Overheat attacks will become quite deadly - the latter is so strong that it 2HKOes Naive Giratina-O after Stealth Rock damage! U-turn allows Infernape to scout the opposing team while also doing massive damage to the many Psychic-types, like Latias and Latios, who may want to switch in on Infernape. Stone Edge OHKOes Rayquaza and Ho-Oh without question, as well as also 2HKOing Lugia after Stealth Rock damage, just in case the weather is not favorable.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set has massive problems with Giratina, Giratina-O, Latias, and Latios. All four resist both of Infernape's STAB moves, do not take much from its other attacks, and can retaliate with their STAB Dragon-type moves. However, Latios and Latias must be wary of U-turn, which deals significant damage and also allows the Infernape user to bring in a counter for free. Also, note that slower variants of Latias are outsped, preventing them from effectively checking Infernape. Mewtwo is faster than Infernape and has a powerful Thunder with which to 2HKO Infernape. Physically defensive Kyogre can also come in on anything, bar Close Combat, and drown Infernape with Surf. Rayquaza also resists both of Infernape's STAB moves and has Extreme Speed to pick it off. Finally, any Choice Scarf user, such as Dialga, Palkia, and Garchomp, is extremely threatening to Infernape, as it can easily KO the flaming monkey before it gets a chance to react. Choice Scarf Dialga is an excellent answer to Giratina, Giratina-O, Rayquaza, Latios, Latias, and Mewtwo (although Dialga must watch out for potential Aura Spheres that might be aimed at Infernape), as it outspeeds and OHKOes all of them with Draco Meteor. Latias counters Kyogre very well, thanks to her superb bulk and powerful Thunder; she can also deal with both formes of Giratina if she has enough health. Scizor has U-turn and Bullet Punch to easily pick off Latios, Latias, Mewtwo, and Rayquaza locked into Outrage. Groudon provides sunlight to power up Fire Blast and it deals with most Rayquaza and Choice Scarf Garchomp very well with its high Defense stat. Wobbuffet's Shadow Tag ability and access to Counter and Mirror Coat allow it to trap and KO Choice Scarf users, as well as some Latios, Latias, and Mewtwo, quite easily.</p>

<p>Infernape is rather hard to switch in because he is very frail. Wobbuffet is a good Pokemon to pair with Infernape since the blue blob can Encore stat boosting and status moves, which are rendered useless by Safeguard, to help Infernape get in safely. Using someone like Latias who attracts moves like Pursuit can also help Infernape get a free switch in. Getting it in on something it can scare out, such as Blissey, a Choice-user locked into a move Infernape resists, Forretress, Skarmory, Bronzong, or Tyranitar can also help. Infernape's good Speed and formidable offensive might means that he is a good choice to send out after one of your other teammates falls in battle.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Flare Blitz
move 2: Close Combat
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Shadow Claw / Stone Edge
item: Choice Band
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The use of Choice Band eliminates Life Orb recoil while still allowing Infernape to pose a huge offensive threat. The main draw of this set is Flare Blitz, which when coupled with the sunlight, can 2HKO almost everything in Ubers. Although the recoil will quickly KO Infernape, this set is more designed to be a hole puncher than a sweeper.</p>

<p>Provided the weather is sunny and Stealth Rock is up, Infernape can OHKO Ho-Oh and 2HKO Lugia, most Giratina-O, Latias, Rayquaza, Latios, Impish Groudon, and Garchomp with Flare Blitz, despite the fact that most of those Pokemon resist Fire-type attacks! Flare Blitz will also OHKO any Steel-type Pokemon not named Heatran. Should Blaze be activated, Infernape's Flare Blitz can even 2HKO Palkia! Close Combat allows Infernape to OHKO Palkia after a layer of Stealth Rock and Spikes have been put down, and it 2HKOes even physically defensive variants of Kyogre. It also gives Infernape a back up sweeping attack in case the weather is not in its favor. U-turn allows Infernape to scout for counters, and it also deals enormous damage to Mewtwo, Latios, Latias, and Darkrai. Shadow Claw allows Infernape to 2HKO Giratina-O after Stealth Rock damage just in case the weather is not sunny. Stone Edge is also a worthwhile option to always OHKO Rayquaza and Ho-Oh. It also always 2HKOes Lugia after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Groudon is highly recommended for use alongside this set because it provides the sunlight that makes Flare Blitz so deadly. Groudon can also help Infernape by paralyzing things such as Latias and Latios, allowing Infernape to 2HKO with its STAB moves before they can Recover off the damage or OHKO Infernape. Groudon can also set up Stealth Rock, which is absolutely required for this set for Infernape to grab the KOes mentioned previously.</ p>

<p>Giratina is the only Pokemon who can switch in on this set without any fear at all. Its huge HP means that Infernape will wear itself down quickly with recoil damage, and Shadow Claw only 5HKOes Giratina factoring in Leftovers. For this reason, packing a reliable Giratina counter is highly encouraged. Bulk Up Dialga is a good partner for Choice Band Infernape, as Giratina cannot do anything to it at all while Dialga can Bulk Up as much as it wants, Rest off Giratina's burns, and eventually KO Giratina with its powerful Outrage. Infernape can also help out Dialga by weakening Groudon. Flare Blitz will often do so much damage to Groudon that, at the cost of sacrificing Infernape, it will be left too weak to fight off Dialga. Aside from this, the same partners from the previous set also work well with this one.</p>

<p>Unlike the other Infernape sets, Wobbuffet can be a serious problem, as it can switch into a Choiced Close Combat, Stone Edge, or Flare Blitz in the rain and threaten to KO Infernape with Counter. Unfortunately, because Wobbuffet has no true counters due to Shadow Tag, the best thing you can do is attempt to lure in Wobbuffet with mixed attackers that bluff a Choice Scarf, or use Close Combat sparingly early in the game.</p>

[SET]
name: Lead
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: U-turn
move 3: Fire Blast / Overheat
move 4: Close Combat
item: Focus Sash
nature: Naive
evs: 252 Atk / 44 SpA / 212 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Infernape's good Speed allows it to set up Stealth Rock quickly and reliably against nearly every lead while also being able to cause some damage later in the game, making it a good choice of lead for an offensive team.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock is Infernape's best support move, and it is highly beneficial to Infernape's teammates, helping them to secure more KOs. U-turn allows Infernape to scout the opponent's team while breaking Deoxys-S's or Deoxys-A's Focus Sash, allowing you to go to a priority user or a faster Pokemon to finish them off. It is highly recommended to have either priority or a Choice Scarf user along with this Infernape to minimize the layers of entry hazards Deoxys-S or Deoxys-A is able to put down, lest your team be hacked apart by the combined damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes. Close Combat destroys Dialga and allows Infernape to 2HKO Kyogre leads, thanks to its Focus Sash protecting it from Surf. You lose to Choice Scarf Kyogre leads, however, as they are faster. Fire Blast destroys Scizor, Forretress, and Metagross leads, while 2HKOing Groudon. Overheat is also option if one wants the extra power for taking on threats, such as specially defensive Groudon. The EVs are the same as the previous set, since they allow Infernape to get the KOs on the necessary leads.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Infernape will lose to Darkrai leads due to Dark Void, so carrying a sleep absorber on your team is recommended. Sleep Talk Kyogre is a good choice, since it also beats Ho-Oh, who will wall this Infernape set due to the lack of Stone Edge. Kyogre's rain will not hurt Infernape, as Fire Blast, which is negatively affected during rain, will still KO most of the targets it needs to. Having a priority user is also recommended to finish off leads who Infernape will U-turn out of, such as Mewtwo and Deoxys formes. Scizor is a particularly good choice, since it can also beat Choice Scarf Shaymin-S leads, whom Infernape loses to if Shaymin-S flinches it with Air Slash; Scizor can also Pursuit Mewtwo and Deoxys formes, should they switch out. Rayquaza benefits from the Stealth Rock laid down by Infernape, and it also has a strong priority move in Extreme Speed.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Swords Dance

move 4: Shadow Claw / Flare Blitz
item: Life Orb
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although somewhat tricky to set up, Infernape can become a viciously powerful offensive threat after just one Swords Dance, capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing everything in Ubers.</p>

<p>Close Combat is the primary attack of this set, and will absolutely devastate any Pokemon who does not resist it, OHKOing foes such as Dialga, Palkia, Kyogre, Scizor, and many others. Stone Edge covers most Flying-types whom Infernape is likely to face. After a Swords Dance, Ho-Oh and Rayquaza are both OHKOed, as is Lugia after Stealth Rock damage. Shadow Claw grants Infernape perfect coverage and is the best option against Latias, Latios and Giratina(-O). It also 2HKOes Giratina and Giratina-O after a Swords Dance, although the former will require Stealth Rock damage. Flare Blitz can be used over Shadow Claw if one has sunlight support from Groudon. In said sunlight, Flare Blitz will still 2HKO Latias, Latios, and Giratina-O, and it also OHKOes even defensive Mewtwo, something Shadow Claw can't always manage. However, the primary use of Flare Blitz is to OHKO Groudon after a Swords Dance, meaning it can no longer stop Infernape from sweeping.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As for EVs, max Attack and Speed EVs are necessary for maximum sweeping potential. Jolly is preferred to Adamant, as the latter does not get any special KOs and Infernape really needs to outspeed as many things as it can, as it cannot take many hits. Life Orb gives Infernape a much needed power boost.</p>

<p>Swords Dance Infernape's main issues are defensive Groudon, any faster Pokemon, and actually setting up. Wobbuffet is by far the best teammate for Swords Dance Infernape, since it can trap and kill most Groudon and Choice Scarf users while using Encore to give Infernape much needed opportunities to set up. Using Psychic-type Pokemon to bait Pursuit from Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Scizor is a good idea to help Infernape set up as well. Other than that, the same teammates from the Physical Mix Infernape set work very well with this one. Kyogre may seem like an odd partner for Infernape at first glance, but with Thunder Wave, it can cripple Latios, Latias, and Palkia switch-ins, thus allowing Infernape to break past them when it sets up later. If Infernape is not using Flare Blitz, Drizzle can actually help Infernape by letting it set up on Choiced Fire-type attacks.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Infernape is quite frail, so you'll always want to capitalize on its Speed and offenses. You will always want at least 212 Speed EVs with a boosting nature to outspeed the standard Timid Lugia and Latias. From there, just maximize your offenses however you see fit, although emphasizing Attack is recommended since most Ubers have lower Defense, thus maximizing Infernape's damage output.</p>

<p>Infernape's best move options are listed in its sets already. Infernape can utilize Nasty Plot along with Fire Blast, Focus Blast, and Grass Knot or Hidden Power Ice to become a special attacking threat, but the lower accuracy of the STAB moves and the generally higher Special Defense of Uber Pokemon makes this a less effective choice than a more physically inclined set. Taunt can have some use on the lead set to stop support Pokemon, such as Groudon and Dialga, from setting up Stealth Rock. Mach Punch is an option on the Swords Dance set if one feels that they need a priority move to pick off faster threats after set up, though the only targets it is useful against are Choice Scarf Dialga and Darkrai. Fake Out is usable on the lead set to allow Infernape to KO Deoxys-S with Fake Out + Fire Blast without needing another teammate to do it, but this will force Infernape to sacrifice Stealth Rock or one of its other attacks. The best move to put it over is most likely U-turn if you feel like you really need it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Giratina and Giratina-O resist or are immune to both of Infernape's STAB moves, and they both have powerful STAB Dragon-type attacks with which to dispatch the flaming monkey. However, neither Giratina nor Giratina-O will enjoy a boosted Shadow Claw from the Swords Dance set, and minimum HP Giratina-O is 2HKOed by a Choice Banded Shadow Claw after taking Stealth Rock damage. Latios and Latias also resist both of Infernape's STABs, are faster, and have powerful Dragon-type STAB moves to dispose of it. However, they risk getting badly injured by U-turn or Shadow Claw. Rayquaza can come in on any of Infernape's attacks, barring Stone Edge, and has a powerful Extreme Speed to pick off a mildly weakened Infernape. However, be aware that Rayquaza can only switch into Close Combat once if Stealth Rock is up. In the absence of Stealth Rock, Ho-Oh stops Infernape cold if it does not have Stone Edge. Kyogre who run a ton of HP and Defense EVs can also stop Infernape, but Close Combat will still do a lot of damage. Wobbuffet can pick off Choice Band Infernape locked into Close Combat, Stone Edge, or Flare Blitz in rain.</p>

<p>Any Pokemon faster than Infernape, such as Darkrai, Mewtwo, Shaymin-S, and Pokemon with a Choice Scarf such as Dialga, Palkia, and Garchomp, can stop it handily. However, keep in mind that Infernape can deal a lot of damage to them so be careful when switching them in.</p>
