[Overview]

<p>The divine titan stands tall above all else on the highest cliff smiting His very creation. When holding the Earth Plate, He's ready to use the earth He created against those who stand in His way. He can choose to either approach His enemies in a Calm (Mind) demeanour and crush them with brilliant dual coverage in the form of Ground-type Judgment and Ice Beam. Else He can unleash His mighty rage in the form of His universally-feared (Swords) Dance, wreaking foes with the still excellent dual coverage of Earthquake and Stone Edge. His mighty bulk, immunity to Electric-type attacks, and resistance to Stealth Rock separate Him from His other Arceus brethen. Whilst very few can resist His awesome two-move coverage, He's prone to some common special attacks, mainly Surf and Ice Beam. But those who try to use such attacks against, as well as any other foe, should never underestimate the power of the titan whose very footsteps make the world shake.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Ground Arceus is one of the only Ground-type Pokemon who is able to boost its Special Attack - the other one being Claydol. Arceus's naturally high Speed allows it to outspeed all positively-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon with a Timid nature and 100 Speed EVs. Ground Arceus also resists Stealth Rock, a valuable asset in any metagame. Thanks to its naturally high bulk, Arceus can find many opportunities to get a Calm Mind or two and proceed to sweep. Ground Arceus is also one of the most reliable Dialga counters thanks to its STAB Ground-type attacks and great bulk, while Dialga rarely carries an attack super effective against it.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Ground- and Ice-type attacks are all Arceus needs to be effective in Ubers, hitting everything but the odd Bronzong for at least neutral damage. However, it does have a few other options. For instance, one may utilize Substitute to run a SubCM set which can scout for counters and make setting up easier, as well as blocking status such as Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. Thunder can also be used in place of Ice Beam to hit things such as Ho-Oh and Lugia harder, as well as score a super effective hit on Kyogre, but Arceus will lose its only way of harming the Lati twins Latios and Latias.</p>

<p>Arceus's biggest problems are Pokemon that outspeed it. Therefore, a revenge killer like Wobbuffet is important to take out these threats. Choice Scarf Kyogre is a huge threat to Arceus because Water Spout will do a significant amount of damage to Arceus, even after a Calm Mind. For this reason, entry hazard support such as Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock are very important as they will wear down common switch-ins and help to weaken Kyogre. By extension of this, spinblockers, such as Giratina and Giratina-O, make excellent teammates. Latios and Latias, especially the latter, are also very dangerous to Arceus. Calm Mind Latias can take an Ice Beam or two from Arceus and do major damage with Grass Knot. Bronzong utterly walls this set, but needs Toxic or Explosion to do anything to back to Arceus. Ho-Oh can also wall this set if Stealth Rock isn't in play.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Much like every other Arceus type, Ground Arceus can run an efficient Swords Dance set. Normally a Ground-type Swords Dance Pokemon would seem to be outclassed by Garchomp with its higher Speed, due to Arceus's EV restrictions, or Groudon with its higher HP and Defense. However, Ground Arceus has a few things over these Pokemon. It lacks the 4x weakness to Ice-type moves and weakness to Dragon-type moves that Garchomp has, and it has higher Special Defense and Speed than Groudon. In addition to this, it has Recover, which prolongs its sweep. Earthquake + Stone Edge offers extraordinary coverage, resisted by only 6 Pokemon in the entire game, only a couple of which are commonly seen in Ubers. A Jolly nature is used for the same reason as Timid is in the above set, to outpace positively-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Substitute is an option over Recover in the last slot if you are worried about status or Intimidate. It also allows Arceus to scout for its counters more easily. Extreme Speed can also be used in the last slot to pick off faster weakened opponents, such as Darkrai or Scarfers, and outspeed Custap users who are looking to take you out with Destiny Bond or Explosion. Thanks to Arceus's natural bulk and Recover, it can take on Dialga really well, being immune to Thunder and having the ability to Recover off Draco Meteors and Outrages.</p>

<p>As with every other Swords Dance user in the game, Stealth Rock and other entry hazards are important for Arceus for turning 3HKOs into 2HKOs and 2HKOs into OHKOs. Forretress makes a great partner with its bulk and resistances to Grass- and Ice-type attacks. Choice Scarf Kyogre is one of Arceus's biggest counters. Because of this, Quagsire is a great teammate for Arceus because it can take on any variant of Kyogre one-on-one. Palkia and even Kyogre are also great teammates because of their ability to revenge kill and take common Ice- and Water-type attacks; however, beware when using Kyogre of the Grass-type weakness it shares with Arceus. Bronzong, once again, can take on this set as well, but will need Toxic or Explosion to threaten Arceus.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Thanks to Arceus's huge movepool, options for it are almost unlimited. The most important thing is to make sure it's not outclassed by Garchomp or Groudon. Arceus can stall fairly efficiently with Substitute and Recover alongside Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, but this is generally better left to other Pokemon. Roar is also a decent option when used in conjuction with multiple entry hazards to rack up damage and prevent set up. Arceus also has access to Light Screen and Reflect, but usually Lugia and Deoxys-S can do a better job at that. Rest + Sleep Talk is also a viable option as it can be used to function as a status absorber.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Ground Arceus is plagued by weaknesses to common types. Luckily, Ground Arceus has something no other Ground-type has with its 120/120/120 defenses, which limits its counters to a degree. The best, and probably most reliable counter to Ground Arceus, is Choice Scarf Kyogre; with its high-powered rain-boosted STAB Water Spout it still has a chance to OHKO Arceus after two Calm Minds with Stealth Rock in play. It also has the advantage in Speed, forcing one to predict an incoming Kyogre to weaken the damage Water Spout does. Calm Mind Latias is also a reliable option for countering Ground Arceus; with her natural bulk and high Special Attack, a boosted Grass Knot will spell doom for Ground Arceus. Water, Grass, and Ice Arceus are also decent counters, but Grass Arceus should be wary of switching into Ice Beam. Other than the aformentioned Pokemon, counters are few and far between for this earthy behemoth.</p>
