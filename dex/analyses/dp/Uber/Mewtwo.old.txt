[Overview]

<p>Mewtwo, also known as the classic "God" of Pokemon, is certainly no slouch. Its offensive stats and huge Speed coupled with its amazing offensive movepool, giving coverage on pretty much any Pokemon, are hard to compare with other Pokemon. Mewtwo might have to share its throne with Kyogre, Darkrai, and other powerful threats; however, Mewtwo has a lot going for it with its "perfectly placed" stats and vast movepool. One of Mewtwo's most fearsome qualities is its amazing versatility. It can function well as a sweeper, a wall to many threats in the Ubers metagame with its underestimated bulk and plethora of defensive moves, or a supporter, so one must be extremely careful of Mewtwo's sheer unpredictability. In fact, Mewtwo's many skills make it pretty much uncounterable. Mewtwo's only bad qualities are its bad STAB and lack of resistances that a lot of other Uber Pokemon can boast, but these are very minor faults. "Fear" is the one thing you should think about when facing a Mewtwo, as it is one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the game.</p>

[SET]
name: Taunt + Calm Mind
move 1: Taunt

move 4: Ice Beam / Shadow Ball
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a set perfectly designed for Mewtwo. Its bulk, 130 base Speed, and sky-high Special Attack make this set destructive when played correctly. Many walls, Blissey, Lugia, and Giratina in particular, carry moves that are easily shut down by Taunt. After using Taunt, proceed to Calm Mind, bolstering your Special Attack and Special Defense stats. Aura Sphere is the best option here, as it does severe damage to Pokemon such as Dialga and Blissey while hitting Scizor and Metagross for neutral damage. Ice Beam should be the next attack to consider. Fighting and Ice complement each other, especially since many Uber Pokemon are hit for super effective damage by this combination. Thunder pairs well with Ice Beam, obliterating Kyogre and Groudon respectively with no problems. Shadow Ball, on the other hand, pairs well with Aura Sphere. Shadow Ball hits the abundant Psychic- and Ghost-types in Ubers while maintaining perfect coverage.</p>

<p>Leftovers is the best item for this set because it keeps Mewtwo alive so it can Calm Mind more times before it is forced to attack. Expert Belt and Life Orb sound very appealing; however, this set should focus on being as bulky as possible. While this Mewtwo does remarkably against stall teams, it is hampered by Forretress with Gyro Ball (or Payback) and Blissey with Seismic Toss, provided Blissey hasn't switched into Mewtwo. To be fair, Mewtwo can 2HKO Blissey most of the time after 3 Calm Minds. In return, Mewtwo is suffering a 5HKO from Seismic Toss.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>While this set is quite a powerful sweeper, there are still plenty of things that can stop it. Blissey with Seismic Toss can still hamper Mewtwo, as chances are Mewtwo will not be able to KO Blissey before it can KO Mewtwo in return. Specially defensive Forretress with Payback or Gyro Ball can also survive most of Mewtwo's attacks and usually beat it down. Scizor and Metagross are probably the best counters to this set, as both of them can survive any of this set's attacks and KO Mewtwo with a Choice Band U-turn and Meteor Mash, respectively, or eliminate poor Mewtwo with Pursuit if it tries to switch out. Tyranitar hates Aura Sphere, but if it has a ton of EVs in HP and Special Defensive, it will survive the assault and maul Mewtwo with a Choice Band Crunch or Pursuit. Without Thunder, Kyogre is a massive pain for Mewtwo, as it can shrug off anything Mewtwo can throw at it and deliver a swift OHKO with Surf. Ho-Oh can bypass Mewtwo's Special Defense boosts and smother it with sun-boosted Sacred Fires or super effective Punishments, and can easily brush off any of Mewtwo's attacks bar Thunder. Finally, Mewtwo is very prone to being revenge killed by threats such as Palkia, Dialga, Shaymin-S, and Darkrai. (However, Darkrai can't revenge kill Mewtwo if it is at full health.)</p>

<p>A physically based mixed Palkia is a good partner for Mewtwo because Blissey will often switch in to Palkia expecting a special set only to be OHKOed by Outrage. Palkia can also fry Scizor, Metagross, and Forretress with Fire Blast and smash Tyranitar and Ho-Oh with mighty Aqua Tails. Palkia can also switch in to Kyogre's absurdly powerful Water-type strikes and will 2HKO any variant with Outrage. Kyogre is also good to have on the same team because it can easily defeat Scizor, Ho-Oh, Forretress, Metagross, and Tyranitar with a mighty Surf. Kyogre can also set up on Seismic Toss Blissey and beat Darkrai with a combination of Rest/Sleep Talk and Calm Mind. Kyogre can also cripple Scarfers trying to revenge kill Mewtwo with Thunder Wave, and can also switch in on an opposing Kyogre's Surf (Beware if the opposing Kyogre is holding Choice Specs) and zap it with Thunder or Thunder Wave. Mewtwo also enjoys rain support from Kyogre, allowing Mewtwo to fire off Thunder without fear of it missing, should Mewtwo have it. Wobbuffet can be used to help Mewtwo set up Calm Minds, use Encore to completely mess up Blissey, and can revenge kill any enemy Scarfer sans Darkrai with Mirror Coat. Wobbuffet can also revenge kill Scizor, Tyranitar, and Metagross as long as it doesn't come in on a super effective attack or can use Tickle when paired with a Pursuit user (such as a Scizor or Tyranitar of your own) as an almost guaranteed way to get rid of Blissey. Scizor in particular is a good partner as it resists all of Mewtwo weaknesses, and can weaken Choice Scarf Dialga, Choice Scarf Palkia, Choice Scarf Darkrai, and Blissey with Superpower, smash Tyranitar and Shaymin-S with Bullet Punch, and can also use U-turn to weaken opposing Kyogre and Metagross, while also allowing you to switch to a counter for said Kyogre and Metagross.</p>

[SET]
name: Defensive Calm Mind
move 1: Substitute / Recover
move 2: Calm Mind
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Aura Sphere
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 204 HP / 52 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is a bulkier Mewtwo who focuses on being able to take hits better while setting up. Calm Mind is once again the crux of the set, boosting Mewtwo's Special Attack and Special Defense to very high levels before attempting a sweep. This time however, Mewtwo focuses of using either Substitute or Recover to help set up. Substitute gives Mewtwo a shield against users of Pursuit (Scizor, Metagross, and Tyranitar come to mind) and revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Palkia, allowing you to switch out to a more suitable counter without being utterly annihilated. Substitute also gives Mewtwo some protection against status users such as Blissey and Lugia. (Beware if the latter has Whirlwind to phase you out as you are setting up.) Speaking of Blissey, Mewtwo can make 101 HP Substitutes, allowing it to always defeat Seismic Toss Blissey one-on-one as long as Toxic Spikes are not up on Mewtwo's side of the field. Because of this, Substitute Mewtwo can be quite a menace to stall teams as their main special wall, Blissey, cannot stop this Mewtwo. (Although Payback Forretress will still give you a headache.). Recover is also a viable option over Substitute. Recover allows Mewtwo to take hits while setting up, decreasing its vulnerability to revenge killers as well as letting it set up in any point of the game. However, without Substitute, Mewtwo will become more vulnerable to being trapped by Pursuit and status moves. If using Recover, it is a good idea to switch Mewtwo into a burn or one layer of Toxic Spikes, as that way Mewtwo cannot be paralyzed or slapped with Toxic. The residual damage with burn or normal poison is easily taken care of with Recover, and it makes Mewtwo almost unbreakable for stall teams since it cannot be hit with Toxic.</p>

<p>Ice Beam and Aura Sphere are the best offensive options for this set. Ice Beam hits the plethora of Dragon-type Pokemon for lethal damage while Aura Sphere takes care of Tyranitar, Darkrai, and most Steel-types. If one wishes for it, Aura Sphere can be dropped to use both Substitute and Recover. This way Mewtwo can block status and deflect Pursuit while being able to heal itself, making it into a quite dangerous Pokemon for defensive teams to try and fight off. However, if you go this route, Magneton or Magnezone support is highly recommended to take care of any Steel-types. With Ice Beam as its sole attack, Mewtwo will be totally and completely walled by them.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>204 HP allows Mewtwo to make 101 HP Substitutes, meaning that Blissey will not be able to break the Substitute with one Seismic Toss, allowing Mewtwo to set up on Blissey. Maximum Speed allows Mewtwo to tie with other maximum Speed Mewtwo and to outpace anything slower than Shaymin-S. The rest of the EVs goes into Special Attack for a little extra oomph. Leftovers is the preferred item to use, as it allows Mewtwo to take hits a little better while boosting with Calm Mind.</p>

<p>This set and the previous set share similar counters, so any partner for the Taunt + Calm Mind set will also work very well with this one. However, this Mewtwo is extremely prone to getting trapped and KOed by Wobbuffet, as Mewtwo can do nothing to stop Encore, forcing it to either let Wobbuffet KO it with Mirror Coat or let another Pokemon set up for a sweep. Without Substitute, Blissey will be a huge problem as Toxic or Thunder Wave will render Mewtwo incapable of sweeping. The best way to save Mewtwo from those dangerous foes is to lure them out and KO them with a mixed attacker such as Lustrous Orb Palkia or Expert Belt Dialga. The opponent will often be fooled into thinking they are holding a Choice item and switch in their Wobbuffet or Blissey only to be slapped with a lethal physical attack such as Outrage, bypassing Wobbuffet's Mirror Coat and likely 2HKOing Blissey. This gives Mewtwo a clear shot at setting up. Toxic Spikes is also useful to wear down Wobbuffet, Blissey, and other defensive Pokemon to help Mewtwo break through them. It is also particularly useful if Mewtwo has Recover. Forretress can set up them easily since it resists all of Mewtwo's weaknesses. It can also use Rapid Spin to get rid of Toxic Spikes and other entry hazards from Mewtwo's side of the field, which could compromise it's sweeping potential. A mixed Giratina-O is a good partner if using Forretress to stop the opponent from getting rid of your Toxic Spikes. Giratina can also stop Blissey quite easily with Outrage, and it can help get rid of Wobbuffet since the blue blob cannot use Counter on Giratina-O's physical attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: All-Out Attacker
move 1: Aura Sphere
move 2: Ice Beam
move 3: Self-Destruct
move 4: Fire Blast / Thunder / Grass Knot
item: Life Orb
nature: Naive / Hasty
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With just a Life Orb in hand, Mewtwo is capable of at least 2HKOing almost every Pokemon in the Ubers metagame, thus making it a great revenge killer when combined with Mewtwo's blistering 130 base Speed.</p>

<p>With Aura Sphere, Mewtwo becomes one of the best Darkrai revenge killers in the game, being able to always OHKO it as long as it is not holding Chople Berry. Aura Sphere will also 2HKO Dialga, Heatran, and specially defensive Tyranitar 100% of the time. Registeel is only 3HKOed by Aura Sphere, and thus should only be used if the weather is rainy or if you lack a Fire-type attack. Ice Beam complements Aura Sphere's coverage well, hitting the Flying-types who resist Aura Sphere super effectively, in addition to KOing several key Pokemon whom Aura Sphere can't. For example, Ice Beam will OHKO Rayquaza, Shaymin-S, and Garchomp, while naive Giratina-O has around a 20% chance of being OHKOed after Stealth Rock damage. Lugia and Latias are also 2HKOed 100% of the time by Ice Beam after Stealth Rock damage (watch out for Calm Mind Latias though), while the standard 112 HP Rock Polish Groudon will take 90% minimum from Ice Beam. Finally, Self-Destruct is Mewtwo's speedy suicidal finisher, being able to OHKO Blissey, Ho-Oh, and max HP Kyogre. Self-Destruct is also Life Orb Mewtwo's only way of defeating Wobbuffet, dealing 87.1%-100% to Calm Wobbuffet. If you desire a way to OHKO Ho-Oh without sacrificing Mewtwo, Stone Edge can be a good choice.</p>

<p>The last move is chosen depending on what you want Mewtwo to revenge kill. Fire Blast is usually the best choice, as it will OHKO Both Scizor--a Pokemon who normally gives Mewtwo problems--and Forretress regardless of the weather. As long as it is not raining, Fire Blast will also OHKO Bronzong, Metagross, and specially defensive Jirachi. If used with Groudon's Drought, Fire Blast will do a massive amount of damage to most Pokemon who don't resist it. For example, in the sun, Fire Blast will OHKO offensive Mewtwo after it takes Stealth Rock damage, while Calm Wobbuffet is 2HKOed. If Fire Blast's accuracy puts you off, Flamethrower is a suitable replacement, though Forretress and some Scizor have a chance of surviving it in the rain. If defeating Steel-types isn't too important, Thunder can be a good choice with Kyogre's rain support. Thunder is Mewtwo's best chance at defeating Kyogre, dealing 84.2%-99.4% to 4 HP Kyogre, and 71.3%-84.2% to maximum HP Kyogre. Thunder will also allow Mewtwo to 2HKO Palkia, Lugia, Forretress, and most Scizor and Metagross. Finally, if you don't care about Steel-types or the weather, Grass Knot can be used to still 2HKO Palkia with a 100% accurate move in the sun, and OHKO 252 HP / 60 SpD Groudon around 79% of the time.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Both Naive and Hasty are viable natures, and should be chosen based on whether you prefer Mewtwo to take less from priority attacks or special attacks. With a Naive nature, Adamant Lucario will only have a 41% chance to OHKO Mewtwo with a +2 Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage, while Hasty Mewtwo will always be KOed by that under the same conditions. Naive Mewtwo will also only be 2HKOed by a Jolly Rayquaza's unboosted Extreme Speed around 19% of the time after Stealth Rock damage, while Hasty Mewtwo will be 2HKOed around 99% of the time after Stealth Rock damage. As for Hasty Mewtwo, it will survive a Choice Scarf Palkia's or Kyogre's Surf in the rain around 54% of the time after it takes Stealth Rock damage (allowing Mewtwo to Self-Destruct), while Naive Mewtwo is always OHKOed after Stealth Rock damage by the same attack. Additionally, Hasty Mewtwo will have around a 67% chance of surviving Choice Scarf Draco Meteors from Palkia and Dialga after Stealth Rock damage, while Naive Mewtwo is always OHKOed by the same attack after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>This Mewtwo set also works well in the lead position as it is capable of 2HKOing most of the common leads seen in Ubers. Groudon and Kyogre will both fall to a Grass Knot, while Focus Blast will annihilate Dialga and Tyranitar. Scizor and Forretress will be destroyed by a Fire Blast, and Mew will also be 2HKOed by Fire Blast boosted by Life Orb. Ice Beam will also destroy the mighty Lead Rayquaza that is devastating to so many offensive teams. However, Lead Deoxys will get 2 layers of entry hazards against Mewtwo, so having Forretress is recommended to get rid of the Stealth Rock and/or Spikes that was set up by Deoxys after it is KOed. Lead Giratina-O, Lead Darkrai, and Lead Shaymin-S are also difficult to deal with. Having a sleep absorber such as Sleep Talk Kyogre or Heracross will help deal with Darkrai, and Lead Shaymin-S and Giratina-O will not be able to do much to a defensive Jirachi or Heatran.</p>

<p>Many of Life Orb Mewtwo's problems are dependent on the last move chosen. If Fire Blast or Flamethrower is chosen, Palkia will be a huge issue. Mewtwo will only have around a 54% chance of 2HKOing Palkia after Stealth Rock damage with Ice Beam, while Lustrous Orb Palkia will OHKO Mewtwo with rain-boosted Surfs. Kyogre will wall Mewtwo's moveset barring Self-Destruct, and smash it with STAB, rain-boosted Surfs. Latias and Latios make superb teammates in this case, being able to take Palkia's Surfs, and threatening to OHKO it with Dragon Pulse. Latias can also switch into Kyogre that lack Thunder Wave, and set up Calm Mind on it, while Latios can slam it with Thunder or Grass Knot. Palkia can also take a Choiced Kyogre's Water Spouts without being 2HKOed most of the time, and shock it with Thunder. A Heatran can lure out Kyogre, and OHKO it with Explosion, and can also take Choiced Spacial Rends from Palkia.</p>

<p>If you choose to forgo a Fire-type attack, Life Orb Mewtwo will have problems with several Steel-types. Although Thunder will 2HKO most Scizor and Metagross, they can revenge kill Mewtwo with U-turn and Meteor Mash respectively. Bronzong is never 2HKOed by Thunder, while Bronzong will 2HKO Mewtwo with Payback after Stealth Rock damage (and Life Orb recoil in Naive Mewtwo's case). Specially defensive Jirachi will also never be 2HKOed by Thunder, and can cripple Mewtwo with paralysis from Thunder Wave or Body Slam. Finally, if using Grass Knot, specially defensive Skarmory can attempt to stall Mewtwo with Roost. Groudon makes a superb teammate in this case. Groudon can generally handle Scizor's U-turns, and can scare out Metagross and Jirachi with the threat of STAB Earthquake. Groudon also has the option of using Overheat to fry incoming Skarmory and weaken Bronzong. Kyogre can switch into Metagross's Meteor Mash, Bronzong's Payback, or Skarmory's Roost, and threaten to crush them all with Surf. Heatran can easily switch into all of the Steel-types listed, and threaten to crisp them with its STAB Fire-type attacks. In a similar manner, Dialga can threaten to roast all of the above Steel-types with Fire Blast, or hit Metagross hard with Earth Power. Hidden Power Latios can be a good Scizor lure in the sun as well.</p>

<p>There are 3 Pokemon in particular who will almost always force Mewtwo to use Self-Destruct if faced with them. Unless Mewtwo has Stone Edge, Ho-Oh will scoff at most of Mewtwo's non-suicidal attacks, and smash it with Sacred Fire or Brave Bird. Even Thunder will fail to OHKO Ho-Oh without Stealth Rock, and the sunny weather that often comes with Ho-Oh will lower Thunder's accuracy to 50%. Blissey's massive Special Defense and HP laughs at Mewtwo's attempts to hurt her, and can even use Protect if Self-Destruct is predicted. Finally, unless Mewtwo uses Fire Blast in the sun as Wobbuffet switches in, Mewtwo will be forced to use Self-Destruct in fear that Wobbuffet will destroy Mewtwo with Mirror Coat. Ho-Oh doesn't have a true counter, thus the best way to deal with it is to either revenge kill it with a faster Pokemon who has Stone Edge, or a faster Kyogre. Due to Shadow Tag, Wobbuffet also has no true counters. If you want a surefire way of defeating Blissey, you can use Tickle Wobbuffet with a Pursuit user to ensure Blissey's demise. Alternately, you can use Dugtrio to finish off a Blissey whom Wobbuffet has Encored into a support move, such as Toxic. Mixed attackers who pose as Choice Scarf users (such as Dialga and Palkia) are a great way of luring in Blissey and weakening Wobbuffet into Mewtwo's KO range. Strong physical attackers, such as Groudon, Garchomp, and Lucario, will usually force Blissey out as well.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes a different approach to the first Calm Mind set, attempting to sweep with only one Calm Mind under its belt instead of several. After just one use of Calm Mind, Mewtwo will be able to OHKO the majority of the Ubers metagame!</p>

<p>Much like the Life Orb set, Ice Beam's main purpose is to OHKO Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Shaymin-S before a boost. With one Calm Mind under its belt, Mewtwo's Ice Beam will OHKO most Giratina-O and all but the most specially defensive of Groudon. Lugia and Latios are also OHKOed by a boosted Ice Beam after taking Stealth Rock damage, while Giratina takes a massive 76.7%-90.7% from the same attack (an OHKO after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage). Even Latias is always 2HKOed by a boosted Ice Beam, and thanks to Mewtwo's insane 130 base Speed, Latias cannot save itself by using Calm Mind. If you decide to forgo using Aura Sphere, Ice Beam will also 2HKO all Dialga variants with the exception of Bulk Up Dialga. Thunder is Mewtwo's most powerful attack in the rain. After one Calm Mind, maximum HP Kyogre is OHKOed by Thunder 100% of the time, making this Mewtwo a great Kyogre lure since most Mewtwo struggle to get past it. Both Lugia and Ho-Oh are OHKOed around 74% of the time by a boosted Thunder (be warned, the sunlight that often accompanies Ho-Oh will reduce Thunder's accuracy to 50%), while offensive Mewtwo are OHKOed by a boosted Thunder after taking Stealth Rock damage. Finally, a boosted Thunder will OHKO Palkia, Metagross, Forretress, and Scizor after they take Stealth Rock and Spikes damage, while Wobbuffet, Bronzong, and specially defensive Jirachi are 2HKOed by a +1 Thunder. If you settle for Flamethrower or Fire Blast as your last move and have ways of dealing with Ho-Oh and Heatran, Grass Knot is an acceptable alternative to Thunder that has the bonus of being 100% accurate in the sun.</p>

<p>The last moveslot is contested between Aura Sphere, Flamethrower, and Fire Blast. Aura Sphere is usually the best choice for several reasons. Like the Life Orb set, Aura Sphere makes Mewtwo an excellent Darkrai revenge killer before a Calm Mind. After one use of Calm Mind, Aura Sphere will OHKO all variants of Tyranitar, OHKO the most specially defensive of Heatran after Stealth Rock damage, and OHKO all Dialga sets after Stealth Rock damage with the exception of Bulk Up Dialga. Flamethrower does have a few advantages over Aura Sphere though when used in the sun. In the sun, Flamethrower will be able to OHKO Darkrai after it takes Stealth Rock damage, while a +1 Flamethrower will still OHKO offensive Dialga and Mewtwo, and 2HKO Bulk Up Dialga. Flamethrower will also ensure that Mewtwo will destroy most Steel-types in the sun without relying on the shaky 50% accurate Thunder. If you prefer power over reliability, Fire Blast can be a workable choice over Flamethrower as well. Fire Blast's main advantages over Flamethrower are that in the sun, a +1 Fire Blast will OHKO specially defensive Mewtwo and support Dialga, in addition to having around a 58% chance to OHKO Calm Wobbuffet after Stealth Rock damage (100% chance with both Spikes and Stealth Rock). The main downfalls of choosing a Fire-type attack over Aura Sphere is that Mewtwo will have a much harder time against Tyranitar. Bulk Up Dialga can also be a pain in the rain, and Heatran can be difficult to take down in the sun.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>By far the most troubling Pokemon for this set is Blissey. Although Blissey is actually 2HKOed by a +2 Aura Sphere, she can cripple Mewtwo with Toxic or Thunder Wave before it beats Blissey. Wobbuffet can also be a serious problem, being able to survive everything but a +1 Fire Blast in the sun with ease, thus putting you in the tough situation of deciding whether to Calm Mind again to survive Mirror Coat, or attack in fear of Encore. Specially defensive Jirachi can also be problematic if you lack a Fire-type attack or it's raining, as it can threaten to paralyze Mewtwo with Thunder Wave or Body Slam. If you chose a Fire-type attack over Aura Sphere, Tyranitar can be a serious problem, scoffing at most of Mewtwo's attacks bar Grass Knot, and then smashing it with Crunch, or Pursuit if Mewtwo attempts to flee. Specially defensive Choice Band Tyranitar is especially problematic, as it will survive even a boosted Grass Knot. Aura Sphere-less Mewtwo will also struggle against Bulk Up Dialga in the rain and Heatran in the sun.</p>

<p>Since Blissey is usually the only defensive Pokemon on most teams who can stop Mewtwo, the Tickle Wobbuffet + Pursuit-user strategy can spell doom to not only Blissey, but also allow Mewtwo to sweep through whole teams! Scizor is an excellent choice of a Pursuit user, and also has the bonuses of being able to Bullet Punch Tyranitar to its death and scare out Blissey. Tyranitar is not only a capable user of Pursuit, but can also revenge kill Wobbuffet and defeat Heatran. Mixed attackers who pose as Choice Scarf users (mainly Palkia and Dialga) are once again a useful asset due to their ability to lure in and defeat Blissey, and weaken Wobbuffet into Mewtwo's KO range. A mixed Kyogre with Waterfall can also be a good teammate, being a good Blissey lure, a good revenge killer of Tyranitar and Heatran, and providing the rain support that makes Thunder never miss. Groudon is an excellent response to specially defensive Jirachi, Tyranitar, Blissey, and Bulk Up Dialga, scaring them all out with the thought of STAB Earthquakes. Groudon can also revenge kill Heatran, though it should be wary of Fire Blast. Groudon is also notable for providing the sun that will power up Mewtwo's Fire-type attacks if it uses them. A Bulk Up Dialga of your own will laugh at Jirachi's paralysis attempts, and can set up on Blissey and Choice Band Tyranitar.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When you first see this set, the first thing that may come into your mind is, "What on earth?". Yes, "what on earth?" is a fairly logical and acceptable response, as turning Mewtwo into a physical wall is very unexpected. </p>

<p>This set attempts to abuse Mewtwo's underrated physically defensive capabilities via Reflect and Will-O-Wisp, a move learned by so few in the Uber metagame. With Will-O-Wisp and Reflect, Mewtwo can quickly shut down many of its usual counters, such as Scizor, Tyranitar, and Metagross, as well as stopping pretty much all physical sweepers dead in their tracks. Taunt prevents recovery, so even Blissey will be hard pressed to bring a stop to this set. With Taunt, Mewtwo can also prevent Pokemon such as Jirachi and Forretress from suffocating it with Toxic, or setting up Spikes / Toxic Spikes. Taunt, in tandem with Recover on the same set, is something no other physical walls in Ubers besides Deoxys-D can boast; however, Mewtwo's superior Speed allows it to abuse Taunt more efficiently, thus Mewtwo is not simply an inferior Giratina or Lugia and should not be treated as such. Thunder is an option over Reflect if you feel it's absolutely necessary to have an attacking move on the set. Thunder covers up Ho-Oh and Kyogre rather nicely, as they don't suffer much from your other three moves. Ice Beam and Seismic Toss are other options that can be used in that slot. Ice Beam hits Rayquaza, Garchomp, and Groudon while Seismic Toss will deal consistent damage and helps with wearing down foes faster. If you do not feel you need an attacking move, you may also use Substitute in the second slot to help Mewtwo protect itself against status, and to also help it outstall slower opponents such as Palkia or Dialga.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs generate 416 HP, 272 Defense, and 334 Speed. The 334 Speed allows Mewtwo to outrun max Speed Jolly Garchomp, the fastest physical attacker you'll see in Ubers, as well as max Speed base 100s like Mew and Palkia.</p>

<p>This Mewtwo has a lot of trouble with most special attackers in the Uber tier. Dialga, Palkia, Latias, and Latios can easily piledrive Mewtwo into the ground with their powerful Dragon-type strikes. Heatran is immune to Will-O-Wisp and will beat Mewtwo senseless with its powerful Fire Blast. Kyogre can come in on anything but Thunder and OHKO Mewtwo with Water Spout. Darkrai can outspeed this variant of Mewtwo, put it to sleep with Dark Void, and set up on it with Nasty Plot. Opposing Mewtwo can also be a pain as they will usually carry a faster Taunt and can set up using Calm Mind while shrugging off any attack that this Mewtwo can throw at it. Finally, Ho-Oh is one of the few physical attackers that Mewtwo will have serious trouble trying to beat, as it is immune to Will-O-Wisp, does not fear Mewtwo's other moves, and will usually be able to overpower Mewtwo with sun-boosted Sacred Fires. Scizor is an excellent choice to pair with this Mewtwo, as it can trap and KO Latias, Latios, and Mewtwo without a Fire-type attack with Pursuit, OHKO to Darkrai with U-turn, and can come in on Choiced Dragon-type attacks from Dialga and Palkia to easily slam them both with Superpower. Kyogre can easily survive a boosted Dark Pulse from Darkrai and most non-super effective attacks from Mewtwo and will OHKO them back with Surf. Kyogre also does not fear Ho-Oh or Heatran that much and can use said Surf to drown the fiery duo. Latias is a great answer to Kyogre, able to survive any of its attacks, destroy it with Grass Knot, and can easily Recover off any damage dealt.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Mewtwo is the special defensive counterpart of the physical defensive Mewtwo mentioned above. With Light Screen, Mewtwo can soak up many special attacks, including a Surf from a RestTalk Kyogre, Spacial Rends from either Choice Scarf or Specs Palkia, as well as Dialga's Specs Draco Meteor without much of a hassle. (Substitute is also an option on this set for reason mentioned in the previous set, if you do not feel Light Screen is necessary.) Mewtwo can then proceed to inflict a status ailment of choice on the opponent; Will-O-Wisp is the preferred option as it cushions Mewtwo's more vulnerable physical side, allowing it to switch out of Tyranitar or Scizor Pursuits with HP to spare, as well as having the added bonus of being able to damage Dialga and Jirachi. Toxic is can also be used as it takes down opponents much faster than Will-O-Wisp can, and as such it will be more useful against Pokemon against whom Mewtwo doesn't want a prolonged stay, such as Ho-Oh and more offensive variants of Kyogre. Taunt stops any attempt of recovering, supporting, and statusing Mewtwo, making it very hard for Pokemon such as Blissey to get past it. Finally, Mewtwo is fortunate enough to be gifted with a reliable recovery move in Recover, allowing Mewtwo to replenish its health quickly and efficiently, and coupled with Mewtwo's Pressure ability, allows it to stall out low PP moves like the aforementioned Draco Meteor and Spacial Rend.</p>

<p>The given Speed EVs allow Mewtwo to outpace Latias and Latios. This allows Mewtwo to Taunt and set up Light Screen without being interrupted.</p>

<p>This Mewtwo, like the other defensive set, has problems with Ho-Oh, Heatran, faster Mewtwo with Taunt, Offensive Kyogre variants, and Darkrai. Without Will-O-Wisp, one must be especially careful of Scizor, Tyranitar, and Metagross as both have little to fear from this Mewtwo. All three have access to Pursuit should Mewtwo switch out, and they both pack attacks that can severely hurt Mewtwo if it doesn't (U-turn in Scizor's case, Crunch in Tyranitar's case, Meteor Mash in Metagross' case). Groudon can handle Scizor, Tyranitar, and Metagross with ease thanks to its high Defense stat and STAB Earthquake, as is mentioned many times before. A Groudon with Stone Edge and a high Speed investment can also serve as a decent Ho-Oh check, but must be careful of swapping into Sacred Fire. A defensive Kyogre can easily take attacks from Ho-Oh, Mewtwo, and Darkrai while possessing a powerful STAB Surf to destroy them. Latias, once again, makes for a great Kyogre counter thanks to her very high Special Defense and Thunder. Latias can also check Ho-Oh and Heatran with Thunder if necessary, but only if the sun is not shining, as then Latias will not be able to stop Ho-Oh and some Heatran reliably.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Mewtwo's high Special Attack means it is undoubtedly capable of dealing lots of damage, but often Mewtwo fails to find turns to utilize it, mostly because of the high usage of Choice Scarf in Ubers. Giving Mewtwo a Choice Scarf of its own immediately transforms it into an astonishingly quick revenge killer, and Mewtwo's solid defenses also allow it to take a hit or two late-game, where it is often able to clean up the opponent's team with a move of choice.</p>

<p>Ice Beam, Thunder, and Grass Knot are Mewtwo's best attacking options for a set designed to revenge kill and check offensive threats. Together, you hit your main revenge kill targets--Rayquaza, Groudon, and Kyogre--for super effective damage. Rayquaza can threaten teams via either Swords Dance or Dragon Dance, but Mewtwo will always be able to take a +2 Life Orb Extreme Speed (even after Stealth Rock) and OHKO back with Ice Beam, whereas Dragon Dance versions are much less threatening and can only muster up to a maximum of 65% damage with a +1 Adamant Life Orb Extreme Speed. Mewtwo also checks Rock Polish Groudon, as Mewtwo outspeeds all Adamant +2 Groudon and deals 85-100% damage to 112 HP / 0 SpD Groudon, which is an OHKO after Stealth Rock and one turn of Life Orb recoil. Admittedly, +2 Jolly Groudon is not outsped, but it will fail to OHKO Mewtwo with a Life Orb Earthquake, even after two switches into Stealth Rock. In a straight 1v1 situation, Kyogre will beat Choice Scarf Mewtwo, but the 62% minimum damage to 4 HP / 0 SpD Kyogre with either Thunder or Grass Knot is hardly shabby. Kyogre also runs the risk of being crippled by paralysis from Thunder. If one is using this Mewtwo in a sun-centric team, Flamethrower is the preferred option in slot three so Mewtwo can still hit Steel-types, such as Scizor and Forretress, for good damage. Kyogre and Lugia will still be covered by Grass Knot and Ice Beam, respectively, although without Thunder Mewtwo will not be able to deal significant damage to Ho-Oh.</p>

<p>Trick is the best general move for the last slot, as it allows you to play mind games and plan out a strong late-game plan, also crippling Blissey and Latias. However, there are other options. Aura Sphere will help against Darkrai and Dialga (and can alternatively be changed for the much riskier Focus Blast). Self-Destruct can damage most Pokemon even with a hindering nature (Mewtwo needs its defenses), and can put the pain on Blissey and Latias.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Mewtwo's downfalls with this set are its hugely exploitable Pursuit weakness, and its ability to be trapped and easily KOed by Wobbuffet. Forretress makes a superb supporting teammate, easily Spiking/Rapid Spinning on Choiced Scizor and Tyranitar stuck on Pursuit, while also being able to Spike against Wobbuffet. Wobbuffet can Encore, but in reality most Uber threats are setting up on Forretress anyway, so its importance is often not great. Choice Specs Dialga can blast holes in opposing teams, especially if an opponent's Scizor has been weakened, or their Blissey Tricked. A bulky Kyogre also goes very well with Mewtwo, providing rain so that Thunder is 100% accurate, while also being able to sponge status and weaker special attacks if using Rest. Stacking up on fast and powerful sweepers such as Rayquaza, Lucario, and Darkrai is suggested, so you can fully utilize Mewtwo's ability to check lots of dangerous setup Pokemon who would otherwise destroy strong but frail teams.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens

move 3: Light Screen
move 4: Self-Destruct
item: Light Clay
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This Mewtwo works very well as a team supporter as it is centered around preventing your opponent from setting up their strategies or using status moves, while raising protective screens to double the defenses of your team. While this set is almost identical to Deoxys-S' "Dual Screens" set, Mewtwo has significantly higher base HP, so it can oftentimes set up the screens more reliably. Self-Destruct allows Mewtwo to take down a Pokemon after setting up while allowing a free switch in for another teammate.</p>

<p>Taunt, in conjunction with Mewtwo's high base Speed, allows Mewtwo to shut down any slower support leads such as Dialga and Groudon. Under a Light Screen, Mewtwo will always outpace, set up a Light Screen and survive a Choice Specs Kyogre's Water Spout and a Choice Specs Dialga's Draco Meteor. Likewise, Reflect + Taunt, easily stops supporting Groudon and Bulk Up Dialga from doing any major damage. Light Clay is the preferred item for this set. It boosts the length of screens from five turns to eight, a welcome addition to any team in the fast-paced Uber metagame.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Mewtwo mainly dislikes Pokemon who will hamper its set up. Scizor, Mixed Dialga, and Mixed Rayquaza commonly carry Brick Break, which breaks the screens, and all three of them can take advantage of this opening to KO Mewtwo. Mewtwo also hates Pokemon with a faster Taunt. Fortunately, this usually only applies to Deoxys-S, who is almost always a suicide lead and is usually KOed early on in the match. While Ghost-types are immune to Brick Break, most of them can't handle Scizor, Mixed Dialga, or Mixed Rayquaza by themselves. Choice Scarf Gengar probably comes the closest, as it can come in on Brick Break and inflict serious damage to Scizor with Hidden Power Fire, Dialga with Focus Blast, and Rayquaza with Hidden Power Ice. (You will have to choose which Hidden Power to use depending on whether you want to OHKO Scizor or Rayquaza. It should be noted, however, that Scizor will still take a lot of damage from Focus Blast, as will Rayquaza from Shadow Ball.) Garchomp will not take too much from Brick Break, and also has a super effective attack for Scizor (Fire Fang), Dialga (Earthquake), and Rayquaza (Dragon Claw).</p>

<p>However, the best teammates for this Mewtwo are Pokemon who benefit from its screens. There aren't any Pokemon who won't benefit from dual screens, but there are a few who stand out. Mew can easily capitalize on the protection of the screens to use stat up moves such as Rock Polish and Swords Dance, allowing it to then Baton Pass the stats to a recipient such as Groudon, which will often spell death for your opponent if successful. Speaking of Groudon, a Rock Polish and Swords Dance set can easily take advantage of its bolstered defenses to use both boosting moves, and then go on to ravage the opponent's team. Users of Substitute, such as Giratina-O, benefit greatly from dual screens, as they often get more time to stat up thanks to screens making their Substitutes harder to break. Any other sweepers, especially ones such as Rayquaza, Lucario, and Garchomp who only need one turn to wreak havoc on your opponent, will enjoy dual screen support, as it can give them more opportunities to set up and it makes them harder to revenge kill.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Aura Sphere
move 2: Ice Beam

move 4: Flamethrower / Trick

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Specs Mewtwo hits incredibly hard right off the bat, easily reaching a monstrous Special Attack stat of 611, although at the cost restricting itself to one attack. Aura Sphere and Ice Beam shuts down many Uber Pokemon while Thunder and Grass Knot handle Kyogre, the latter not relying on weather to affect its accuracy. Thunder's 30% paralysis rate is very appealing, as it still cripples most Pokemon who attempt to switch into Mewtwo. Flamethrower is the best option in slot four to hurt opposing Scizor, Forretress, and Metagross. Fire Blast should only be considered for the ability to OHKO those Scizor who concentrate EVs in Special Defense in the rain. If you don't care about Scizor, Forretress, or Metagross, Trick is a wonderful replacement for Flamethrower to cripple common switch-ins to Mewtwo, such as Blissey and Forretress. Take care to only use Trick against physical Pokemon: it isn't a very good idea to use this on Pokemon who focus on special attacks, even if they are a wall. (Unless it is Blissey.)</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This Mewtwo set has serious issues with Scizor, Metagross, Tyranitar, Latias, Latios, Blissey, and Wobbuffet. Scizor and Metagross can come into anything bar Fire Blast and KO Mewtwo with Pursuit, as it is often forced to switch out. Since Scizor and Metagross often carry Choice Items, Trick won't really affect them that much, and will make Mewtwo as good as dead since it will still be locked into Trick. Tyranitar does not care about anything but Aura Sphere (which it can survive once with the proper EV investment) and it, too, can vanquish Mewtwo with Crunch or Pursuit. Latias and Latios despise Ice Beam and Trick, but otherwise can switch in on any other move and start setting up for a sweep. Blissey also hates Trick, but it can absorb everything else and wear down Mewtwo with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Wobbuffet can trap Mewtwo thanks to Shadow Tag and destroy it with Mirror Coat. Groudon can easily squash Scizor, Metagross, Blissey, and Tyranitar with its STAB Earthquake and it can also lure in Latias and Latios only to cripple them with Toxic or Thunder Wave. Kyogre can do the same, and also has the advantage of being capable of 2HKOing Wobbuffet with Surf, but has less Defense to sponge Scizor's, Metagross's and Tyranitar's hits. A mixed attacker that usually has a Choice item, such as Palkia and Dialga, can also lure in Wobbuffet (and Blissey) and take it out by alternating between physical and special attacks. A Tickle Wobbuffet of your own paired with a Pursuit-equipped Pokemon (Scizor or Tyranitar) is an easy way to get rid of Blissey, Latias, and Latios, allowing Mewtwo to tear apart the opponent with little trouble.</p>

<p> After a KO, there are a lot of Pokemon who can come in and start setting up for a sweep, depending on what attack Mewtwo last used. Groudon can come in on Thunder, Rayquaza and Garchomp can come in on anything bar Ice Beam (or Aura Sphere for Garchomp), Lucario can come in on Ice Beam or Grass Knot, and Dialga can come in on anything bar Aura Sphere, and all of them can potentially set up a sweep that could potentially destroy your team. Revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Dialga, Palkia, and Garchomp can also easily switch in, outspeed, and KO Mewtwo after it KOes one of the opponent's Pokemon. An extremely defensive Impish Groudon can ward off most of the above threats, wearing down opposing Groudon, Dialga, and Lucario with Earthquake and Toxic (remember that Toxic doesn't affect Lucario or Dialga), and can use Dragon Claw against Rayquaza and Garchomp. Lugia can also use Whirlwind, Toxic, and Ice Beam to take on Lucario, Groudon, Garchomp, Dialga, and Rayquaza. Wobbuffet can also easily come in, trap Choice Scarfers such as Dialga and Palkia, and KO them with Mirror Coat.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Grass Knot is acceptable on many of the sets listed here, able to hit both Groudon and Kyogre for super effective damage without being reliant on the weather, but with so many Pokemon in Ubers resisting it, it isn't the best option. Psychic is a STAB option, but has the same problems as Grass Knot has: too many Pokemon resist it, or, in Psychic's case, are immune to it. Bulk Up Mewtwo can allow Mewtwo to surprise opponents with its underrated base 110 Attack Stat. Mewtwo has many physical attacks to choose from with its decent Attack stat of 110, but without Bulk Up they won't be terribly effective. Mewtwo can also create 101 HP Substitutes and use Focus Punch.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Blissey is probably the closest thing to a Mewtwo counter. Since most Mewtwo focus on boosting its Special Attack, the special wall should be able to handle it. Taunt and Substitute sets are Blissey's bane; without Seismic Toss, Taunt Mewtwo sets up on Blissey. With Substitute, Blissey has more issues to deal with. Self-Destruct will eliminate Blissey with little problems. While she is a fantastic counter to Mewtwo, you must always be on your guard against it.</p>

<p>Scizor and Metagross can make Mewtwo's life miserable if it lacks Flamethrower or Fire Blast. Scizor's Bullet Punch, U-turn, and Pursuit will put Mewtwo in a hard spot. Metagross has a weaker Pursuit; however, STAB Meteor Mash isn't something to underestimate either. Beware of Will-O-Wisp and Reflect: it will soften the impact from these attacks. Tyranitar has many powerful attacks at its disposal, and is capable of surviving an Aura Sphere from even a Choice Specs Mewtwo with a Special Defensive EV spread.</p>

<p>Kyogre and Ho-Oh don't have too many problems countering Calm Mind sets. Kyogre's massive Special Defense, resistance to Ice Beam, and its own ability to Calm Mind let it take on Mewtwo with ease. Furthermore, Surf really hurts Mewtwo due to the rain and its massive Special Attack. Ho-Oh, on the other hand, bypasses Mewtwo's Calm Mind boosted Special Defense with Sacred Fire or Punishment, and with its Special Defense rivaling Mewtwo's Special Attack, Ho-Oh easily shrugs off Ice Beam and Aura Sphere. Both should not be hasty in switching into Mewtwo, however, for there are chances where Mewtwo might carry Thunder or Self-Destruct. Heatran can easily revenge kill Mewtwo with a Choice Scarf, and immunity to Toxic and Will-O-Wisp make it well suited to countering defensive Mewtwo as well. Giratina-O is bulky enough to handle most hits from Mewtwo, and it can easily scare a 2HKO with Shadow Sneak while also bypassing Mewtwo's great Speed.</p>

<p>Otherwise, focus on being faster than Mewtwo. Any Deoxys formes, excluding Deoxys-D, are faster than Mewtwo. Choice Scarf users such as Palkia, Kyogre, Ho-Oh, Jirachi, Darkrai, and Dialga also make good options to eliminating Mewtwo.</p>
