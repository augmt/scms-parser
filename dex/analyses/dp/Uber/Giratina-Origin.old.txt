[Overview]

<p>Whereas Giratina is a wall that never dies, Giratina-O is an attacker that can puncture many holes in the opponent's team. He is arguably the best spinblocker in the game too, as his Levitate ability allows Giratina-O to switch in without being scathed by Spikes and Toxic Spikes. The addition of Shadow Sneak in Heart Gold and Soul Silver allows Giratina-O to also check many dangerous Ubers threats. His ability to break down stall teams with the Calm Mind set is a feat that very few other Pokemon can achieve. Immunity to Trick and the item removing effect of Knock Off is also quite exclusive and can prove to be very useful.</p>

<p>However, he does have some pretty disturbing weaknesses; Giratina-O only has base 90 Speed, which is quite slow for Ubers standards. He has weaknesses to the most common types in the Ubers metagame. And finally, his most fundamental flaw is his inability to hold anything else besides Griseous Orb, which is what Giratina-O is most often criticized for. The inability to hold any other items ruins what would otherwise be a Pokemon with amazing potential.</p>

<p>For those that play on Wi-Fi, it is a very annoying fact that Giratina-O can not be used in that environment, probably to allow compatibility for players using Diamond or Pearl. He can, however, be used in Link battles.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Say hello to the best spinblocker in the metagame. Giratina-O's impressive combination of power and bulk allows him to switch into Forretress with impunity, nullifying any attempts to Rapid Spin away entry hazards. Thanks to Levitate, Giratina-O has nothing to fear from Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and can easily survive two Paybacks from Forretress even after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage. From there, Giratina-O can wreak havoc upon the opposing team, through the combination of his powerful moves and the entry hazards he has preserved.</p>

<p>Hidden Power Fire will quickly disintegrate Forretress who are bold enough to stay in and attempt to hurt Giratina-O with Payback, it's also quite effective for dealing with Scizor, Lucario, and Metagross to an extent. Be aware that Hidden Power Fire is quite weak, as it will only manage a mere 3HKO against Forretress in the rain, but it is enough to prevent a successful Rapid Spin later in the game. Outrage is an obscenely powerful attack that allows Giratina-O to tear through the likes of bulky Kyogre and Blissey at moderate health, as well as KOing Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock damage. However, if one is turned off by Outrage's locking in effect, Dragon Claw is a viable alternative, but it is quite weak in comparison; it can't 3HKO physically bulky Kyogre and Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock, nor Protect Blissey without a Lonely nature. Although Shadow Sneak may be a weak attack, it is Giratina-O's only priority move, gets boosted by both STAB and Griseous Orb, and is enough to pick off Psychic-types like Latias, Latios, and Mewtwo when their HP drops to about 50%. Draco Meteor is a very powerful attack that gives Giratina-O a reliable way to dent common switch-ins, most notably Dialga. With Draco Meteor and Shadow Sneak in its arsenal, Giratina-O can make a fantastic check to Rock Polish Groudon, as he is immune to Earthquake and can survive a Life Orb Dragon Claw even after Stealth Rock damage, all the while being able to 2HKO Groudon back with Draco Meteor followed by Shadow Sneak.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread given allows Giratina-O to outrun up to Adamant Rayquaza, while enabling his Dragon Claw to 2HKO Protect Blissey and physically bulky Kyogre after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage, all with a Naive nature. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack for an extra power boost to Draco Meteor and perhaps Hidden Power Fire. Naive is generally preferred over Hasty as it guarantees that Giratina-O will not be 2HKOed by Forretress's Payback after switching into Stealth Rock twice. Giratina-O will also survive Rock Polish Groudon's Life Orb Dragon Claw, as well as a Bullet Punch from Swords Dance Scizor. With a spread of 252 Atk / 216 SpA / 40 Spe and a Lonely nature, Mixed Giratina-O can also function as a lead. Common leads such as Deoxys-S, Mewtwo, and Deoxys-A are all 2HKOed by Shadow Sneak; Kyogre and Tyranitar are both 2HKOed by Outrage; Mew falls to Draco Meteor and Shadow Sneak; Shaymin-S is 3-4HKOed by Shadow Sneak, and can only 4HKO with Air Slash in return; Forretress, Mamoswine, and Scizor all fall to Hidden Power Fire; finally, Ninjask is beaten down with a combination of Hidden Power Fire and Shadow Sneak. A Lonely nature is preferred over Naughty in this case to ensure that Giratina-O cannot be 3HKOed by Timid Shaymin-S's Air Slash.</p>

<p>To fully abuse Giratina-O's talents, he should be partnered with Pokemon who can effectively set up multiple layers of entry hazards. Deoxys-S can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes while Giratina-O can keep the momentum on his team's side due to his offensive nature. Forretress can lay down all types of entry hazards and synergizes excellently with Giratina-O. Groudon can lay down Stealth Rock while providing sunlight to power up Hidden Power Fire. Groudon can also handle Tyranitar, whose bloated Special Defense enables it to sponge Draco Meteor, and it threatens Giratina-O with sandstorm and STAB Dark-type attacks.</p>

<p>Despite Giratina-O's power, he has problems hurting Heatran and Lugia; even though Drizzle lowers Hidden Power Fire's damage output, Kyogre is a decent partner to run alongside Giratina-O, as its strong Water-type attacks will quickly wash them both away. Tyranitar synergizes well with Giratina-O and can absorb attacks from Heatran. Unlike Drizzle, Sand Stream does not cut down Hidden Power Fire's damage output, although it comes at the price of Giratina-O's health getting slowly whittled down. Forretress can take advantage of Lugia's extremely weak attacks and set up entry hazards with ease; Mewtwo and Darkrai can both set up on Lugia as well. Despite his bulk, Giratina-O is also quite easily revenge killed. Blissey is therefore a helpful partner as she can absorb special Dragon-type attacks and can provide Wish support for Giratina-O. Scizor can take on Choice Scarf Garchomp, Palkia, and Dialga by resisting their Dragon-type STAB attacks, while checking Latias and Latios with U-turn and Technician-boosted Pursuit. Jirachi can take Dragon-type attacks for Giratina-O, as well as being able to spread paralysis with Thunder Wave or Body Slam and support Giratina-O with Wish. Wobbuffet can revenge kill Choice Scarf users and Encore Lugia for a teammate to set up on.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Giratina-O is a fantastic special sweeper and sports some valuable qualities that other special sweepers can only wish for. He has a great Special Attack stat, complemented by Calm Mind and a myriad of special attacks at his disposal. Being part Dragon-type gives Giratina-O an amazing STAB. His Ghost typing grants him immunity to Seismic Toss, shutting down Blissey's main method of damage, while any attempt to hurt Giratina-O with status is rendered useless by Substitute. Giratina-O's bulk is no laughing matter either, especially when they are coupled with Levitate, which makes him immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. To top it all off, Giratina-O has the ever elusive immunity to the item-removing effects of Trick and Knock Off.</p>

<p>Dragon Pulse is a good option in general and is only resisted by Steel-types not named Dialga. Giratina-O can use Dragon Pulse to OHKO Rayquaza and Palkia and 2HKO Groudon without even using Calm Mind. Shadow Ball is a powerful STAB move that provides an easy KO on Mewtwo and deals more damage to other Psychic-types than Dragon Pulse, which includes Metagross and Lugia. Thunder inflicts massive damage to Kyogre while possibly causing paralysis, which aids Giratina-O in his sweep. After one use of Calm Mind, Giratina-O has an excellent chance of OHKOing 4 HP / 0 SpD Kyogre with Thunder after Stealth Rock damage. Substitute is a great defense against status, shutting down standard Blissey in the Ubers metagame while simultaneously aiding prediction. Be careful though, as Giratina-O has no recovery, so his ability to throw out Substitutes is very limited, so make each Substitute count. Aura Sphere allows Giratina-O to severely damage Dialga, Blissey, and most importantly, always 2HKO Tyranitar. If one does not care about Blissey, Calm Mind and 3 attacks can be used for maximum coverage. Finally, there's the option to drop Dragon Pulse in favor of the unresisted combination of Aura Sphere and Shadow Ball; while Giratina-O loses super effective coverage against Dragon-types and some power against Kyogre and Latias, he is compensated by super effective coverage on Psychic-types as well as Tyranitar and Dialga.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>112 Speed EVs allow Giratina-O to outrun Jolly Tyranitar and most Kyogre and Groudon while outspeeding Jirachi who do not invest in Speed, which means that Giratina-O can set up a Substitute before Jirachi gets to Toxic or paralyze him. The defensive EVs give him guaranteed survival against a Spacial Rend from Timid Palkia after Stealth Rock damage and Dragon Claw from Groudon without Stealth Rock. The rest of the EVs go into Special Attack to allow Giratina-O to hit as hard as possible.</p>

<p>Giratina-O is an excellent choice on offensive teams that require a way to beat stall. Recall that a classic Ubers stall team often consists of Groudon, Forretress, Blissey, Latias, Giratina, and a filler (often Lugia). Giratina-O can switch in on Blissey without much of a problem and threaten devastation. The only Pokemon who can prevent this devastation from occurring is Latias, and in order to do so, she must sacrifice herself to deal massive damage to Giratina-O, ensuring that he is unusable afterwards. The loss of Latias enables Pokemon like Calm Mind Kyogre to demolish the remaining team members. Giratina-O's main attraction here is that he can threaten a sweep against stall teams unless he is stopped promptly, and the Pokemon who do try to stop him often fall shortly afterwards, opening up a potential sweep for another member of your team.</p>

<p>An important thing to note when using Giratina-O is that, despite his many resistances and excellent HP and defensive stats, Giratina-O has no form of recovery in this set, and therefore it is not recommended to switch Giratina-O into powerful attacks. Instead, it is best to switch Giratina-O into moves that he is immune to. Wobbuffet can use his combination of Encore and Shadow Tag to force opponents to repeat support moves, such as Toxic and Stealth Rock, or moves that Giratina-O is immune to, such as Earthquake. Wobbuffet can then use Safeguard if he has Encored a status move, and provide a free switch in for Giratina-O.</p>

<p>Offensive partners that are good teammates for this set are Pokemon who can set up entry hazards or those who can take advantage of Giratina-O's ability to weaken his switch-ins. Deoxys-S is a great entry hazard user that can get Stealth Rock and Spikes up early on in the game, while Forretress can set up all three types of entry hazards. Giratina-O can then switch in on predicted Rapid Spins, keeping the offensive momentum on your side and proceed to set up with Calm Mind. If Giratina-O has used Calm Mind once, he can severely weaken or KO most Dialga, Kyogre (with Thunder), and Tyranitar (with Aura Sphere). Weakening a Choice Scarf Dialga would mean that Swords Dance Rayquaza or Lucario can sweep an opponent's team unchecked. The removal of Kyogre would allow Mewtwo, Darkrai, and Lugia to set up much more easily, while any team based around Groudon's Drought ability would also appreciate Kyogre's retirement. Ho-Oh in particular will be much harder to stop after Kyogre is eliminated. With Tyranitar severely weakened or KOed, stopping Calm Mind Mewtwo or Calm Mind Latias or Latios will be much more difficult for the opponent.</p>

<p>Tyranitar is Giratina-O's arch enemy, especially if Giratina-O lacks Aura Sphere. The combination of Tyranitar's powerful STAB Dark attacks and the sandstorm he summons will dramatically cut Giratina-O's life short. Groudon and Garchomp can switch into Tyranitar with ease and threaten him with STAB Earthquake. Groudon also changes the weather, meaning that Giratina-O will not have to face the damaging effects of Tyranitar's sandstorm. Lucario can freely switch into Dark-type attacks and threaten Tyranitar with Close Combat. Forretress is another threat as it can use Payback and Light Screen to defeat Giratina-O one on one. Lucario, Groudon, and Dialga can easily switch into Forretress and set up for a sweep. If one does not want to sacrifice Giratina-O to take down Latias, then Scizor and Metagross are good teammates to use alongside Giratina-O. Both can cripple Latias with Pursuit if she decides to switch out or KO her with the appropriate STAB move should she stay in. Blissey is also a reliable switch-in for most Latias.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set combines the stat-boosting threat of the Substitute + Calm Mind set with a form of recovery to take advantage of Giratina-O's bulk. At the expense of Substitute and an extra attacking move, Giratina-O gains virtual immunity to status and more freedom to switch into attacks. At first glance, it would seem that Giratina is better suited to this set due to its better bulk and access to Leftovers. However, Giratina-O does possess a fair number of advantages over Giratina. While Giratina-O may not find as much room to set up as Giratina, his higher Special Attack stat and the boost from Griseous Orb more than makes up for it. For example, Giratina needs 3 Calm Minds to match the power of a Giratina-O that has used Calm Mind once.</p>

<p>Unlike Giratina, as well as many other sleep absorbers in the game, Giratina-O packs a unique immunity to Trick. In the later stages of the game, this immunity helps prevent Trick users from shutting down Giratina-O's setup process. Finally, Giratina-O has the useful ability Levitate, allowing him to avoid the Spikes and Toxic Spikes that trouble Giratina. Although Giratina can Rest off the damage or status caused by these entry hazards, doing so takes up valuable turns, which can be better spent setting up Calm Minds. Having an immunity to Earthquake never hurts either.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs give Giratina-O a balanced amount of defenses, while holding enough power to take down standard Latias with a Calm Mind boosted Dragon Pulse. The Defense EVs ensure that Payback from Forretress does not 3HKO, allowing Giratina-O to set up Calm Mind against him and Rest off the damage. A Life Orb Dragon Claw from Jolly Rayquaza will never OHKO this Giratina-O, even after Stealth Rock damage, while the Adamant variant cannot OHKO without Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>On the classic Ubers stall team, the only Pokemon who will outspeed Giratina-O, after Latias is gone, is Lugia. This can be a problem, because if Stealth Rock is in play, Giratina-O will faint on the second switch in. To properly remedy this, be sure to include a Wobbuffet with Tickle and a Scizor with Pursuit on your team. Wobbuffet can Encore and then Tickle Lugia 5 times to get him into the KO range of Scizor's Pursuit as he flees. With Lugia gone, and once Giratina-O defeats Latias, he will often be able to restore his health with Rest before the opposition attacks, letting him continue his sweep in peace. Wobbuffet can also Encore moves such as Earthquake or status moves, this can provide Giratina-O with free time to either Rest to recover or Calm Mind to set up.</p>

<p>Tyranitar will give Giratina-O some serious issues, as he is able to 2HKO with Crunch, bypassing Giratina-O's possible Calm Mind boosts. A Jolly Tyranitar can also use Taunt to prevent Giratina-O from using Sleep Talk, and then set up a sweep with Dragon Dance. A Calm Mind Lugia that has Whirlwind can also set up on Giratina-O and Whirlwind Giratina-O away. When Giratina-O is sleeping, Mewtwo can switch in and Taunt Giratina-O as he attempts to Sleep Talk; Mewtwo can then easily set up Calm Mind, as Giratina-O is now virtually helpless. A Mewtwo of your own can easily set up on opposing Calm Mind Lugia with Taunt and Calm Mind. Opposing Mewtwo that carry Taunt and Calm Mind can be taken care of by Scizor or Metagross, who can both Pursuit him as he runs or OHKO him with the appropriate STAB moves should he stay in. Finally, Tyranitar is best handled by Garchomp or Groudon. Thunder Wave Groudon is a particularly useful Pokemon to use with this Giratina-O because it's in your interest to paralyze fast threats, particularly Lugia and Mewtwo. This will allow Giratina-O to enter the battle during late-game and use Rest before they land the finishing blow.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While the special sweeper set may be very appealing, one cannot forget that Giratina-O's Attack stat is equivalent to his Special Attack. He is a force to be reckoned with, hitting most Pokemon in Ubers in their softer physical defenses. With access to a STAB 120 Base Power Outrage, which is boosted further by Griseous Orb, he is not to be taken lightly. However, being locked into Outrage can be displeasing, as Giratina-O has mediocre Speed and is weak to Dragon-type attacks, making him very susceptible to the rampant Draco Meteors of Ubers. This can often be remedied by setting up Substitute before attacking to minimize punishment during the turns in which Giratina-O is locked into Outrage. Substitute also protects Giratina-O in case your opponent switches to a counter during Shadow Force's charge turn. Earthquake pairs up with Outrage pretty well as it takes care of Steel-types. The choice between Shadow Force and Shadow Claw is very much up to the user. They both serve as Giratina-O's secondary STAB and are helpful in the disposing of Psychic-types. Shadow Claw is the choice for reliability, while Shadow Force is the choice for sheer power. Shadow Claw can still KO some key targets though, despite its lower Base Power. For example, Mewtwo without physical defense investment and Latias will always be OHKOed by Shadow Claw after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread used allows Giratina-O to outspeed Jolly Tyranitar, while having enough bulk to survive a Timid Palkia's Spacial Rend after Stealth Rock. The rest are placed in Attack so Giratina-O hits as hard as possible.</p>

<p>Many people view Shadow Force as terrible due to the fact that it's a charge up move. Shadow Force isn't necessarily a great move, but it's certainly quite underrated, and it packs quite a punch. The only Normal-type Pokemon commonly seen in Ubers is Blissey, who fears Outrage and thus would never switch into physical Giratina-O. Even if Blissey switches in after seeing Giratina-O using Shadow Force, she is unable to do anything to Giratina-O anyway, which allows him to set up a free Substitute. Once the opponent's Normal-type is gone, Shadow Force can deal massive damage to even Pokemon that resist it, like Darkrai. Shadow Force also OHKOes physically defensive Mewtwo, something that Shadow Claw cannot achieve. One possible good moment to use Shadow Force is when Giratina-O's weakened opponent can be KOed by it, but not by Earthquake, while Outrage is very risky to use due to its locking side-effect. A good way to use this set is to almost always use Substitute as the opponent switches out. This is because some players may suspect that Giratina-O is using a Calm Mind set, and may send in Giratina-O's usual counters, such as Tyranitar, Kyogre, Dialga, or Latias. Giratina can then 2HKO Kyogre with Outrage, 2HKO Tyranitar and Dialga with Earthquake, and can either OHKO Latias with Outrage or with Shadow Claw after Stealth Rock. Pokemon like Calm Mind Kyogre greatly appreciate the removal of Latias, while other Calm Mind users, such as Latias and Mewtwo, appreciate the removal of Tyranitar. The removal of Dialga can open up a Swords Dance Rayquaza or Lucario sweep.</p>

<p>Physical Giratina-O is walled by four main Pokemon: Forretress, Scizor, Skarmory, and Lugia. Forretress, Scizor, and Skarmory resist both of Giratina-O's STAB attacks and take little to no damage from Earthquake. While Lugia takes a heavy amount of damage from Shadow Force, he is faster than Giratina-O, and can therefore cushion the hit with Reflect and Roost. Because of this, a Support Groudon with Fire Punch and Toxic pairs well with Giratina-O. Fire Punch will easily OHKO Forretress and Scizor, while Skarmory is 2HKOed. Groudon will often lure in Lugia, who can be crippled by Toxic. Although Magnezone does not fit on many Uber teams, he can be useful for trapping and killing Forretress, Scizor, and Skarmory. Dialga can also easily switch into the aforementioned Steel-types and threaten to roast them with Fire Blast; Dialga, like Groudon, can also use Toxic to cripple Lugia. Finally, Wobbuffet can use Encore and Tickle on Lugia, switch to Scizor, who can then OHKO Lugia with Pursuit if he attempts to switch. Something to note is that, although Kyogre is not the safest switch into Scizor, Choice Specs Kyogre can work well with physical Giratina-O because he can OHKO all four of the problem Pokemon with his STAB Water-type attacks and Thunder.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk

move 3: Outrage
move 4: Shadow Force / Earthquake / Shadow Claw

evs: 84 HP / 216 Atk / 96 SpD / 112 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Giratina-O can run a physical RestTalk set fairly effectively too, eliminating any worries about status and residual damage. The combination of Rest and Sleep Talk means that Lugia would be unable to do anything to him apart from setting up Reflect or Whirlwinding him away. Outrage is Giratina-O's weapon of choice, because it is very devastating to most Ubers, as previously mentioned in the physical attacker set. When picked by Sleep Talk, Outrage loses its locking side-effect, and essentially becomes a 120 Base Power STAB move with no drawbacks. This is extremely helpful for Giratina-O, because most of the other sets are easily revenge killed when he's locked into Outrage. Shadow Force is the preferred option out of the three moves listed on the second attack slot, as it cannot be picked with Sleep Talk, giving Giratina-O a higher chance of firing off a very deadly Outrage. This is a win-win situation, as when Giratina-O is awake, he has two powerful offensive moves to choose from, and when he is asleep, he has a high chance of picking consequence-free Outrage with Sleep Talk. If one were to find Shadow Force distasteful, you can choose either Shadow Claw or Earthquake as a replacement. While both of these moves interfere with Sleep Talk's chances of picking Outrage, they are more reliable than Shadow Force when Giratina-O is awake. Earthquake gives coverage against Steel-types, while Shadow Claw decimates Psychic-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Again, the EVs used allow Giratina-O to survive a Timid Palkia's Spacial Rend while outspeeding Jolly Tyranitar. If you don't mind the loss of Speed, a spread of 200 HP / 44 Def / 224 Atk / 40 SpD can be used so Forretress never 3HKOes with Payback, while also allowing Giratina-O to take some abuse on the special side.</p>

<p>Much like the Physical Attacker set, Giratina-O will struggle against Forretress, Skarmory, and Scizor. A Groudon with Overheat can be helpful here, as he can lure in Skarmory and OHKO it outright. Groudon can also take any of Scizor's attacks, and hit back with either Fire Punch or Overheat. A Choice Specs Kyogre can also switch in while Scizor uses Bullet Punch, or while Skarmory and Forretress use anything else, and OHKO them all with Surf or Water Spout. A support Dialga can also be helpful for similar purposes, being able to roast all three Steel-types with Fire Blast, while also being able to set up Stealth Rock.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Thunder Wave can be a good option on some Giratina-O sets, as it can ruin many common Giratina-O switch-ins, such as Kyogre, Latias, and the many Pokemon who might come in expecting Giratina-O to set up (such as Rayquaza and Darkrai). Giratina-O also enjoys paralysis support as it is rather slow. Will-O-Wisp can be used to weaken physical attackers, such as Groudon and Metagross, allowing Giratina-O to set up on them, but it will cost him the moveslot for a secondary attack. Energy Ball is Giratina-O's most reliable move against Groudon, but it does not have much use otherwise. Icy Wind is an interesting option to slow down Giratina-O's switch-ins. There's also the option of running 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe Timid with an all-out Calm Mind + 3 attacks set.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Giratina-O is tough to counter directly, considering his huge offensive movepool. The mixed attacker will generally have trouble hurting Heatran and Lugia, while specially defensive Scizor in the rain can take Hidden Power Fire reasonably well and slowly chip down Giratina-O's health with Bullet Punch; he can also Roost off any damage taken.

<p>Latias can stop the special attacker set only if Stealth Rock is not up. While rare, Calm Mind or Psych Up Blissey can stop Giratina-O by breaking its Substitutes with Ice Beam, eventually defeating him outright. If Giratina-O lacks Aura Sphere, Tyranitar can easily take on Dragon Pulse and quickly destroy him with Crunch, Payback, or Pursuit Giratina-O if he tries to flee. Without Thunder, Kyogre can Calm Mind alongside Giratina-O or Roar it away. Choice Specs Dialga with investment in bulk can take a one Calm Mind-boosted Aura Sphere and OHKO back with Draco Meteor. If Dragon Pulse is absent, Rayquaza and Palkia can survive Shadow Ball and proceed to KO Giratina-O with their STAB Dragon-type moves.</p>

<p>The physical sets are countered by Skarmory, Scizor, and Forretress. Skarmory and Scizor can both Roost off any damage done to them, while Forretress can set up entry hazards and use Payback to hurt Giratina-O. Lugia can also switch in on any attack apart from Shadow Force's execution turn and set up Reflect; he can then Roost off any damage and Whirlwind Giratina-O away or hit him with a Toxic or Thunder Wave, cutting short his sweep.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb is to take advantage of Giratina-O's low Speed and lack of recovery. Even relatively weak attacks like Forretress's Payback can place Giratina-O into KO range of stronger moves like Palkia's Spacial Rend.</p>
