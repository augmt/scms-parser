[Overview]

<p>Kabutops gets a huge boost in the Ubers environment because of Kyogre. The infinite rain created by Drizzle instantly transforms this sub-par Pokemon into an offensive force, as once its mediocre Speed stat is cured (it's actually quite impressive with a Swift Swim boost), its great Attack stat can shine as well. Kabutops is one of those Pokemon whom you probably laugh at the first time you see, but then watch in utter horror as it easily bulldozes through your team once it has set up.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Kabutops is a perfect example of a Pokemon who can excel when it is granted access to a metagame with permanent weather. Kabutops's already decent base 115 Attack stat gets raised to tremendous heights when it is boosted by Life Orb and Swords Dance. Furthermore, Kyogre's Drizzle ability allows it to abuse the perpetual rain with its Swift Swim, doubling its Speed.</p>

<p>Swords Dance is obvious on this set, as, coupled with Life Orb, it makes Kabutops's Attack soar; this makes it a true threat, even in the Ubers tier, which holds some of the toughest Pokemon. Waterfall is also quite obvious. It gains not only STAB, but also the boost from rain, bringing its Base Power up to 180. This can rip through many Pokemon, especially since it comes off Kabutops's boosted Attack stat. Waterfall is its main STAB and will probably be the move that you use the most (and for good reason). Low Kick is a great move for Kabutops; it gives great coverage alongside Waterfall. Most Pokemon in Ubers are quite heavy, which gives a great 120 Base Power on these targets. Furthermore, it allows Kabutops to beat many Pokemon who would normally give it trouble. For example, most versions of Dialga will be OHKOed by a Swords Dance-boosted Low Kick. Stone Edge rounds off the set nicely, giving you a secondary STAB move. It will probably be used only sparingly, because of the great coverage from Waterfall and Low Kick, but it certainly does have its uses. It allows you to hit Latias and Latios, who otherwise resist your moves. It also hits Lugia, Ho-Oh, and Rayquaza for massive damage (it gets 150 Base Power after STAB, before weaknesses are taken into account).</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs for this set are quite straightforward. Maximizing Attack and Speed give Kabutops all the power and speed that it can get, so it can sweep as easily as possible (since its not going to be taking many hits). The choice between Adamant and Jolly is a classic choice between speed and power. Adamant is recommended, as it gives you more attacking power, while still letting you outspeed Choice Scarf Garchomp when the rain is up. Jolly, however, is also viable, as it allows you to outspeed Choice Scarf Gengar and Shaymin-S, at the cost of a bit of Attack.</p>

<p>Scizor is a threat for Kabutops, since its Bullet Punch bypasses Kabutops's boosted Speed stat. Kabutops is quite frail, so it will be doing a lot of damage to the shellfish (Kabutops does not resist Bullet Punch). A bulky Kyogre, such as the "Boosting Tank" version, can take Scizor's Bullet Punches with ease. It can then start boosting its Special Defense and Special Attack with Calm Mind, Resting off damage when necessary; from there it can attempt a sweep. Kyogre will also set up the rain, which is so incredibly necessary for Kabutops to sweep.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, Kabutops is quite frail, so any assistance in getting it into play or helping it set up is greatly appreciated. Wobbuffet can be a great help. By using Encore, Shadow Tag, and Safeguard (in some cases), Wobbuffet can provide for an easy switch into play. To do this, you can simply Encore a move that does little to no damage to Kabutops, or a status move (once Safeguard is set up). Then, you can switch Kabutops in without fear, while it also gains a turn to use Swords Dance while your opponent switches Pokemon. Although it is not necessary, Wobbuffet support is highly recommended. Kabutops's 60 / 105 / 70 defenses are really quite dismal (albeit its Defense isn't too bad), especially in Ubers, where Pokemon hit harder and generally from the special side.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Waterfall
move 2: Low Kick
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: X-Scissor
item: Choice Band
ability: Swift Swim
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although Kabutops is holding a Choice Band, this set generally functions best as a revenge killer. Kabutops's Speed stat is boosted to epic proportions via Swift Swim, since Kyogre is the most-used Uber Pokemon. Furthermore, Kabutops's Attack is boosted right off the bat by its Choice Band, meaning that it can do some serious damage without the need for using Swords Dance.</p>

<p>Like the Swords Dance set, Waterfall will generally be your move of choice. Waterfall receives two 1.5x boosts from STAB and the rain, as well as the Attack boost from the Choice Band, making it a truly potent threat. Low Kick and Stone Edge provide excellent coverage with Waterfall. The former has high Base Power due to how heavy most Pokemon are in Ubers, as well as doing huge damage to Dialga, who can normally walk all over Kabutops; the latter gains STAB boost and is generally your best bet against Lugia, Rayquaza switch-ins (don't stay in against Rayquaza because of Air Lock), and Ho-Oh. The fourth slot is mainly filler, since the other three moves hit most if not all Ubers for at least neutral damage. X-Scissor hits Latias and Latios for super effective damage, as well as being more reliable than Stone Edge, accuracy wise. Aqua Jet is an option to pick off weakened Pokemon, but, generally speaking, you'll be faster than your opponent thanks to Swift Swim.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Since you are not boosting your Attack quite as much, sturdy physical walls can wall this Kabutops quite easily. Giratina in particular can present a problem, as it resists your main form of attack, Waterfall, and it has no weaknesses to your other moves, meaning that it can status Kabutops with Will-O-Wisp while Resting off the damage that Kabutops does. Special attackers can power through Giratina, as the mighty Dragon-type normally invests in Defense. Of note are Dialga or Palkia who can wallop it with a STAB super effective Draco Meteor.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Aqua Jet can be used to take out weakened Pokemon, however Kabutops will generally be outrunning your opponent anyway, because of Swift Swim. X-Scissor is also a possibility, but it would mainly be filler, since the coverage granted by Waterfall / Low Kick / Stone Edge is quite vast.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin can be used on a Choice Band set in order to clear Stealth Rock, but Kabutops has much better things to do than be a support Pokemon. Furthermore, being locked into an extremely weak Normal-type move is just asking to be set up on in Ubers.</p>

<p>The choice between Adamant and Jolly is up to whether you prefer speed or power. With Adamant, you still outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Garchomp, as well as maximizing your Attack, and thus it is probably the better choice. Jolly, on the other hand, allows you to outspeed Modest Choice Scarf Shaymin-S and Choice Scarf Gengar, but it does come at the cost of Attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Groudon is by and large the best Kabutops counter. It can come in on most of Kabutops's attacks, because of its excellent Defense stat. It also replaces the rain with the sun. This reduces Kabutops's Speed, bringing it back down to its mediocre base 80 stat. Also, it not only gets rid of the rain boost on Kabutops's Water-type STAB, but it also actually further cuts it down, leaving Waterfall a shell of its former self (meaning Groudon can even switch in on that, even if Kabutops has managed to get a Swords Dance boost).</p>

<p>Rayquaza can come in on a resisted Waterfall or Low Kick, or after a KO, and cancel out the weather temporarily with its Air Lock. Then, it outspeeds Kabutops, and can proceed to destroy it with a Dragon-type move, or Earthquake. Scizor can use Bullet Punch to bypass Kabutops's boosted Speed stat, and hit it for lots of damage.</p>

<p>If Kabutops does not have a Jolly nature, Choice Scarf Shaymin-S can come in and force Kabutops out with the threat of a STAB super effective Seed Flare.</p>

<p>Finally, Giratina can give Kabutops problems, since it resists Waterfall and is immune to Low Kick. It can also threaten to burn Kabutops with Will-O-Wisp, making Kabutops utterly useless. Furthermore, any user of Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp can threaten to completely cripple Kabutops.</p>
