[Overview]
<p>Fantastic defenses, resistance to Dragon-, Ice-, Dark-, and Ghost-type moves, and array of useful support moves make Registeel very useful in the Uber tier. What is most useful about Registeel is that in Ubers, rain is a common field condition, alleviating Registeel of its Fire-type weakness. Registeel also provides a complete counter to some of the most common Pokemon in the tier, such as Giratina-o and Choice Scarf Palkia.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>This set beefs up Registeel's already high Special Defense in order to take the most common attacks from the Uber metagame. Because of Registeel's excellent Steel-typing, it can provide to you an excellent check to many of the most common Uber Pokemon, while simultaneously supporting the team with Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave.</p>

[Additional Comments]
<p>Stealth Rock is always useful to have, and Registeel is a reliable Pokemon to set it up. especially in the face of many Choice Scarfed Dragon-type attacks. Thunder Wave is extremely useful for crippling a wide range of Pokemon in the Uber tier, such as Latias, Latios, and Lugia. Ice Punch is Registeel's offensive move of choice, but don't expect too much out of it, given Registeel's mediocre offenses. Explosion can be used to go out with a bang, and will leave dents in almost everything that doesn't resist it. Toxic deserves a mention for the ability to cripple walls like Lugia, Giratina, and Groudon (on the switch-in), and may be used over Thunder Wave. Make your choice depending on the team's needs.</p>

<p>The EVs lean towards Special Defense, with a small investment in Attack and Defense. The Attack EVs allow a guaranteed 2HKO on min/min Rayquaza with Ice Punch, and an OHKO on Latias with Explosion, with Stealth Rock in play. 80 Defense EVs allow you to be almost never 2HKOed by an Adamant, once Dragon Danced Rayquaza with Outrage, allowing you to cripple it with Thunder Wave, or if it is within range, flat out KO it. Additionally, Modest Choice Specs Kyogre's Thunder will be a 3HKO, allowing you to either paralyze it, poison it, or Explode on it, all of which will severely hinder its sweep.</p>

<p>While it can survive against Dragon Dance Rayquaza locked into Outrage, DO NOT keep Registeel in against Swords Dance variants. This is because the Swords Dance variants run Dragon Claw instead of Outrage, and hence can simply Earthquake for the KO. You should also beware of Earthquake from any other variant of Rayquaza, especially Dragon Dance Rayquaza, since it will do a ton of damage, with a small chance of a OHKO. Additionally, do not even try to switch in Registeel onto Kyogre unless it is locked into Thunder or Ice Beam, as its STAB attacks OHKO Registeel in the rain.</p>

<p>To get the most out of Registeel, partner it with an offensive Kyogre to provide rain support while also luring in Dragon-types who resist Water Spout. Registeel can switch in on most of these Pokemon, allowing it to either spread paralysis or simply explode. Other useful teammates include defensive Lugia and Ho-oh. Both of these Pokemon are resist Fighting-type attacks and are immune to Ground-type ones, while simultaneously providing support against many of Registeel's common switch-ins, including Groudon, Skarmory, and Forretress.</p>

<p>Registeel may resist the premiere attacking types in Ubers, but is still weak against Ground- and Fighting-type attacks. It also suffers from a lack of reliable recovery. To these ends, Latias is a fantastic partner for Registeel, providing Wish support for the metal hunk, as well as having awesome defensive synergy with Registeel. Latios is also a decent partner, as Earthquakes aimed at Registeel give him free switch-ins to start wreaking havoc. Someone to take care of Rayquaza is also preferable, such as physically defensive Groudon. Speaking of Groudon, it absolutely mauls Registeel, so having someone like Wobbuffet, Giratina, Lugia, or Scarf Shaymin to check it is preferable.</p>

[Other Options]
<p>Toxic can be useful over Thunder Wave in order to deal with Lugia and Groudon switch-ins, but won't likely support the team as much, as many of Registeel's preferred teammates would enjoy their common counters becoming paralyzed. Earthquake or Iron Head can be used to deal with Dialga and Mewtwo respectively. Iron Head also gives Registeel an attack against Darkrai, although many Darkrai will simply put Registeel to sleep, Nasty Plot, and then Focus Blast. Thunder is a final option to deal damage to many common Pokemon while also providing a chance of paralysis, but the damage is pretty low when you factor in the only 30% chance of paralysis compared to Thunder Wave's 100% chance.</p>

[Checks and Counters]
<p>Registeel's best counter is by far Groudon who is immune to Thunder Wave, has huge defense, can hit Registeel super-effective with STAB Earthquake, and provides sun to further increase Registeel's weakness to Fire-type attacks. Other solid counters include Bulk Up Dialga and Substitute Ho-oh, both of whom Registeel can't touch outside of Explosion. Much like in OU, Registeel's biggest weakness is that it can not defend against the most common Spikers in the tier.</p>
