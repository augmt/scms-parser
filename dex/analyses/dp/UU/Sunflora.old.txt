[Overview]

<p>This pretty flower has been blessed with a great Special Attack stat, two useful abilities in Chlorophyll and Solar Power, and a pretty good movepool to take advantage of. Although she seems great at first glance, you'll notice her poor Speed and defensive stats make it difficult for her to sweep and leaves her vulnerable to priority moves. Her lack of useful supporting moves is also a disappointment; her support movepool is so shallow, she is even forced to use the horribly unreliable Grass Whistle instead of Sleep Powder. With the correct teammates and/or field effects, Sunflora is a decent offensive Pokemon; just play it safe, she's as delicate as a rose.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although Sunflora looks like "just another Chlorophyll user," she has higher Special Attack and a better offensive movepool than most of them. When the weather is sunny, Sunflora has enough Speed to outrun base 95 Pokemon and base 105s with a Timid nature. Solar Beam is used for STAB, as the sun removes its charging turn, Hidden Power Fire is used to hit other Grass-types and gains a boost from the sun, and Earth Power provides coverage against Fire-types. Grass Knot can be used for STAB outside the sun and deals a lot of damage to heavy opponents.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Sunflora needs partners who can switch into Fire-type attacks as she is unable to stay in against them. Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Milotic are great examples because of their great defenses and access to reliable recovery moves. Flash Fire Pokemon such as Houndoom and Arcanine are good choices as well. Finally, bulky Rock-types such as Rhyperior and Omastar are good partners as they take little damage from Fire-type attacks and can hit back super effectively--watch out for Hidden Power Grass, though.</p>

<p>As Sunflora is so frail, she usually requires a teammate to set up Sunny Day for her. Uxie is a great defensive option and has access to other support moves such as Yawn and Stealth Rock--great assets to offensive teams. Ambipom is another good option because of his blistering Speed, access to Taunt, and the ability to scout the opponent's team with U-turn and Fake Out. Finally, Exeggutor can set up Sunny Day, cripple an opponent with Sleep Powder, then Explode in their face allowing you to bring in Sunflora unscathed. Sunflora also appreciates teammates who take advantage of the sun along with her. Fire-types such as Moltres and Blaziken get a boost to their STAB moves, Chlorophyll users such as Shiftry and Vileplume have their Speed doubled, and Leaf Guard Pokemon such as Leafeon and Tangrowth gain an immunity to status; all are excellent teammates.</p>

<p>Sunflora has trouble breaking through special walls such as Chansey and Clefable, making a teammate who can dispose of them a necessity. A powerful Fighting-type such as Hariyama is a good option as it can thrash special walls with its STAB Fighting-type attacks and Guts will turn status into an asset rather than a liability. Dugtrio is another option as Arena Trap will stop them from fleeing the field and a STAB Earthquake OHKOes them with ease.</p>

[SET]
name: Life Orb

evs: 12 HP / 252 SpA / 244 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes advantage of Sunflora's alternative ability Solar Power, boosting her Special Attack to insane levels. This does come with its drawbacks however. Using a Life Orb when the sun is active causes Sunflora to lose 22.5% of her health per turn, making her extremely frail, and giving her little time to sweep. Leaf Storm is an immensely powerful attack coming from 105 base Special Attack, boosted by Life Orb and Solar Power, and gaining STAB as well. Earth Power is used to hit Fire-types such as Houndoom, Blaziken, and Magmortar on the switch, while Hidden Power is used to hit opposing Grass-types. Synthesis is used to recover Life Orb and Solar Power recoil, and also benefits from the sun by restoring 2/3 of Sunflora's health.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Modest nature along with 244 Speed EVs allow Sunflora to outrun the likes of Weezing and Clefable not investing in Speed, while maximum Special Attack is used for extra power. Alternatively, a Quiet nature can be used with 2 Speed IVs and Trick Room support. Choice Specs is also viable to boost Sunflora's attacking power, though this makes Synthesis pretty useless and doesn't help her much in the long run.</p>

<p>If Trick Room is used, Pokemon who can set it up are important. Slowking is a great example as he is slow, has a resistance to Fire- and Ice-type attacks, and access to Slack Off. Porygon2 is another defensive partner with reliable recovery. Slow sweepers such as Camerupt, Rhyperior, and Omastar can be used to plow through the opponent's team. Sunny Day is required to activate Solar Power, making defensive Pokemon like Uxie prime examples of good teammates to set the sunny weather up. More offensive Pokemon such as Shiftry and Exeggutor can be used as well.</p>

<p>Again, Chansey and Clefable will be difficult to break through, making powerful physical attackers great teammates. Outside of physical attackers, Taunt Mismagius is immune to Seismic Toss, blocks status and stat boosting moves with Taunt, and has access to Nasty Plot to boost her Special Attack. A +6 Hidden Power Fighting can 2HKO Chansey with ease. Neither Chansey nor Clefable like being Tricked a Choice item, so Pokemon such as Choice Band Spiritomb or Choice Scarf Uxie can catch the opponent off-guard and make a sweep much easier.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Sunflora has a pretty good movepool, though half of her attacks are rendered useless by her mediocre stats. Encore can be used against slower Pokemon trying to set up stat boosts, giving a teammate extra time to set up. Leech Seed can be used alongside Substitute to restore Sunflora's health, though her low Speed makes it difficult to pull this off before she gets KOed. Endeavor can be used with a Focus Sash to severely weaken the opponent, but a lack of priority makes it difficult to finish them off. Growth can be used to raise Sunflora's already high Special Attack. Grass Whistle can put an opponent to sleep, just beware of its shaky accuracy. Light Screen raises Sunflora's Special Defense and supports her teammates, and Sludge Bomb hits other Grass-types super effectively, though it provides poor coverage. Swords Dance can be used alongside Seed Bomb and Return, but Venusaur is a much better user of this strategy as he has access to Sleep Powder and Earthquake.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Most Flying-types can take on Sunflora with ease as they resist her main STAB and have super effective attacks to KO her. Moltres, Swellow, and Altaria are just a few examples. Chansey and Clefable can take on any Sunflora thanks to their massive HP and Special Defense stats, access to status moves, and reliable recovery. Golduck can cause problems with Cloud Nine as he outruns Sunflora without her Chlorophyll boost and has access to Ice Beam to hit her super effectively. Specially defensive Weezing is immune to Earth Power, has a resistance to Grass-type attacks, and has Sludge Bomb to dispose of Sunflora. Specially defensive Arcanine is another good option as he can survive Earth Power, has a resistance to Grass-, Ice-, and Fire-type attacks, and has STAB Fire-type attacks to scorch Sunflora. Although Sunflora is fast when her Speed is boosted by Cholorophyll, she's still too slow to beat Pokemon such as Alakazam, Dugtrio, and Sceptile, all of whom can hit Sunflora on her frail defenses and KO her. Finally, Sunflora's poor Defense leaves her vulnerable to physical priority moves such as Sucker Punch and Ice Shard, so take advantage of them when you can.</p>
