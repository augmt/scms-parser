[Overview]

<p>While Illumise appears terrible on paper, she does have a few perks that allow her to compete in UU; her biggest advantage is Tinted Lens, which allows any resisted attacks to hit for neutral damage. While it appears that Illumise is outclassed by Venomoth, her superior movepool, which includes moves such as Encore, Wish, and Baton Pass, allows her to differentiate herself from her moth cousin. Given some team support, Illumise could be a reasonable alternative to some of the other Pokemon running around UU; just don't expect anything amazing out of her.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Bug Buzz is Illumise's main STAB move, and hits most Pokemon reasonably hard, while Thunderbolt allows Illumise to hit Moltres, who resists Bug Buzz even with Tinted Lens, and Milotic for more damage. Hidden Power Ice is Illumise's most powerful attack against Altaria, while Hidden Power Ground lets Illumise hit Toxicroak and Registeel for super effective damage. The final move depends on what item Illumise is using; if Life Orb is being utilized, Encore can be used to shut down stat-boosters, while U-turn should be used in conjunction with Choice Specs to scout switch-ins.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Charge Beam is a decent alternative in the last slot, having a 63% chance (factoring in accuracy) to grab a free Special Attack boost while allowing Illumise to finish off a weakened opponent in the process. Roost is another option in the final slot, enabling Illumise to recover lost health, but she generally doesn't have the time to do so.</p>

<p>Chansey and Registeel completely wall Illumise. Moltres (as long as it avoids Thunderbolt) and specially defensive Arcanine can take a hit and roast Illumise to a crisp with their powerful STAB Fire-type attacks. Due to this, Dugtrio is a fantastic teammate thanks to his ability to trap and remove most of Illumise's counters. Rapid Spinners are great parters since they can remove Stealth Rock, allowing Illumise to switch in much more easily. Bulky Water-types, such as Milotic and Slowking, are also wonderful as they are excellent switch-ins to the Fire-types who threaten Illumise. For this reason, Blastoise gives you the best of both worlds, as it can switch into Fire-type attacks and use Rapid Spin to clear away Stealth Rock. Hitmontop and Donphan can switch into Rock-type attacks aimed at Illumise, then spin away Stealth Rock.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Bug Buzz
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Baton Pass
move 4: Encore 
item: Leftovers
ability: Tinted Lens
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes advantage of Illumise's access to Encore and ability to pass Substitutes to her teammates. Illumise can switch into supporting moves such as Wish or Recover, use Encore, and then pass a Substitute to a teammate. Bug Buzz prevents Illumise from being rendered completely useless by Taunt, allowing her to dish out at least some form of damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Charge Beam can replace Substitute if you wish to utilize Illumise's ability to Baton Pass Special Attack boosts. If you want Illumise to become a pure Baton Passer, Bug Buzz can also be replaced. Wish is also an option to pass to Illumise's recipient. It should be noted that Growth is illegal with Baton Pass. The EVs used are so Illumise has maximum bulk while being as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Due to Illumise's crippling Stealth Rock weakness, Rapid Spin support is highly recommended. Blastoise is a fantasic Rapid Spinner who resists Fire-type attacks and can reliably spin away Stealth Rock; additionally, it can even pull off a Rapid Spin against Ghost-types thanks to Foresight. Hitmontop and Donphan can do the same, though these Pokemon resist Rock-type attacks, not Fire. As for recipients, virtually any Pokemon that synergizes well with Illumise works just fine. Feraligatr, Rhyperior, and Toxicroak are all excellent Pokemon who can use the protection of Substitute to set up.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Illumise has a decent movepool, so a few other options can be considered. Growth is useful on the special sweeper set to boost Illumise's Special Attack. Illumise has access to many modes of recovery, namely Roost and Moonlight, as well as Wish, but her lack of bulk really prevents her from abusing these to their fullest potential. If you feel like taking a chance, Silver Wind can replace Bug Buzz on the Baton Pass set, as it has a 10% chance of passing a +1 boost in every stat to the recipient.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Essentially, a Pokemon who has a good Special Defense stat and is not weak to any of Illumise's attacks can be considered a counter. Chansey and Registeel completely wall Illumise, while specially defensive Arcanine can switch in without too much hassle and roast Illumise to a crisp with Flare Blitz. Altaria can switch in, Roost off any damage taken, and proceed to set up Dragon Dance. Toxicroak resists Bug Buzz and can set up on Illumise should she lack Hidden Power Ground. Illumise is also easily revenge killed; Pokemon such as Scyther, Houndoom, and Moltres can all outspeed and OHKO Illumise with their STAB moves.</p>
