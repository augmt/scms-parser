[Overview]

<p>At first glance, Rapidash may seem like a run-of-the-mill Fire-type who is outclassed by Arcanine and Ninetales, but this is not entirely true. Rapidash plays rather uniquely. It has a few support options, blazingly fast Speed (pardon the pun), an immunity to Fire-type attacks thanks to its Flash Fire ability, and respectable offensive stats. Despite Rapidash's limited movepool, it can still be a valuable asset to any team.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Flare Blitz
move 2: Hypnosis
move 3: Megahorn / Return
move 4: Will-O-Wisp / Morning Sun

evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>One of Rapidash's best assets is its access to Will-O-Wisp and Hypnosis, which allows it to take out its counters and support its team. These two moves pair wonderfully with Rapidash's above average Speed. Flare Blitz is Rapidash's strongest STAB move, and coming off of Rapidash's base 100 Attack stat, will hurt anyone who doesn't resist it. Megahorn differentiates Rapidash from other Fire-types. While the type coverage may seem redundant, Megahorn helps against bulky Water-type switch-ins, especially Slowbro and Slowking. Return is also an option if you are concerned about opposing Fire-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs allow Rapidash to Speed tie with Scyther and Mismagius, while 252 Attack EVs let Rapidash deal as much damage as possible. If you aren't concerned about Mismagius and Scyther, you can opt to run a slightly bulkier spread of 84 HP / 248 Atk / 176 Spe. 84 HP EVs give Rapidash 292 HP, allowing it to switch into Stealth Rock an extra time and slightly increase its overall bulk. 176 Speed EVs allow Rapidash to outpace all positive natured base 95s. The rest of the EVs are placed into Attack. Other options include Hidden Power Grass, which allows Rapidash to take out Rhyperior, Kabutops, and Omastar. Toxic is also a decent option in the last slot, as it allows Rapidash to cripple some hard counters like Milotic and Moltres.</p>

<p>Due to Rapidash's Stealth Rock weakness and Spikes vulnerability, a Rapid Spinner would do well as a teammate. Blastoise works well as it can switch into bulky Water-types; in return, Rapidash can take the odd Grass-type attack aimed at Blastoise. Kabutops is also an acceptable spinner if you wish to go for a more offensive approach. In general, anyone who benefits from weakened physical attackers is a great partner for this set. Sceptile and Venusaur are good teammates for Rapidash, as they can come in on the bulky Water-types who Rapidash lures out and set up with Swords Dance or Substitute. Other Grass-types, such as Leafeon and Tangrowth, can work with this set as well. Special walls such as Milotic and, to a lesser extent, Chansey benefit from burned physical attackers.</p>

<p>The counters for this set are essentially the same as the counters for every other Fire-type Pokemon: fast Earthquake users and strong Water-types. Aqua Jet Azumarill can counter this set, provided it doesn't get burned. Fire-types can do a pretty good job of taking on this set since they are immune to Will-O-Wisp and resist Flare Blitz and Megahorn. However, they should be wary of Hypnosis. Milotic is a great counter for this set; RestTalk variants work especially well since they can Rest off the burn inflicted by Will-O-Wisp. Rock-type Pokemon can also counter this set with ease. While most of them do not enjoy being burned, Omastar can take the burn and KO from the special side.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Hidden Power Grass
move 3: Megahorn
move 4: Hypnosis / Will-O-Wisp
ability: Flash Fire
item: Life Orb
nature: Naive
evs: 80 Atk / 252 SpA / 176 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rapidash's decent base 80 Special Attack, respectable base 100 Attack, and high base 105 Speed mean that it is perfectly capable of running an efficient mixed set. Fire Blast is Rapidash's most powerful special attack, while Hidden Power Grass hits bulky Water-types for decent damage and OHKOes Omastar. Megahorn takes out would-be walls, such as Slowking and Grumpig, who can take on Fire Blast and Hidden Power Grass without breaking a sweat. Naive is the preferred nature because it allows Rapidash to run more EVs in Attack while maintaining some more physical bulk, which can pay off if you use Will-O-Wisp as the final move. Hypnosis and Will-O-Wisp can both fit in the last slot, as they allow Rapidash to cripple its counters.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If you don't wish to take away from Rapidash's Special Defense, a Mild nature is useable with an EV spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe. With this alternate EV spread, however, you will lose out on some important 2HKOs, such as on Slowking and Grumpig. Morning Sun is a possible option over Will-O-Wisp or Hypnosis if you wish to increase Rapidash's longevity. Those are really the only other options for this set; poor Rapidash was cursed with an extremely small movepool.</p>

<p>Rapidash's Stealth Rock weakness limits its ability to switch in, so a Rapid Spinner such as Kabutops or Blastoise will benefit this set greatly. Strong Grass-types such as Sceptile, Venusaur, Leafeon, and company can all benefit from Rapidash's tendency to lure out bulky Water-types, essentially getting a free turn to attack or set up. Other Fire-types can also benefit from this set because of its ability to weaken opposing Water-types.</p>

<p>The counters for the above set apply for this set as well. Specially defensive Donphan can survive a Hidden Power Grass or Fire Blast and easily OHKO back with Earthquake, but cannot switch in on either of the aforementioned attacks, as it will be 2HKOed. Milotic fears nothing from this set and can strike back with a super effective Surf or Hydro Pump. Azumarill and Feraligatr can switch in and take Rapidash out with Aqua Jet. Dugtrio can also be used to revenge kill this set, but cannot switch in on any of Rapidash's moves.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>At first, this set may seem odd; in most people's minds, a Pokemon with a Stealth Rock weakness and a fairly limited movepool is not going to be the first candidate for a choice set. Rapidash appears to be outclassed by Arcanine, but it can scout the opponent's switch-in with Baton Pass, something Arcanine cannot do. Megahorn is also a pretty neat move; with a whopping 120 Base Power, it will deal a chunk of damage to most Water-type switch-ins and dent Houndoom as well. Iron Tail may seem like a strange option, as it lacks STAB and has poor coverage. However, it will do a good amount of damage to Kabutops, Omastar, Rhyperior, and other Rock-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are pretty straightforward: max Attack and max Speed to hit as hard and as fast as possible. The choice between Baton Pass and Iron Tail in the last slot is dependent on how you wish to play Rapidash. If you want to play conservatively and use Rapidash to scout your opponent's team, then Baton Pass is an ideal option. However, if you wish to be more aggressive, then Iron Tail is an excellent choice. Choosing between a Jolly or an Adamant nature is also a tough decision; an Adamant nature gives Iron Tail a chance to 2HKO Rhyperior, but a Jolly nature will let Rapidash Speed tie with max Speed Mismagius and Scyther.</p>

<p>Quick Attack is also a decent option if you wish to pick off weakened, faster threats and pinch Berry users, but doesn't have much use outside of that. Double Kick is also a somewhat viable option, but using it means that Mismagius can switch in on two of Rapidash's attacks for free and proceed to set up.</p>

<p>As with every other Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon in the game, a Rapid Spinner makes a wonderful teammate for Rapidash. This is especially true with a Choice set since switching will be more common. Blastoise is a decent option since it can take on most Water-types who Rapidash lures in. Donphan is also a good choice, as it can switch in on the bulky Rock-types who come in on Rapidash. Kabutops is a good option if you want a more offensive approach. Leafeon is a good teammate because it can come in on Rhyperior and get a free Swords Dance on the switch. Offensive Milotic is also a good partner since it can take advantage of the Water-types who Rapidash lures in. As far as counters go, Stealth Rock will wear down Rapidash very quickly, as will sandstorm or hail damage. Spikes further bring down Rapidash's miniscule HP stat; this problem is compounded by the fact that many common Spikes users can set up on Rapidash. Milotic fears nothing on this set and easily shrugs off any damage with Recover. Feraligatr can also set up on this set and force it out. Regirock and Rhyperior can cause problems for this set, as they are able to set up if Rapidash is using an ineffective move.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Agility
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Flare Blitz
move 4: Substitute
ability: Flash Fire
item: Leftovers
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to Pokemon XD, Rapidash can use Baton Pass to pass boosts to its teammates or to scout for counters. After an Agility boost, nobody will outspeed Rapidash, allowing it to execute its Baton Pass with incredible speed. Generally speaking, Rapidash will not be able to pass both Substitute and Agility, as it is rather frail and its Substitutes will easily be broken. Flare Blitz gives Rapidash some sort of attack so it cannot be shut down by Taunt users.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>There really are no other options for Rapidash. You could go with a Timid nature and Fire Blast instead of Flare Blitz, but Flare Blitz is almost always a better option because of its higher accuracy. Unfortunately, you cannot use Morning Sun or Hypnosis with Baton Pass on Rapidash because of breeding conflictions stemming from the fact that Baton Pass is only available on XD.</p>

<p>Leftovers is an excellent item choice, but if you wish to take full advantage of Baton Pass, a pinch Berry may be equipped to pass an extra boost. To activate the Berry safely, Rapidash can first use Agility, and then Substitute down to 25% health. The pinch Berry strategy should be used late-game, however, as it only has one shot to work and is more successful when you know your opponent's team.</p>

<p> Bulky, offensive Water-types are excellent recipients because of Rapidash's tendency to lure out Water-types. Milotic is a great choice because of its natural bulk and strong attacking moves. Azumarill is also a good option if you are looking for a physical recipient. Leafeon, Venusaur, Tangrowth, and basically any other offensive Grass-type are also good options since they can take the Water-type attacks aimed at Rapidash and proceed to outspeed and possibly OHKO said Water-type.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes all hinder Rapidash's attempts to Baton Pass effectively, so a Rapid Spinner would be a very welcome teammate. Claydol is a decent option as it resists Stealth Rock and is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, but shares a Water-type weakness with Rapidash. Blastoise is a pretty solid option as well because of its decent bulk and resistance to Water-type moves. Donphan and Hitmontop can also be used, but their poor special bulk leaves them vulnerable against bulky Water-types.</p>

<p>Phazers and Hazers shut down this set and strategy. The most threatening of these Pokemon is Milotic, who can take Rapidash's Flare Blitz and OHKO back with Surf. Aqua Jet users, such as Kabutops and Azumarill, can OHKO Rapidash before it can pass its boosts. Bulky Taunt users such as Drapion also mess up this set by preventing Rapidash from using Baton Pass.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There isn't much else Rapidash can do that Arcanine or Ninetales can't. Rapidash is capable of running a SunnyBeamer set, but other Fire-types can generally do this better. Rapidash also has access to Bounce and Toxic for spreading paralysis or Toxic stalling, respectively. However, these sets are not particularly effective since Rapidash is forced out rather easily and cannot afford to switch in many times due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Rapidash also learns Poison Jab, but Megahorn is generally a better choice.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Earthquake from anyone with a respectable Attack stat will KO or cripple Rapidash. Specially defensive Donphan is an excellent counter, as it can shrug off anything Rapidash has to throw at it. Dugtrio is also a good option, but can't switch in on Rapidash safely. Thanks to its ability, however, it can trap and OHKO Rapidash with Earthquake. Slowbro can take on the Standard Pony set, but can be 2HKOed by Hidden Power Grass from the mixed set. Milotic is generally going to be the best answer to any and all Rapidash sets. With its natural bulk and respectable Special Attack, it can switch in on almost any move, take advantage of any status inflicted onto it, and OHKO with STAB Surf. Arcanine can also counter Rapidash well since it resists all of Rapidash's attacks.</p>

<p>Anyone with a STAB Aqua Jet will also make Rapidash think twice about staying in. Azumarill is an excellent candidate for this due to its natural bulk and massive Attack stat. Feraligatr and Kabutops can also take on Rapidash, but the latter should be careful about switching into Hidden Power Grass.</p>
