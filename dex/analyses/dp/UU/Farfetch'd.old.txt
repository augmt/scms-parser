[Overview]

<p>I am of the opinion that as Pokemon Red and Blue were about to be released, Farfetch'd accidentally spilled some ink on the suit of one of the most important Game Freak staff members. Since then, they have hated Farfetch'd and did everything they could to make this thing suck as much as possible on the battlefield. No Base Stat over 65, a gazillion better Normal/Flying-types, some interesting moves (none of which can be employed to their full potential) and limited ways of obtaining it ever since the beginning of the Pokemon games. The best thing that can be said about Farfetch'd is that it got a personal item (Stick) which makes it get random critical hits. When you don't need them, usually.</p>

[SET]
name: Violation!
move 1: Knock Off
move 2: Toxic
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Return
item: Stick / Leftovers / BrightPowder
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Oh boy. Okay, here is the deal. Farfetch'd has amazing coolness value, and with this, it astounds its opponent into switching six times in a row. In the meantime you Knock Off their items, Toxic them, use Return to dent things a little or U-turn to get the hell out.</p>

<p>Or, in a more realistic scenario, you get to use one of these moves and you just see which is more appropriate.</p>

[SET]
name: CH'Ding
move 1: Slash
move 2: Night Slash
move 3: Air Cutter
move 4: Steel Wing / Toxic / Knock Off
item: Stick
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>If you're using Farfy, you should be a rather optimistic fellow. Therefore, you will assume it critical hits as often as it dies. Farfetch'd's Special Attack may be beyond retarded, but it's also only seven base points lower than its Attack, so Air Cutter might work out if Farfetch'd is exceptionally lucky.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Bandux
move 1: Return
move 2: Aerial Ace
move 3: Quick Attack
move 4: Night Slash / Hidden Power Ground / Double-Edge / Knock Off
item: Choice Band
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>I've seen this set before and I'm sure you have too. But where? Was it on Staraptor, Dodrio, Swellow, Fearow, or Pidgeot?</p>

[SET]
name: Flail
move 1: Endure
move 2: Flail
move 3: Swords Dance
move 4: Substitute / Aerial Ace / Agility
item: Salac Berry / Liechi Berry
nature: Jolly / Adamant
evs: 252 Atk / 252 Spe / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>There's so many options with this set, it almost makes Dux look versatile. You're going to get to one HP somehow to launch STAB Flails, Swords Danced or not. Substitute and Endure on the same set nearly guarantees you get that Swords Dance in, Aerial Ace gives you some decent STAB when Flail isn't effective (yet), and Agility allows you to skip Salac Berry and outspeed more things in addition to praying for Liechi.</p>

<p>I could have named this set F(l)ail, but since Dux is so horribly cool I think placing it in the same vein as Luvdisc is a bit mean.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Pluck for things that have a Berry, Mirror Move for laughs, and False Swipe for in-game catching. Air Slash is a decent STAB move. Farfetch'd is too fragile to use Curse, Roost or Psych Up.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>See the Counters section of all its bird brethren, starting from Pidgeot and going up, and ignore all "watch out for" statements.</p>
