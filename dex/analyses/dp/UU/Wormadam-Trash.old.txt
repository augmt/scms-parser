[Overview]

<p>Wormadam-S has always been considered a bad Pokemon. Its stats are subpar, its movepool is shallow, and it doesn't have anything that makes it stand out from other Bug-types. Simply put, Wormadam-S is basically an inferior Forretress. Nevertheless, this Pokemon shouldn't be considered complete trash (pun intended), as it has a superb defensive typing with only a single weakness, as well as good overall defenses. These attributes mean that the pink bagworm can be a good team supporter in UU if played correctly.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Wormadam-S at its best. Wormadam's main strategy will be to set up Stealth Rock as early as possible, and then attempt to cripple a few Pokemon before it faints. Gyro Ball is its main attacking move, as it gains STAB and is quite powerful due to Wormadam's low Speed stat. Wormadam-S has access to both Toxic and Protect, allowing it to effectively Toxic stall opposing Pokemon. Protect also has the added benefit of enabling Wormadam-S to scout for Hidden Power Fire, as Wormadam's ability, Anticipation, does not allow it to detect the type of Hidden Power.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Wormadam-S's resistances are more suited to "countering" special attackers, and thus the EVs and nature have been chosen to reflect this. Max HP and 240 Special Defense EVs give it a considerable amount of bulk on the special side, and allow it to survive two +2 Thunderbolts from Mismagius, whilst 16 Defense EVs allow Wormadam-S to never be 2HKOed by a +2 Double-Edge from Leafeon, factoring in Leftovers recovery from Protect. Leftovers is chosen to complement Wormadam's bulk, whilst Sassy is the chosen nature to maximize Special Defense and maintain a low Speed stat, in order to give Gyro Ball more power.</p>

<p>Milotic is a great partner to Wormadam-S, as it is able to switch in on the Fire-type Pokemon who threaten Wormadam-S and strike back with Surf. Omastar is also an excellent teammate thanks to its 4x resistance to Fire-type moves and ability to set up entry hazards. Slowbro is also a good switch-in, as it resists many of the moves that would normally fatally wound the pink-bagworm, and heal itself with Slack Off or set up dual screens to support the team. Houndoom and Arcanine appreciate Wormadam-S's ability to cripple bulky Water-types with Toxic, and can also switch in on Fire-type moves and receive a boost thanks to Flash Fire, turning them both into deadly sweepers.</p>

[Other Options] 

<p>There isn't much else that Wormadam-S can do, but there are a few options to choose from. It can utilize Metal Sound, Flash Cannon, Psychic, and a Hidden Power of your choice with a Modest nature to create a special attacking set, but it is usually inferior to every other special attacking Pokemon in UU in all cases. It also has access to Substitute, but with its lack of reliable recovery and a glaring weakness to Fire-type moves, it is not worth using. It is also able to set up rain in the form of Rain Dance, due to it's its great 4x resistance to Grass, which many rain teams struggle with, and can also lure in Fire-types for Pokemon like Kabutops to switch into. Skill Swap is also a viable gimmick move to use on Fire-types, because if Wormadam-S can snag Flash Fire, it will have at least a neutrality to all types.</p>

[Checks and Counters] 

<p>Wormadam-S is not hard to counter. Pretty much any Fire-type is a counter to Wormadam-S, as they can switch in and easily OHKO the floating bug. Arcanine and Houndoom make short work of Wormadam-S with their Fire-type STAB moves, and can also set up on it with ease. Moltres falls in a similar category, and can even set up Substitute as Wormadam-S switches out or attempts to poison it. Altaria can also set up on Wormadam-S with impunity and proceed to sweep, but should be cautious of Toxic (though Natural Cure somewhat remedies this problem). Weezing is another good counter to the pink bagworm, as it resists all of its attacking moves and Toxic, and can OHKO with Fire Blast or Flamethrower. Wormadam-S also has to be wary of Uxie, who can set up dual screens before crippling it with Memento. Registeel, despite not being able to do much to Wormadam-S, can use it as setup fodder and boost its stats with Curse.  Basically, don't try hitting it with Grass- or Poison-type attacks and avoid Toxic and you've successfully countered it.</p>
