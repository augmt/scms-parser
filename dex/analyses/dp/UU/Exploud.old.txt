[Overview]

<p>Discounting the mighty Arceus, Exploud has (arguably) the best mixed attacking stats of any Normal-type in the game. With a diverse offensive movepool to match, Exploud would seem to be a very prominent wallbreaker in the metagame. To the contrary, however, he is not, for his attacking stats come at the expense of his defenses and Speed, and even his beefy base 104 HP isn't enough to save him in this regard. Normal STAB is also not that great, being resisted by a fair number of popular Pokemon, and being super effective against none. Regardless of these issues, Exploud makes a fine offensive Pokemon, and can really shine when given the right circumstances and support.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Exploud's eloquent movepool backed up by his impressive mixed attacking stats allow him to put a dent on just about anything in UU with the right move. This set takes advantage of this quality to maximize Exploud's potential. Return is Exploud's most appropriate STAB move, having absolutely no drawbacks and sporting a very respectable Base Power. Earthquake covers those annoying Steel- and Rock-types that resist Return, while Crunch does the same for Ghost-types, who sport an immunity to Return. Having already achieved perfect coverage with those three moves, the fourth slot is for a leisure move more than anything else. Surf OHKOes Rhyperior, who would otherwise be able to take an Earthquake and retaliate, and does more damage to the likes of Steelix and Donphan as well. On the other hand, Ice Beam deals massive damage to Torterra and Altaria.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb gives Exploud the power he needs to achieve the KOs he does, which is why it's the recommended item here. As always, Leftovers is still a viable alternative for survivability. Low Kick has roughly the same coverage as Earthquake, but is only more powerful against Pokemon already covered by Surf or Ice Beam. The EVs maximize Attack and give Exploud enough speed to outpace positive-natured base 50s such as Aggron. The rest is then sprinkled into Special Attack to power up the fourth move.</p>

<p>Seeing as Exploud is an offensive Pokemon, entry hazards will be very helpful in improving his chances of success by passively weakening the opposition, securing KOs he may not have had otherwise. Claydol and Nidoqueen are great Pokemon for this, and they both can switch into the Fighting-type moves that Exploud fears. Paralysis support is also favorable for the slow Exploud, and it can be easily provided by an ample number of Pokemon; Rotom, Venusaur, and Uxie being just some of them. Finally, Pokemon that can take advantage of a weakened defensive team make great teammates, particularly those that attempt to set up and sweep late-game.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Return
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Crunch
item: Leftovers
nature: Adamant
evs: 224 HP / 252 Atk / 32 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Exploud's defenses aren't too great, but he has the movepool and attacking stats to threaten anything, making him more than capable of using Substitute to his advantage. While a mixed set is more comfortable dealing with defensive teams, Substitute Exploud can tear apart offensive teams with proper prediction. Return returns (pardon the pun) as the preferred STAB move, with good Base Power and no drawbacks, while Earthquake and Crunch cover everything that resists Return. Substitute is a given, and Leftovers help Exploud cope with the health loss from making Substitutes.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As for the given EV spread, Attack is maximized so that Exploud can deal as much damage as he possibly can. Then, HP is pumped so that Exploud can create 101 HP Substitutes, punishing foes that rely on Seismic Toss to deal damage, namely Chansey. The remainder is sent to Speed, conveniently allowing Exploud to outspeed all neutral nature base 40 Speed Pokemon, most notably Rhyperior. Some defensive Pokemon also tend to lurk around this Speed tier, however, so additional Speed EVs can be invested in order to outpace them as well. The benefits of a simple maximum Attack and maximum Speed spread are also there, so that's also an option, and so is everything in between, really. Low Kick and Hammer Arm make viable alternatives to Earthquake here, though Low Kick doesn't have consistent damage and Hammer Arm lowers Exploud's already barely-adequate Speed.</p>

<p>Entry hazard support is especially useful here because of the typical switch-causing effect of a Substitute set. Spikes are good for hitting the grounded targets that Exploud usually lures in, and they can be set up by Qwilfish, who resists Fighting. Special attackers such as Mismagius make great offensive teammates here because of their ability to bring out Registeel and Chansey, two Pokemon that Exploud can set up on with particular ease. The reverse is true in the case of Mismagius, who can easily set up on the kind of Pokemon that Exploud attracts.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Exploud makes a fantastic Baton Pass recipient, as he has all the right stats and movepool to be one. He also has Soundproof to block out any attempts to Roar him out. A pass could come from either a chain, or from a Pokemon such as Gligar. Fire Blast and Flamethrower are good special attacks, but have rather redundant coverage alongside Earthquake. Going primarily special is an option, using Hyper Voice for STAB, and moves such as Surf, Fire Blast, Shadow Ball, and Focus Blast for coverage. Exploud's physical attacks are generally more powerful though. Choice sets are fine, but Exploud is generally too slow to pull one off effectively. Howl is an interesting move, but Exploud is pretty much outclassed in that area by Swords Dance Zangoose.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Despite his excellent coverage, Exploud can still be beaten by several bulky Pokemon. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic, who are sturdy enough to avoid being 2HKOed by Return, make great checks. Spiritomb isn't 2HKOed by Crunch, and can burn Exploud with Will-O-Wisp. Defensive Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Hitmontop are able to take a few hits and KO with their STAB attacks. Without Surf, physical behemoths such as Steelix and Regirock have little to fear from Exploud, while Torterra is able to take him on when he lacks Ice Beam. Finally, pretty much any offensive Pokemon can come in on the revenge kill quite effectively if Exploud has no Substitute up.</p>
