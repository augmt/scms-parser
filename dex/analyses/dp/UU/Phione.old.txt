[Overview]

<p>Aside from having a cuter name, Phione is essentially a cheap rip-off of the mighty Manaphy. While it shares Manaphy's ability and typing, Phione's lack of key moves such as Tail Glow and Calm Mind makes it a lot less threatening, even in the UU tier. However, Phione's near-unique ability in Hydration and usable stats allow Phione to act as a solid Rain Dance supporter or attacker. Although Phione is not an overwhelming force in its own right, do not underestimate what it can do for its team.</p>

[SET]
name: Rain Dance Support
move 1: Rain Dance
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Rest
item: Damp Rock
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Phione's main niche in the UU metagame is to function as a bulky rain supporter. With its ability, Hydration, Phione is able to repeatedly switch in and set up Rain Dance while Resting off any damage taken. Hydration also allows Phione to act as an excellent status absorber for rain teams, preventing its fellow rain sweepers from being crippled. Waterfall is Phione's main STAB move and hits reasonably hard in the rain. U-turn is the icing on the cake, allowing Phione to scout the opponent's switch-in while enabling rain sweepers to come in unscathed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes Phione's bulk, while allowing it to Speed tie with its fellow base 80s, most notably Venusaur. If you want to play Phione more aggressively, an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe can be used; however, Phione won't be able to set up Rain Dance nearly as many times as it can with the main spread if it chooses to utilize such an offensive EV spread. Damp Rock is the item of choice, allowing Phione to create an eight-turn Rain Dance. Heal Bell can be used in place of U-turn to cure status for your team, though U-turn is extremely useful for scouting purposes, one of the main reasons you should even consider using Phione on your team.</p>

<p>It should be noted that by using Phione, you are adding additional Electric- and Grass-type weaknesses for your Rain Dance team to struggle with. For this reason, Pokemon that resist these attacking types are essential teammates. Grass-, Dragon-, and Ground-types, such as Tangrowth, Altaria, and Rhyperior, can cover these weaknesses well, while forming decent defensive cores on a Rain team. Since Phione is dedicated to setting up rain for the rest of the its team, Pokemon that can abuse the rain are essential teammates. Kabutops, Ludicolo, Qwilfish, Omastar, and Gorebyss are all extremely deadly sweepers in the rain, making them excellent partners.</p>

<p>Toxicroak and Poliwrath are the biggest threats to Phione and its team. These Pokemon can switch into Phione as it uses Rain Dance, and set up Substitute, Nasty Plot, or Swords Dance as Phione switches out. Uxie and Weezing can wall Toxicroak and Poliwrath without much difficulty; additionally, both Pokemon are able to set up Rain Dance themselves, making them wonderful teammates. Venusaur is a very good teammate to Phione because of its ability to switch into Grass- and Electric-type attacks with ease. It can also absorb Toxic Spikes, which are quite troublesome for rain teams.</p>

[SET]
name: Rain Dance Special Attacker
move 1: Rain Dance
move 2: Surf
move 3: Grass Knot / Ice Beam / Toxic
move 4: Rest
item: Life Orb / Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is Phione's best attempt at being an offensive Pokemon. By using Rain Dance, Phione becomes immune to status and can use Rest to restore all of its HP in a single turn. In the rain, Surf becomes a powerful move that deals large amounts of damage to any Pokemon that does not resist it. Grass Knot helps Phione deal with the myriad of bulky Water-types in UU, while Ice Beam allows Phione to hit Venusaur and other Grass-types for super effective damage. Toxic can be used in the third slot, enabling Phione to stall and attack at the same time.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If you're using Toxic in the third slot, it is generally a better idea to run a bulkier EV spread such as 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe. Such a spread allows Phione to both take hits and stall much more effectively. Leftovers is the item of choice due to the additional longevity it grants Phione; however, Damp Rock can be used if you want the rain to last longer.</p>

<p>Venusaur is a major threat to Phione, due to its ability to switch into any move apart from Ice Beam. Even though Phione Speed ties with Venusaur, it won't always be able to come out on top against Venusaur. Specially defensive Weezing is possibly the best switch-in to Venusaur, as it resists both of Venusaur's STABs and is indifferent to Sleep Powder thanks to Rest and Sleep Talk. Registeel can also switch into all special variants of Venusaur without much hassle. Apart from Venusaur, strong Electric-types such as Manectric, Rotom, and Lanturn can deal huge amounts of damage to Phione. Venusaur is, ironically, an excellent teammate for this reason, as it is able to absorb Thunderbolt and threaten such Pokemon with its powerful STAB moves. Manectric's Flamethrower will also be weakened by rain, making it a non-threat to Phione's Grass-type teammates.<p>

[Other Options]

<p>Phione's movepool is not particularly large. Due to its great coverage and access to U-turn, a Choice Specs set is plausible. However, Phione's mediocre stats mean that most UU Water-types outclass it in this role. Charm and Acid Armor lower the foe's Attack and boost Phione's Defense, respectively, but since most of its counters attack on the special side, they aren't really useful for Phione. Hidden Power Psychic is possible on the Rain Dance supporter set to prevent Toxicroak and Poliwrath from freely setting up on Phione.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Water Absorbers such as Toxicroak and Poliwrath make Phione's job extremely difficult. Toxicroak can switch into anything that Phione throws at it, set up with Swords Dance or Nasty Plot, and proceed to sweep while being healed by the rain due to Dry Skin. Poliwrath can set up a Substitute in Phione's face and proceed to fire off powerful STAB Focus Punches. Lanturn takes little damage from Phione's attacks, as even Grass Knot only hits for a meager 40 Base Power. Electric-types such as Manectric and Rotom can outspeed and OHKO Phione with Thunderbolt if they switch in on anything apart from Surf or Waterfall. Venusaur is also a huge threat to Phione, capable of switching into any attack apart from Ice Beam, and threatening to OHKO with its powerful Grass-type STAB of choice. Taunt users can completely almost shut down the rain supporter set. Mismagius can use Taunt to stop Phione from setting up rain, then set up Nasty Plot or Calm Mind. Ambipom is also a great user of Taunt, and is capable of hitting Phione hard with its powerful Return.</p>
