[Overview]

<p>Competitively, Regirock is often compared to Registeel, who boasts more balanced defensive stats and a superior set of resistances. However, Regirock fits a specific niche in countering the Fire-types running rampant in the UU metagame. Regirock has a superior Attack stat and STAB typing as well, allowing it to deal with Moltres and other Pokemon whom Registeel has trouble with.</p>

<p>Because of its ability to reliably set up Stealth Rock, counter many top threats in the metagame, and use Explosion when it's finished, Regirock is one of the best tanks in UU. Unlike many other walls in UU, it can take hits from a wide variety of UU Pokemon while also dishing damage back out, and is easily a top contender in the UU metagame.</p>

[SET]
name: Tank
move 1: Stone Edge / Rock Slide
move 2: Earthquake / Thunder Wave
move 3: Stealth Rock
move 4: Explosion
item: Leftovers
nature: Adamant
evs: 204 HP / 148 Atk / 156 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set focuses on Regirock's ability to check numerous threats in the UU metagame, while also being able to pose a threat offensively. Regirock's excellent Defense aids it in countering and checking many physical sweepers. Additionally, Regirock can use its impressive bulk to aid its team through its support moves. Stone Edge and Earthquake create the famous EdgeQuake combination, which provides great type coverage, backed by Regirock's respectable Attack stat. Stealth Rock is secured a spot in the third slot because it allows Regirock to provide some team support while also taking advantage of Regirock's ability to set it up reliably. Explosion differentiates Regirock from Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Aggron. A well-timed Explosion can turn the tide of a match by eliminating a problem Pokemon your team may have trouble facing.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Stone Edge is best used with Earthquake, as 8 PP is too little to rely on for a wall such as Regirock. Earthquake also gives Regirock a way to hit Steelix and Registeel, as well as Fighting-types. However, paralysis support is always useful, and if Thunder Wave is chosen over Earthquake, then Rock Slide becomes the superior option over Stone Edge. With Rock Slide, Regirock will not have PP issues, and also gains access to a nice flinch chance. An alternative to Thunder Wave is Toxic, which can severely cripple Pokemon such as Milotic and Donphan as they switch in. If you already have a reliable Stealth Rock user, such as Mesprit or Uxie, Toxic can go in the third slot to complement either Earthquake or Thunder Wave. Rest can be used over Explosion to ensure Regirock sticks around a bit longer; however, it would be wise to pair Regirock with a cleric such as Chansey or Clefable so it's not a sitting duck.</p>

<p>With the given EV spread, Regirock can comfortably defeat powerful threats such as Mismagius and Houndoom, never being OHKOed by a +2 Hidden Power Fighting or Dark Pulse, respectively. If a more hard-hitting Regirock is desired, an alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD Adamant may be used, but Regirock now has a decent chance of being OHKOed by Timid Life Orb Alakazam's Focus Blast and Nasty Plot Houndoom's +2 Dark Pulse. Finally, another alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD with a Careful nature can be used to fully maximize Regirock's special tanking abilities, made better if used in a sandstorm.</p>

<p>Regirock can also check Pokemon such as Blaziken and Moltres. Blaziken only causes trouble if Regirock is weakened, or if Blaziken runs rare moves such as Focus Blast or Swords Dance. With its amazing defenses, Regirock can switch into Moltres, OHKOing it with its STAB Rock-type move of choice. Regirock really enjoys having a Grass-type to sponge Water-, Grass-, and Ground-type attacks thrown at it. Pokemon such as Venusaur provide nice support for Regirock by bringing down bulky Water-types. Altaria is another Pokemon who can be of use, as it is resistant to Fighting- and Water-type attacks and immune to Ground-type attacks. Both of these Pokemon have instant recovery moves, so Regirock can form a solid defensive core with them. Mismagius can take advantage of Regirock's ability to lure Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, as it can switch into them with impunity. Weezing also makes a great partner as it resists Regirock's Grass- and Fighting-type weaknesses, and is immune to Ground-type attacks. Wish support is greatly appreciated because of Regirock's lack of a reliable recovery move. Chansey makes a good Wish passer to pair with Regirock, as it lures out physical attackers for Regirock to switch into. Leafeon makes a decent alternative Wish passer, possessing great defensive synergy with Regirock.</p>

<p>With Explosion, Regirock can punch some major holes in the opponent's team, allowing another Pokemon to sweep. Bulky Water-types like to switch into Regirock and attempt to force it out with STAB Surf. However, Regirock can absorb the Surf and Explode, eliminating said bulky Water-type. Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Azumarill benefit greatly from these Pokemon being removed from the battle, and thus make good partners for Regirock.</p>

[SET]
name: Mono-Attacker
move 1: Curse
move 2: Rock Slide
move 3: Rest
move 4: Sleep Talk
item: Leftovers / Chesto Berry
nature: Careful
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set abuses Regirock's bulk to set up for a late-game sweep. With its excellent defenses, aided by RestTalk recovery, Regirock will have no trouble setting up Curse. After a couple of Curses, the opponent will likely not be able to KO Regirock with any Pokemon who can survive a boosted Rock Slide. This set reaches its full potential in a sandstorm, especially as the last Pokemon standing so that it can't be forced out. With incredible Defense as well as decent Attack and Special Defense, Regirock can set up six Curses quite easily and sweep your opponent's team. Rock Slide is chosen as the single attack due to its high PP, whereas Stone Edge might be more powerful but runs out too quickly.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Since Regirock already boasts an insane Defense stat, Regirock's EVs should be put into Special Defense and HP (its Special Defense also receives a boost from sandstorm). Leftovers is the preferred item, but Chesto Berry allows Regirock to instantly wake up upon using Rest, allowing it to sweep and prevent itself from becoming setup fodder.</p>

<p>This variant of Regirock needs a Pokemon who can set up permanent sandstorm. Without sandstorm in play, Regirock struggles to take powerful special hits. Unfortunately, Hippopotas is the only option in UU. This Regirock has trouble against Steelix and Donphan, who have great Defense, STAB Earthquake, and Roar to force Regirock out. Pokemon such as Nidoking, Magmortar, and Blaziken can OHKO Steelix, Donphan, and other walls who may be in Regirock's way; however, Magmortar and Blaziken lack sandstorm immunity, so Nidoking is preferred. Unfortunately, all three share an Earthquake weakness with Regirock. Haze Milotic is a big nuisance to Regirock, as it prevents it from setting up. Venusaur makes a fantastic partner, as it can easily switch in on Milotic and threaten it with STAB Grass-type attacks. Regirock should be wary of setting up until Encore and Trick users have been eliminated. Common users of these moves include Alakazam, Clefable, and Uxie. Drapion with Pursuit can be a great partner due to its ability to eliminate common Psychic-type Trick users, and can set up Toxic Spikes to aid Regirock's sweep. Drapion may also utilize Taunt and wear down Clefable as well.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Stone Edge
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Ice Punch
move 4: Explosion
item: Choice Band / Life Orb
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Physical attacking Regirock aims to hit its usual counters hard with boosted attacks. Stone Edge nails any Pokemon who doesn't resist it, and deals respectable damage even when resisted. Earthquake and Ice Punch hit Steel-types and Ground-types, respectively. When Regirock has run its course, Explosion makes sure it takes out another Pokemon before it bites the dust.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Stone Edge is Regirock's main STAB attack, and will dent almost everything that does not resist it. Earthquake is a nice coverage move which hits Steelix for super effective damage and also takes care of Registeel quite easily. Ice Punch is there to KO Pokemon such as Torterra and Claydol, who completely wall Stone Edge and Earthquake. A boosted Explosion is extremely powerful, easily KOing any wall without a resistance or immunity to it.</p>

<p>Regirock takes advantage of Pokemon such as Houndoom and Arcanine who give Regirock a free opportunity to switch in. Venusaur is probably the best partner for this Regirock set, as it lures these Fire-types, and is also able to take hits from the bulky Water-type Pokemon who give this set trouble. With Houndoom and Arcanine out of the way, Grass-types and Pokemon susceptible to priority, such as Alakazam or Absol, have a much easier time sweeping.</p>

[SET]
name: Rock Polish
move 1: Rock Polish
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Explosion
item: Life Orb / Passho Berry
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>As a Rock Polish user, Regirock can work in two different ways. On the one hand, Regirock can play exactly the same as Rock Polish Rhyperior and Torterra as an offensive late-game sweeper. On the other hand, Regirock can also lure in its main counters, Milotic and other bulky Water-types, and blow them away with Explosion, opening the door for another sweeper to come in and finish the job. For the other two slots, Stone Edge and Earthquake come together to form the famous EdgeQuake combo, giving Regirock almost perfect neutral coverage in UU outside of Torterra and Claydol.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>If using Regirock as a sweeper, an Adamant nature and Life Orb are recommended in order to give Regirock as much power as possible. If using Regirock as a lure, a Jolly nature and Passho Berry are recommended instead to guarantee that Regirock outpaces Milotic, survives Surf or Hydro Pump if need be, and eliminates it with Explosion. Regirock literally doesn't have anything else worth using in the last slot besides Explosion. Superpower or Brick Break could be used to gain super effective coverage on Normal-types, but most times Stone Edge and Earthquake will be sufficient, and Regirock really doesn't like the power drop from Superpower.</p>

<p>If you're not planning on Exploding Regirock at the first sign of a bulky Water-type, teammates who can eliminate them in a cleaner manner are recommended. Venusaur is a great teammate to switch into Water-types and blast them with a super effective Leaf Storm; Venusaur is also a good answer to both Claydol and Torterra, who resist both Stone Edge and Earthquake. Stealth Rock and Spikes support are also appreciated to pick up Regirock a couple of secured KOs against bulkier threats. With both forms of support, Life Orb Regirock can easily 2HKO Milotic with Stone Edge. Cloyster and Qwilfish can both provide Spikes support while Uxie and Miltank are both good options for Stealth Rock. Finally, if you decide to blast Milotic with Explosion, then a teammate who can capitalize on its absence is crucial. Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Choice Band Azumarill can both wreck teams without a bulky Water-type, as can Blaziken and Arcanine.</p> 

[SET] 
name: Sunny Day Support
move 1: Sunny Day
move 2: Stealth Rock
move 3: Stone Edge / Rock Slide
move 4: Explosion 
item: Heat Rock
nature: Adamant
evs: 252 HP / 188 Atk / 68 SpD 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sunny Day Regirock is a surprisingly sound strategy; it reduces the damage Regirock takes from Water-type attacks, allowing it to actually beat several of its typical switch-ins, open up a sweep for a Fire-type, such as Typhlosion, or a Chlorophyll user, such as Victreebel, as well as boost the offensive prowess of its teammates in general. In addition to this, Regirock makes a great Stealth Rock supporter, which further facilitates the sweep of said teammates. Regirock is also a fine switch-in to the Fire- and Flying-types that usually trouble a team that revolves around the harsh sunlight, and can quickly dispatch them with its STAB Rock-type attacks. Ghost-types intending to switch into Explosion are also made wary because of its powerful STAB moves.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Heat Rock is the item of choice, prolonging the effects of Sunny Day, and giving Regirock's teammates the best chances of success. The EV spread is simple; HP is maximized for bulk, Attack EVs ensure that Milotic is always OHKOed by Explosion, and the rest are sent into Special Defense for some added leeway against special attackers such as Houndoom. A dedicated specially defensive spread can be used so that Regirock has the bulk to repeatedly set up Sunny Day throughout the match. If such a spread is used, it is recommended that you replace Explosion with Earthquake, as it would be a bit wasteful to just blow up that much beef... err rock.</p>

<p>Fire-types, Chlorophyll users, and basically any Pokemon that can benefit from Sunny Day make great teammates to Regirock. Tangrowth deserves special mention for its ability to switch into Donphan, opposing Regirock, and Rhyperior with ease. Typhlosion and Arcanine are amazing partners as well, as both of them benefit from the removal of Water-types such as Milotic and Azumarill, making a potent Choice set much more viable.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A set consisting of Swagger, Thunder Wave, Rock Slide, and a filler, perhaps Psych Up, is plausible. This set is annoying for your opponent, but accomplishes little more than that. A set with Counter can be used, as Pokemon such as Steelix will commonly use physical attacks to try and take Regirock down, but Regirock often has trouble giving up a moveslot for Counter.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Regirock has many counters due to being mostly defensive in nature. Steelix is a good switch-in to Regirock, as it takes next to nothing from its Rock-type attacks and very little damage from Earthquake. Steelix can put a dent in Regirock with its own Earthquake, which will eventually KO it, or Steelix can just Roar Regirock away if it's trying to set up. Similarly, Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Donphan, and Omastar can switch into almost any attack from Regirock thanks to their high Defense stat and KO it with Earthquake or Surf, respectively.</p>

<p>Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Milotic can switch into Regirock with ease and then threaten it with STAB Surf. Regirock can still deal major damage to these threats with Explosion, though, so be careful. Grass-types such as Venusaur can switch into almost any attack except Thunder Wave and threaten Regirock with powerful STAB attacks. Blaziken can also KO Regirock with Superpower if Regirock switches into a Fire Blast or a super effective Hidden Power; however, Regirock can survive a Superpower if it has taken very little prior damage.</p>
