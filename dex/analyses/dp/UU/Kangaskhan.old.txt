[Overview]

<p>While physical attacking Normal-types normally have their share of troubles with Ghost-types, Kangaskhan is an exception. She is capable of smacking around Ghost-types with Normal- and Fighting-type moves thanks to her ability Scrappy. In addition to this, Kangaskhan is not particularly frail; she has an impressive 105 HP stat along with passable defenses on both ends. While she doesn't exactly have a jaw-dropping Attack stat like most physical sweepers do, Kangaskhan's stand-out features as a sweeper somewhat compensate for this. Overall, Kangaskhan is a cool and underrated Pokemon; this female kangaroo definitely meshes well in the UU tier.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>In contrast to other Choice Banded Normal-types, Kangaskhan has the unique ability Scrappy, which allows her to hit Ghost-types with Normal and Fighting moves. The Choice Band set is the perfect choice for Kangaskhan, since she can spam her high-powered STAB moves without being completely walled by Ghost-types. Furthermore, Kangaskhan hits a Speed of 306 with a Jolly nature, meaning she will always have a jump ahead over the omnipresent 80 Base Speed group in the UU tier. Return and Double-Edge are givens, while Hammer Arm and Earthquake deal with those Steel- and Rock-types. Sucker Punch is mostly filler, but it comes in handy when facing faster threats.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The first slot comes down to two choices: Return or Double-Edge. Return is usually the preferred choice over the latter since it doesn't have any drawbacks for an attacking move, and it can inflict respectable amounts of damage to the opponent with a Base Power of 102. Double-Edge functions as a more aggressive alternative that deals more damage to physical walls in exchange for some recoil. Hammer Arm allows Kangaskhan to smack Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage, who would otherwise resist her primary STAB move. It also hits Normal-types for super effective damage. Low Kick can be used over Hammer Arm to hit heavier Pokemon such as Steelix, Rhyperior, and Registeel harder; it also has 100% accuracy and lacks the negative Speed-dropping effect that Hammer Arm possesses. However, it comes at the risky price of hitting lighter Pokemon, such as Omastar and Kabutops, for lower damage. Sucker Punch provides Kangaskhan with a somewhat reliable priority move for hitting Alakazam and Espeon. The last slot is given to Earthquake as a way to hit Rock- and Steel-types without the Speed drop associated with Hammer Arm. Fake Out is another alternative that allows Kangaskhan to function as a revenge killer in tighter situations. Overall, the general idea of the set is to lure in Rock- and Steel-types, allowing Kangaskhan to smack them for the possible KO with the appropriate move. Once the opponent's Rock- and Steel-types are gone, the Return / Double-Edge spamming can commence.</p>

<p>Life Orb is another option to use over Choice Band if you are worried about getting locked in on a single move. Aqua Tail is an option if you're using Life Orb, as it KOes Rhyperior if it comes in on Return. Adamant can replace Jolly to allow Kangaskhan to truly 2HKO a number of physical walls, including Slowbro, Donphan, and Milotic, on the switch with Double-Edge, as long as Stealth Rock is down.</p>

<p>The Choice Band set is usually hard to deal with since nothing can reliably take the hit on the switch. Rock- and Steel-types are major barricades to this set, so it's advised that you remove them beforehand. Dugtrio is an ideal partner as it can fit on offensive teams while removing Rock- and Steel-types from the match. If you feel the need to space in Kangaskhan with several walls, then Donphan would make an excellent partner. Donphan can combat many Rock- and Steel-types while providing Stealth Rock support for Kangaskhan as an added bonus. Another physical wall who tends to mesh with Kangaskhan is Slowbro, because it can check Hitmontop with relative ease thanks to its part Psychic typing.</p>

[SET]
name: SubPunch
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Focus Punch
move 3: Sucker Punch
move 4: Return
item: Leftovers
ability: Scrappy
nature: Jolly
evs: 212 HP / 44 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Kangaskhan is an ideal choice for a SubPunch set because she can set up sturdy 101 Substitutes and has good defenses, a passable Attack stat, and the ability Scrappy to hit Ghost-types on the switch. Focus Punch, Sucker Punch, and Return can hit everything in UU for neutral damage. The only concern is that Kangaskhan needs to be behind a Substitute to guarantee herself a hit with Focus Punch.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This particular set can run over a team if used correctly. The basic premise is to set up Substitute on the predicted switch-out and from there, you select the appropriate attack accordingly. Focus Punch and Substitute make an excellent combo, and Focus Punch can deal a hefty amount of damage to most Rock- and Steel-types. Kangaskhan's Sucker Punch prevents faster Pokemon from destroying her Substitute. The magic of this set comes from the three moves: Substitute, Focus Punch, and Sucker Punch. If you predict correctly, your opponent will have a hard time hitting Kangaskhan with or without Substitute. Lastly, Return makes a fantastic STAB move for hitting stuff for neutral damage.</p>

<p>If this set's results come off a bit mediocre in terms of power, then you can pump up its Attack stat in exchange for some Speed. An EV spread of 212 HP / 120 Atk / 176 Spe with a Jolly nature allows it to outpace the beneficial Base 80 group, while pumping up its Attack stat to deal more damage to the opponent.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this set lacks the raw power without Choice Band or Life Orb. Most physical walls will beat this set, especially ones with a reliable recovery move such as Milotic, Slowbro, and Tangrowth. Venusaur makes an ideal partner alongside Kangaskhan since it can combat many of those same physical walls. With its fantastic dual STAB moves, Venusaur can beat Milotic, Slowbro, Donphan, Tangrowth, Hitmontop, and Blastoise, if played correctly.</p>

<p>This set tends to lure in Steel-types, so make sure to bring a Pokemon who enjoys having Steel-types removed from the match. Offensively, Dragon Dance Altaria makes an excellent partner, since he can provide a Fighting-type resistance for Kangaskhan, while also wrecking the opposition with his STAB Outrage. Swords Dance Drapion also appreciates it when Steel-types are removed, particularly Steelix.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>There are a number of potential sets that are not among the main sets. You could run an Anti-Lead set with the moves Fake Out, Sucker Punch, Focus Punch, and Counter. However, Kangaskhan doesn't have enough power, unfortunately, to face most common leads. Kangaskhan can also run a support set with Wish, Protect, Return, and Toxic, but she is better off attacking and taking advantage of Scrappy to deal with those pesky Ghost-types. Besides, Lickilicky outclasses her in that role because he has more overall bulk. Kangaskhan can also run a RestTalk set to take advantage of her passable bulk on both ends.</p>

<p>Reversal can be used with Substitute and Liechi Berry to deal more damage to Steel- and Rock-types. Double Hit is another option as well in order to break Mismagius's and Rotom's Substitutes. Although it is illegal with Scrappy, Kangaskhan has Sing and Yawn if you ever need to put the opponent to sleep. Kangaskhan is also blessed with an impressive special movepool, but her Special Attack stat is incredibly low. You can go for 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe spread with a Jolly nature if you wish the outpace the Base 80 group.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The Choice Band set is difficult to check since Rock- and Steel-types risk losing a hefty amount of their HP to Hammer Arm or Earthquake, and Ghost-types can't exactly switch in on her. As with most Choiced Pokemon, you need prediction to weather her hits. Defensive Hitmontop can take a STAB Return while OHKOing back with Close Combat. Rhyperior, Regirock, and Steelix are bulky enough to take a boosted Hammer Arm or Earthquake, and they can counteract with their respective STAB moves, or, in the cases of the latter two, Explosion. Omastar and Registeel are decent checks to the Choice Band set if they avoid switching into super effective moves.</p>

<p>The SubPunch set has troubles dealing with a majority of the physical walls in the tier. Milotic and Slowbro can easily take her down with the combination of Surf and Slack Off or Recover. Tangrowth can do the same with Power Whip or Leaf Storm and Synthesis. Donphan can take Return while 2HKOing back with Earthquake. Blastoise can take a few Returns while striking back with Surf.</p>
