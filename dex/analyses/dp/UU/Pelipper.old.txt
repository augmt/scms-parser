[Overview]

<p>As you might expect of such an ubiquitous Pokemon in-game, Pelipper is not particularly amazing. However, while many of such common Pokemon are usually extremely lackluster, Pelipper is surprisingly decent. His rare typing gives him access to a fantastic STAB combination that's only resisted by Lanturn in UU and a slew of interesting resistances that allow him to check a few common Pokemon in the UU metagame. Additionally, his stats, while not top-notch, are not really poor; a great Defense stat and passable Special Attack give him the ability to be a decent tank. He also has access to all the right moves that allow him to perform his role well. All in all, while Pelipper may seem like another mediocre Water-type that's outclassed by bulkier alternatives such as Milotic, Pelipper has more than enough unique traits to distinguish himself from them and is still somewhat competitively viable.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Boasting a respectable Special Attack stat and a fantastic STAB combo that hits everything in UU neutrally barring Lanturn, Pelipper becomes a strong user of a Life Orb. Additionally, Pelipper is a fairly bulky user of the item, as he has plenty of resistances to switch in on, great physical Defense, and Roost, all of which allow him to switch in multiple times and wreck the opposing team with powerful attacks. While his Speed and Special Attack stat are not quite up to par with some of his fellow Water-types, the aforementioned traits allow him to stand out amongst the crowd and give him competitive viability.</p>

<p>After a STAB and Life Orb boost, Hydro Pump hits fairly hard, especially coming off of Pelipper's maxed out Special Attack stat. Additionally, it has fantastic neutral coverage, only resisted by Grass-, Water-, and Dragon-types, the last of which are rare in UU. Air Slash covers the Grass-types that resist Hydro Pump, and forms a strong neutral attacking combination alongside it. If your opponent happens to have both a Water- and Grass-type on their team, Air Slash is also a decent option to nail either for respectable damage. Roost gives Pelipper some extra longevity by allowing him to shrug off damage from Stealth Rock, Life Orb recoil, and resisted or weak neutral attacks. Hidden Power Grass nails Water-types for decent damage. While it certainly won't do enough to KO healthy bulky Water-types, it is more than capable of KOing weakened ones. Surf is an option over Hydro Pump if you're wary of its low accuracy and PP, but using Surf results in a massive loss of power.</p>

<p>This EV spread is finely tuned to fit Pelipper's purpose. A Modest nature, in tandem with maximum EV investment in Special Attack, gives Pelipper as much force behind his attacks as possible, which is appreciated due to Pelipper's middling Special Attack stat. 212 Speed EVs allow Pelipper to outspeed max Speed Aggron, who Pelipper can then dispose of with ease. However, you can also decrease the amount of Speed EVs if you find that giving Pelipper more bulk is better. For example, 136 Speed EVs is just enough to outspeed Adamant Aggron, and the rest can be poured into HP (though Pelipper still needs to run max Special Attack). 40 HP EV make Pelipper slightly bulkier, and they give Pelipper an odd HP stat. Finally, the 4 remaining EVs are dumped into Pelipper's Defense stat since Pelipper tends to enjoy switching into physical attacks more than special attacks, and so Pelipper doesn't take more damage from Life Orb recoil.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock is a particularly annoying problem for Pelipper; although he does have an instant recovery move, the 25% health lost from Stealth Rock, Life Orb recoil, and damage from light attacks will quickly add up and hinder him. Therefore, Rapid Spinners are extremely useful. Donphan is a good choice due to his powerful attacks and ability to hit Ghost-types with Assurance. Furthermore, Donphan can help Pelipper deal with Registeel and Chansey by hitting them with strong Earthquakes on their weaker defensive stat. Hitmontop is also a decent option due to his ability to guarantee a Rapid Spin with Foresight, and hit the aforementioned walls with super effective Fighting-type STAB attacks.</p>

<p>The main counters to Pelipper reside in bulky Water-types and special walls such as Clefable, Chansey, and Registeel. Bulky Water-types can take everything that Pelipper throws at them with relative ease, bar Hidden Power Grass, and can stall him out with Toxic, while special walls can have no issues switching into Pelipper's special attacks off his just barely above average Special Attack. The former can be dealt with by Grass-types such as Venusaur and Leafeon, who can strike these Water-types for strong, super effective damage, though Venusaur and Leafeon won't enjoy continually switching into Ice Beams. However, the latter are much harder to deal with, as Clefable, Registeel, and Chansey all possess the means to cripple any Pokemon that dares to switch into them with Thunder Wave. Despite this, there are a few Pokemon that can hit these Pokemon on their weaker defensive stats to do massive damage, while not fearing Thunder Wave. Rhyperior and Donphan are two prime candidates for this job, boasting incredible Attack stats which can easily muscle through these walls, as well as an immunity to Thunder Wave due to their Ground typing. Dugtrio can also be used to guarantee that these Pokemon will be removed thanks to Arena Trap, though he will only be able to KO weakened variants.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Pelipper is blessed with an excellent Defense stat, an interesting typing, and a reliable recovery move in Roost, which all assist him in acting as a check to multiple Pokemon in the UU metagame. These include prominent Pokemon such as Arcanine, Leafeon, Donphan, and Azumarill. Though these Pokemon can pack attacks that can dispose of Pelipper (Arcanine can carry Thunder Fang, for example), they typically won't have them, which makes him a decent answer to such Pokemon. Surf is Pelipper's obligatory STAB move, and its ability to hit many important threats such as Donphan and Arcanine is appreciated. Air Slash compliments Surf well, and broadens the field of opponents that Pelipper can successfully check by hitting Pokemon that Surf fails to strike for strong enough damage, such as Leafeon and Hitmontop. Roost greatly increases Pelipper's overall longevity, and its secondary effect of removing Pelipper's Flying typing can be greatly appreciated against some foes. Hidden Power Grass rounds off the set by smacking physical Water-types such as Feraligatr and Azumarill for super effective damage. However, Toxic is a respectable option to deal with bulkier Pokemon such as Milotic, and it's Pelipper's best option against foes he can't touch, such as Rotom. If Toxic is used, it's recommended to replace Air Slash with Hidden Power Grass, as Pelipper has more success checking physical Water-types than Fighting-types since they will usually carry a devastating Stone Edge that Pelipper will have trouble taking.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Speed EVs on this set give Pelipper just enough Speed to outspeed Adamant Rhyperior, and the rest are dumped into HP and Defense to bolster Pelipper's defenses. While more Speed EVs can be used to outspeed foes such as Jolly Rhyperior or even Jolly Aggron, it's usually a poor choice to do so; with the given EVs in Pelipper's Defense, he barely has enough Defense to survive some heavy physical assaults anyway. However, it should be noted that by investing more EVs into Speed, Pelipper will have more opportunities to abuse Roost to prevent himself getting hit super effectively by strong Rock-type moves. Similarly, while a more specially-oriented spread is plausible, taking away more Defense EVs will simply make Pelipper a less reliable check to many physical sweepers, such as Leafeon. To demonstrate Pelipper's physical bulk with the given amount of defensive investment, here are some damage calculations:</p>

 <ul class="damage_calculation">
 <li>252 Adamant Life Orb Arcanine Flare Blitz vs. Pelipper: 28.8% - 34.4%</li>
 <li>252 Adamant Choice Band Azumarill Waterfall vs. Pelipper: 27.6% - 32.5%</li>
 <li>252 Adamant Choice Band Azumarill Return vs. Pelipper: 47.1% - 55.4%</li> (will not 2HKO because Pelipper is faster)
 <li>252 Adamant Choice Scarf Hitmonlee Close Combat vs. Pelipper: 23.5% - 27.9%</li>
 <li>252 Adamant Choice Scarf Hitmonlee Stone Edge vs. Pelipper: 52.6% - 62.5%</li>
 <li>252 Jolly Life Orb Hitmonlee Close Combat vs. Pelipper: 27.9% - 33.1%</li>
 <li>252 Jolly Life Orb Hitmonlee Stone Edge vs. Pelipper: 62.5% - 73.7%</li>
 <li>252 Adamant Life Orb Hitmontop Stone Edge vs. Pelipper: 58.2% - 68.7%</li>
 <li>252 Adamant Toxicroak Stone Edge vs. Pelipper: 48.9% - 57.6%</li>
 <li>252 Jolly Life Orb Leafeon +2 Leaf Blade vs. Pelipper: 78.7% - 92.9%</li>
 <li>252 Adamant Donphan Stone Edge vs. Pelipper: 52.6% - 62.5%</li>
 <li>252 Adamant Choice Band Donphan Stone Edge vs. Pelipper: 79.3% - 93.5%</li>
 </ul> 

<p>Important to note is the fact that Pelipper needs to switch into many of these Pokemon with little or no prior damage, as he barely has enough Defense to take on many of these Pokemon at full health. For example, against Leafeon, Pelipper can survive a +2 Leaf Blade and KO back with Air Slash, but with Stealth Rock, Pelipper is always KOed. This means that Pelipper appreciates two main things: Wish and cleric support, and Rapid Spin. Wish and cleric support can be provided by the likes of Clefable and Chansey, who are both exceedingly bulky and enjoy Pelipper's ability to take on Fighting-types who will give them issues. Also, both of these Pokemon can take hits from specially offensive threats who plague Pelipper. Good Rapid Spin users can be found in Hitmontop and Donphan, who possess sizable strength and a way to deal with Ghost-type Pokemon who may try to block their spin.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Pelipper has a movepool that's fairly large, and as such, there are plenty of other options to choose from. Offensively, Pelipper boasts a surprisingly large physical movepool; powerful moves such as Gunk Shot, Seed Bomb, U-turn, Payback, and Fly are usable with a Life Orb or Choice Band. However, Pelipper's lack of strong physical STAB options and poor Attack stat make this a lackluster choice. While Ice Beam may seem like an appetizing option on special sets, it's usually a poor choice since Pelipper can use STAB Air Slash to hit most of the things that Ice Beam is designed to hit. Pelipper also has the option of using Choice Specs or Choice Scarf, but Pelipper's weakness to Stealth Rock undermines this option. Also, Pelipper has more success abusing his great coverage with his STABs, so he prefers the ability to switch attacks. Pelipper also has access to two boosting moves in Stockpile and Agility. Agility allows Pelipper to act as a decent late-game cleaner, and while Pelipper isn't nearly as effective in that role as other Pokemon, he still does a respectable job at it. Stockpile gives Pelipper a way to boost his excellent Defense and mediocre Special Defense; however, even after one boost, Pelipper's Special Defense isn't good enough to take most reasonably powerful special attacks. Finally, Knock Off is an option to remove opposing Pokemon of their items, but it's typically a wasted moveslot since Pelipper has much better options to use.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Despite Pelipper's excellent type coverage, he is unfortunately hindered by his average Special Attack. This makes it so that most special walls will have no problems taking his attacks and crippling him with a status ailment, or simply just forcing him out, which can cause Pelipper to have to take Stealth Rock damage when he switches in again. In addition to this, bulky Water-types don't really mind any of his attacks, bar the rare Toxic, and will eventually stall him out, even if they don't have Toxic themselves. Lanturn is by far the most effective bulky Water-type, boasting a resistance to both of Pelipper's STAB moves and a STAB Thunderbolt that can dispatch Pelipper with ease. While Pelipper has a great Defense stat, his Special Defense is lackluster, so any Pokemon who can target his lesser defensive stat can threaten him. Rotom is particularly effective due to its ability to block Pelipper's teammates from Rapid Spinning, in addition to posing a huge threat to him with a lethal STAB Thunderbolt. Pelipper's low Speed is also a hinderance, as it makes it extremely easy to revenge kill him. Finally, Stealth Rock is a huge obstacle for Pelipper, as the loss of 25% of his health each time he switches in can make it extremely difficult for him to switch in.</p>
