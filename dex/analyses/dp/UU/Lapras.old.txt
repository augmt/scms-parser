[Overview]

<p>At first glance, Lapras seems inferior to the UU Water-types due to its Ice typing, but it has a couple of useful traits that it can utilize well. Its high HP and Special Defense make it an excellent counter to common UU Water-types such as Milotic and Omastar. Lapras's Stealth Rock weakness may seem disappointing, but this is balanced by the ability to heal itself with Water Absorb, which allows Lapras to switch into any Water-type move and heal a quarter of its health. Due to Lapras's wide movepool, it can be used as a sweeper or as a supporter. This versatility gives the opponent a tough time at predicting what role Lapras plays on its team. These traits also make Lapras a reliable check to common Rain Dance teams thanks to Water Absorb, its 4x resistance to Ice-type moves, access to Thunderbolt, and its mammoth HP stat. All in all, Lapras should not be underestimated.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set focuses on Lapras's excellent defensive stats and the ability to hit many UU threats with its great type coverage. Surf, Ice Beam, and Thunderbolt together hit every Pokemon in the UU tier for neutral damage (barring Lanturn and Shedinja). The final slot brings a support move to the set, allowing Lapras to heal its team or cripple an opponent.</p>

<p>The choice between Surf and Hydro Pump depends on whether you prefer power or accuracy. Hydro Pump is recommended if you wish to play more offensively. For example, with Life Orb equipped, Hydro Pump scores OHKOs on both Nidoqueen and Absol, which Surf cannot do. In the second slot, Ice Beam strikes Pokemon such as Venusaur and Altaria for major damage. To round off the coverage, Thunderbolt hits helpless Water-types such as Milotic and Blastoise for super effective damage. Finally, the last slot depends on what role you wish Lapras to fulfill. Toxic allows it to wear down walls such as Lanturn and Chansey, Perish Song allows Lapras to force switches when it is faced with an unfavorable match up, and Heal Bell allows it to support its teammates by removing crippling status.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>252 HP and 56 Special Defense EVs ensure that Lapras will never be 2HKOed by Hidden Power Grass or Electric from Gorebyss and Omastar, even if they hold a Life Orb. The remaining EVs give Lapras great offensive power and type coverage. If you wish to play more offensively, you may move 52 EVs from HP into Special Attack and have Lapras hold a Life Orb, though this carries the risk of being 2HKOed by the previously mentioned Gorebyss and Omastar.</p>

<p>As with any special sweeper, Lapras has trouble with Chansey. Toxic and Perish Song may work for a limited time, but by then, Chansey will have crippled Lapras with Toxic or Thunder Wave. Powerful physical attackers, such as Hitmonlee and Hitmontop, are excellent choices to deal with Chansey; both Pokemon are able to batter it with super effective STAB Fighting-type moves. Hitmontop is also an effective Rapid Spin user, which is helpful due to Lapras's Ice typing. Dugtrio is another option, as it can trap both Chansey and Clefable with Arena Trap and 2HKO them with Earthquake, though Clefable needs to have taken prior damage to ensure this.</p>

<p>Venusaur causes problems for this set as it can switch in on any move (barring Ice Beam) and threaten Lapras with a super effective Grass-type move or Sleep Powder. RestTalk Arcanine makes an excellent check to Venusaur as it can absorb status, while also hitting Venusaur super effectively with Flare Blitz. Altaria with RestTalk is another option who is capable of switching into all of Venusaur's moves. Sleep Talk allows it to set up Dragon Dance boosts or hit Venusaur with a powerful Outrage.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>On this set, Dragon Dance is used in order to raise Lapras's average Attack and Speed stats into much higher degrees. Lapras makes an excellent Dragon Dance user thanks to its respectable defenses and Water Absorb ability, giving it numerous opportunities to switch in and boost its stats.</p>

<p>A combination of Waterfall and Return provides near-perfect type coverage in UU, with Shedinja being the only Pokemon who is immune to both moves. Zen Headbutt is an option if you need Lapras to hit Weezing and Fighting-types such as Poliwrath or Toxicroak harder. However, if you leave out Return, Slowbro will cause problems. Substitute grants Lapras safety from crippling status moves, but Ice Beam, although being a special attack, will hit Grass-types for more damage than any of Lapras's other physical options.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>224 Speed EVs give Lapras 212 Speed, which allows it to outrun base 95 Pokemon with a positive nature, such as Drapion and Houndoom, after a single Dragon Dance boost. Maximum Attack EVs allow it to deal as much damage as possible. The remaining EVs are placed into HP, giving Lapras more bulk while also allowing Lapras to create Substitutes bigger than 101 HP. This requires Chansey to use Seismic Toss twice before Lapras's Substitute breaks.</p>

<p>Bulky Water-types cause this set problems as Lapras is unable to hit them super effectively. Grass-types, most notably Venusaur, are good teammates as they can hit Water-type Pokemon for super effective damage with their STAB Grass-type attacks or cripple them with status or Leech Seed. Venusaur is an outstanding candidate because of its great bulk and versatile movepool.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set functions as a wallbreaker; with Lapras's above-average offensive stats and great type coverage, it is capable of removing some of UU's most troublesome walls, including Steelix and Chansey. This set also utilizes Dragon Dance, which boosts Lapras's Speed and Attack, and turns it into a powerful sweeper.</p>

<p>Dragon Dance gives Lapras a great boost in power and the Speed to outrun common UU threats such as Drapion and Houndoom. The choice of which physical move to pick depends on your personal preference: use Waterfall for flinch rate and power, or use Return to damage Water-types. With 64 Special Attack EVs and a Life Orb, Hydro Pump gives Lapras a chance to OHKO the most defensive Steelix with Spikes support, while also dealing huge damage to Donphan and Weezing. The final slot depends on whether you wish to hit Grass-types super effectively with Ice Beam, or if you want Lapras to hit Water-types with Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt is recommended if you use Waterfall as your physical option.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs on this set ensure that Lapras is able to OHKO most defensive Steelix with Hydro Pump and Spikes support. 224 Speed EVs allow Lapras to outrun positive nature base 95 Pokemon after a single Dragon Dance, including Leafeon and Houndoom, who are OHKOed by Ice Beam and Hydro Pump, respectively.</p>

</ul>

<p>This set isn't easy to counter after a Dragon Dance or two; however, bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Milotic cause trouble for this set if Lapras lacks Thunderbolt, due to their massive physical defense stats. Venusaur comes in handy here as it can hit them super effectively with Grass-type moves or Sleep Powder. Lanturn is one of Lapras's biggest problems thanks to its mammoth HP stat and ability to switch in on any Water-, Ice-, or Electric-type move. Support from Toxic Spikes can cripple Lanturn as it lacks a reliable recovery move. Drapion is an option as it can prevent Lanturn's Thunder Wave by using Taunt, and can set up Toxic Spikes or phaze the opponent's team with Whirlwind. For a more offensive approach, Venusaur can hit Lanturn with STAB Leaf Storm or Power Whip, while Dugtrio can switch in on Thunderbolt and trap Lanturn with Arena Trap.</p>

<p>If Lapras lacks Ice Beam, Venusaur can switch in on Hydro Pump or Return and threaten Lapras with Sleep Powder or a super effective Grass-type move. RestTalk Arcanine is an excellent check to Venusaur as it can absorb status while also dishing out huge damage with Flare Blitz. Altaria also makes a fine RestTalk user due to its high defensive stats and great typing. Natural Cure also helps Altaria remove its own status upon switching out.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Curse
move 2: Ice Shard / Avalanche
move 3: Waterfall
move 4: Return / Rest
item: Leftovers / Chesto Berry
ability: Water Absorb
nature: Careful
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lapras's huge HP and respectable Special Defense stats make it an ideal Curse user. Curse allows Lapras to boost its Attack and Defense stats at the cost of lowering its Speed, which turns it into a monstrous tank who is difficult to remove without landing a critical hit or leeching its health with Toxic or a burn.</p>

<p>Ice Shard works great with Curse as its priority will negate the drop in Speed. Avalanche is another option, as it doubles in power by moving last, which Lapras will almost always be doing after a Speed drop. Waterfall is a strong STAB attack that will deal huge damage to any Pokemon without a resistance or immunity after a few boosts from Curse. Return provides excellent type coverage alongside Waterfall, while Rest allows Lapras to fully restore its health and remove harmful status. Using a Chesto Berry with Rest is a good option as it wakes Lapras up instantly.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An alternative set of Avalanche, Curse, Rest, and Sleep Talk is viable, as it gives Lapras the ability to recover its health and absorb status effectively. Sleep Talk is helpful to ensure that Lapras isn't wasting the two turns of sleep, and is instead using them as an opportunity to raise its stats further with Curse or attack with a boosted Avalanche.</p>

<p>The EVs on this set give Lapras the highest possible special bulk. Maximum HP also gives Lapras a Leftovers number. 252 Special Defense EVs allow Lapras to withstand powerful specially-based hits, even those that are super effective. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack, giving Lapras a little more offensive power. Critical hits are a problem to this set as they will overcome any boosts from Curse and deal huge damage to Lapras. This is where Shell Armor, which protects Lapras from any critical hits, comes in handy. However, Water Absorb is usually the preferred ability, allowing Lapras to restore 25% of its health and come in freely on Water-type attacks, which can sometimes be a more reliable form of healing than Rest.</p>

<p>As this set is designed to stick around as long as possible, support from Toxic Spikes is recommended, as it allows Lapras to stall opponents, such as Lanturn, who it cannot damage sufficiently. Drapion is an excellent option as it has access to various support moves such as Taunt, Whirlwind, and Knock Off which allow it to cripple the opponent's team and set up for Lapras at the same time. To keep these hazards on the field, a way to block Rapid Spin is necessary; Spiritomb is a great defensive option, while Calm Mind or Nasty Plot Mismagius is the preferred option if you'd like an offensively oriented Pokemon to block Rapid Spin.</p>

<p>Lapras has major problems when faced with a Fighting-type opponent such as Hitmonlee or Hitmontop. Spiritomb is an ideal partner for Lapras as it can switch into a predicted Close Combat and threaten physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. Uxie is another option as it takes little damage from physical attacks and can cripple the opponent with Thunder Wave or Yawn.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Lapras has a great variety of moves not listed on the above sets due to the lack of moveslots. Body Slam can be used on the Dragon Dance set if you wish to abuse the 30% paralysis rate, though Return is probably better due to its higher Base Power. Confuse Ray is a risky option, but deals huge damage to an incoming Choice Band user if it hits itself. Icy Wind is an option for overcoming Lapras's average Speed, though the low Base Power can be a turn off. Rain Dance alongside Thunder and Hydro Pump is an excellent offensive option for Lapras. It can also support other teammates who have abilities that benefit from the rain, Water-type attacks, and Thunder. With Rain Dance, a Damp Rock can be used to prolong the rain, or a Life Orb can be used to deal more damage. Sing is an option on the Special Attacker set, though the low accuracy makes it unreliable. Finally, Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit Quagsire, who is immune to Thunderbolt and Water-type moves due to its Water Absorb ability.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Lanturn is the best all-around counter to Lapras, as it can switch in on Thunderbolt thanks to Volt Absorb and takes little damage from either of Lapras's STAB attacks. It can then proceed to hit Lapras with an STAB Thunderbolt or cripple it with Toxic. Venusaur can also easily switch in on any move barring Ice Beam or Avalanche and threaten Lapras with a super effective Grass-type attack or Sleep Powder. It also benefits from Lapras's huge HP stat, as it will recover more health with Leech Seed. Venusaur's ability to absorb Toxic Spikes is useful as well.</p>

<p>Chansey can counter special attacking sets with ease, though it should beware of any physical or mixed sets due to its lower Defense stat. Natural Cure lets Chansey laugh at Lapras's Toxic all day. It can then cripple Lapras with Toxic or Thunder Wave and attempt to weaken Lapras with Seismic Toss. Clefable makes an excellent counter with Encore, which allows it to foil Lapras if it decides to set up with Dragon Dance or Curse. With its high defensive stats, Clefable can switch in on unboosted attacks with little trouble, while Magic Guard will prevent poison damage.</p>
