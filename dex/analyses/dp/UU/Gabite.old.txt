[Overview]

<p>Gabite is among an elite few NFE Pokemon that are actually viable in the UU tier thanks to its excellent typing and well-distributed stats. Its offensive nature makes it a safe pick for any offensive team. Gabite sports the second highest Attack stat among all Dragon-types in the UU tier, right behind Shelgon. Furthermore, Gabite has an immunity to Electric-type attacks, which is a useful quality to have on offensive teams. Although you might find Gabite's power a bit mediocre at times, it can still pack a punch with the right support.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Boasting high-powered, dual STABs unresisted by anything bar Shedinja, and a unique base Speed that allows Gabite to outpace the omnipresent base 80 speed tier, Gabite can be a potent offensive threat when used correctly. Since most offensive Dragon-types currently reside in either the OU or Uber tiers, Gabite's only competition as an offensive Dragon-type in UU is Altaria. Gabite's resistance to Stealth Rock, higher Attack stat, and STAB Earthquake are what differentiates it from Altaria. Sadly, Gabite does not get Swords Dance or Dragon Dance, so wielding a Choice Band or Life Orb is its best option for increasing damage output. The need to go mixed with Fire Blast is unnecessary since all Steel-type Pokemon in UU are grounded, and thus weak to Earthquake.</p>

<p>Outrage is the primary STAB move for this set since it is nearly unresisted and can pack quite a punch with Spikes support. It is best to remove Steel-types beforehand by using Earthquake, which with a Choice Band deals 45.8% - 54.2% to 252/0 Steelix and 57.7% - 68.1% to 252/0 Registeel. The final two slots of this moveset are filler. Stone Edge deals with Flying-types such as Moltres, while Dragon Claw is a weaker alternative if you're afraid of locking Gabite into Outrage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice of item ultimately comes down to personal preference. Choice Band packs a greater punch than Life Orb, pushing many near-2HKOs into actual 2HKOs with the aid of Stealth Rock damage. However, Life Orb prevents Gabite from being locked into one attack, making it the better item to use against offensive teams. Although Gabite is in a unique speed tier, maximizing Speed ensures that Gabite wins the rare Speed tie with opposing Gabite. You can use an Adamant nature with the same EVs to deal more damage to physical walls, but then Gabite won't be able to outpace positive natured base 80 Speed Pokemon, such as Venusaur and Blaziken, which is pretty crucial.</p>

<p>Gabite shines best when the sturdiest physical walls are removed, as most semi-frail Pokemon are OHKOed by Outrage or Earthquake. Since most physical walls are weak to Grass-type attacks, Venusaur makes an ideal partner for Gabite. The two common walls not weak to Grass-type attacks, Tangrowth and Leafeon, are maimed by Venusaur's Sludge Bomb. Furthermore, Venusaur can incapacitate the opponent with Sleep Powder, allowing Gabite to smack them while they are crippled. Thanks to Gabite's Ground typing, Pokemon such as Registeel and Slowbro will think twice about using Thunder Wave, allowing Venusaur to get in more reliably. Dugtrio also works well as an offensive partner to Gabite because it can trap and kill most Steel-types easily, which in turn lets Gabite use its primary Dragon-type STAB recklessly.</p>

<p>If you plan to combat physical walls with a more brute-force approach, Spikes and Stealth Rock support is needed to 2HKO the sturdiest of opponents. Omastar makes an ideal partner as it can deploy both Spikes and Stealth Rock at the start of the match. Qwilfish is a good alternative for Spikes support, thanks to its high Speed stat and access to Taunt which shuts down opposing entry hazard leads. Outside of Spikes, dual screen support is another option to consider in order to patch up Gabite's pathetic defensive stats. Uxie is an excellent choice because it can set up Stealth Rock in addition to screens.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Gabite has a pretty good special movepool which includes Fire Blast, Earth Power, Dragon Pulse, and Draco Meteor. However, Altaria generally outclasses it as a special attacker, so it's best to focus on utilizing physical attacks. Gabite also has access to Dragon Rush, but the lower power and accuracy makes it inferior to Outrage. Support-wise, Gabite has access to Stealth Rock, but it is generally more useful to utilize its offensive prowess.</p>

<p>A Choice Scarf set can be viable, but due to Gabite having weak defensive stats overall and only a slightly above-average Attack stat, it's not that effective. Unfortunately, Gabite cannot play the same role as its bigger brother and is ultimately better off dishing out damage with a Choice Band or Life Orb. A Substitute set could be used in conjunction with sandstorm to take advantage of Gabite's ability, Sand Veil.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Steelix and Registeel are usually the best switch-ins to Gabite because they resist its strongest attack, Outrage. If Gabite decides to use Earthquake to hit your Steel-type, Flying-type Pokemon and those with levitate can switch-in and fare decently, but beware of Gabite that aren't Choice-locked. Physically defensive Claydol fares excellently against Gabite because it is immune to Earthquake and Spikes, is not 2HKOed by Outrage, and can OHKO Gabite in return with Ice Beam or Explosion. Milotic and Slowbro can 2HKO with Surf while healing with Recover and Slack Off, respectively. Donphan has a chance to OHKO Gabite with Ice Shard, or can simply pound away at it with Earthquake. Tangrowth can 2HKO Gabite with Power Whip, and takes little from most of Gabite's attacks thanks to its immense Defense stat.</p>
