[Overview]

<p>It has bad stats, a poor movepool, and a type combo that gives it many weaknesses to common attacks. A 4x weakness to Stealth Rock makes matters even worse, especially seeing as Rapid Spin would have been one of its greater assets. Throughout the UU metagame, you will find that Delibird is easily countered and any job you want it to do will probably be done better by something else. If you are running the Choice sets, ensure that you have solid Rapid Spin or anti-Stealth Rock support to ensure that Delibird can come in and fire off hits. Sadly, even if Smogon were to endorse a NU tier, Delibird still wouldn't be competitively viable. In short, there is almost always a better choice out there than Delibird.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Delibird has terrible stats, and its Attack is no exception. However, the Santa bird has a little trick in its bag in the form of Hustle. With this ability, the power of its physical attacks are boosted at the cost of their accuracy. By using Aerial Ace, you get to enjoy the Attack boost while still retaining the ability to always hit your opponent. Focus Punch hits the Rocks and Steels that are resistant to Flying attacks. Ice Shard is useful against faster opponents as it makes up for Delibird's average Speed, especially those that try to use Flail, Reversal, or Endeavor sets. Ice Punch provides a stronger STAB than Ice Shard, but Seed Bomb will allow Delibird to hit bulky Water-types such as Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Blastoise.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Sleep Talk is an interesting option that can also be used in the last slot to absorb sleep attacks from foes like Venomoth. If you prefer the power that an Adamant nature provides, you may use that as an option. However, be aware that Delibird will lose the ability to outspeed positive-natured base 70s such as Luxray and Poliwrath and tie with other positive-natured base 75s such as Absol and Kingler.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Ice Beam / Blizzard
move 2: Signal Beam
move 3: Water Pulse
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Electric
item: Choice Specs
ability: Vital Spirit
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe
ivs: 30 SpA 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Its special movepool is even worse than its physical, but Delibird does have higher Special Attack than Attack without Hustle, and Vital Spirit is a very useful ability. Ice-type moves will obviously be your main mode of attacking. Ice Beam is the more consistent choice, but when using Delibird you may find you need the extra power that Blizzard brings to the table. Signal Beam will allow Delibird to hit Grumpig and Hypno harder, who will otherwise wall this set. Water Pulse hits Ninetales and Flareon who can switch in freely on any other move. Hidden Power Grass is effective against Water-types except for Mantine, which will shrug it off easily, so if you are intent on hitting Mantine hard, use Hidden Power Electric.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs given maximize Delibird's Special Attack and Speed stats, as these are really the only stats in which Delibird benefits from investment.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Some Pokemon with bad stats have good movepools, but this isn't the case with Delibird. It can learn Rapid Spin but it happens to be the worst spinner out there since it loses 50% of its health from Stealth Rock simply by switching in. Quick Attack is a priority option over Ice Shard if you want Delibird to hit those annoying Fire-types a little harder. Brick Break requires less prediction than Focus Punch, but it also has only half the power. Toxic is a generic option and can be used on any of the sets to inflict some status. Icy Wind can be used on a predicted switch-in to lower your opponents' Speed and aid in countering it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>As far as UU Pokemon go, Blastoise makes an excellent counter. It doesn't fear any of Delibird's attacks, besides perhaps a Choice Specs Hidden Power Grass, and can KO back with ease. The same premise also holds for Dewgong. Fire-types such as Ninetales and Flareon can switch in on anything barring Water Pulse and set up. Stealth Rock will also ruin Delibird, forcing it to lose a full half of its health upon switching in. In short, Delibird has bad defenses and mediocre attacks. With its poor type coverage, low Speed, and poor defenses, almost anything can switch in on an attack that isn't super effective and KO back with a neutral attack.</p>
