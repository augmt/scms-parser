[Overview]

<p>While there is no shortage of Fire-types in UU, Ninetales has some unique attributes that help it stand out from the crowd. It boasts one of the largest movepools of any Fire-type, including assets like Nasty Plot, Hypnosis, and Energy Ball. This movepool, combined with Ninetales's decent bulk and Special Attack, allows it to overcome the biggest threats to UU Fire-types: bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Milotic. These unique characteristics enable Ninetales to step out of the shadows of its more popular Fire-type brethren and take center stage as a powerful special attacker or status inducer.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Ninetales's flagship set, which allows it to act as an effective lure for bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro while also functioning as a sweeper. With a minor investment in its HP, Ninetales is able to take on and defeat the usual Fire-type counters after a Nasty Plot boost. Fire Blast is Ninetales's best STAB move in terms of sweeping, especially since Ninetales doesn't have maximum Special Attack investment. Energy Ball is Ninetales's most important coverage move, and is the key reason why Ninetales is able to take on Water-types. Hidden Power Rock is for Altaria and opposing Fire-types, like Arcanine and Moltres. Fire-, Grass-, and Rock-type coverage also gets perfect coverage in UU.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>The EV spread allows Ninetales to survive a 0 SpA Milotic's Surf 100% of the time, even after Stealth Rock damage thanks to Leftovers, and hit back with a +2 Energy Ball for a 2HKO. It also allows Ninetales to outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon with a boosting nature. In addition to Nasty Plot, Ninetales can also nab another power boost by switching into Fire-type attacks, thanks to its Flash Fire ability. This will make its Fire Blast very difficult to wall, especially after Nasty Plot.</p>

<p>Ninetales greatly appreciates Stealth Rock support, as it weakens most of its other counters to the point where Ninetales can easily KO them. Ninetales especially likes partners that can weaken Water-types to make sweeping easier and lure Fire-types so it can grab a Flash Fire boost. Grass-types such as Venusaur, Tangrowth, and Leafeon are perfect for this. Toxicroak works as well, since its Dry Skin ability allows it to heal itself by switching into Water-type attacks. It also smites Ninetales' biggest counters: Clefable and Chansey. However, Toxicroak may also lure in Ground-types, so be careful when using it.</p> 

[SET]
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Fire Blast / Flamethrower
move 3: Energy Ball
move 4: Hypnosis / Hidden Power Rock 
item: Life Orb 
nature: Timid
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a single Nasty Plot boost, Ninetales reaches 522 Special Attack, which is just good enough for sweeping mid- to late-game. Switch Ninetales in on a Fire-type attack for a free switch in and begin boosting with Nasty Plot. For which attack to use, Fire Blast is Ninetales's main STAB attack, though Flamethrower is a perfectly fine substitute for more reliability. Energy Ball hits Water-, Ground, and Rock-type Pokemon super effectively. Hypnosis is a valuable (if somewhat unreliable) asset, as it can be used freely as your opponent switches out to a counter, and may grant Ninetales a free turn to boost with Nasty Plot. Hidden Power Rock covers Moltres, Altaria, and other Flash Fire Pokemon, though its coverage is less potent than Hypnosis's crippling effect.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Another option over Hypnosis is Substitute; Ninetales can boost its Special Attack from behind a Substitute without fearing status or damage. Since Ninetales' physical defense is rather low, it is best to use attacks with high accuracy. However, Flamethrower may miss out on OHKOing standard Registeel, since it only deals 87.9% - 103.8%.</p>

<p>Life Orb is used to squeeze out all of Ninetales's sweeping potential, as it appreciates every bit of power it can get. If Hidden Power Rock is used, an EV spread of 36 HP / 252 SpA / 220 Spe is an option as Hidden Power Rock lowers Ninetales' Speed IV; running maximum Speed still won't allow Ninetales to tie with other base 100s. With 220 Speed EVs, Ninetales will always outpace positive natured base 95s. Maximum Special Attack must always be used with this set, since Ninetales is aiming to sweep through the opposing team. The remaining EVs are simply shunted into HP to increase overall bulk and make setup slightly easier.</p>

<p>Ninetales works well as part of a Fire-Water-Grass team core. One helpful teammate includes Venusaur, which can switch into and immediately threaten bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro. These same bulky Water-types function well as teammates, since they can easily sponge attacks aimed at Ninetales and threaten Altaria, which resists both Energy Ball and Fire Blast. Milotic becomes an even better choice should you forgo Hidden Power Rock, since it can check the likes of Altaria, Blaziken, Houndoom, and Moltres effectively. Blastoise is also a great Water-type teammate that is capable of adding not only defensive synergy to your team, but also Rapid Spin support - something Ninetales should have in order to sweep uninhibited. Taking down Clefable and Chansey is nigh impossible for Ninetales, which is why Hariyama is a good teammate. Its STAB Fighting-type attacks and Guts allow it to deftly handle these threats. Moreover, it can deal with Houndoom, which may try to nab a Flash Fire boost on the switch in.</p>

[SET]
name: Double Status
move 1: Hypnosis
move 2: Will-O-Wisp
move 3: Energy Ball / Pain Split
move 4: Fire Blast / Overheat
item: Wide Lens 
nature: Timid
evs: 184 HP / 104 SpD / 220 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Ninetales's support movepool also allows it to pull off a double status set quite effectively. Start off with Hypnosis to sleep a foe then cripple the next switch-in, hopefully a physical attacker, with Will-O-Wisp. Energy Ball and your choice of STAB fill out the rest of the moveset, providing Ninetales with the best coverage it can get should it find an opportunity to pick off a foe. Pain Split can be used over Energy Ball if you feel that being able to heal off damage (albeit, somewhat unreliably) would be helpful.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Wide Lens is almost mandatory when using this set, due to Hypnosis's and Will-O-Wisp's low accuracy. Since this Ninetales isn't looking to stay in and sweep, Overheat is a perfectly viable attack choice. Fire Blast is better if you want Ninetales to function as both a supporter and a sweeper, since it doesn't lower Ninetales's Special Attack, but with no Special Attack investment, this is still unlikely to have much of an impact. The EV spread allows Ninetales to outrun max Speed base 95s such as Drapion while getting as much bulk as possible out of the remainder.</p>

<p>This set's ideal teammates are those that form the Fire-Water-Grass combination, which creates strong team synergy. Specifically, Torterra is able to function well with Double Status Ninetales as it can set up Stealth Rock, which is very useful when using a set that causes as many switches as this one does. It is also suggested that your Water-type has the potential to overcome Morning Sun Arcanine, since it resists or is immune to three of the moves in the moveset. Using a Utility Blastoise with Roar is highly recommended, since it can shuffle your opponent's team and Rapid Spin away entry hazards that ruin Ninetales. Just be sure you don't use Yawn in the third moveslot; it will fail if Ninetales has already put something to sleep.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Specs
move 1: Overheat / Fire Blast
move 2: Energy Ball
move 3: Extrasensory
move 4: Hidden Power Rock 
item: Choice Specs 
nature: Timid
evs: 36 HP / 252 SpA / 220 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>One can avoid the shaky accuracy of Hypnosis and the hassle of setting up Nasty Plot boosts by having Ninetales hold Choice Specs. Overheat is more useful early-game, where Ninetales will be switching more often, while Fire Blast becomes a better choice late-game, where Ninetales will want to be sweeping unimpeded. Energy Ball does the same job here as it does on the other sets, cleaning up bulky Water- and Rock- types. Extrasensory, while not commonly seen, does give Ninetales a way to take down Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Blaziken. Hidden Power Rock helps out with other Fire-types as well as Flying-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread allows Ninetales to outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon, since the 30 Speed IV caused by Hidden Power Rock means outspeeding anything faster is impossible. The leftover EVs are placed in HP, but could also be put back into Speed if opposing Ninetales are of concern. If you decide to use an attack other than Hidden Power Rock, a simple 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe spread could be adopted to reach the next Speed tier.</p>

<p>Being locked into a single move often results in a lot of switching, something no Fire-type enjoys doing with Stealth Rock around. Therefore, it is recommended that you add a Rapid Spinner to your team. Cloyster is able to fill this role and can also set up its own entry hazards to help make sweeping easier. Bulky Hitmontop is a fair choice too, since it can hit enemy Rock-types super effectively or employ a Foresight + Rapid Spin combination that can only be stopped by a double-Ghost team.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Ninetales has few other viable move choices, although some can prove useful. Dark Pulse has more coverage than Extrasensory but its damage output never exceeds that of a STAB Fire Blast or Overheat. Grudge can be useful against walls and sweepers to drain the PP of one of their attacks. Calm Mind is also available, but Nasty Plot's +2 Special Attack boost is much more useful on a frail sweeper.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Chansey is by far the best counter to Ninetales; her massive Special Defense and HP stats make brute force from offensive sets useless, while her ability, Natural Cure, erases any status effects Ninetales would have hoped to inflict. In a similar vein, Altaria has no problem sponging special attacks from Ninetales, and boasts Natural Cure as well. Unlike Chansey, it can also KO Ninetales much faster with a super effective Earthquake. However, one must be wary of switching in Altaria after Ninetales gets a Nasty Plot boost; +2 Hidden Power Rock will 2HKO Altaria after Stealth Rock damage. Clefable can survive a +2 Life Orb Fire Blast from Ninetales and cripple it with paralysis, but must beware of Hypnosis and will have trouble damaging Ninetales significantly. Thick Fat Hariyama will also be able to overpower Ninetales.</p>

<p>Flash Fire Pokemon like Arcanine and Houndoom are also decent answers to Ninetales, especially the Choice Specs set once it has locked itself into a Fire- or Grass-type attack. Blaziken, too, is able to switch in with relative ease and immediately threaten Ninetales with Stone Edge or Superpower. Substitute + Roost Moltres can also handle Ninetales thanks to its ability to outstall the fox. However, Arcanine, Houndoom, and Moltres must be wary of Hidden Power Rock, while Blaziken must beware of Extrasensory. Bulky Water-types are generally good counters as they resist Fire, but they must watch out for a +2 Energy Ball. Milotic can absorb status very well (even better if it is a RestTalk variant), as can the lesser-seen Mantine, which deserves a special mention as it is one of the few UU Water-types that is neutral to Energy Ball while still resisting Fire Blast. Lanturn can also deal with an unboosted Ninetales extremely well, since it can 2HKO any variant after Stealth Rock and eliminate any status problems it might cause with Heal Bell.</p>
