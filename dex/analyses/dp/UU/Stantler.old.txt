[Overview]

<p>Though seemingly outclassed by both Kangaskhan and Tauros, who are bulkier and have greater attacking prowess, Stantler does have a much wider movepool that keeps his opponents guessing. Complemented with his good Attack, this turns Stantler into a potent offensive force; this also makes Stantler a good user of the ParaFusion technique, while Intimidate helps soften physical blows. His diverse movepool doesn't stop there; Stantler has a variety of good support options such as Gravity, Thunder Wave, and Trick Room, along with the defenses to use them.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes advantage of Stantler's good Attack stat, turning him into a potent sweeper. His diverse movepool makes it difficult for most of his counters to switch in safely, while Intimidate gives him an easier time switching into physical attackers. Return is used for reliable STAB, Earthquake destroys Rock- and Steel-types, and Sucker Punch will overcome faster opponents such as Mismagius and Scyther. Megahorn deals immense damage to Grass-types such as Leafeon and Tangrowth, though Bite can be used to hit Ghost-types reliably. The item choice is down to personal preference. A Choice Band can be used over Life Orb in exchange for more power, though it locks Stantler into a single attack. Sucker Punch isn't advised when Stantler is holding a Choice Band as an opponent can use this opportunity to set up.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Stantler should watch out for opposing Fighting-types, since they make light work of him. Weezing can switch into almost any Fighting-type and cripple them with Will-O-Wisp; unfortunately, Weezing is also a good counter to Stantler due to its high Defense and immunity to Earthquake. Venusaur is another partner who can handle Fighting-types, being able to cripple the opponent with Sleep Powder and then use its powerful STAB to weaken them. Mismagius is another good switch-in to Fighting-types, and she also has a helpful immunity to Ground-type moves and access to Will-O-Wisp; again, Mismagius is also a good counter to Stantler as she can switch into Return and Earthquake, while using Will-O-Wisp to cut his Attack.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Thunder Wave
move 2: Confuse Ray

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Stantler is an effective user of the parafusion strategy; thanks to Intimidate and his good Attack stat, Stantler can cause some real problems for the opponent. Headbutt can make things even worse for the opponent, having a small chance at causing them to flinch; although this doesn't seem like much, when combined with paralysis and confusion, this can severely reduce the opponent's chance of attacking. Alternatively, Stantler may use Return for more power. Earthquake deals with Rock- and Steel-types, while Bite can be used to hit opposing Ghost-types. Body Slam is another option for this set, giving Stantler another way to paralyze the opponent. However, this should only be used alongside Bite, as Ghost-types completely wall him.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As this Stantler can severely cripple the opponent's team, your teammates can gain more opportunities to set up and sweep. Alakazam and Mismagius can take advantage of the holes created by Stantler by setting up Calm Mind or Nasty Plot, respectively. Mismagius and Rotom can be troublesome for this set if they switch into a predicted Return or Earthquake, making a Dark-type such as Drapion or Absol a good partner. Both of them have access to Pursuit, while Drapion can set up Toxic Spikes and Absol can set up Swords Dance. Donphan is immune to Thunder Wave and his huge Defense means he'll take little damage from Earthquake or Headbutt. Furthermore, his STAB Earthquake cleanly KOes Stantler. To get past Donphan, a bulky Water-type such as Milotic is helpful as she can hit Donphan hard with a STAB Surf. Poliwrath is another good option due to his good Attack and Defense stats, access to Bulk Up, and ability to switch into most of Donphan's attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: Gravity
move 1: Gravity
move 2: Hypnosis
move 3: Earthquake
move 4: Return
item: Life Orb
ability: Intimidate
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Stantler is a good user of Gravity; Earthquake has perfect coverage alongside Return, hitting Flying-types and Levitators such as Moltres and Rotom. Return is used for reliable STAB, and Hypnosis becomes more accurate with Gravity in effect. Finally, Intimidate gives Stantler a much easier time switching into physical attackers.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Donphan has a high Defense stat and threatens a lot of Pokemon with his STAB Earthquake, which becomes even more dangerous in Gravity as it can hit your own Flying-types and Levitators. Torterra is a good teammate as he can switch into Donphan with ease and threaten him with Wood Hammer, while Gravity makes his STAB Earthquake unavoidable.</p>

<p>Mismagius can be a problem under Gravity, as she can switch into Return and her Will-O-Wisp becomes 100% accurate. A Flash Fire Houndoom is a good teammate option as it can switch into Will-O-Wisp and gain a boost, and Water Veil Wailord can switch into it as well. Chansey can take on Mismagius if she doesn't carry Taunt, and Dark-types like Drapion can threaten Mismagius with Night Slash and Pursuit.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Stantler has a pretty good movepool with a large amount of moves not mentioned. Other physical options include Bounce, Double-Edge, and Zen Headbutt; Bounce can damage a Fighting-type switching in, Double-Edge deals more damage than Return or Headbutt at the cost of recoil, and Zen Headbutt nails Poison-types such as Weezing and Fighting-types such as Toxicroak. On the special side, Stantler has access to Calm Mind, Charge Beam, Energy Ball, Hidden Power, Psychic, Shadow Ball, Signal Beam, and Thunderbolt; it's just too bad Stantler doesn't have any STAB Normal-type moves and is completely outclassed by almost every other Calm Mind user under the sun. Me First can be a nasty surprise for the opponent, especially if they use an attack that they themselves are weak to. Magic Coat and Roar are two more support moves that Stantler can use, though there is little room on any of his sets to fit them in. A set composed completely of status moves may be used; with access to Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Hypnosis, Stantler becomes a surprisingly good status platform who can cause a lot of switches. Stantler may also use Trick Room to some level of success, though he is usually too weak offensively and isn't slow enough to properly use it himself (Rhyperior without Speed investment will outspeed Stantler under Trick Room, even if Stantler has 0 Speed IVs).</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Most Fighting-types can take on Stantler, especially Guts Hariyama and Limber Hitmonlee as neither mind paralysis. Even after Intimidate, Fighting-types can easily take out Stantler with their STAB attacks. Hitmontop is a good example as it weakens Stantler further with Intimidate of his own. Ghost-types are also decent counters, Mismagius being one of the best as she is immune to Earthquake (provided Gravity isn't in effect) and Return, has the ability to set up on Sucker Punch, and create a Substitute to block status moves. Claydol is a pretty good counter as he can switch into Earthquake and his good Defense means he'll take little damage from any of Stantler's attacks (bar Megahorn). Most bulky Water-types can take on Stantler with their good defenses, reliable recovery, and powerful STAB; Milotic, Slowbro, and Cloyster are all decent examples. Rhyperior is immune to Thunder Wave, takes little damage from any of Stantler's attacks, has Solid Rock to weaken Earthquake, and can set up with Rock Polish to sweep your team. Almost any physically defensive Pokemon who doesn't mind paralysis can be called a counter, especially Ground-types.</p>
