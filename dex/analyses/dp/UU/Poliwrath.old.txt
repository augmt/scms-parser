[Overview]

<p>Poliwrath has a very unique and valuable typing, resisting Dark-, Rock-, Ice-, and Fire-type attacks, which are all very common types in the UU metagame, not to mention that it's capable of absorbing Water-type attacks for 25% HP recovery. Poliwrath has no big flaws stat-wise, but this balance is also what kills it as a potential standard. Usually, Pokemon need to hit hard or take hits really well to be very successful, but in this case, Poliwrath is more of a middleman. If you put its EVs where its purposes lie, it will certainly pull its weight for you in a standard team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Poliwrath is one of the bulkiest Fighting-types available and also has the benefit of having a secondary STAB in Water to work with. Basically, the strategy of this set is to send Poliwrath into something that it can force out, such as Registeel or Regirock, and set up a Substitute. Your next move would depend on your opponent's switch-in.</p>

<p>This set has many viable options to go in the last two slots. The choice between Waterfall and Ice Punch is indeed a tough selection; Waterfall grants decent coverage and STAB, while Ice Punch provides much better super effective type coverage against Pokemon like Altaria and Venusaur. However, both can be used if you are not a fan of Encore, Bulk Up, or Hypnosis. Encore is an excellent move for Poliwrath to use, as it gives it an opportunity to Encore a move like Iron Head from Registeel or Wish from Chansey, allowing Poliwrath to score a free Substitute. Bulk Up allows Poliwrath to set up on weaker physical attackers, such as Regirock and Steelix. It also helps Poliwrath make unbreakable Substitutes on the physical side and OHKO a good portion of the metagame with its powerful STAB Focus Punch. Hypnosis, although not mentioned, is great to hit Pokemon like Slowbro or Venusaur who resist both of Poliwrath's STAB moves. It's a great way to temporarily take Poliwrath's counters out of the game, although the 60% accuracy may be risky. If these three options seem unappealing, Ice Punch can take their place.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With Pokemon such as Slowbro, Uxie, and other bulky Psychic-types taking very little damage from Poliwrath's STAB attacks and dealing decent damage back to Poliwrath with their STAB Psychics, Poliwrath is going to need help from certain Pokemon to work more effectively. Absol and Drapion are great partners for Poliwrath, both being immune to Psychic and having Pursuit, Crunch, or Night Slash to deal with these Pokemon. Registeel works especially well because it takes minimal damage from Electric-type attacks, and resists Grass-, Flying-, and Psychic-type attacks aimed at Poliwrath, while also setting up Stealth Rock.</p>

[SET]
name: Bulk Up
move 1: Bulk Up
move 2: Waterfall

evs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Poliwrath can be a very dangerous bulky sweeper, setting up on many Pokemon while also being able to render many Pokemon helpless with Hypnosis. With a couple of Bulk Ups under its belt, Poliwrath becomes a formidable physical tank, being able to take hits and dish out hard ones as well.</p>

<p>The choice between STAB and coverage is always a tough choice for Poliwrath. Ice Punch hits Pokemon such as Venusaur and Altaria hard, as they resist both of Poliwrath's STAB moves, but Brick Break hits any Pokemon who isn't weak to Ice Punch harder. Return is a solid choice as well, as it grants perfect coverage with Waterfall; however, Brick Break and Ice Punch hit many more targets for super effective damage. The last slot is best used as a utility move for Poliwrath, taking advantage of placing a counter to sleep, stopping a potential set-up, or blocking status and critical hits. Hypnosis lets Poliwrath immobilize one of its common switch-ins, such as Slowbro or Uxie, keeping it away from the battle for a decent amount of turns. You can then bring in a counter without taking damage in the process. With Encore, Pokemon like Curse Registeel, Quagsire, or Gastrodon are no longer threats, because Poliwrath can Encore them as they use Curse, forcing them to switch out as Poliwrath uses Bulk Up. Substitute blocks dangerous status, such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, and Bulk Up can help make physically unbreakable Substitutes.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Poliwrath is unable to sweep with its counters in the way, similar to the SubPunch set. Slowbro and friends come back again, taking little damage from any attack and fighting back with their STAB Psychics. So as they return to the fray, so do Absol and Drapion, who are able to drill these Pokemon with strong Dark-type attacks or trap them with Pursuit. Blaziken and Magmortar also work well with Poliwrath because they can lure and take out Pokemon such as Slowbro with their strong super effective special attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Waterfall
move 4: Brick Break / Rock Slide / Ice Punch
item: Leftovers / Life Orb
ability: Water Absorb
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Outside of Water Absorb, Poliwrath has no way of restoring a reasonable amount of health by itself, but with the RestTalk set, Poliwrath now has a decently reliable way of gaining its health back. Sporting decent defensive stats, Poliwrath can be a viable user of the RestTalk combo, allowing it to become a tough tank and a great status absorber. Although, as with every RestTalk set, there will always be downsides. In this case, Poliwrath loses its rather decent Attack stat, becoming very weak on the attacking side and therefore turning into perfect set-up bait for Pokemon such as Feraligatr and Mismagius.</p>

<p>The moveset is pretty standard for Poliwrath, since using both of its STAB attacks, Waterfall and Brick Break, provides near perfect coverage, only resisted by Altaria, Slowbro, Venusaur, and Toxicroak in UU (you can use Ice Punch as an alternative option for dealing neutral or super effective damage against some these Pokemon if they cause trouble). Body Slam is another interesting option that may paralyze the opposing Pokemon. As stated before, Poliwrath's poor Attack stat with the given EVs can be solved by equipping a Life Orb, enabling it to deal slightly more damage than usual. If you want to keep Poliwrath as a bulky tank, Leftovers is the superior option as it allows for more survivability.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>It would be a very good idea to eliminate the opponent's stat boosting Pokemon, since they can easily switch in on Poliwrath with little to no fear and proceed to set up something nasty. Common examples of these Pokemon are Dragon Dance Feraligatr, Nasty Plot Mismagius, and Swords Dance Drapion. Spiritomb and Weezing are decent answers to stat boosters, being able to switch in on them and threaten them with Will-O-Wisp. It should also be mentioned that physically defensive Pokemon, such as Weezing and Milotic, can easily rub off anything Poliwrath fires out at them, leaving Poliwrath vulnerable to a stall match. Spiritomb and Weezing are decent answers to stat boosters, being able to switch in on them and threaten them with Will-O-Wisp. Venusaur can pose an immediate threat to Milotic, being able to OHKO it with Leaf Storm or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder. Venusaur and Poliwrath also make a great combo, as Venusaur can switch into Electric attacks fired at Poliwrath, while Poliwrath can sponge Fire- and Ice-type attacks thrown at Venusaur.</p>

[SET]
name: Belly Drum
move 1: Belly Drum
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Waterfall
move 4: Return
item: Salac Berry
ability: Water Absorb
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Poliwrath can become an extremely threatening Belly Drum sweeper when played properly, capable of sweeping entire teams who aren't ready for this threat. This set takes Poliwrath to a whole new level as a sweeper, since most of its other sets rely on improving its defensive capabilities and tanking. After pulling off a Substitute and a Belly Drum, Poliwrath's Attack and Speed stats skyrocket to an incredible Attack stat of 1076 and a great Speed stat of 393, the latter thanks to Salac Berry. Poliwrath now outspeeds everything without a Choice Scarf in the UU metagame aside from the occasional Electrode.</p>

<p>Waterfall and Return are recommended since that combo hits everything for neutral or super effective damage. Waterfall will obviously be the main attack of choice since it receives a valuable STAB boost and has a chance to flinch, which could help Poliwrath greatly in some cases. Return is the best alternative so Poliwrath can deal heavy damage to Pokemon who resist Water-type moves, mainly Slowbro and Milotic.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The procedure is quite simple, yet difficult to pull off. Switch Poliwrath in on a bulky Pokemon who isn't able to deal enough damage to break its Substitute, such as Registeel, or if you're lucky enough, a Choiced Water-type move thanks to Water Absorb. Substitute as they switch, and proceed to use either Belly Drum or attack right away depending on who they switch in. If the switch-in is not that threatening, such as a Pokemon who doesn't have priority moves, set up a Belly Drum and attempt to sweep. If the switch-in does have priority moves or is faster than Poliwrath, it's a good idea to attack right away instead of wasting a potential Belly Drum sweep.</p>

<p>Before you start any Belly Drum sweep with Poliwrath, you must make sure that there are no priority attackers that can put an end to its sweep, since Poliwrath fails to receive a reasonable priority move. Sucker Punch Absol, Vacuum Wave Blaziken, and Mach Punch Hitmontop are prime examples of Pokemon who use priority moves. Jolly Drapion threatens Absol due to its resistance to Sucker Punch and ability to knock out Absol with X-Scissor; Slowbro can switch into Blaziken's STAB moves and threaten it with Surf; and, Weezing can switch into Hitmontop and burn it with Will-O-Wisp, draining its effectiveness. Entry hazards can make it much harder to score the Belly Drum boost since Poliwrath will keep getting hit by them as it switches out from a Pokemon who stops it from Belly Drumming, meaning that sooner or later, Poliwrath won't have enough health to set up. Toxic Spikes in particular will ruin Poliwrath since it will only have at most one chance to attack if it ends up receiving a Belly Drum boost behind a Substitute, which is not very useful. Drapion comes to mind again, as it is great at absorbing and setting up its own Toxic Spikes thanks to its overall bulk, while Claydol is capable of Rapid Spinning away any entry hazards and can than proceed to set up Stealth Rock. Poliwrath can be easily revenge-killed by Choice Scarfers with a base Speed stat of 71 or above with a positive nature and max Speed, like Mesprit, Rotom, and Venusaur.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>CroCune has been considered a threatening force in the OU metagame, but now, Poliwrath brings Suicune into the UU metagame by using an identical set. This set allows Poliwrath to become a sturdy tank, a fantastic status absorber, and a threatening sweeper at the same time, being able to destroy most teams that aren't prepared for such a threat.</p>

<p>The main attacking choice for this set would be Waterfall, as it receives a helpful STAB boost and hits a lot of types for neutral or super effective damage, while only being resistant to Dragon-, Water-, and Grass-types. The EV spread is pretty simple; maximizing Poliwrath's HP and Special Defense helps it tank on the special side since it is boosting its Defense and not Special Defense.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With its great overall bulk, Poliwrath has many chances to switch in and start setting up Bulk Up to attempt a sweep. It's best to switch it in on weaker Pokemon or Pokemon who can't harm it greatly, such as Registeel, Blaziken, and Weezing. Once Poliwrath receives a couple of Bulk Up boosts, it's ready to wreak havoc and eliminate Pokemon who can't take powerful Waterfalls and can't deal much damage towards it. However, Poliwrath will have difficulties with Pokemon who absorb Water-type moves, including Toxicroak, Lapras, Parasect, and Quagsire.</p>

<p>Although maximizing Poliwrath's HP and Special Defense helps, Poliwrath will still take a lot of damage from high powered super effective special attacks, as well as high powered super effective physical attacks if it hasn't received a few Bulk Ups under its belt. Leaf Storm from a Timid Venusaur running max Special Attack with a neutral nature will deal 77% - 91%, which is devastating. Registeel is an excellent answer in threatening these Pokemon, since it boasts excellent Special Defense, resists Grass-, Flying-, and Psychic-type moves aimed at Poliwrath, and can cripple Pokemon with Thunder Wave. Providing dual screen support for Poliwrath is recommended to help Poliwrath set up. Clefable and Gardevoir are excellent dual screeners thanks to their decent bulk and massive support movepools.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Payback can be used to hit bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Uxie and Mismagius, who can cause trouble for Poliwrath in some cases. Body Slam isn't a bad option as it has a chance to cause paralysis which can help Poliwrath in terms of outspeeding crippled enemies, not to mention that it works well in conjunction with Waterfall because of the flinch rate. Counter can potentially gain a surprise KO on a physical attacker that doesn't see it coming, while Endeavor is a decent option to surprise your opponent once Poliwrath is at low health.</p>

<p>You may choose to use a Speed IV of 30 in order to move after opposing Poliwrath. That way, you are able to set up a Substitute and fire off Focus Punch safely. However, this is not necessary due to the fact that the only effective move Poliwrath can use against you is Brick Break, which isn't the primary option on most of Poliwrath's sets.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Poliwrath can generally be walled by any bulky Pokemon who resists or takes neutral damage from its attacks. Bulky Psychic-types are Poliwrath's biggest counters, as they have great physical bulk, resistances to Fighting-type attacks, and access to super effective STAB Psychics that will easily end Poliwrath. Slowbro is Poliwrath's number one counter, boasting a resistance to both of Poliwrath's STAB attacks and takes pathetic damage from its other moves. Uxie is a great counter, shrugging off almost anything Poliwrath throws at it, and striking back for heavy damage with Psychic or Thunderbolt.</p>

<p>Venusaur, Leafeon, and Tangrowth are Pokemon who can cause Poliwrath a ton of grief. The former resists both of Poliwrath's STAB moves, has access to Sleep Powder, and can destroy Poliwrath with Leaf Storm, while the latter two pack excellent physical bulk and a hard-hitting Leaf Blade and Power Whip, respectively. Jumpluff, although nowhere near as bulky as the aforementioned Grass-types, can switch into either of Poliwrath's STAB or set up moves, such as Waterfall or Substitute, and can Encore it to force Poliwrath to switch out.</p>

<p>Dusclops and Spiritomb can both burn Poliwrath with Will-O-Wisp, draining its effectiveness instantly, unless Poliwrath uses Rest. Weezing pulls off the same role as Dusclops and Spiritomb, except it can also hit Poliwrath with a super effective Thunderbolt. Milotic's great physical bulk and access to Recover and a super effective Hidden Power to Poliwrath can end it reasonably fast as well; it also has access to Haze to get rid of Poliwrath's Bulk Ups.</p>
