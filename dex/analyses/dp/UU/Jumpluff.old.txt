[Overview]

<p>Jumpluff is by no means a bad Pokemon because it lacks the stats to attack. Instead, Jumpluff plays the role of supporting its teammates. Jumpluff can take advantage of Sleep Powder, base 110 Speed, and a plethora of support moves like Encore and Memento in UU, OU, and even in Ubers if you know how to take control of the field. Just don't expect Jumpluff to take too much torture, and you should be able to annoy all day.</p>

[SET]
name: SubSeed
move 1: Leech Seed
move 2: Substitute
move 3: Sleep Powder
move 4: Encore
item: Leftovers

nature: Timid
evs: 188 Def / 68 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is simple to use: Sleep Powder on the first turn, Substitute the second, and Leech Seed the third. Repeat steps two and three when needed. If you have entry hazard support, the indirect damage received from switching out from Leech Seed can add up very quickly. Encore simply adds to the madness, and thanks to the Substitute, you can switch around appropriately without worries.</p>

<p>Aerial Ace or Hidden Power Flying can be used over Encore should you want to be able to hurt Grass-types, while U-turn is another alternative for some scouting and escaping from troublesome Pokemon. Timid and 252 Speed EVs are used so Jumpluff can outrun Mismagius and Speed tie with Froslass. The rest are put into Defense and Special Defense to take weak, resisted attacks better. Don't put EVs in HP; this inhibits its SubSeeding ability as you want Leech Seed to restore a greater percentage of Jumpluff's health.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Chlorophyll is the preferred ability as with Sunny Day support, the opponent won't have much of a chance at outspeeding and beating Jumpluff when it is at 700 Speed. This set has potential in Ubers when paired with Groudon. Drought activates Chlorophyll and lets Jumpluff outspeed everything but Choice Scarf Deoxys-S with a positive nature.</p>

<p>Breaking through the combination of Sleep Powder and SubSeeding is annoying, but Grass-types can usually do very well. You can scare them off with the STAB moves of powerful Fire- or Flying-type Pokemon such as Moltres or Arcanine. Swellow can deal with the Grass-types with a powerful STAB Brave Bird, but its fragility makes it hard to switch in. Swellow and other Pokemon who can avoid Sleep Powder's effects, such as Primeape, are also threats to Jumpluff. Rotom can therefore make a nice partner to deal with Primeape and Swellow thanks to its solid typing and its possession of Will-O-Wisp to cripple Primeape, as well as STAB Thunderbolt to scare off Swellow.</p>

<p>Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Toxic Spikes support are very useful for this set. Substitute + Leech Seed makes your opponent want to switch, but the entry hazards will make them think twice. Cloyster, Omastar, and Qwilfish can set up the two types of Spikes and also take many of the moves commonly aimed at Jumpluff. Qwilfish also has access to Poison Jab to scare off most Grass-types. In the sun, they aren't such great options, though. Nidoqueen and Drapion are great partners for setting up Toxic Spikes. Nidoqueen's Rock-type resistance will be useful, and they can both take Poison-type moves aimed at Jumpluff. Stealth Rock support is a must for punishing your opponent's switches. Claydol and Donphan are great Pokemon to set up Stealth Rock as they have useful Rock-type resistances and can also use Rapid Spin to get rid of your opponent's Stealth Rock; taking 25% each switch in would badly hinder Jumpluff. Other options for setting up Stealth Rock include Steelix, Kabutops, and Omastar, all of whom possess resistances to various attacks super effective against Jumpluff.</p>

<p>Sunny Day support isn't required but is very useful. At 700 Speed, barring priority, your opponent will find it very hard to outspeed you, and so SubSeeding will be more effective and annoying. Donphan, Hariyama, and Moltres and Arcanine are possible defensive choices; each resists one or more of Jumpluff's weaknesses. Ambipom can make a nice lead to set up Sunny Day at the beginning of the match.</p>

[SET]
name: Double Status
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Stun Spore
move 3: Encore
move 4: U-turn
item: Leftovers
ability: Chlorophyll
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Due to Sleep Clause, you can only put one Pokemon to sleep with Sleep Powder. However, Jumpluff also has access to Stun Spore, meaning it can still annoy your opponent by not only putting one of their Pokemon to sleep, but also paralyzing a few.</p>

<p>Sleep Powder first, and then hopefully status with Stun Spore to hopefully hurt another Pokemon. Encore is an amazing move that can be used to buy free switch-ins. With good prediction, Jumpluff can switch into an Earthquake and Encore it, allowing it a free turn to abuse Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. U-turn is for getting the hell out of there when you're all done. It also helps ease prediction and shift the momentum of the game in your favor.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Leftovers is the preferred item for the free recovery it provides, but if you want to use this as a lead, then Focus Sash is a good alternative to guarantee surviving an attack from most (non-Fake Out) leads. Therefore, Protect may be a good option on this set when using Focus Sash, but generally it's better to stick to Encore and U-turn in the other slots. EVs are aimed at maximizing its HP and Speed so it can move first and will never have to take a hit. Chlorophyll is the preferred ability to further boost Jumpluff's Speed in the sun.</p>

<p>Countering this set entails switching in Pokemon who don't mind either status. Altaria has Natural Cure to shrug off status and has many moves to hit Jumpluff hard with. Steelix can do well against Altaria who lack Flamethrower as its high Defense lets it take even Earthquake easily. Bulky Water-types can also do well against Altaria. RestTalk Pokemon such as Milotic can shrug off status and attack while asleep. In this case, Ice Beam will make short work of Jumpluff. Powerful Grass-types and Electric-types can also do well against Milotic. Feraligatr and SubPunch Azumarill can make great partners to Jumpluff as they can set up on Milotic who lack Hidden Power Grass, and Haze in the case of Feraligatr.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Blastoise, Claydol, Donphan, or Hitmontop is very useful for this set. Taking 25% from Stealth Rock every time it switches in will badly hinder Jumpluff. Claydol, Donphan, and Hitmontop can also take Jumpluff's Rock-type weakness, while Blastoise can take the Fire- and Ice-type moves aimed at Jumpluff. Sunny Day support can also be beneficial because of the Speed boost, making it almost impossible for your opponent to outspeed Jumpluff.</p>

[SET]
name: Support
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Memento
move 3: Encore
move 4: Reflect
item: Leftovers
ability: Chlorophyll
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Jumpluff has a myriad of unique support options that can help the team, and this set puts all of them to good use. Its purpose is to provide a powerful attacker the chance to set up, hopefully opening the game for a sweep.</p>

<p>Jumpluff's high Speed allows it plenty of chances to use Sleep Powder. With the opposing Pokemon asleep, Jumpluff can freely use Reflect to provide itself and its teammates more protection from physical attacks and then proceed to use Memento, a self-KO move that harshly lowers the opponent's Attack and Special Attack. At that point, a powerful set-up sweeper, such as Belly Drum Charizard, can enter the battle and use its stat-boosting move with little risk. This would also be a great opportunity for a Baton Passer to set up.</p>

<p>Encore is definitely the preferred third move to punish those that think Jumpluff is a setup fodder. Reflect does not have to be used in order for Jumpluff to be successful. It is somewhat of a filler move, but given the fact that UU is a tier crowded with physical attackers, it can prove to be very useful. If this set is used in OU or Ubers, Reflect can be dropped in favor of another move, such as Leech Seed or Toxic. Don't even bother with an attacking move like Grass Knot or Aerial Ace, as the damage output will be always be pitiful.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Leftovers as the item works fine, but there are other choices too. Lum Berry, Light Clay, and Focus Sash are the most obvious examples, the latter only being of use if one decides to lead with this set because of the 25% damage that Stealth Rock will deal to Jumpluff upon switching in.</p>

<p>The best partners to this set are Pokemon who can take advantage of Memento and possibly Reflect, and set up. Belly Drum Charizard, Substitute + Dragon Dance or Substitute + Swords Dance Feraligatr, and Rock Polish Torterra are good choices; each has natural bulk or Substitute to take advantage Jumpluff's support. Swords Dance Absol, Scyther, and Toxicroak are other good teammates.</p>

<p>There aren't many counters to this set as it doesn't aim to stay around for long. Ambipom and Electrode are some of the best, though, as they are faster, barring Sunny Day, and can stop Jumpluff with Taunt. Most Steel-types are good partners to deal with Ambipom, while if it lacks Payback, Ghost-types can deal with it. Therefore, Steelix and Registeel make great partners to deal with the aforementioned Pokemon thanks to their high defenses, resistances to many of their common moves, and ability to hit back with Iron Head / Earthquake. A Rapid Spinner such as Donphan can be useful to spin away Stealth Rock, which badly hurts Jumpluff. However, since this set doesn't aim to survive long, this isn't a requirement.</p>

[SET]
name: Sunny Day
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Sunny Day
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Encore / Memento
item: Heat Rock
ability: Chlorophyll
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This combo is actually nice in UU and decent to use in OU. Use Sleep Powder first and then proceed to use Sunny Day to boost your Speed to 700. You can then easily U-turn away for your other teammates to tear through your opponent with Fire-type moves or their own Chlorophyll abilities.</p>

<p>The main reason for Encore is because once Sleep Clause is activated and you need Jumpluff to make the sunlight return, you have to rely on using Encore to cripple your opponent and give yourself a free turn to set up the sun during the switch. This allows you to U-turn safely from harm right after you set up the sun; however, your switch-in is at risk with the second strategy. Memento can go somewhere should you like the ability to help Swords Dance Tangrowth or Victreebel set up; with +2 Attack and doubled Speed, they will be a major pain to your opponent. This will work better in UU though as there are less Choice Scarf users to revenge them.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Heat Rock is the recommended item choice as it gives your team eight turns of sun to abuse. Max HP and Speed is simple as this set needs to be as fast as possible due to Jumpluff's fragility, while the HP EVs help it take weak resisted attacks. The rest are left in Attack to power up U-turn a bit. Chlorophyll is better than Leaf Guard in every way. The opponent won't waste time statusing Jumpluff; they will just try and OHKO it. You therefore want to be as fast as possible.</p>

<p>This should only be used on a Sunny Day team. Powerful Chlorophyll sweepers such as Exeggutor, Shiftry, Tangrowth, and Victreebel are very threatening with a Speed boost from the sun. They can also use a boosted Hidden Power Fire to deal with some of the Steel-types who usually wall them. Houndoom, Magmortar, Moltres, and Typhlosion can make great use of the boosted Fire-type moves, and if you keep Stealth Rock off the field, your opponent won't like taking boosted STAB Eruptions from Typhlosion. It can even 2HKO Chansey with a Choice Specs Eruption under the sun when at full health; this actually 2HKOs Blissey as well should you use this in OU. In OU, Heatran and Infernape are both good options for partners as they love the boost to their STAB Fire-type moves. With Flash Fire, Sunny Day and Choice Specs, Heatran can even 2HKO Blissey with Fire Blast.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin support is very useful to help Jumpluff stay alive longer to support the team. Donphan is perhaps the best option as it can also set up Sunny Day and Stealth Rock while taking Rock-type moves aimed at Jumpluff. Torkoal can do the same, except it has a weakness to Rock-type moves; however, it does also have useful Fire- and Ice-type resistances. Donphan is generally the superior choice of those two as there are better Pokemon than Torkoal for taking advantage of the Fire-type power boost. Altaria, Arcanine, Camerupt, Cresselia, and Hitmontop can make good partners in UU as they can all set up Sunny Day, but also take moves aimed at Jumpluff, and in the case of Arcanine and Camerupt, take advantage of the Fire-type power boost. In OU, Bronzong and Celebi are solid partners as they can both set up Sunny Day reliably.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Worry Seed easily destroys Sleep Talkers like Articuno and also makes Clefable shuffle in fear. Aromatherapy can be thrown onto a set but isn't highly recommended on a Pokemon who can barely take many hits at all. It does have Swords Dance as well but lacks a physical movepool and an Attack stat as well. Bounce works well in conjunction with SubSeed as it helps protect your Substitute for a turn but also leaves you vulnerable once you crash down; however, you have that nice chance of paralysis on your side. Reflect tones down physical hits, but don't expect Jumpluff to be surviving long even with the screen up. Jumpluff can use Toxic to poison opponents; this would be particularly annoying on the SubSeed set, but this conflicts with Sleep Powder, and generally Stun Spore is better for the Double Powder set. Aerial Ace and Hidden Power Flying are other options, mainly for the SubSeed set. They give you a way to hit the many Grass-types in UU. However, Jumpluff's low Attack stats weakens the viability of these moves.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Sleep Powder makes Jumpluff incredibly hard to counter, as many UU Pokemon capable of absorbing sleep are extremely weak to the SubSeed set.</p>

<p>Clefable is one of the best counters to Jumpluff. Despite still being vulnerable to Encore and Sleep Powder, her Magic Guard ability makes Leech Seed useless. To make matters worse Clefable can easily carry a Toxic Orb and prevent any status put upon her. Grass-types are the best counters to the SubSeed set, although Sleep Powder is a pain for most. Sleep Talkers can easily step in on Sleep Powder and take advantage of the field by retaliating, but they won't like the SubSeed set. Primeape can do well as Vital Spirit blocks Sleep Powder and it has many ways of taking out Jumpluff, or it can just U-turn to a faster sweeper while breaking Jumpluff's Substitute.</p>

<p>Phazers can take advantage of the situation and simply force Jumpluff far away. And to make your life easier, next time Jumpluff steps in it receives 25% more damage if Stealth Rock is down. Just make sure that use Roar or Whirlwind only after you switch in. Since both moves have a negative priority, you run a risk of an Encore shoved right back at you. A lot of UU Pokemon can switch into Jumpluff but have a lot of issues from there. However, outside of Leech Seed and possibly U-turn you really have no fear of taking damage at all.</p>
