[Overview]

<p>Blaziken is arguably the best wallbreaker in the UU metagame, thanks to its awesome mixed attacking stats (120/110/80), Fighting-type STAB to take out common special walls, and powerful Fire-type STAB to deal major damage to everything else. Unfortunately, Blaziken wishes it were faster, as its middling Speed and defenses are the main things holding it back. However, it's a very versatile Pokemon with many viable options and a useful typing that sets it apart from fellow Fire- and Fighting-types. With so many possibilities, no one can ever be sure of what set it is running until it attacks. If you need a Pokemon to break down walls, revenge kill, or sweep late-game, definitely consider Blaziken for a slot on your team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set focuses on using Blaziken's excellent Attack stat and coverage to deal massive damage to opposing teams. The way to use this Blaziken is rather simple: just switch into a Pokemon whom Blaziken easily forces out, such as Registeel, and fire off any attack that your heart desires. Blaziken's main attack is Flare Blitz, which can OHKO most Pokemon who don't resist it. Low Kick and Superpower hit the Rock-types who resist Flare Blitz, such as Rhyperior, for major damage while also nailing most Water-types on the switch. Thunder Punch hits Water-types such as Milotic harder, achieving a 2HKO, and also strikes Moltres, who resists both of Blaziken's STAB attacks, for a near OHKO. Finally, Stone Edge can be used in the fourth slot to smash opposing Fire-types and Altaria super effectively, but Blaze Kick could be run instead as a great recoil-less move to sweep late-game with (especially if Blaziken is in Blaze range).</p>

<p>Superpower and Low Kick are both great moves for Blaziken, and both 2HKO Milotic, making it tough to decide between the two. While Superpower hits Pokemon such as Omastar for an OHKO, Low Kick has more consistent power and doesn't lower Blaziken's Attack stat. With a Choice Band, Low Kick and Superpower are both equally effective; however, the Choice Scarf set prefers Superpower because of its more reliable immediate power.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice of whether to use a Choice Band or Choice Scarf comes down to personal preference. Choice Band is the recommended item choice, as most of the listed OHKOs and 2HKOs are assuming a Choice Band, and it is much harder to switch into. With a Choice Scarf, however, Blaziken is much harder to revenge kill, but has weaker offense.</p>

<p>The sheer power of a Choice Band boosted Flare Blitz can OHKO a good portion of the metagame on its own, as well as 2HKOing most defensive Pokemon as well. Altaria, who would otherwise commonly switch into any of the other sets, is 2HKOed with Stealth Rock in play, and a predicted Stone Edge will easily OHKO the poor dragon. However, Slowbro can switch into this set all day, with Thunder Punch barely missing out on the 2HKO, so pairing Blaziken with a Pokemon who can easily dispose of Slowbro, such as Lanturn, is highly recommended. Grass-types, such as Venusaur and Tangrowth, can switch in on Slowbro as well as other Water-types, and threaten them with a STAB Grass-type attack. This Blaziken is also liable to get set up on by Ghost-types predicting the incoming Fighting-type attack, so packing a Skuntank or Spiritomb on your team will allow Blaziken to easily bypass those threats and continue with its wallbreaking duties. Choice Band Blaziken is prone to revenge killing by faster threats such as Alakazam, Swellow, and Scyther, so pairing Blaziken with a Pokemon who can absorb blows from these threats, such as Registeel, will greatly increase Blaziken's survivability. Spikes help this Blaziken out a lot; with Spikes and Stealth Rock, Choice Band Blaziken can actually 2HKO Slowbro with Thunder Punch, and OHKO Donphan with Flare Blitz. While holding a Choice Scarf, Blaziken will appreciate any residual damage to compensate for the lack of power.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Fire Blast
move 2: Superpower
move 3: Hidden Power Grass / Hidden Power Electric
move 4: Vacuum Wave / Stone Edge
item: Life Orb
nature: Mild / Rash
evs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is designed to take advantage of Blaziken's great offensive stats to break down any wall who dares stand in its way. The strategy works likes this - send Blaziken in on a support move or a weak attack, such as Spiritomb's Will-O-Wisp or Registeel's Stealth Rock, scare off the opponent, and proceed to hit the switch-in with either Fire Blast or Superpower, before finishing it off with another hard-hitting attack.</p>

<p>Fire Blast is Blaziken's main STAB attack that can deal a devastating amount of damage to most Pokemon, while Hidden Power covers common Water-type switch-ins. Common walls such as Registeel and Steelix are easily dispatched by either of Blaziken's STAB attacks, and Chansey is easily OHKOed by Superpower, giving special sweepers on your team a new lease on life. Vacuum Wave helps Blaziken become a fairly decent revenge killer as well, nearly OHKOing dangerous Pokemon such as Omastar and Kabutops (if it does not carry Aqua Jet) in the rain. Alternatively, Stone Edge can be used over Vacuum Wave to hit Altaria, who would otherwise safely switch into this set. Vacuum Wave is generally a better choice though, taking into account Blaziken's mediocre Speed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Max Speed allows Blaziken to outspeed Absol and tie with other base 80 Speed Pokemon. A Speed-boosting nature can be used to tie with positive-natured Venusaur and Kabutops, but the loss of power is noticeable. Alternatively, a spread of 240 Atk / 252 SpA / 16 Spe allows much more firepower, giving Blaziken more stallbreaking ability, but less use against more offensive teams. The 16 Speed EVs allow Blaziken to beat Adamant Aggron and minimum Speed Milotic. The added power will allow Superpower to OHKO Lanturn with Stealth Rock and Omastar after a Fire Blast, and have a good chance of KOing Milotic after a Hidden Power. Superpower followed by Vacuum Wave is also Blaziken's only means of 2HKOing Azumarill before getting hit by Aqua Jet. Either a Mild or Rash nature may be used depending on whether you want Blaziken to be able to switch into Houndoom's and Spiritomb's assaults or to have more protection against priority users such as Arcanine, respectively.</p>

<p>This Blaziken set is great at breaking your opponent's walls, such as Registeel, Chansey, and Slowbro, who may cause significant trouble for your sweepers. Thus, Mismagius and Alakazam make great teammates for Blaziken, because with Registeel and Chansey out of the way, they can easily set up and sweep the opponent's team. Alakazam also has the added benefit of checking Hariyama, who may cause Blaziken problems with its bulk and Thick Fat. Pokemon such as Swords Dance Drapion can take advantage of a possible Steelix or Regirock kill as well. Azumarill is another good choice to use with Blaziken, because with Slowbro out of the way, Azumarill can sweep more effectively. Stealth Rock support gives this set many more KOs, so a reliable user of it such as Uxie also makes a wonderful partner to Blaziken.</p>

<p>Defensively, Venusaur is a great Pokemon to use alongside Blaziken, as it can take the Water-type attacks aimed at Blaziken, while dealing with the bulky Water-types whom Blaziken may have trouble with. It is also recommended that you carry an Ice-type attack on your team when you use Blaziken, because Altaria severely hinders Blaziken's wallbreaking power, especially if it has Roost to heal off damage. Mismagius and other Pokemon who can switch into Ground-type attacks make great partners to Blaziken as well.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Low Kick / Superpower
move 3: Flare Blitz
move 4: Thunder Punch / Stone Edge / Quick Attack
item: Life Orb
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Though the common mixed Blaziken is considered a wallbreaker, almost all UU stall teams will carry one of its counters, such as Milotic, Altaria, or Hariyama. However, this Blaziken uses Swords Dance to boost its Attack to sky-high levels, allowing it to OHKO all of its usual counters and run through unprepared stall teams.</p>

<p>Low Kick is Blaziken's main STAB move, OHKOing many walls (if Stealth Rock is on the field) without any drawbacks. However, Superpower is another option that can OHKO Milotic and defensive Altaria as well as have a chance to OHKO Donphan with Stealth Rock down (in exchange for the Attack and Defense drop). Superpower will always OHKO 252 HP / 252 Def Milotic, and 252 HP / 40 Def Altaria will take a minimum of 77.68% from a resisted Superpower, which is a guaranteed OHKO with Stealth Rock down. Even after the stat drops, Blaziken will have a +1 boost under its belt and a clear path to sweep. The secondary STAB move is a choice between Fire Punch and Flare Blitz. While Flare Blitz may sound like a dangerous choice for this set because of its recoil, its sole purpose is to grab the OHKO on bulkier Pokemon like Spiritomb, Uxie, and Claydol. On the other hand, Fire Punch provides a safer option without any negative side effects.</p>

<p>The final slot comes down to three choices that are dependent on a team's needs. Firstly, Thunder Punch comes in handy when faced with a defensive Slowbro, as it deals 73.15% - 88.83% and has a 7.69% chance to OHKO with Stealth Rock down after a single Swords Dance boost. Secondly, Stone Edge is a nice move to hit Altaria and Moltres without resorting to Superpower and having Blaziken's Attack and Defense drop. Lastly, Quick Attack provides Blaziken with a way to hit faster Pokemon such as Dugtrio and Sceptile. Though its Base Power is less than ideal, with a Swords Dance boost, it nabs some interesting KOs.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>To illustrate the damage output of a boosted Quick Attack, here are some damage calculations:</p>

<ul class="damage_calculation">
<li>+2 Quick Attack vs 0/0 Dugtrio - 96.68% - 113.74%<li>
<li>+2 Quick Attack vs 0/0 Sceptile - 59.43% - 70.11%<li>
<li>+2 Quick Attack vs 0/0 Espeon - 65.68% - 77.49%<li>
<li>+2 Quick Attack vs 0/0 Alakazam - 100.8% - 118.7%</li>
<li>+2 Quick Attack vs 0/0 Swellow - 68.2% - 80.5%</li>
</ul>

<p>A Jolly nature is an alternative to outpace Pokemon who linger around the base 80 speed tier, most notably neutral-natured Venusaur, Nidoking, Kabutops, Toxicroak, and other Blaziken. However, the drop in power means Blaziken loses out on a guaranteed OHKO on Altaria with Stealth Rock down (Superpower and Flare Blitz both do a minimum of 70.90%).</p>

<p>Blaziken fits nicely on Spikes-stacking offensive teams that use both Stealth Rock and Spikes. Stealth Rock and at least two layers of Spikes give Blaziken a higher chance to OHKO Slowbro with Thunder Punch, as well as Dugtrio and Sceptile with Quick Attack. Another way to improve Blaziken's sweep is to spread paralysis around the opponent's team. Uxie and Mesprit are great candidates for this due to their natural bulk and ability to set up Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>Blaziken usually has trouble dealing with priority users. Ambipom is a nuisance with its powerful Fake Out + Return combo, which has the power to OHKO Blaziken. Hitmontop also has Fake Out and Mach Punch to reduce Blaziken's HP to smithereens. Azumarill can threaten Blaziken with STAB Aqua Jet, while Blaziken can't even muster a 2HKO with a boosted Quick Attack. On a balanced team, Weezing makes an exceptional partner to Blaziken when it comes to handling these threats, as it can cripple these Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp as well as lure in Chansey to give Blaziken a good opportunity to get a free Swords Dance boost. Cloyster also fits in with Blaziken due to its ability to set up Spikes while scaring away Azumarill. From an offensive standpoint, Choice Scarf Rotom makes an exceptional partner because it is immune to most priority moves and can threaten foes with STAB Thunderbolt.</p>

<p>On an offensive team, Curse Registeel makes an excellent partner because Blaziken can lure in and defeat Milotic, Altaria, and Hariyama, all of whom can disrupt Registeel's setup with phazing moves or Haze. With these Pokemon out of the picture, Registeel can stack Curse boosts without fear. Feraligatr also makes a good partner because it shares many counters with Blaziken and appreciates having them significantly weakened or KOed.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to take advantage of Blaziken's wallbreaking abilities to sweep late-game with Agility. Fire Blast and Superpower are nearly unresisted in UU, save for a couple of Pokemon, such as Slowbro and Moltres, who are hit hard by Hidden Power. To use this set effectively, send out Blaziken on a weak or harmless attack and start wailing on the opponent's walls. Once a wall is in KO range, use Agility on the switch and begin to sweep.</p>

<p>With Fire Blast as its main sweeping attack and a base 110 Special Attack, Blaziken can leave a deep mark on most targets. Superpower deals with what Fire Blast cannot, and the drops in Attack here are not as important anymore, as Blaziken should be sweeping primarily with special moves. Finally, Hidden Power Electric covers bulky Water- and Flying-types, most notably Moltres, who is OHKOed after Stealth Rock.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Naturally, Blaziken draws out its counters, but what is remarkable about this Blaziken is that it can actually beat its counters before setting up its sweep. The EVs reflect this by allowing Blaziken to KO Milotic with Hidden Power followed by Superpower most of the time, assuming Stealth Rock in play. Maximum Special Attack allows Fire Blast to outright annihilate most Pokemon who do not resist it, and 64 Speed EVs outspeeds Adamant Torterra before an Agility and neutral-natured Choice Scarf base 90s such as Moltres after one.</p>

<p>The item choice is not easy. Life Orb is preferred because of the increased damage output against Pokemon neutral to Blaziken's attacks, such as Donphan, but Expert Belt lets it bluff a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs set before it uses Agility, and doesn't inflict recoil damage. A Rash nature is used over Mild because this set needs as much protection against priority attacks as possible.</p>

<p>This set works a lot like the previous set, but without priority; instead, it directly bypasses Blaziken's mediocre Speed stat with Agility. Since this variant of Blaziken is a standalone sweeper (as in, it breaks walls for itself), this set only has trouble with Pokemon who normally wall Blaziken with their resistances and bulk, namely Altaria, Slowking, and Hariyama. A Pokemon who can deal with Altaria is a must; Rhyperior and Steelix make good choices due to their great physical bulk and the latter's Dragon resistance. Stealth Rock also helps deal with Altaria by taking away 25% from its health every time it switches in. Even though this set functions fine without any other boosts, it can benefit greatly from Calm Mind boosts from Espeon, who can Baton Pass to Blaziken on any Bug- or Dark-type attack.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to reliably revenge kill as many threats as possible, while also maintaining some late-game sweeping power. Fire Blast will finish off many Pokemon quite easily, while Superpower covers the rest. With Thunder Punch or Stone Edge along with Hidden Power Ice added to the mix, Blaziken will hit many Pokemon for super effective damage, which aids Blaziken with revenge killing. This Blaziken can also be used as a late-game clean up Pokemon, as once it has taken enough damage, it can sweep with its powerful Blaze-boosted Fire Blast.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With the given Speed EVs and a Choice Scarf, Blaziken reaches a Speed stat of 384, which outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon (except Electrode) in UU. The rest of the EVs are split between Attack and Special Attack to give Blaziken as much attacking power on both sides. It may seem absurd to run a 30 Speed IV, but this allows you to have your other IVs at 31 and effectively gain a single point of Defense out of the deal for free. If you plan on running max Speed to tie with max Speed Choice Scarf Venusaur, then run the following IV spread: 30 Atk / 30 Def / 31 Spe.</p>

<p>The advantage of going mixed over a purely physical Scarf set is that Blaziken's revenge killing prowess broadens. With this set, Blaziken can open with a STAB Fire Blast to deal a lot of damage to whatever it is attempting to revenge kill, and it works well to scout your opponent's Blaziken counters. With "BoltBeam" coverage alongside its STABs, there are few Pokemon whom Blaziken will not hit for super effective damage, which is important for a Choice Scarf set.</p>

<p>Choice Scarf Blaziken works great offensively with Pokemon such as Swords Dance Drapion and Rock Polish Torterra, being able to outspeed and OHKO many of their counters, while defensively, Blaziken needs a Pokemon to sponge hits from opponents who can take a hit while also hitting Blaziken for a KO back. With the lack of a boosting item, Water-types will be even more comfortable switching into this set. Bringing a Grass-type Pokemon to the battle, such as Venusaur, can easily force them out.</p>

[Hidden Power]

<p>With many of Blaziken's sets using Hidden Power, it is important to know which ones to use and why. Hidden Power Grass is one of Blaziken's commonly used Hidden Power types that can hit Water-type Pokemon. It does more damage to Lanturn, Quagsire, and Gastrodon than Superpower, and is also needed to OHKO defensive Omastar. However, when compared to Hidden Power Electric, Hidden Power Grass leaves Blaziken open to Qwilfish, Moltres, and Charizard. Hidden Power Electric hits Water-type Pokemon as well, but also hits Moltres. In comparison to Hidden Power Grass, Hidden Power Electric leaves Blaziken open to Lanturn, Gastrodon, and Quagsire. The most significant Pokemon hit super effectively by Hidden Power Electric, Moltres, can be dealt with through Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>Hidden Power Ice has one use for Blaziken: OHKOing Altaria, who resists both of Blaziken's STAB attacks and has great Special Defense with a recovery move to boot. Using it, however, leaves Blaziken painfully vulnerable to Water-types and Moltres, so it is only recommended if you have those Pokemon covered some other way. The reason it's used on the mixed Choice Scarf set is because it is used in conjunction with Thunder Punch, which hits these Flying- and Water-type Pokemon super effectively.</p>

<p>The last viable Hidden Power option is Rock. It OHKOes Moltres and Charizard, and dents physically defensive Intimidate Arcanine more than Superpower or Stone Edge. Again, the issue is that Blaziken needs to be able to hit Water-types hard, as they are the most common switch-ins. Stone Edge is often a better option unless you're using a Choice Specs set.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Flamethrower can replace Fire Blast on any set if you dislike Fire Blast's accuracy, but there is a significant drop in power. Blaziken can replace Superpower with Sky Uppercut or Low Kick on almost any of the sets if you dislike the stat drops from Superpower or the inconsistent damage from Low Kick, but you'll notice the decreased damage against bulky targets like Milotic. Blaziken can also run a purely physical Agility set, with the same attacks as mentioned for the Swords Dance set. It can sweep in the same fashion that the mixed Agility sweeper can, but Flare Blitz has recoil and Superpower will lower the physical Agility set's only attacking stat. Overheat can go over Fire Blast in some places for the extra power, but it will only work effectively on Choiced sets due to their hit-and-run style.</p>

<p>There are still a few sets that Blaziken could run that are not mentioned above. For example, a Reversal set could be devastating, but without a reliable way to remove priority attackers it is very hard to pull off a sweep. A Choice Specs set is also viable because of Blaziken's great coverage and STAB attacks; however, this set is mostly outclassed by the Life Orb set due to Superpower and the ability to switch attacks.</p>

<p>Blaziken can also play the role of a Baton Passer, capable of passing Swords Dance, Agility, Bulk Up, and Substitute. It's actually very good at doing it, because Blaziken forces a lot of switches. Choice Scarf sets can take advantage of a Speed-boosting nature to outspeed Torterra after a Rock Polish. This should only be used on the physical set because the mixed Choice Scarf set has its EVs split up already, so the additional drop in power is not worth it.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Since Blaziken is such a good mixed attacker, it's hard to switch any Pokemon in safely. That being said, safe initial switch-ins include bulky Water-types such as Milotic, but they need to watch out for Hidden Power, as it lowers them into KO range from Superpower. Altaria is probably the best all around switch-in to Blaziken, as it can take any attack except for Hidden Power Ice and Stone Edge. Since it resists both of Blaziken's STABs, it is probably your best bet if you want to safely switch into Blaziken. Similarly to Altaria, Moltres can switch in on many attacks except for Stone Edge and Hidden Power Electric as long as Stealth Rock is kept off the field.</p>

<p>Slowking is an amazing counter to the Mixed Priority and Agility sets, as it takes Fire Blast and Hidden Power better than Slowbro due to its good Special Defense, while Blaziken suffers from Life Orb recoil damage. Dugtrio serves as a good check to most Blaziken sets, as it can trap and KO Blaziken with STAB Earthquake; Blaziken can only muster around 60% damage with a Life Orb Vacuum Wave.</p> 

<p>Blaziken's main weaknesses are its mediocre Speed and defenses. With mediocre Speed, Blaziken can be easily revenge killed by any Pokemon with a super effective attack who has decent attacking strength. Pokemon such as Drapion can be taken out by a Fire Blast, but they can outrun and OHKO Blaziken. The key to eliminating Blaziken is by predicting an obvious Fire Blast or Superpower and then taking advantage of its base 80 Speed and fragility by either forcing it out or revenge killing it. For example, Pokemon such as Azumarill or Kabutops can switch in on a Fire Blast and then threaten to KO it with Aqua Jet or Waterfall respectively.</p>
