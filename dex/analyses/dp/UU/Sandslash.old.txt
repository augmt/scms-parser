[Overview]

<p>Sandslash has a tough time competing for a team slot with Donphan, who boasts superior stats in everything but Speed. However, Sandslash does have a few advantages over his tusked counterpart, namely access to Swords Dance and a rare ability, Sand Veil. Sandslash's unique access to both Rapid Spin and Swords Dance (a combination only shared by Kabutops in UU) allows him to support the team and sweep when given the opportunity. Sandslash is quite effective on sandstorm-based teams, because Sand Veil boosts Sandslash's evasion by 20%, potentially allowing Sandslash to avoid an attack that would normally KO him. Sandslash may be burdened with low Speed and Special Defense, and he may even face serious competition with Donphan, but he is still a solid choice if you want a reliable defensive Ground-type Pokemon or a powerful offensive sandstorm sweeper.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sandslash's unique access to both Swords Dance and Rapid Spin helps him differentiate himself from Donphan as a bulky Ground-type Rapid Spinner. Sandslash is typically used as a physical wall and spinner, acting similarly to Donphan but having the ability to go on the offensive at any given time. Swords Dance boosts Sandslash's already decent Attack stat to powerful levels, making him capable of doing some serious damage to even the bulkiest of walls. Rapid Spin allows Sandslash to remove entry hazards on his side of the field, which greatly aids his team. Earthquake is his primary STAB move and deals solid damage after a Swords Dance boost, even without an Attack-boosting item; Earthquake cleanly OHKOes standard Registeel and, with a little residual damage, OHKOes Steelix and defensively oriented Rhyperior as well. Night Slash is useful for dealing with Ghost-type Pokemon who attempt to block Sandslash's Rapid Spin. After a Swords Dance, even the bulkiest Rotom sets are OHKOed by +2 Night Slash. Stone Edge, on the other hand, is useful for taking out Flying-type Pokemon who attempt to switch into Earthquake.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Leftovers is the item of choice since it gives Sandslash significantly more staying power, but Lum Berry is useful for avoiding status momentarily and allows Sandslash to consistently beat bulky Ghost-types who attempt to cripple him with Will-O-Wisp. An alternative EV Spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with an Impish nature may be used for a weaker but bulkier Sandslash. By doing so, Sandslash may gain more chances of setting up Swords Dance, which could either help negate the power lost or make Sandslash even stronger than before.</p>

<p>Sandslash is easily countered by bulky Water-types like Milotic and Slowbro, as they can easily take a boosted Earthquake and OHKO Sandslash in return with their STAB Water-type moves. A bulky Grass-type is an effective partner for dealing with the aforementioned threats, so pairing Sandslash with Venusaur or Torterra is recommended. Strong special attackers like Moltres have an easy time switching into Sandslash on a Swords Dance, Earthquake, or Rapid Spin and obliterating him with powerful STAB attacks. Chansey can help safeguard against special attackers with her incredible special bulk while also paralyzing them with Thunder Wave. Grass-types can deal with Sandslash without much trouble as they resist Earthquake, allowing them to freely set up on him. Torterra and Leafeon can either destroy Sandslash with their STAB moves of choice or set up with Rock Polish or Swords Dance, respectively. Weezing can also switch in with ease and threaten Sandslash with Will-O-Wisp. Moltres himself is a fine partner to Sandslash, as it can switch into most Grass-types and Weezing easily, and roast them with STAB Fire Blast, while Sandslash can return the favor by removing Stealth Rock from the field with Rapid Spin.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Swords Dance

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Despite facing serious competition from other Ground-type Sword Dancers, Sandslash is able to set himself apart due to Sand Veil. The evasion boost from Sand Veil is highly important to his success, as it gives him the ability to beat his counters by potentially avoiding attacks that would otherwise be fatal. Swords Dance increases Sandslash's Attack to an impressive 656, which allows him to 2HKO all of his counters and become a significant threat to the opposing team. Earthquake is the bread and butter STAB attack of choice that deals amazing damage to any Pokemon not resistant or immune to it. Stone Edge is an excellent coverage move when paired alongside Earthquake, as it gives Sandslash a way to deal with troublesome Flying-types and Levitating Pokemon. Substitute is highly important to this set's success, as it lets Sandslash scout for his counters and gives him an opportunity to dodge an incoming attack without risking his own life if he fails. If Sandslash succeeds in dodging his counter's attack, then he can freely set up a Swords Dance.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>BrightPowder is the main item on this set, as it goes hand in hand with Sand Veil. The combined evasion boosts give Sandslash a 28% chance to dodge incoming attacks, and that's just against those with otherwise perfect accuracy. The evasion boost is compounded even further versus attacks with less than perfect accuracy, such as Power Whip and Will-O-Wisp. Leftovers can be used if you want a bulkier Sandslash, and it's useful for healing HP lost from Substitute. The EVs are pretty straightforward: 252 Atk EVs and an Adamant nature are used for maximum power, 212 Speed EVs are used to outspeed nearly all defensive variants of Milotic, and the rest is dumped into HP for more bulk.</p>

<p>This set absolutely requires Hippopotas support to provide permanent sandstorm in order to function. Despite the rather large evasion boost, keep in mind that bulky Water- and Grass-types are still effective counters to Sandslash 72% of time. Weezing is also a pain for Sandslash to deal with if he is carrying Flamethrower or Fire Blast. Should a counter switch into Sandslash while he is behind a Substitute, Sandslash can opt to Substitute again to increase the odds of the opposing Pokemon eventually missing. Conventional Weezing counters like Houndoom and Moltres are not as effective with this set, as sandstorm adds unwanted residual damage and limits their effectiveness. Cradily is an excellent partner to Sandslash, as it receives a sizable Special Defense boost in sandstorm and is capable of beating both bulky Water- and Grass types. As a bonus, Cradily is capable of taking on Moltres, who otherwise threatens to OHKO Sandslash.</p>

<p>Excessive use of Substitute will quickly wear out Sandslash, so pairing Sandslash with a Wish user is recommended in order to replenish lost HP. Clefable, Chansey, and Leafeon are all recommended due to their ability to deal with some of Sandslash's counters. Clefable stands out as the only Pokemon of the aforementioned three whom is immune to sandstorm, and she is also capable of dealing with most of the above threats with ease.</p>

[SET]
name: Support

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Sandslash can put his good defenses to use by serving as a solid Ground-type support Pokemon. Not only is Sandslash capable of removing entry hazards, but his above-average physical bulk allows him to check prominent physical sweepers such as Rhyperior, Swords Dance Toxicroak, and Hitmonlee. Stealth Rock provides immediate support for the team, aiding your team's sweepers with much appreciated residual damage. Rapid Spin helps Sandslash's teammates preserve their health by clearing away entry hazards. Earthquake is his main STAB attack and is at least strong enough to noticeably hurt frail Pokemon. Access to Night Slash makes it somewhat difficult for Ghost-types to block Sandslash's Rapid Spin, as Night Slash hits Rotom and Mismagius hard even with no EV investment in Attack.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>You can replace Night Slash with Stone Edge so that Sandslash can better deal with powerful Flying-types who would otherwise easily switch into him. Unfortunately, replacing Night Slash removes one of Sandslash's niche advantages over Donphan: the advantage of being able to reliably hit Levitating Ghost- and Psychic-types for super effective damage. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 204 Def / 32 SpD / 20 Spe can be used in order for Sandslash to outrun any Lanturn who does not invest in Speed, survive a Surf, and 2HKO back with Earthquake.</p>

<p>Sandslash pairs up well with bulky Water- and Grass-types like Milotic and Venusaur, as they can take incoming Water- and Ice-type attacks and Grass-type attacks respectively. Moltres is also a good partner, as it appreciates the removal of Stealth Rock and threatens Grass-types with its STAB moves. Wish support is also helpful for this Sandslash, as without a reliable way to restore his HP, he will be worn out quickly. Leafeon, Clefable, and Chansey are great examples of Wish users who have decent synergy with Sandslash. Although he shares an Ice weakness, Leafeon has the advantage of attacking Water-types for super effective damage. Clefable and Chansey have Thunder Wave to slow down faster threats for Sandslash to outspeed. </p>

[Other Options]

<p>Moveset-wise, there isn't much else that Sandslash can do without being outclassed by other Pokemon. He can run a Choice Band set, but he is entirely outclassed by Donphan in that respect, as Donphan boasts more power. Toxic is an option on the defensive set if you want Sandslash to cripple bulky switch-ins. X-Scissor is an option on the offensive sets, as it does decent damage to Grass-types. Finally, Safeguard is an option if your team really hates status afflictions.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bulky Grass-types in general are capable of switching into Sandslash with ease and threatening him with their STAB attacks. Tangrowth only takes 30.4% - 35.9% damage from +2 Stone Edge and KOes back with STAB Power Whip or Leaf Storm. Leafeon and Torterra can easily switch into Sandslash and set up in his face. Bulky Water-types are also great counters to Sandslash, as they can usually shrug off his attacks and threaten him with STAB Surf. Milotic and Slowbro do not mind boosted Earthquakes and are capable of OHKOing Sandslash with Surf. Moltres is able to comfortably switch into most of Sandslash's attacks and destroy him with STAB Fire Blast. Weezing is an effective counter, as it can switch into any of Sandslash's moves and cripple him with a burn. However, Weezing needs to watch out for Sandslash who carry Substitute as he will actually beat Weezing one-on-one unless he carries Flamethrower. Typically, strong special attackers carrying a Grass-, Ice-, or Water-type move can usually dispose of Sandslash without too much difficulty.</p>
