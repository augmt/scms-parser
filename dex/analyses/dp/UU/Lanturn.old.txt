[Overview]

<p>Lanturn's best use doesn't really depend on what tier it's being used in, but more on what Pokemon are being used in the respective tier; Lanturn can switch into most Fire-, Water-, Electric-, and Ice-type special attackers with relative ease even in OU. UU, however, is where Lanturn really shines. Almost no other Pokemon can hold its own in the diverse special attacking metagame of UU, catching switches on bulky and offensive Fire- and Water-types alike. Even with all of these formidable resistances, however, Lanturn simply cannot take repeated beatings, resisted or not, without proper team support. Smart play and knowing Lanturn's limits are important when using it. With enough practice and experience, Lanturn makes a unique and colorful addition to any team.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Tank
move 1: Surf
move 2: Thunderbolt / Discharge
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Heal Bell / Thunder Wave
item: Leftovers

nature: Calm
evs: 40 HP / 192 Def / 100 SpA / 176 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lanturn is a great special tank, having the bulk to absorb many special hits in the UU tier. Surf is a reliable, yet reasonably powerful attack, and is one of Lanturn's main attacks. Thunderbolt is another STAB attack, and hits a lot of Pokemon that Surf does not for super effective damage. Discharge is an option over Thunderbolt, offering lower power but having a much higher chance of paralyzing a threat, allowing Lanturn and its teammates to have an easier time with them. Heal Bell turns Lanturn into a cleric, allowing it to clear status off all its teammates. It also prevents Lanturn from getting crippled by Toxic coming from the likes of Arcanine and Milotic. Thunder Wave guarantees an opponent paralyzed, and if Lanturn utilizes it, Thunderbolt should be used over Discharge.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Defense EVs allow Lanturn to survive an Earthquake from Impish Donphan, boosted Facade from Swellow, and +2 Return from Life Orb Feraligatr. The Special Defense EVs allow Lanturn to tank Moltres's Fire Blast assaults. The Special Attack EVs allow Lanturn to OHKO Rhyperior and 2HKO specially defensive Donphan with Surf. The remaining EVs are put into HP to give Lanturn more bulk and to hit a Leftovers number. Calm nature allows Lanturn to tank special hits more easily, while not altering any of its necessary stats.</p>

<p>Though Lanturn has a reasonable amount of physical bulk, it cannot take repeated hits of any kind, meaning a sturdy physical wall will greatly benefit Lanturn. Leafeon pairs well with Lanturn, having impressive physical bulk and great synergy with Lanturn. Leafeon also has access to Wish, allowing it to heal itself and Lanturn, making it an ideal teammate. Entry hazards are also welcome, as special attackers will often find themselves unable to harm Lanturn, forcing them to switch out. Registeel is a good candidate for Stealth Rock thanks to its huge amount of physical bulk and access to Thunder Wave, allowing it to cripple opposing Pokemon if Lanturn lacks Thunder Wave itself.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute + Charge Beam
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Charge Beam
move 3: Surf
move 4: Ice Beam / Thunderbolt
item: Leftovers
ability: Volt Absorb
nature: Modest
evs: 104 HP / 28 Def / 252 SpA / 124 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lanturn can utilize Substitute and Charge Beam to easily destroy unprepared teams, thanks to its ability to set up on many special walls, gain Special Attack boosts easily, and manage to come out on top. With a combination of Substitute and Charge Beam, Lanturn can beat Chansey and other Pokemon who rely on Seismic Toss to deal damage, as it will take two Seismic Toss to break Lanturn's Substitute. Lanturn hits hard with max Special Attack, and very hard after just a few boosts from Charge Beam. It has perfect coverage with its moves, bar opposing Lanturn and Shedinja, and is a very good weapon against stall and slower teams. It has a very good typing, ability, and coverage, which is very helpful for Lanturn.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to its wide coverage, it can easily defeat teams that rely on a Fire-Water-Grass core, as each type is hit for super effective damage by one of Lanturn's attacks. The EVs allow Lanturn to outrun 8 Speed Milotic, defensive Venusaur, Rhyperior, and Adamant Aggron. The HP EVs allow Lanturn to create 101 Substitutes, while also giving it an extra point of healing each turn via Leftovers. Special Attack is maxed out so that Lanturn can hit as hard as possible, while the remaining EVs are put into its lower Defense to help it tank hits better.</p>

<p>Even with the investment in Defense, Lanturn appreciates teammates who can take powerful physical attacks, especially Ground- and Grass-type attacks. Altaria, Scyther, and Moltres all make decent partners, although Rhyperior will cause issues for everybody because Lanturn cannot switch into even Stone Edge. Tangrowth is a good counter to Rhyperior, and can switch in on an Earthquake and force it out with Power Whip. Offensive Venusaur can cause problems for Lanturn, so Altaria is again a great option for defeating Venusaur. Other options include Toxicroak, who can deal with the special variants, and Scyther and Moltres, who can deal with the physical variants. However, all counters must beware of a potential Sleep Powder.</p>

[SET]
name: Rain Dance
move 1: Rain Dance
move 2: Hydro Pump / Surf
move 3: Thunder
move 4: Heal Bell / Ice Beam
item: Damp Rock
ability: Volt Absorb
nature: Modest
evs: 40 HP / 252 SpA / 216 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set utilizes Lanturn's ability to set up Rain Dance, which can boost the power of its Water-type moves, while bringing its powerful Thunder to 100% accuracy. Hydro Pump is the main option, because it allows Lanturn to 2HKO Clefable in the rain, which is a great bonus. However, Surf can still be used if you are wary about Hydro Pump's shaky accuracy. Heal Bell allows Lanturn to also act as a cleric, while Ice Beam provides Lanturn with almost perfect coverage, hitting all Pokemon for at least neutral damage, except for other Lanturn and Shedinja. This set works very well thanks to Lanturn's invaluable Electric-type immunity, combined with good special bulk. Lanturn can easily switch in on Choice Scarf Rotom, amongst other Electric-type Pokemon, and set up Rain Dance with ease. While Lanturn works well as a bulky user of Rain Dance, Lanturn does a much better job when hitting hard, allowing it to beat several Pokemon that usually enjoy setting up on relatively weak Lanturn, such as Mismagius and Toxicroak.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Modest nature is used so Lanturn can hit as hard as possible. Damp Rock is the recommended item choice so that the rain will last for eight turns, allowing Lanturn and its teammates to abuse it more easily. The EV spread brings Lanturn to 401 HP, maximizes Lanturn's Special Attack stat, and heavily reinforces Lanturn's Special Defense, turning Lanturn into a sturdy special tank.</p> 

<p>Though not a direct counter, Dugtrio is a major threat to Lanturn. It can switch in on a Rain Dance or Thunder, and immediately threaten Lanturn with a STAB super effective Earthquake. As an answer to this threat, a Pokemon such as Torterra makes for a great teammate, being able to setup on Dugtrio after Lanturn faints. Venusaur is also problematic, so a Pokemon who can take it out will greatly aid Lanturn and all of its teammates.</p>

[SET]
name: Agility
move 1: Agility
move 2: Hydro Pump / Surf
move 3: Thunderbolt 
move 4: Ice Beam
item: Life Orb
ability: Volt Absorb
nature: Modest
evs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lanturn can make great use of Agility, turning it into a fearsome endgame sweeper. It doesn't quite have the power to get through bulkier teams, but if they are weakened from previous assaults and entry hazards, it can sweep many teams with its great coverage. Agility doubles Lanturn's Speed, allowing it to hit 466 Speed, outspeeding almost all Pokemon in the UU tier, unless they hold a Choice Scarf. Hydro Pump is Lanturn's most powerful attack, gains STAB, and hits very hard. Surf is an alternative, trading power for accuracy, and is much more reliable. Thunderbolt is for secondary STAB, and hits opposing Water-type Pokemon hard. Ice Beam hits Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Venusaur and Altaria, respectively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes Lanturn's Special Attack and Speed stat, allowing it to hit as hard as possible while outrunning Choice Scarf Rotom after an Agility, and Jolly Torterra before an Agility. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to allow Lanturn to take physical hits a tad easier. Thunder Wave is an option over Agility, and if you decide to make this change, the Speed EVs should be shifted into HP and Special Defense to turn Lanturn into a serviceable Life Orb tank. Lanturn loves switching in on bulky Water-types, making Moltres an ideal teammate as it attracts Water- and Electric-type attacks, and they form a powerful specially offensive core.</p>

<p>Choice Band Dugtrio is a great teammate, trapping special walls such as Chansey, Registeel, and Clefable, and being able to 2HKO them with Earthquake, allowing Lanturn to have a much easier time sweeping. Opposing Lanturn are also taken care of by Dugtrio. Entry hazards are crucial to Lanturn's success, so teammates that can set up hazards will greatly benefit Lanturn. Though not often seen in the tier, Cacturne makes a decent teammate, resisting both of Lanturn's weaknesses, and being able to set up Spikes. Uxie is a great candidate for Stealth Rock, having Levitate to avoid Ground- attacks aimed at Lanturn, and having a lot of bulk to easily set up.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Surf
move 4: Discharge / Thunderbolt
item: Leftovers
ability: Volt Absorb
nature: Calm
evs: 40 HP / 192 Def / 100 SpA / 176 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lanturn has access to impressive bulk, great typing, a great ability, Rest, and Sleep Talk, allowing Lanturn to effectively switch into powerful assaults and heal itself thanks to Rest. Sleep Talk prevents Lanturn from being a sitting duck while it's asleep, and prevents Lanturn from being set up on. Surf and Discharge are both reasonably powerful STAB moves, and have good coverage with each other. Thunderbolt is an option over Discharge to pack more power, but since this set lacks impressive offensive capabilities, Discharge is usually the better option thanks to its relatively high paralysis rate.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Ice Beam is an option over Surf to create the BoltBeam combination that hits all Pokemon for neutral damage bar Magneton, Shedinja, and opposing Lanturn, but the extra STAB power that Surf provides is usually more appealing. Most enemies will be left unimpressed by a non-STAB Ice Beam from this set's relatively low Special Attack. The HP EVs allow Lanturn to hit a Leftovers number, the Defense EVs allow it to take more powerful physical attacks, the Special Attack EVs allow Lanturn to hit hard against switch-ins such as Donphan and Rhyperior, and the Special Defense EVs turn Lanturn into a sturdier special tank.</p>

<p>Grass-types do well against Lanturn, resisting both of Lanturn's attacking moves, while being able to threaten Lanturn with powerful super effective STAB attacks. Sceptile can switch in easily, and either set up a Substitute or hit Lanturn hard with a Leaf Storm. Venusaur can easily set up Swords Dance on Lanturn, before knocking it out with Power Whip. Therefore, a Pokemon that can deal with the aforementioned Grass-type Pokemon is helpful. Moltres complements Lanturn well, having great defensive synergy with it and being able to scout switch-ins with Substitute and toast Lanturn's enemies with a powerful Fire Blast. Arcanine can also deal with Grass-types thanks to its powerful Flare Blitz, but it shares a common Ground-type weakness with Lanturn.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Lanturn has access to Aqua Ring, which when used in tandem with Leftovers, heals 1/8 of Lanturn's health every turn; however, every moveslot is worth a lot to Lanturn, and Lanturn will find itself struggling against certain opponents when Aqua Ring is used. Lanturn can make use of a parafusion set, utilizing Thunder Wave and Confuse Ray to make it almost impossible for the opponent to attack. Icy Wind can be used to slow an opponent down, but it is severely outclassed by Ice Beam in terms of power, and Agility and Thunder Wave in terms of Speed modification. Finally, Toxic can be used to severely cripple an opponent, but common Lanturn switch-ins such as Toxicroak and Venusaur are immune to Toxic, making Thunder Wave the best option in most cases.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>In UU, specific Pokemon who can switch in neutrally on Lanturn's main attacking moves and come prepared with a super effective STAB attack do well. Quagsire, Ludicolo, and Gastrodon are excellent examples, all of which are armed with either Earthquake or a super effective Grass-type attack. Other Grass-types do exceedingly well at stopping Lanturn, especially those who don't mind taking a Thunder Wave while switching in; bulkier Grass-type Pokemon such as Tangrowth can absorb the paralysis in confidence that they won't have to worry about more dangerous damaging statuses. Chansey can switch in on any status move and simply dispose of them when she switches out thanks to her ability, while absorbing any weak special attacks Lanturn throws at her.</p>

<p>Dugtrio can trap and kill Lanturn if it can get in without eating Surf. It will survive Ice Beam at full health most of the time unless Lanturn is running more than 247 Special Attack (which is close to its maximum without a Modest nature). Other strong Ground-type attackers in UU like Donphan, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen can KO Lanturn if they get the chance to switch in.</p>

<p>In general, considering Lanturn's mediocre Defense stat, most strong physical attackers will easily dispense of Lanturn should they be able to safely switch in, either on a predicted resisted move or to revenge kill following a kill by Lanturn. Faster Ground-types do well, however most will have to watch out for STAB Water-type moves, especially from more offensive Lanturn. Toxic and Toxic Spikes also spell doom for Lanturn if it lacks Rest, and they help to wear Lanturn down enough to sweep.</p>
