[Overview]

<p>Lopunny's biggest asset is her unpredictability, as she can run a large number of sets effectively. When Lopunny's revealed, you won't know whether she's a supporter, a Baton Passer, or maybe even both. Many opponents blindly switch in the Pokemon who would be least effected by Switcheroo, but this plan can go awry if she sets up Substitute or Agility. Lopunny can always manage to keep her opponents guessing.</p>

<p>Although unpredictable, Lopunny faces stiff competition from Alakazam and Jumpluff, who both have access to Encore as well as higher Speed. Alakazam can employ Trick as well, and Jumpluff has a crippling Sleep Powder. With Trick being so widespread, other Pokemon are chosen instead of Lopunny for this particular role. That being said, Lopunny still has one the largest support movepools of any Pokemon (including the excellent Baton Pass) and a unique ability which distinguishes her from other Trick users. Lopunny's strengths lie not in brute force, but in support and messing with the opponent's strategy. One misprediction can cost you the match, so underestimate her at your peril.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>High Speed coupled with Encore is a dangerous combination, especially when the user can also employ a quick SubPass strategy. This is arguably Lopunny's most effective set, as it combines all of her assets and abuses them to the fullest.</p>

<p>Lopunny works as a simple Substitute passer, allowing frail teammates to get in safely or on an attack they otherwise wouldn't be able to switch in on. Encore is Lopunny's greatest tool in making sure the strategy is pulled off. Lopunny can Encore weak attacks or an attack her teammate is immune to, and then simply Baton Pass and allow it to obtain a free turn. Switcheroo is an excellent move to round out this set. Because of Lopunny's unique ability, Klutz, she can simply bide her time and choose the appropriate Pokemon to cripple, unlike other Trick users such as Uxie and Mesprit who would be forced into one move. Klutz also allows her to absorb the harmful items an opposing Tricker may try to cripple one of your Pokemon with, and throw it back at the opponent. Flame Orb is a great option to cripple powerful physical attackers who enjoy switching into Lopunny, such as Rhyperior, but Choice Scarf cripples a wider variety of Pokemon by locking them into one move.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Lopunny needs maximum Speed to ensure she outpaces as many Pokemon as possible. A Timid nature is chosen because Lopunny doesn't have any attacks, and it reduces the amount of damage she takes when she hurts herself from confusion. The HP EVs give Lopunny a decent amount of bulk; she can survive a Modest Life Orb Alakazam's Psychic with a bit of health left to spare. Lopunny has alternative choices in the item department such as Lagging Tail and the other Choice items, but they're usually inferior options.</p>

<p>Because of Lopunny's high Speed, many Pokemon such as Registeel may try to paralyze her. Substitute blocks this, however, and allows Lopunny to Encore then Baton Pass to a teammate. With proper prediction, the possibilities brought by a high-Speed Encore are endless. For example, Lopunny can switch into Shadow Ball, Substitute, or Nasty Plot from Mismagius with Hidden Power Fighting (the lowered Speed IV ensures that Lopunny is faster) and Encore her, making her much easier to handle. Lopunny can also switch into other powerful threats including Swords Dance Leafeon and Nasty Plot Houndoom as they begin to set up, and foil their chances at a sweep. After Lopunny has been revealed, many opponents will be hesitant to set up a Pokemon slower than her, allowing you to be free from worry that a powerful Pokemon will end up sweeping until she's been eliminated.</p>

<p>Lopunny has significant trouble with Fighting- and Fire-types. If Lopunny has already Tricked away Flame Orb, powerful Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Hitmontop can freely switch in and OHKO her with their STAB attacks. Hariyama is the most threatening because he can obtain a Guts boost from Flame Orb. A bulky Psychic-type such as Uxie or Slowbro is useful in sponging these Pokemon's assaults. Lopunny can also Baton Pass to Mismagius and Rotom on a Fighting-type move, allowing them to switch in freely and behind a substitute. Fire-types such as Arcanine and Houndoom are also problems because they're immune to Flame Orb's effects and don't mind Choice Scarf as much. Rhyperior is also a nuisance if Lopunny is without a Flame Orb. A Water-type such as Azumarill or Milotic works excellently to scare off these threats. Potential counters need to be wary of Switcheroo and Lopunny's ability to Baton Pass to a counter.</p>

[SET]
name: Agility + Baton Pass
move 1: Baton Pass

move 3: Substitute
move 4: Encore
item: Liechi Berry / Petaya Berry
ability: Cute Charm
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With base 105 Speed and access to Encore, Lopunny makes a brilliant Baton Passer. Unlike Lopunny's other sets, this set takes a less subtle approach in setting up her teammates, and is particularly risky, but the payoff can be huge.</p>

<p>The plan is to switch into a Pokemon who is using a support move such as Stealth Rock or is healing itself and Encore the opponent, locking it into the last used move. You can also abuse Lopunny's immunity to Ghost by switching into Shadow Ball or Shadow Sneak. Once Encored, the opponent will likely switch, giving Lopunny an opportunity to use Agility. At this point, begin using Substitute as the opponent attacks you. After the third Substitute, the Berry you've chosen will kick in, and the boosts can be passed to a sweeper who will obliterate the opposing team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice of Berry depends on what type of sweeper you're trying to set up. Physical sweepers will enjoy the Liechi boost, while special attackers will welcome the Petaya boost. Lum Berry is a safe option that can aid Lopunny against status. Starf Berry is also available and is a riskier alternative, but the payoff can be huge if Lopunny manages to grab a +2 Attack or Special Attack boost. Cute Charm is necessary as Klutz would prevent the Berries from activating, and can also give Lopunny an easier time setting up if the opponent becomes attracted.</p>

<p>Faster Taunt users can be a huge roadblock to Lopunny. Fortunately, only Ambipom and Alakazam fulfill this role in UU. Spiritomb is great to Pursuit these threats as they switch and to absorb Fighting-type attacks aimed at Lopunny. Haze Milotic is a hindrance to Lopunny, so a strong Grass-type such as Sceptile or Venusaur makes a good partner. Perish Song Altaria and Roar Steelix also cause problems. Milotic handles these threats with Ice Beam and Surf, respectively. An alternative would be having a Pokemon with Soundproof or Suction Cups, such as Mr. Mime or Octillery. Mr. Mime can continue passing on the chain while Octillery can use the Speed boost to sweep.</p>

[SET]
name: Support
move 1: Switcheroo
move 2: Encore
move 3: Heal Bell / Thunder Wave
move 4: Baton Pass / Return
item: Flame Orb / Choice Scarf
ability: Klutz
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lopunny's support movepool is nearly unmatched, making her a fantastic choice to aid the team. Switcheroo is perfect to cripple Lopunny's common switch-ins. Ground-types such as Torterra and Fighting-types such as Hitmontop will be rendered useless by Flame Orb, which cuts their offensive capabilities significantly. Choice Scarf cripples walls and sweepers by locking them into one move. Encore allows Lopunny to halt set-up attempts and gives her team free switch-in opportunities. For example, Lopunny can Encore weak attacks from Registeel and go to a threatening sweeper, giving it a vital free turn without fear of status. Heal Bell gets rid of all status effects on your team, while Lopunny can spread status herself with Thunder Wave. Employing a dry Baton Pass is a great strategy to help build momentum and safely counter threats, although if Taunt is troublesome Lopunny can run Return which packs enough of a bite to hurt frail sweepers significantly.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Lopunny has a few other move options that easily fit into this set. Magic Coat can be used to bounce back harmful status moves such as Thunder Wave and Sleep Powder, while Healing Wish can restore a teammate back to mint condition, provided you're willing to sacrifice Lopunny. Lagging Tail and the other Choice items are viable item alternatives, but they aren't as effective if Tricked to the wrong Pokemon.</p>

<p>Fighting- and Fire-types are major threats to Lopunny. Hariyama is extremely dangerous because Flame Orb and Thunder Wave give him a Guts boost and his STAB attack will OHKO. Arcanine is also threatening because of his immunity to Flame Orb. Slowbro makes a great partner for this Lopunny as he can easily handle these threats, while she halts any set-up attempts Mismagius makes. Spiritomb makes an ideal partner as he's immune to Fighting attacks and can defeat Fighting-types with repeated Shadow Balls. He can also scare off and Pursuit faster Pokemon such as Ambipom and Alakazam before they can Taunt or Encore Lopunny.</p>

<p>Many sweepers enjoy having Lopunny's support. Since Lopunny has the defenses to Encore a weak Surf or Flamethrower from walls, she can switch to a friendly sweeper who will be given a free turn that they would otherwise find difficult to obtain. Thunder Wave can also allow slow but powerful Pokemon such as Marowak a chance to sweep. Lopunny's ability to give fearsome Pokemon such as Torterra, Houndoom, and Toxicroak that crucial turn they need to set up is extremely useful, and can turn the match around in the blink of an eye.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Lopunny has an extremely large support movepool. Toxic, Charm, Captivate, Mirror Coat, Fake Tears, and Swagger are all options that weren't mentioned but can find their way into a specialized set. Lopunny can be a decent weather supporter with the proper item, high Speed, and access to both Rain Dance and Sunny Day. Fake Out and Quick Attack can be used on Lopunny, but Ambipom is better in that department. Endeavor is available and can be used to severely weaken a Pokemon as Lopunny's health becomes low.</p>

<p>Although it's not one of Lopunny's strong suits, she can run a few viable offensive sets. Lopunny has access to nifty physical moves such as Low Kick and the elemental punches, making a Choice Band set a decent option. She can also still utilize Switcheroo; just don't forget to use Cute Charm. In addition, Lopunny can run a SubPunch set as her common switch-ins such as Steelix or Rhyperior are weak to Fighting, and she can Baton Pass the Substitute to a more capable Pokemon if the need arises.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Since Lopunny's sets are geared towards support, a mixed attacker such as Blaziken, Nidoking, or Sharpedo makes a great initial switch-in. None of them mind any of the Choice items and can hit Lopunny hard with the proper attack. Fighting-types including Hitmonlee and Hitmontop can OHKO Lopunny with their STAB attacks but they don't enjoy receiving a Flame Orb or Choice Specs. Hariyama can obtain a Guts boost from Flame Orb or Thunder Wave and OHKO her with STAB Close Combat. Arcanine can hit Lopunny hard with Flare Blitz and heal off any damage with Morning Sun, while also being immune to Flame Orb's effects. He won't particularly enjoy a Choice Scarf or paralysis, however. Faster Taunters such as Ambipom and Floatzel shut most Lopunny down, as do faster Encore users such as Alakazam and Jumpluff. Steelix, Donphan, and Blastoise can ruin any attempts at Baton Passing with Roar while Altaria can accomplish the same with Perish Song. Haze Milotic can switch in and remove any boosts Lopunny may have attained.</p>

<p>Countering Lopunny is a daunting prospect because she will always manage to cripple at least one Pokemon, or pull off at least one successful pass. It may take multiple Pokemon to scout her set, but once it's revealed she shouldn't cause many problems. Just don't forget that her access to Encore means that pulling off a sweep will be difficult until she's eliminated from the match. Luckily, she has no way of healing herself and is worn down quickly.</p>
