[Overview]

<p>With a useful base 85 Speed and superb base 105 Defense to compliment its unique Ground / Flying typing, Gligar should not be frowned upon in the UU tier, despite its NFE status. Gligar's typing grants it both an Electric and Ground immunity, as well as neat resistances to Bug, Fighting, and Poison. Perhaps the most impressive niche about Gligar is its versatility; it can set up Swords Dance and/or Agility and Baton Pass the boosts to a teammate, use Toxic to stall its opponent, break stall with Taunt, or be a deadly set-up sweeper with Swords Dance. It's not all good though, Gligar's special stats are pitiful and its Attack stat is only average. However, as long as its teammates are able to cover up its unfortunate weaknesses to common Water- and Ice-type attacks, Gligar will make a formidable addition to your team.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Due to its great Defense, superb typing, access to Taunt, and an instant recovery in Roost, it's no surprise that Gligar can run a SubRoost set effectively. This set makes a great addition to teams that have trouble breaking through key pieces of stall teams, such as Chansey, Spiritomb, and Clefable. The premise of this set is simple: bring Gligar in on something that can't do much to it, such as a Choiced Fighting-, Ground-, or Electric-type attacks, and Substitute on the switch. Then, let Gligar proceed to whittle away at its opponent's health with Toxic, while simultaneously preventing them from healing via Taunt and keeping itself healthy with Roost.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Speed EVs allow Gligar to outspeed max Speed Milotic, while the HP EVs gives a Leftovers number, allowing it to use Substitute five times. The rest of the EVs are thrown into Defense for additional bulk. You can run 232 Speed to outrun any neutral natured base 95 Pokemon, or you can move the Defense EVs into Special Defense if you want Gligar to be able to take special attacks slightly better. For instance, 56 Special Defense EVs stop Offensive Lead Uxie from 2HKOing Gligar with Psychic. Substitute prevents Gligar from being hit by status, and when used in a sandstorm, greatly increases its survivability.</p> 

<p>If you choose to use Toxic, Poison- and Steel-types like Venusaur and Registeel, as well as Clefable and any Pokemon that can get behind a Substitute, will wall Gligar to no end. Earthquake allows Gligar to hit the aforementioned Pokemon, but leaves it vulnerable to Flyers and Levitators, such as Moltres and Rotom. You can choose to run either Aerial Ace or Rock Slide in the last slot so that Gligar can guarantee some damage against all opponents, particularly Weezing, but the damage output is less than sub-par.</p>

<p>Hippopotas is a good teammate for this set because it sets up sandstorm, which allows Gligar to abuse Sand Veil and negates possible Leftovers recovery on the opponent. A bulky Water-type like Milotic can switch into any Water- and Ice-type attacks aimed at Gligar, while luring Electric-type attacks for Gligar to switch in on. Drapion can set up Toxic Spikes, which frees up a moveslot space, trap Rotom and Mismagius with Pursuit, and attracts Ground-type attacks that Gligar can take advantage of. Cloyster can set up both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, but neither it nor Gligar like being targeted by special attacks.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While this set may look similar to the SubRoost set, it has a different function: to be a reliable check to a number of physical threats in the tier. Gligar is able to check threats like Rhyperior, Aggron, and Hitmonlee without much trouble, thanks to its typing and base 105 Defense. Roost is a given on a defensive set, since it allows Gligar to recover half of its health, as well as play mind games with the opponent by removing its Flying-type. Due to Gligar's weak damage output, opponents will try to setup on Gligar; Taunt solves this issue by preventing Gligar's opponent from setting up on it. Earthquake is Gligar's STAB move of choice, as it allows Gligar to hit Rock-, Poison-, and Steel-types for super effective damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An alternative spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe and a Jolly nature can be used. While Gligar will lose a significant portion of its bulk, this spread will allow Gligar to outrun max Speed Venusaur and Taunt the incoming Sleep Powder. It also lets Gligar outrun neutral natured base 95s and tie with Jolly Toxicroak. Toxic can be used over Aerial Ace if you want to have an easier time breaking stall. If you don't have any Stealth Rock users on your team, Gligar can use Stealth Rock instead of Taunt or Aerial Ace. Rock Slide and Knock Off are both viable options for Gligar's final moveslot. Rock Slide can 2HKO both Moltres and Scyther, while Gligar can have an easier time Roosting off damage if it manages to Knock Off a boosting item.</p>

<p>Rotom and Mismagius are both troublesome to this set, partially due to Levitate, so Pokemon that can remove them, or set up on them, such as Spiritomb, Drapion, or Registeel, make great partners to this set. Spiritomb and Drapion can utilize Pursuit to prevent both threats from simply switching out, while Registeel can paralyze them with Thunder Wave and attack with Shadow Claw. As Gligar tends to lure in specially-based bulky Water-types, having a special wall such as Chansey can be helpful. Chansey has incredible special bulk, access to Thunder Wave, and the ability to lure in Fighting-type attacks for Gligar to switch in on. Slowbro also deserves a mention as a teammate, as it can take physical Ice and Water attacks that neither Gligar nor Chansey can take very well, while Gligar can switch into any Electric and Bug attacks that are aimed at Slowbro.</p>

[SET]

move 2: Agility / Earthquake

move 4: Taunt

ability: Hyper Cutter
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Being only one of three Pokemon in UU that has access to the combination of Swords Dance, Agility, and Baton Pass, Gligar takes after Gliscor as being one of the best Baton Passers in their respective tiers. The moves are fairly simple. Taunt can prevent Gligar's opponent from halting its boosts or phazing it out. Running both Swords Dance and Agility can make your recipient a deadly sweeper if Gligar can manage a successful pass. However, you can opt to use Earthquake instead of a second boosting move because it can be difficult to gain a +2 boost in both Attack and Speed without dual screen support or Defense boosts. The choice between Yache or Passho Berry depends on the resistances of your team; if your team has multiple Water resistances, Gligar is better off holding a Yache Berry, while if your team has more Ice resistances, Gligar should hold a Passho Berry.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Providing dual screen support is an absolute must if you want this set to be as effective as possible. There are a slew of Pokemon that can set up dual screens for Gligar. Both Uxie and Gardevoir can set up dual screens and have access to Memento, which weakens the foe offensively and gives Gligar a free switch in. Mr. Mime has a great support movepool that includes Encore, Taunt, Calm Mind, and Baton Pass, and has Soundproof to prevent sound-based moves, like Perish Song and Roar, from working. Clefable can also set up dual screens with ease due to its great bulk, while also luring Fighting-type attacks that Gligar can switch in on.</p>

<p>As for selecting a receiver, there are several Pokemon to choose from. Physical Water-types are able to switch in easily on incoming Ice and Water attacks, and can make great use of any Swords Dance and Agility boosts. Azumarill has a max Attack stat of 436, thanks to Huge Power, and with a +2 boost on both Attack and Speed, it can absolutely tear through opposing teams. Feraligatr may not pack as much of a punch as Azumarill, but it is significantly faster, so it will be able to outspeed certain threats that Azumarill wouldn't be able to. Perhaps the best recipient for Gligar's boosts is the often mocked Bibarel. With Simple, Swords Dance and Agility each give an effective +4 boost, which allows Bibarel to hit harder than Azumarill after a boost and outrun much more threats than Feraligatr. Add in an unresisted (excluding Shedinja) STAB combination of Waterfall and Return, and Quick Attack for priority, and Bibarel can tear through teams if it can get the required boosts.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance

move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: X-Scissor / Roost
item: Life Orb
ability: Hyper Cutter
nature: Jolly
evs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Gligar's other sets tend to play a more supportive or defensive role, this set is meant to remedy its rather mediocre Attack stat with Swords Dance, and use its respectable base 85 Speed to sweep. After a boost, Gligar reaches 498 Attack which allows it to OHKO or 2HKO all but the sturdiest of walls with its great coverage. As for the moves, Earthquake is Gligar's main way of dealing damage, thanks to its STAB, and Stone Edge completes the infamous QuakeEdge combo, resisted only by Claydol and Torterra in UU. X-Scissor allows Gligar to hit the previously mentioned Pokemon, in addition to bulky Psychic-types like Uxie, Mesprit, and Slowbro, for super effective damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>There are a few other options for Gligar to use in its last moveslot. Roost allows Gligar to heal any Life Orb recoil and turn walls like Registeel, Chansey, and Clefable into set-up bait, but you must be cautious of status attacks. Taunt can stop the opponent from inflicting Gligar with status, and can be used to help beat Weezing, which is a great counter to this set. Aerial Ace can ensure certain KOs against Fighting- and Grass-types. Baton Pass can let Gligar escape from its counters, while passing its boosts to a teammate that can handle your opponent's switch-in. Rock Polish can be used instead of Swords Dance as Gligar reaches and impressive 538 Speed with an Adamant nature. However, Gligar will not be dishing out much damage if it isn't hitting its opponent for super effective damage.</p>

<p>In order for this set to live up to its potential, it requires Stealth Rock and at least one layer of Spikes on your opponent's side of the field to get the necessary OHKOs. Registeel is a great candidate for Stealth Rock because it can lure Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, which Gligar can easily switch into. Qwilfish and Cloyster can both lay Spikes and then Explode, giving Gligar a free switch in and likely eliminating your opponent's Pokemon with it. Dusclops and Weezing are able to take a boosted attack from Gligar and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, so a Flash Fire Pokemon like Houndoom or Ninetales can help by absorbing Will-O-Wisp and blasting the opposition with boosted Fire Blasts. Venusaur and Sceptile also make good teammates, since they can remove any bulky Waters with their STAB attacks, while luring Registeel for Gligar to set up on.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Due to its good physical movepool, Gligar could be an ideal Choice user, but its mediocre Attack makes the idea moot. Gligar can also use Screech to force switches, and use U-turn to take advantage of the switch. In terms of other attacking options, Night Slash allows Gligar to hit Ghost-types, most notably Rotom, for super effective damage. Aqua Tail can be used to hit bulky Ground-types, like Claydol, Rhyperior, and other Gligar. Since most physical attackers will have trouble 2HKOing Gligar without any super effective attacks, Counter can be used to strike back at them.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Most physically bulky Pokemon that can take a boosted attack from Gligar and deal super effective damage back make good counters for it. Any specially-based Water-type like Milotic and Slowbro can OHKO Gligar with Surf. Donphan can use its excellent physical bulk to switch in on Gligar and hit it with Ice Shard. Both Claydol and Torterra resist the infamous QuakeEdge combo and can OHKO or 2HKO Gligar with Ice Beam or Wood Hammer, respectively, but neither will enjoy taking a boosted X-Scissor. Pokemon with access to priority that super effectively damages Gligar can remove it once it has been weakened enough. Cloyster, Azumarill, and Feraligatr are all great examples of such Pokemon.</p>
