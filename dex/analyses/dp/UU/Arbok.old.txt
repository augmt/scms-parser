[Overview]

<p>Arbok comes across as one of the many inferior Poison-type Pokemon in the UU metagame. Despite having a wide array of powerful moves, Arbok's poor overall stats sorely let it down. Looking on the bright side, its ability, Intimidate, allows it to act as a check for many common UU Pokemon, such as Venusaur and Leafeon. The cobra isn't a familiar sight in the UU metagame, but it should by no means be underestimated unless you want your team poisoned and paralyzed all over.</p>

<p>Glare is a neat tool for paralyzing common Ground-type switch-ins such as Rhyperior. Where Weezing's Will-O-Wisp would be useless against special attackers, Arbok's Glare cripples both physical and special sweepers alike. Glare also has the added bonus of being able to paralyze anything it hits, regardless of type, though it does come at the cost of a not-so-hot 75% accuracy. Gunk Shot boasts a great Base Power which can deal a considerable amount of damage to almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, but has very low accuracy. Poison Jab has risk-free accuracy, although it wields considerably lower Base Power than Gunk Shot, which is vital for a Pokemon of Arbok's caliber. Earthquake has good coverage with Arbok's STAB, hitting Steel- and Rock-types that are immune to or resist Gunk Shot for super effective damage. It also has the added benefit of hitting Fire-types such as Arcanine and Houndoom for a considerable amount of damage. This is followed by an option of Seed Bomb or Crunch. The former is the best way to get some nice damage on Water-types, especially Omastar, Quagsire, Kabutops, and Gastrodon, all of whom are 4x weak to Seed Bomb. Crunch provides better overall coverage, but it hits fewer Pokemon super effectively. However, these few targets, particularly Rotom and Mismagius, take little damage from anything else Arbok can throw at them; so if your team is weak to the aforementioned Pokemon, Crunch might be the superior option.</p>

<p>The EV spread allows Arbok to take powerful, resisted hits with some degree of comfort. Combine this with the fact that Intimidate reduces the opponent's Attack by one stage as Arbok switches in, and it makes an excellent physical tank. 252 HP EVs give the cobra all-around bulk, while the remaining EVs are dumped in its Attack stat. One fact that is pretty much overlooked is that Arbok can absorb Toxic Spikes, and thanks to its ability in combination with its high defensive EV investment, it can switch in on all Toxic Spikes users. This can be used to your advantage, as slower sweepers such as Rampardos and Rhyperior can set up and sweep more easily on paralyzed Pokemon. Entry hazards are especially useful if you are running an offensively-inclined team, as the opponent would most likely switch his or her crippled Pokemon as you try to set up or kill them accordingly. Uxie and Mesprit are invaluable teammates as they are immune to Ground-type attacks, which Arbok cannot afford to take, resist Psychic-type attacks, and are able to set up Stealth Rock, amongst other roles such as setting up dual screens. Cloyster's impressive Defense means it can switch into almost any physical attack with ease. In addition to that, it can set up Spikes as well as spin away enemy hazards for Arbok.</p>

<p>Choice Band is a great asset for a Pokemon who is as desperate for attacking power as Arbok. Despite the unappealing fact of being locked into a single move, Switcheroo, when used with correct timing, can render an opposing Pokemon virtually useless. Common switch-ins to Arbok include Registeel and Clefable, and handing them a Choice Band can significantly cripple them whilst at the same time allowing fellow members to set up more easily. Choice Band is also a great item to ruin the sweeping chances of stat-up boosters such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Rock Polish Rhyperior, and to cause the opponent to have to predict a lot more. The second slot features two solid STAB moves, Gunk Shot and Poison Jab. Gunk Shot has a massive 120 Base Power, although with its shaky 70% accuracy, it can cause an almost certain KO or even win to go astray. However, Arbok can do with the extra 40 Base Power Gunk Shot brings, especially when it has given away its Choice Band; although if you prefer having 100% accuracy, Poison Jab is your better bet. Earthquake has good coverage with Arbok's STAB move, hitting both Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage. However, Registeel and Regirock are 3HKOed most of the time, and hence Arbok is better off switching out before they can fire off an Earthquake of their own or cripple Arbok with Thunder Wave. The last moveslot depends on what your team can handle better. Seed Bomb can do a number to Pokemon who are 4x weak to Grass-type attacks such as Gastrodon, Rhyperior, and Kabutops, while Crunch is Arbok's only method of hurting Ghost-type Pokemon such as Rotom and Mismagius.</p>

<p>252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allows Arbok to tie with other positive base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Venusaur and Blaziken. The remaining EVs are dumped into Attack to give the purple snake as much bite as it can pack. Entry hazards are very useful for a Pokemon such as Arbok as it comes close to landing an OHKO on most Pokemon in the metagame. Uxie is immune to Ground-type attacks and can set up Stealth Rock consistently throughout the match due its sheer bulk, and it can also aid Arbok by crippling the opposing team with Thunder Wave or Yawn. In addition to the above, Uxie usually has little Speed investment so that it can U-turn after the opposing Pokemon attacks it, thereby giving Arbok a safe switch-in. Cloyster and Donphan can switch into most physical attacks aimed at Arbox with ease, and can also set up and spin away entry hazards that threaten to reduce Arbok's longevity. Donphan can also defeat most Steel- and Rock-types that give Arbok constant trouble with its STAB Earthquake.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Arbok has access to the three elemental fangs, however they are too weak, and in addition to that don't provide any significant coverage alongside its other moves. Aqua Tail can be used as it hits most of the targets that both Seed Bomb and Earthquake hit for super effective damage, and has the added benefit of hitting Moltres super effectively. Stockpile isn't worth considering, as Arbok has poor defenses to start with and lacks a reliable means of recovery. Shed Skin has the potential to cure Arbok of any stat disorder and can be used in tandem with Rest, though Intimidate is the better option to help cushion physical attacks, not to mention Arbok's low HP and defenses will rarely allow it to still live after the several turns that it is asleep. Screech can catch common switch-ins to Arbok off-guard, and has the potential to force a lot of switches.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bulky defensive behemoths such as Donphan and Steelix have little to fear from Arbok as it fails to even 2HKO them with Choice Banded Seed Bomb and Earthquake, respectively. Ideally, they can hit back with STAB Earthquake, putting a swift end to the cobra. Other common Steel-types like Registeel fall in the same category, being able to take anything Arbok can throw at them with ease due to their sheer physical bulk. Aggron hates taking an Earthquake due to its 4x weakness, however it can switch in on anything else. Moltres can switch in on a predicted Seed Bomb or Earthquake and fire off a boosted Fire Blast, although it should be wary of Glare. Both Rotom and Mismagius can switch in on anything bar Crunch and proceed to set up or cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Both Quagsire and Gastrodon can take down Arbok with their STAB Ground-type attacks and fear nothing it can throw at them bar Seed Bomb. Arbok's overall stats make it easy to revenge kill or set up on, hence the only thing to be worried about is being paralyzed or poisoned.</p>
