[Overview]

<p>Hitmontop is often one of the most noticed and used Pokemon out of the three "Hitmons". With its unique ability to Rapid Spin, it has a unique niche, and is constantly a top-tier Pokemon. It is also one of the few solid counters for Absol and Rock-types such as Rhyperior. Hitmontop's HP stat is rather low, however with the help of Intimidate and great defenses, Hitmontop is still bulky. With a strong STAB Close Combat or Revenge, strong priority attacks, and Bulk Up, Hitmontop is also a very effective sweeper and revenge killer. If you carry Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, or just want a Pokemon to absorb Rock-type attacks and revenge kill, Hitmontop is definitely a good choice for your team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hitmontop is one of the most reliable users of Rapid Spin in UU, making it a good choice for a team in need of entry hazard removal. In UU, Spiritomb is commonly used on teams who rely on residual damage to defeat the opponent due to Spiritomb's incredible bulkiness and ability to block Rapid Spin. However, Hitmontop is one of the better ways around it, due to the fact that Hitmontop possesses the move Foresight. Foresight allows Hitmontop to basically nullify Spiritomb's Ghost-type attribute, and hit it with Rapid Spin or a super effective STAB Close Combat. Even when used against Pokemon such as Rotom or Mismagius, Foresight allows Hitmontop to reliably Rapid Spin. With Intimidate lowering your foe's Attack, Hitmontop will get many chances to safely switch into Stealth Rock users such as Steelix and spin away the hazards.<p>

<p>To make Hitmontop a relative threat to your opponent (other than threatening with entry hazard removal), Close Combat can be used with either Sucker Punch or Stone Edge for coverage. Close Combat and Sucker Punch work well with their near perfect coverage and allow Hitmontop to revenge kill effectively. However, Stone Edge is a nice attack to hit some common Flying-types super effectively, such as Altaria and Moltres. Rest can be used in the last slot as well, because with Hitmontop constantly being hit with burn or poison among other damage it may have taken, it can definitely appreciate the full recovery. A lesser option is Earthquake - while it may seem redundant with Hitmontop's STAB, it hits Toxicroak hard, preventing it from setting up for free on Hitmontop. Close Combat is preferred over other Fighting-type moves because of its high power, perfect accuracy, and the fact that Hitmontop is usually slow enough to go second against harder hitting foes, making the drop in defenses not impact Hitmontop as much.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A more specially defensive spread with 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 SpD with a Careful nature can be used for easier spinning against Special Ghost-type threats such as Mismagius and Rotom once their immunity has been removed with Foresight.</p>

<p>Pokemon with 4x weaknesses to Stealth Rock essentially rely on Hitmontop to clear the field before they enter battle. Without Hitmontop's Rapid Spin support, Pokemon such as Charizard, Moltres, and Scyther will start the battle with 50% HP, which is a bad thing in most circumstances. With Hitmontop on their team however, they can freely switch in and cause some serious harm to your opponent. If Hitmontop uses Rest, Pokemon like Altaria, Chansey, or Miltank with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy help lessen the time that Hitmontop is asleep.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With Technician and a whole slew of priority attacks, Hitmontop becomes one of the best revenge killers in the UU metagame. Basically, Hitmontop switches into a given Pokemon whom it can KO, and uses Fake Out to cause it to flinch and deal damage. After Fake Out, the opponent's Pokemon should be in KO range for Mach Punch. Close Combat or Revenge is used as a STAB attack, both of which carry various advantages and setbacks. Close Combat can dent more physically bulky Pokemon such as Steelix for more immediate power, however, Revenge has 90 Base Power because of Technician, or 120 Base Power if used after being hit, making it a very nice option when compared to Close Combat, which lowers Hitmontop's useful and above average defenses. Keep in mind that Revenge has a negative priority, making you attack last, though. Bullet Punch is there to basically be able to revenge kill Ghost-types, and Pokemon who resist Mach Punch more effectively. However, Stone Edge is still a viable option, to hit Pokemon such as Charizard and Moltres who effectively wall this set. After all of your opponent's Pokemon are weakened and their counters are removed, Hitmontop can utilize its strong priority attacks and proceed to sweep late game.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This offensively oriented Hitmontop is very easily walled by Pokemon such as Weezing, Spiritomb, Slowbro, and basically any other defensive Poison-, Ghost-, or Psychic-type. Blaziken is a great Pokemon for getting rid of Spiritomb, because not only can Blaziken catch Spiritomb with a Fire Blast on the switch, it can also switch in with ease into Will-O-Wisp or Dark Pulse variants. Blaziken can also lure and 2HKO Slowbro as well. Unfortunately, the weakness to Flying-type attacks is a bad thing in the UU metagame because of Swellow's strong Brave Bird and Moltres' strong Air Slash, and both Blaziken and Hitmontop share this weakness. To get Swellow out of the way, one can try many tactics. Stealth Rock can be used on a Pokemon such as Regirock, so that Swellow is forced out and will have to take large amounts of damage switching in with Stealth Rock in play, on top of status and Brave Bird recoil. Venusaur, Sceptile and other Grass- or Bug-types are decent Swellow lures, and all can take Swellow out with the correct attack, but these plans are not foolproof by any means, so keeping a Swellow counter (such as nearly any Rock-or Steel-type) is ideal.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hitmontop normally faces stiff competition from his Fighting-type counterparts Hitmonlee and Hariyama. The selling points of this set that distinguishes it from the aforementioned Pokemon are high Defense and Special Defense along with Intimidate. Additionally, Hitmontop has slightly higher Speed than Hariyama, which ultimately makes him a viable choice and not one inferior to its brethren.</p>

<p>Close Combat is the primary attacking choice for this set and is capable of 2HKOing physical walls like Donphan and Milotic with a little residual damage. Sucker Punch allows Hitmontop to hold his ground against offensive teams; his Speed stat is still quite low, but priority will deal with a slew of faster threats such as Mismagius, Alakazam, and Rotom. Stone Edge wards off overzealous Flying-types who would normally switch into the defensive set easily. Mach Punch serves as a secondary priority move to use against Houndoom, Swellow, and Absol. Rapid Spin is also a viable alternative if you want to effectively spin on many physical walls switching into this set. Thanks to Life Orb, this set can feign a pure offensive set and will therefore lure in dedicated physical walls like Tangrowth, Weezing, and Slowbro, ultimately making spinning easier.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Speed EVs hit 212 Speed, allowing Hitmontop to outpace Adamant Torterra by one point. This also means Hitmontop outruns the prominent Milotic, allowing him to 2HKO her with Close Combat with Stealth Rock in play. If you opt not to use Mach Punch in the final slot, an EV spread of 84 HP / 252 Atk / 172 Spe is recommended as it allows Hitmontop to outpace Jolly Aggron, who has a slight chance to 2HKO Hitmontop with Stealth Rock and Intimidate.</p>

<p>Foresight and Pursuit are viable options in the final slot depending on what you plan to do. Foresight allows Hitmontop to bypass the Fighting-type immunity of Ghost-types, which can help scare away Mismagius, Rotom, and Spiritomb switch-ins. On the other hand, Pursuit can come in handy against Mismagius and Rotom who flee in fear of Sucker Punch.</p>

<p>To demonstrate Hitmontop's ability to hurt Pokemon, here are some calculations:</p>

<ul class="damage_calculation">
<li>Close Combat vs. 248 HP / 252 Def Bold Milotic: 48.1% - 56.7%</li>
<li>Close Combat vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Adamant Donphan: 50.3% - 59.4%</li>
<li>Close Combat vs. 0 HP / 0 Def Venusaur: 43.5% - 51.2%</li>
<li>Sucker Punch vs. 0 HP / 0 Def Venusaur: 38.5% - 45.5%</li>
</ul>

<p>As with the other offensive sets, Hitmontop has difficulty beating Slowbro, Uxie, Mesprit, Weezing, and Spiritomb; the latter two have access to Will-O-Wisp and can greatly reduce Hitmontop's effectiveness. Slowbro and Weezing can be dealt with by using offensive lures such as Swords Dance Leafeon and Swords Dance Blaziken. Spiritomb, on the other hand, is a harder Pokemon to lure, but a good option is Life Orb Mismagius. Uxie and Mesprit can be dealt with by using Close Combat and Stone Edge on consecutive switches until their HP drops to Sucker Punch KO range.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock is required to gain a higher chance of 2HKOing Milotic and Donphan. Although it's not completely compulsory, Spikes can also be used to score a higher chance of 2HKOing the defensive juggernaut Tangrowth. Omastar makes a fine choice for setting up both Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Hitmontop can use Bulk Up to increase its already high Attack and decent Defense, making it very tough to take down. With Hitmontop's defenses so high, it would be a shame to waste them with Close Combat, but luckily Hitmontop has Technician to utilize the move Revenge to its fullest potential. The strategy starts by scouting your opponent's counters, and then weakening them with strong STAB attacks. If your opponent either does not have a good counter, or has a counter that relies on physical attacks, you can proceed to Bulk Up right away. With a couple of Bulk Ups, Hitmontop can sweep the opposing team with Revenge for STAB, Sucker Punch for coverage and priority, and Stone Edge to hit the rest of the Pokemon who resist Revenge and Sucker Punch. If you wish, you may use Mach Punch instead of Revenge, even though it isn't nearly as powerful or reliable.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Pokemon such as Magmortar help pave the way for this Hitmontop set, because its main counter is none other than Slowbro, as it packs massive HP and Defense stats, resistances to Fighting-type attacks, and a reliable recovery move. Uxie is tough as well, but Pokemon such as Absol can Pursuit Uxie into oblivion, as long as Uxie doesn't carry U-turn. A Choice Scarf Absol or Drapion can be of use as well, to trap and KO Alakazam who will be a prime revenge killer for Hitmontop. Weezing and Spiritomb also put Bulk Up Hitmontop between a rock and a hard place, making Hitmontop either switch out and lose its boosts, or stay in to get burned. Absol is a nice lure for these Pokemon, as it can Swords Dance on their switch-in and 1-2HKO them with Psycho Cut and Night Slash respectively.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hitmontop can use many other sets effectively, but it is simply outclassed by the more offensive Fighting-types as Hitmontop outclasses them for bulky Rapid Spin sets. A Choice Scarf set may seem like a good option with Hitmontop's very impressive movepool, however this set is almost always done better by Hitmonlee, due to Hitmontop's much weaker Attack stat. A fast Technician boosted Pursuit is always nice though. A Focus Punch set is better left to Hariyama, because it can make massive Substitutes, has a higher base Attack, and has more HP.  Aerial Ace receives a Technician boost as well, and is Hitmontop's strongest attack against Venusaur and nails Exeggutor and other Fighting- and Grass-types for good damage.</p>

<p>Toxic can work on the Rapid Spin set, but with Foresight, Hitmontop has a better way to hit Ghost-types than merely with Toxic, as most of them will Rest it off anyway. Endeavor and Mach Punch could work out nicely, but with priority omnipresent, and Snover and Hippopotas somewhat present, odds are it won't work well. The same applies with a Reversal set, though Hitmonlee does that better in any event.</p>

<p>Choice Band can be used to catch opponents off-guard, as Hitmontop isn't expected to hit very hard due to its more defensive nature. However, once the surprise is gone, it is outclassed by more powerful and/or bulkier alternatives, such as Hariyama and Hitmonlee.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The Rapid Spin set doesn't have a lot of counters per se, because anything that doesn't block Rapid Spin lets it do its primary job. Ghost-types like Rotom, Spiritomb, and Mismagius come to mind as counters, blocking Rapid Spin and being able to burn Hitmontop, or just attack Hitmontop with a strong STAB attack.</p>

<p>Nearly any Psychic-type can deal with Hitmontop, ranging from faster Pokemon such as Espeon to slower and more bulky Pokemon like Slowbro. A STAB Psychic definitely puts a dent in Hitmontop, if it isn't KOed. Weezing is a great example of a Poison-type who easily counters Hitmontop. Weezing can just use Will-O-Wisp to put Hitmontop in a very weak state.</p>
