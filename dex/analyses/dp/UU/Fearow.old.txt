[Overview]

<p>Fearow is one of the worst Normal / Flying Pokemon in the game. He is outclassed by Dodrio, who is stronger; Swellow, who is much quicker and has Guts; and, to a lesser extent, Pidgeot, who is significantly bulkier. Furthermore, all three of the aforementioned birds also have access to Brave Bird, a critical move that Fearow lacks. Fearow is quite frail and weak to Stealth Rock, so don't expect him to stay alive for much of the battle, either. To make matters worse, Fearow's ability, Keen Eye, is practically useless, as accuracy-reducing moves are almost never seen. It's not all bad news for Fearow, however; he has a decent Attack stat and excellent Speed for UU, and he can be an effective Choice Band user thanks to his access to U-turn.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to Fearow's good Attack, awesome Speed, and access to U-turn, a Choice Band set is viable. Return is a very strong STAB move that does good damage to any Pokemon who doesn't resist it. Fearow doesn't learn Brave Bird, so Drill Peck is his best Flying-type attack, hitting Grass-, Bug-, and Fighting-types hard. U-turn is great for scouting, and is one of Fearow's few advantages over Dodrio. Quick Attack is helpful for finishing off faster Pokemon who are low on health. Pursuit can be used to trap Ghost- or Psychic-type Pokemon, but many of them can simply outspeed and KO Fearow.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes Fearow's offensive capabilities. A Jolly nature is preferred, as it lets Fearow outspeed important threats, such as max Speed Hitmonlee, Rotom, and Houndoom. An Adamant nature is also acceptable, however, as Fearow always appreciates the extra power. Choice Scarf can be used over Choice Band, since Fearow reaches 448 Speed with an Adamant nature, enough to outspeed most other Choice Scarf users. With a Choice Scarf, Fearow can outspeed and KO Sceptile, Alakazam, and Choice Scarf Adamant Hitmonlee. However, without a boost, Fearow lacks the power needed to KO many Pokemon, allowing them to take his hits and KO him in return.</p>

<p>Fearow has significant trouble getting past Rock-, Electric-, and Steel-types. For that reason, Donphan is a great teammate for Fearow, because he can KO Aggron and other Steel- and Rock-types with his STAB Earthquake. Donphan is also able to switch into Rock- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Fearow, while Fearow can destroy the Grass-types whom Donphan fears in return. Dugtrio is another option, since he can trap the Pokemon who give Fearow problems and KO them with Earthquake. Rhyperior and Torterra also make good partners, as they can easily set up with Rock Polish against most of Fearow's counters and proceed to sweep your opponent's team.</p>

<p>With Fearow's poor defenses and weakness to Stealth Rock, almost any neutral attack will OHKO him if he switches in on it when Stealth Rock is up. For that reason, Rapid Spin support is necessary. Hitmontop is a reliable Rapid Spinner, thanks to Foresight, and can take the Rock-type attacks directed at Fearow; Donphan is also a good option for this role. While Fearow hates Stealth Rock placed on his side of the field, he greatly appreciates entry hazards on the opponent's side. Donphan is again a great choice to supply this, as his excellent physical bulk gives him plenty of opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Rhyperior, Aggron, Omastar, and Uxie are great options too, thanks to their ability to set up entry hazards easily.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Fearow has a few more options, but he is usually outclassed by other Pokemon in these areas. He can run a Baton Pass set with Agility and Substitute, but Lopunny, Ambipom, Dodrio, and Gligar are all much better in that role. Offensively, Steel Wing is an option to hit Rock-types for super effective damage, but Fearow fails to deal respectable damage with it to Rhyperior and Regirock. Feint Attack or Assurance can be used for hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types, but most of them are hit just as hard by Fearow's other moves. Pluck, Aerial Ace, Sky Attack, and Fly are alternative Flying-type attacks that Fearow can use, but they are all outclassed by Drill Peck. Roost can be used to recover HP, but Fearow isn't really bulky enough to make use of it. Toxic and Attract are possible support options, and Mirror Move is interesting, though not altogether useful. Finally, Fearow has a few usable special attacks in Tri Attack, Heat Wave, and Hidden Power, but with Fearow's pitiful Special Attack stat, these moves are not recommended.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fearow has a lot of counters due to his poor defenses and lack of offensive power. Rock- and Steel-types, such as Registeel, Aggron, Steelix, Rhyperior, and Regirock, take minimal damage from Fearow's attacks and can KO him with ease. Aggron and Rhyperior can also use Rock Polish to boost their Speed while Fearow flees, turning into dangerous offensive threats at Fearow's expense. Donphan is also a decent counter, as he is quite bulky and can hit Fearow with Ice Shard and Stone Edge. Rotom is a great counter too, resisting Fearow's STAB attacks and being able to OHKO back with STAB Thunderbolt.</p>

<p>There are some frail and fast sweepers who cannot switch into Fearow, but if they come after a KO or predict a weak attack, can outspeed and KO Fearow if he isn't carrying a Choice Scarf. Examples of these Pokemon include Alakazam, Mismagius, Espeon, and Manectric. Fearow is also outsped and KOed by many common Choice Scarf users.</p>

<p>When holding a Choice Scarf, Fearow often lacks the power necessary to OHKO the opponent's Pokemon, and with Fearow's frailty, he will take heavy damage from any counterattack. Rotom and Moltres often carry Choice Scarves of their own, and will outspeed and OHKO Fearow unless he runs a Jolly nature.</p>
