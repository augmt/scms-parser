[Overview]

<p>Bastiodon, although possessing gargantuan defenses and access to many useful support moves including Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Taunt, has always been overlooked for a position on UU teams due to its lackluster offenses. Thanks to moves such as Metal Burst and Torment, however, Bastiodon can present a serious threat while simultaneously contributing to the team. It's not a very reliable option considering its grave 4x weaknesses to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks and low Speed, but it can hold its own given the proper support.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its amazing base defenses and access to an array of supporting moves, it seems as though Bastiodon was designed to play the role of a supporting Pokemon on a UU team. Not only can the prehistoric Pokemon set up the always-valuable Stealth Rock, it can also provide stall or balanced teams with Toxic support, maximizing the effectiveness of the team's strategy, as well as being an efficient phazer.</p>

<p>Rest is an alternative to Stealth Rock which can be used in conjunction with sandstorm support, making Bastiodon quite durable. Taunt is another valuable asset, as it prevents many bulky foes, like Miltank, from simply healing off Toxic damage, as well as stopping common foes, most notably Venusaur, from putting Bastiodon to sleep and setting up. Roar can be used to slowly chip away at an opponent's health with residual damage when entry hazards are up; it is also useful if you find yourself facing an opponent who has already set up. The final moveslot will hold Bastiodon's only attacking move and the decision of which one to use is based upon your preference; both Iron Head and Stone Edge are great STAB attacks, but since the latter is not very accurate, Rock Slide can be used instead of for better accuracy in exchange for less Base Power.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Leftovers and an Impish nature are used in tandem to increase Bastiodon's overall bulk and longevity in the battle as it will often be switching in repeatedly to check certain Pokemon. The EVs are used for a similar function as the nature: to increase Bastiodon's bulk while focusing on its special durability, as its physical defense is already very impressive. It should be noted, however, that you can alter the EVs to make Bastiodon slightly more offensive, as it may need the extra Attack investment due to its mediocre base 52 Attack stat.</p>

[SET]
name: Torment
move 1: Torment
move 2: Substitute / Toxic
move 3: Protect
move 4: Roar / Toxic
item: Leftovers
nature: Impish
evs: 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Def

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With excellent bulk, Bastiodon's massive base defenses, and access to moves such as Protect and Roar, Bastiodon can be turned into a fierce Torment user when given the proper support. The strategy of this set is simple; Torment an opponent to block their STAB or super effective move, follow up with a cycle of the other moves mentioned in the set, repeat until the foe's HP bar reaches 0%.</p>

<p>The decision between using Substitute or Toxic comes down to your personal preference. Although Substitute can act as a reliable barrier when one foe has fainted and another switches in, Toxic makes the entire Torment stall process faster by increasing residual damage. Protect is a staple on the set as it allows Bastiodon to regain health every turn through Leftovers while also being able to stack up more and more residual damage on the opposing Pokemon. The last move slot is given to Roar, which can be effectively used alongside entry hazards or simply for phazing; Toxic can also be fitted into this slot if you prefer its stalling capabilities over Roar's phazing ones.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The nature and EVs have been chosen to make Bastiodon as bulky as possible on both the physical and the special side, while also retaining a huge amount of HP. The EV spread and nature are malleable, allowing you to make Bastiodon more physically bulky if you so desire. Also, it should be noted that any user of Taunt will completely shut down this Bastiodon set as it relies solely on defeating enemies through the use of indirect damage.</p>

[SET]
name: Metal Burst
move 1: Metal Burst
move 2: Taunt
move 3: Stealth Rock / Earthquake
move 4: Earthquake / Stone Edge / Iron Head
item: Leftovers / Focus Sash
nature: Sassy
evs: 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Atk
ivs: 0 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Aside from Aggron and Dialga, Bastiodon is the only Pokemon who can learn the fearsome move Metal Burst, which is the equivalent of Mirror Coat and Counter except for both physical and special attacks. Bastiodon's natural defenses and awful Speed make it ideal for utilizing Metal Burst to take out opposing threats.</p>

<p>Taunt and Metal Burst are staples on the set as their combination forces the opposition to attack, which means Bastiodon can use Metal Burst to inflict 1.5x the damage caused by the incoming attack. Stealth Rock is mainly mentioned for support purposes. If you feel like Stealth Rock is unnecessary, an attacking move can be used instead. Since this set focuses primarily on the combination of Taunt and Metal Burst, it is very susceptible to users of Taunt. For this reason, the final moveslot is best filled by a move that causes direct damage. Earthquake can be a valuable asset as it hits many common threats in UU for super effective damage, while Stone Edge is also viable as it is boosted by STAB and hits Flying-types. Iron Head is another option, but compared to the two aforementioned moves, it is not recommended due to the low Base Power, even after STAB.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Leftovers along with a Sassy nature help increase Bastiodon's durability, allowing it to survive a wider array of attacks from more Pokemon and retaliate with Metal Burst, although it can use Focus Sash to defeat foes like Choice Band Hariyama and offensive Hitmontop who otherwise beat Bastiodon. The EVs are designed to maximize Bastiodon's bulk and make it more specially defensive, as it will need the extra EV investment when facing foes like Milotic and Houndoom. 0 Speed IVs and the Speed-reducing nature ensure that the opponent always gets to attack first, before Bastiodon uses Metal Burst.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Outside of the mentioned sets, Bastiodon doesn't have many other options to choose from. Metal Sound, Curse, and Rest can be utilized, but their viability is limited. Also, an all-out attacking set revolving around Curse, Metal Sound, and two attacking moves can be used, but due to Bastiodon's mediocre base 52 Attack stat and lack of a reliable recovery move, it is not recommended. For any of Bastiodon's sets, an EV spread of 252 HP / 68 Atk / 192 SpD can be used if you're intent on being able to break the Substitutes of Nasty Plot Mismagius and Sub-Charge Rotom.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Even with Bastiodon's immense defenses, Fighting-types like Hitmontop and Hariyama can cleanly 2HKO--in some cases even OHKO--Bastiodon after it has taken some residual damage. Similar to the aforementioned Fighting-types, bulky Ground-types also cause problems for Bastiodon with their super effective STAB attacks and immunity to sandstorm, a factor Bastiodon relies on to slowly wear down bulky foes. It should be noted, however, that when sending in a counter to face Bastiodon, you must beware of the possibility that Bastiodon may survive the attack and strike back with Metal Burst. Finally, any user of Taunt will be able to defeat the sets that lack an attacking move.</p>
