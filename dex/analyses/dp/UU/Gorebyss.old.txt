[Overview]

<p>Rain teams are a powerful force to be reckoned with in 4th Gen UU, and it's no accident that Gorebyss is a common feature on most of them. Its praiseworthy Special Attack and its ability to outspeed the entire tier in the rain make it a dangerous foe to face. Gorebyss can even function as a successful Baton Passer when rain is not in play. Despite less-than-stellar base HP and Speed stats, Gorebyss remains a serious threat for an unprepared team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With an admirable base 114 Special Attack stat and enough Speed to outpace any UU Pokemon with Swift Swim activated, this South Sea Pokemon makes an excellent rain sweeper. Hydro Pump is Gorebyss's most powerful STAB attack, capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing almost anything that lacks a resistance or immunity to it. Surf is also an option for more accuracy, though it lacks the raw power of a rain-boosted Hydro Pump. Ice Beam complements Gorebyss's Water STAB nicely, landing super effective hits on the annoyingly ubiquitous Grass-types. Hidden Power Grass allows Gorebyss to cut through opposing Water-types, creating nigh-unresisted coverage in UU. In the last slot, Psychic is used to eliminate Toxicroak, Poliwrath, and Qwilfish, the former two of whom sport abilities that give them immunity to Water and would otherwise create endless amounts of trouble for a Rain Dance team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>The current EV spread maximizes Gorebyss's potent Special Attack, and maximum Speed ensures that Gorebyss will always outspeed Jolly Swellow and anything slower with Rain Dance in play. Life Orb gives Gorebyss the power it desires and the versatility to switch moves, but Choice Specs is also a noteworthy option, as a Choice Specs rain-boosted Hydro Pump hits extremely hard, capable of 2HKOing Chansey and Milotic with just Stealth Rock support.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Gorebyss's movepool is extremely shallow, which leaves this fish high and dry with few remaining options. What little that it does get, however, should be used in the last slot in lieu of Psychic. Rain Dance can be used on a Life Orb set to prolong Gorebyss's sweep even after the previous bout of rain has ended. Baton Pass can be used on a Choice Specs set to scout the opponent's rain checks before committing Gorebyss to an attack. Aqua Tail can be used with Life Orb and a Rash nature if you really fear Chansey; Gorebyss will be able to 2HKO Chansey after Stealth Rock, though it's probably more efficient to just blast her with Specs Hydro Pump anyway.</p>

<p>This Gorebyss requires the use of entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock, to function to its maximum potential. Uxie and Mesprit can both set up Stealth Rock and provide Rain Dance support, making them excellent partners for Gorebyss. Registeel can do the same, while Gorebyss scares away the Ground- and Fire-type Pokemon that are the bane of Registeel's existence. Other rain sweepers are also excellent teammates. Ludicolo deserves a special mention because it can defeat Milotic, the most troublesome rain check in UU.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set lets the pink menace take a more supportive role as a Baton Passer. Although Gorebyss has a plethora of moves it could pass, Agility is the most effective, allowing a teammate to reach blistering levels of Speed for a lightning-fast sweep. Substitute safeguards Gorebyss and the Baton Pass recipient from harmful status effects, in addition to providing cover from incoming attacks. Finally, Surf ensures that Gorebyss isn't rendered a complete deadweight by Taunt, since even with only a meager investment in Special Attack it still hits decently hard.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Gorebyss's EV spread allows it to outpace positive nature base 80 Speed Choice Scarf Pokemon after an Agility. This ensures that it can create a Substitute or Baton Pass against Choice Scarf Venusaur without worrying about being tranquilized by Sleep Powder.</p>

<p>In addition to Agility, Gorebyss could also potentially pass Iron Defense, Amnesia, or Aqua Ring to a suitable recipient. The latter is worth noting because Gorebyss is the only Pokemon in UU capable of Baton Passing Aqua Ring. Pinch Berries, such as Liechi or Petaya, could be used in conjunction with Substitute to send offensive boosts along with Agility.</p>

<p>Baton Pass Gorebyss requires two types of Pokemon: lures so it can switch in and set up, and recipients to pass its boosts to. Grass-types such as Venusaur and Tangrowth can fulfill both roles, since they draw in Fire- and Ice-type attacks, which are resisted by Gorebyss, and also resist Gorebyss's Electric- and Grass-type weaknesses. Other Baton Passers, such as Leafeon, Gligar, and Ambipom, also make good teammates, as they can form a Baton Pass chain for Gorebyss to fit into.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Gorebyss has very few options outside of these specific niches. Turning Gorebyss into an Agility sweeper is possible, but it lacks the raw power of the rain sweeper, and will still fail to outpace Choice Scarf Rotom. On the Baton Pass set, passing Aqua Ring, Iron Defense, or Amnesia instead of Substitute is possible, but it is an inferior option. Shadow Ball and Signal Beam round off Gorebyss's special movepool, but they are highly inferior options to its other attacks.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>When utilizing the Swift Swim Sweeper set, Gorebyss's true counters are sparse. Specially Defensive Milotic can work if Gorebyss is carrying a Life Orb, as it can cripple Gorebyss with Toxic or KO it with Hidden Power Grass while healing off damage with Recover. Toxicroak also poses a problem if it switches in on anything other than Psychic, as it can KO a weakened Gorebyss with Sucker Punch. Ludicolo is a dire threat, since Gorebyss has nothing that can even hit Ludicolo for super effective damage (outside of Bounce), while Ludicolo will always OHKO back with Energy Ball. One of Gorebyss's greatest fears are priority moves, which can quickly wear it down to KO range. Rotom, the most common UU Choice Scarf user, is also one of Gorebyss's most common checks, since it will always outspeed Gorebyss with a Timid nature. Positive nature Choice Scarf Venusaur and Electrode do likewise, while Registeel can survive Gorebyss's onslaught and cripple it with Thunder Wave.</p> 

<p>The counters list for the Baton Pass set is much less specific. Phazers can cause problems, as they mess up the Baton Pass chain and negate Gorebyss's boosts. Haze Milotic or Weezing also stop Gorebyss from doing anything productive. Taunt prevents Gorebyss from passing on its boosts or setting up, leaving it a veritable sitting duck, well, fish.</p>
