[Overview]

<p>Swalot has always been looked upon as a lesser version of Muk, as with its lower HP and Special Defense stats, along with certain key moves missing from its moveset, it is quite easy to make this mistake. However, it does have more balanced defenses and a greater supporting movepool with access to Encore, which makes it a much better mixed wall than the purple slime could ever hope to be. Although its lack of resistances make it hard to wall certain foes, the Purple Bag Pokemon is an underrated threat that can whip up a storm in UU.</p>

[SET]
name: Support
move 1: Encore
move 2: Yawn
move 3: Pain Split
move 4: Sludge Bomb / Ice Beam
item: Leftovers
nature: Calm 
ability: Liquid Ooze
evs: 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although Swalot has competition from Muk and Weezing as a Poison-type wall, it manages to separate itself by being the only one of the three to have access to Encore. Encore allows Swalot to effectively stop setup sweepers and certain walls from using Swalot as setup fodder. Yawn is used to effectively cripple any switch-ins, and also stops the majority of setup sweepers indifferent to Encore. Pain Split is Swalot's only way of recovering health outside of Rest, and although it is rather unreliable, Swalot's low HP stat usually makes up for this. The last moveslot is up to personal preference, although STAB Sludge Bomb is usually the better choice, Ice Beam can be used to hit dual Grass-types like Venusaur harder.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Leftovers is basically mandatory on any wall for extra recovery, though Black Sludge can be used if Swalot is using Sticky Hold as its ability. The given EVs maximize Swalot's defensive prowess, while the small amount of HP EVs make Pain Split much more effective. The nature is chosen to complement its bulk on the special side, whilst Liquid Ooze is the preferred ability to stop SubSeeders in their tracks.</p>

<p>This set highly appreciates the presence of entry hazards, as both Encore and Yawn will cause many switches when used together. Toxic Spikes are highly recommended in this case as it allows Swalot to defeat Water-types more easily. As for teammates, Swalot appreciates Pokemon that can cover both its Psychic- and Ground-type weaknesses. Slowbro is the most effective candidate against Ground-types, as it can hit back hard with STAB Surf, but Spiritomb is a better option against Psychic-types, turning those counters into setup fodder. In general, setup sweepers appreciate how Swalot can cripple other setup sweepers and walls with Encore.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest
move 2: Sleep Talk
move 3: Sludge Bomb
move 4: Earthquake
item: Leftovers
nature: Sassy
ability: Liquid Ooze / Sticky Hold
evs: 252 HP / 144 Def / 112 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Swalot has higher HP and Special Defense stats than Weezing, thus creating a niche of being a Poison-type that is bulky on both ends. These attributes allow Swalot to run a viable RestTalk set. Sludge Bomb is for STAB and allows Swalot to hit other Pokemon for a reasonable amount of damage. Earthquake is required to hit Steel-types that are immune to Swalot's STAB, and often catches many switch-ins off guard.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Swalot walls any specially-oriented version of the versatile Venusaur 100% with this set. Leftovers is the preferred item on any wall, as it provides longetivity, although if Sticky Hold is the chosen ability, Black Sludge can be used as an alternate recovery option. The EVs give Swalot good defenses on both sides, and a Sassy nature complements this whilst allowing Swalot to have a slightly more powerful mixed moveset. Liquid Ooze is the preferred ability as it allows Swalot to wall Leech Seed users more effectively, but Sticky Hold is also effective to prevent Trick.</p>

<p>This set is built for survivability, and as such, Wish support is highly recommended. Entry hazards also work well with this set as many Pokemon will be forced to switch in and out, or risk being hit by one of its high-power moves. Bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Venusaur, Leafeon, and to a lesser extent, Meganium are effective against the Ground-types that wall Swalot. Hitmontop can defeat Steel-types such as Registeel and Steelix that like to come in on this set, and can also get rid of entry hazards with Rapid Spin, which goes a long way in adding to this set's survivability.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Stockpile can be used to boost Swalot's defenses to ridiculous levels, but it is pretty outclassed by other Pokemon, and not just Muk either, in that role. Toxic can be used to help wear down bulky Pokemon into the KO range, and is especially effective against bulky Water-types. Counter can be used to screw over physical sweepers such as Donphan, but can also be used in conjunction with a Shuca Berry to net a surprise KO. Explosion can be used to try and faint something before Swalot faints itself. Curse can also replace Sludge Bomb on the RestTalk set in conjunction with a Careful nature to create a physical boosting tank.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Gastrodon and Quagsire wall the purple blob well due to their typing, but should be wary as Yawn and Toxic can cripple them. Scyther can come in on anything but Ice Beam and proceed to KO Swalot. Kabutops can use Swalot as setup fodder, but only if Swalot lacks Earthquake. Steelix and Registeel can take pretty much anything Swalot can throw at them and bring it down with Earthquake, but both should be wary of Yawn on the switch. Grumpig and Hypno are decent but they cannot take repeated Earthquakes too well.</p>
