[Overview] 

<p>Corsola is a very poor Pokemon. She has an amazing movepool, but her unfortunate typing and terrible stats result in her being outclassed by the vast majority of UU. She does have some merit as a defensive Pokemon with access to Recover, usable defenses, and Natural Cure as her ability, but if you are in the market for a sturdy defender, there will always be a better option than Corsola.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Corsola generally isn't a Pokemon you'd want to use competitively, but if you choose to do so, this set is her best option. She has usable defensive stats, as well as access to Recover, an important asset that Omastar lacks. Corsola also resists Fire-, Flying-, Ice-, and Normal-type attacks, making her a decent supporter. Stealth Rock and Toxic allow Corsola to support her teammates, while Natural Cure allows Corsola to absorb status moves aimed at her teammates, as it removes any status inflicted on her upon switching out.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Corsola can run Explosion with a Relaxed nature to go out with a bang, hopefully removing one of the opposing Pokemon from the game in the process; however, her poor Attack stat means that even Explosion does not deal much damage. Sandstorm support from Hippopotas and max EVs in Special Defense may be helpful to turn Corsola into somewhat of a specially defensive "tank"; however, the types she resists are normally physically based, therefore investing in Defense is more suitable to Corsola's typing. Finally, a spinblocker is neccessary to prevent Stealth Rock from being removed from the field, making Mismagius and Spirtomb good partners.</p>

<p>Bulky Water-types, such as Milotic and Slowbro, cause problems for Corsola, so packing an Electric-type like Magneton or Rotom would be smart. Venusaur and Cacturne are also good teammates, hitting bulky Water-types super effectively or draining their health with Leech Seed. Toxic Spikes are also helpful, slowly wearing down bulky Pokemon with increasing poison damage if you can get both layers down.</p>

<p>Fire-types such as Moltres and Arcanine are helpful, as they can blast through Grass-types like Venusaur, who can otherwise cause huge problems for Corsola. RestTalk Arcanine is an excellent choice due to his ability to switch into Sleep Power with ease. Mixed Blaziken is another excellent choice who is able to destroy both physical and special walls. Finally, Altaria can switch into Grass-type attacks with her 4x resistance and set up with Dragon Dance.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Due to Corsola's poor stats, she is unable to use her wide movepool, which is a shame as she has some pretty nifty options. Calm Mind can be used alongside Power Gem, Surf, and Earth Power, though Corsola lacks the Speed and power necessary to be effective with such a set. Choice items may be utilized to boost her low attacking stats, but this ultimately restricts her even further. Mirror Coat is available to surprise special attackers, though Corsola isn't likely to survive any sort of hit. Reflect and Light Screen can be used along with Recover, helping Corsola support her teammates. Curse may be used with max Special Defense, though all Grass-types on the opposing team must be eliminated for such a set to succeed. Aqua Ring can be used to restore small amounts of health; however, Recover is much more reliable. Amnesia can raise Corsola's Special Defense, and she also has Rock Polish to boost her Speed. Rock Blast can be used with Hustle, dishing out multiple hits and breaking Focus Sashes, though Hustle lowers its accuracy to a horrible 60%. Endeavor and Sucker Punch are usable with a Focus Sash, but this strategy is unreliable. Finally, Corsola can utilize a Rindo Berry to weaken Grass-type attacks.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Corsola is beaten by almost everything in the game, barring Luvdisc, though Grass-types are the most threatening. Basically, any Pokemon who doesn't mind being poisoned and can hit Corsola super effectively is a counter; bulky Water-types with Hidden Power Grass, Electric-types like Rotom, and Fighting-types like Hariyama are just a few examples.</p>
