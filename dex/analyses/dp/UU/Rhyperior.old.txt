[Overview]

<p>Rhyperior is one of the most terrifying Pokemon in the metagame due to its excellent coverage and monstrous Attack stat. Rhyperior also boasts one of the most impressive HP stats, as well as excellent physical Defense, making it a great physical check. Rhyperior's ability (Solid Rock) is also quite impressive, as it allows Rhyperior to take some super effective attacks that other Pokemon could only dream of taking, such as Blaziken's Superpower.</p>

<p>Rhyperior's main problem is that it has very low Special Defense and two very common 4x weaknesses. Furthermore, these attacks are common on the more defensive Pokemon with whom Rhyperior already has trouble. However, when you give Rhyperior the needed support, it can be a huge asset to your team. If you're looking for a bulky Pokemon who can sweep late game, set up Stealth Rock, or simply just hit hard, try Rhyperior.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rhyperior is one of the most fearsome Pokemon in UU with its monstrous Attack stat. This makes it quite easy for Rhyperior to force switches, giving it time to set up Stealth Rock or Substitute. Once Stealth Rock is in play, Rhyperior makes a great check to almost every physical attacker, as long as they don't have a strong super effective STAB attack. Earthquake and Stone Edge provide Rhyperior with nearly perfect coverage. Add Megahorn to that, and there isn't much that can safely switch into Rhyperior. Rock Blast can be used over Stone Edge to deal with pesky Substitute users such as Moltres, Articuno, and Mismagius.</p>

<p>The EVs are very particular since Rhyperior needs to function in a lot of situations. The 84 Speed EVs give Rhyperior the ability to outpace no Speed base 50s, such as Azumarill and Donphan. The 140 HP EVs gives Rhyperior an HP stat of 406, which allows it to create five 101 HP Substitutes from full health. Attack is maximized, and the remaining EVs are put in Defense to make the most of Rhyperior's Solid Rock ability. If using Substitute, Rhyperior can use 164 Speed EVs so that it outpaces minimum Speed Weezing, allowing it to Substitute before Weezing can use Will-O-Wisp. This results in a final spread of 140 HP / 204 Atk / 164 Spe.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set is great at beating Rapid Spin users who try to come in and Spin away Rhyperior's Stealth Rock. Donphan and Hitmontop are 2HKOed by Earthquake with Spikes support, Cloyster is taken care of by Stone Edge, and Claydol is hit hard by Megahorn. This means Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Cloyster who set up Spikes appreciate Rhyperior's presence on a team. They work especially well since with Spikes support, Rhyperior can 2HKO Blastoise, who is another common Rapid Spinner. Cloyster and Qwilfish can also set up on bulky Water-types such as Milotic who threaten Rhyperior.</p>

<p>Rhyperior is also a stellar physical wall, especially when against Pokemon without a super effective STAB attack. Using a specially defensive Altaria with Rhyperior works as an effective walling duo, since Altaria resists Water-, Fighting-, Ground-, and Grass-type attacks that would normally destroy Rhyperior, while Rhyperior can take Rock-type attacks and any hard-hitting physical attacker. Ice-type is left uncovered, so using something like Azumarill is beneficial as well.</p>

move 4: Megahorn
item: Leftovers
nature: Adamant
ability: Solid Rock
evs: 132 HP / 212 Atk / 164 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set capitalizes on Rhyperior's ability to create 101 HP Substitutes, turning Rhyperior into an effective stallbreaking tank. The idea when using SubPerior is to switch into a Pokemon that poses little threat, such as Chansey, Registeel, or Swellow, create a Substitute as it switches out, and proceed to nail the switch-in with the appropriate coverage move. Stone Edge and Earthquake are Rhyperior's strongest STAB moves and create the QuakeEdge combo, which is resisted only by Torterra and Claydol in UU. Megahorn rounds off the set, nailing the aforementioned Pokemon for super effective damage, as well as piercing through Uxie and Exeggutor.</p>

<p>SubPerior's main goals are to force switches, get free hits on Pokemon when behind a Substitute, and punch holes through the opposing team to open a sweep for a partner. The beauty of using SubPerior over Rhyperior's other sets is that Substitute blocks Will-O-Wisp from pesky opponents such as Spiritomb and Weezing, and it protects Rhyperior from mispredictions should you incorrectly guess the opposing Pokemon's set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread is designed to allow Rhyperior to create 101 HP Substitutes and to outrun minimum Speed Weezing and Clefable, with the rest of the EVs dumped into Attack. While an alternative offensive spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe can be used to put more pressure on the opponent, using such a spread takes away Rhyperior's ability to create 101 HP Substitutes and freely set up on Seismic Toss Chansey and Clefable. Leftovers is the recommended item to regain the health lost from creating Substitutes. Life Orb can be used, though Rhyperior's HP will be quickly drained from the combination of Substitute, Life Orb, and potential entry hazard damage. Ice Punch or Avalanche can be used over Megahorn for a reliable way to smack Grass-types for super effective damage; however, the lost damage output on Uxie and Mesprit is highly disappointing.</p>

<p>Milotic is a hard stop to this set, as Rhyperior lacks the power to 2HKO it with Earthquake. Venusaur and offensive Lanturn therefore make great partners due to their ability to plow right through Milotic. Venusaur also has the added benefit of absorbing Toxic Spikes and Toxic, which completely ruin this set's effectiveness, as well as resisting any Grass- and Fighting-type attacks aimed at Rhyperior. In return, Rhyperior walks all over Chansey, Clefable, and Registeel, and should Rhyperior safely set up a Substitute, it can eliminate Altaria and Moltres with ease.</p>

<p>This set absolutely loves paralysis support, as it allows Rhyperior to create Substitutes against faster foes, such as Ambipom, Kangaskhan, and Scyther, and possibly proceed to sweep the opponent's team. Rhyperior has an easy time OHKOing paralyzed Venusaur, Moltres, Sceptile, and Omastar, all of whom normally outpace it, with the appropriate attacking move. Awesome teammates to provide paralysis include Slowbro, Slowking, Registeel, and Uxie. Registeel and Uxie can also provide Stealth Rock support, while Slowbro and Slowking can utilize Trick Room to aid Rhyperior against faster, non-paralyzed foes. Finally, Rhyperior enjoys Wish and cleric support to keep it healthy and free of status. Teammates that can provide said support are Clefable, Leafeon, and Vileplume.</p> 

[SET]
name: Rock Polish
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: Megahorn
move 4: Rock Polish
item: Life Orb
ability: Solid Rock
nature: Jolly
evs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Rhyperior is often unable to pull off sweeps because of its horrible Speed; however, Rock Polish attempts to fix that problem. With a Jolly nature, Rhyperior will outrun all unboosted Pokemon in UU minus Electrode. Boasting an Attack stat of 379 (not including Life Orb), Rhyperior will still hit incredibly hard. The premise of this set is to use Rhyperior's incredibly hard-hitting attacks to weaken its counters and then sweep late game with a Rock Polish boost. The biggest difference between the previous set and this set (besides Rock Polish) is that it uses Life Orb. With a Life Orb boost, Earthquake 2HKOes bulky Pokemon such as Blastoise and Milotic as long as Stealth Rock is in play. Megahorn now comes close to OHKOing Claydol, while also 2HKOing Tangrowth and Slowbro.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>An alternative item (and strategy) for this Rhyperior set is to use a Passho Berry. Passho Berry allows Rhyperior to take an extra Water-type attack from Pokemon such as Blastoise or Milotic. This means that you don't have to rely on weakening them as much. Passho Berry also protects you from Aqua Jet, which is used by Azumarill, Kabutops, and Feraligatr. However, without a Life Orb, Rhyperior isn't going to have as much of an easy time sweeping, and it also loses important KOs on Milotic, Blastoise, Claydol, and Slowbro.</p>

<p>This Rhyperior set benefits from Stealth Rock and Spikes support more than most of the other sets would, since it's pulling off a late game sweep. Cloyster is a good candidate to set up Spikes, since it can set up on the bulky Water-types who will come in on Rhyperior. Qwilfish is also a good candidate since it possesses neutrality to Grass-type attacks in addition to its Water-type resistance. Rhyperior also appreciates Reflect and Light Screen support since these barriers allow it to set up quite easily while also being able to brush off most priority attacks.</p>

<p>Besides screens, Stealth Rock, and Spikes, Rhyperior really appreciates the removal of certain Choice Scarf and priority users, since they will easily outpace Rhyperior even after a Rock Polish boost. Venusaur is a major threat to Rhyperior since it threatens to OHKO with its STAB Leaf Storm. Having a Pokemon such as Moltres who can easily dispose of these Choice Scarf users is very beneficial for Rhyperior. There are also many Pokemon who carry priority moves that halt Rhyperior's sweep. Vacuum Wave and Aqua Jet in particular cause problems for Rhyperior since they are both super effective, and Vacuum Wave hits Rhyperior's much weaker Special Defense stat, while Rhyperior has a 4x weakness to Aqua Jet. Vacuum Wave is usually only seen on Pokemon such as Toxicroak and Blaziken, and Dugtrio is a perfect candidate to take them out. Aqua Jet is a little tougher, but Moltres is a great candidate again to lure out these Water-types and hit them hard with Hidden Power. Magmortar and Blaziken can also work, hitting the Aqua Jet users hard with Thunderbolt and Superpower respectively.</p>

[SET]
name: Tank
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge / Rock Blast
move 3: Megahorn
move 4: Stealth Rock / Roar / Rest
item: Leftovers
ability: Solid Rock
nature: Adamant
evs: 244 HP / 16 Atk / 248 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is Rhyperior's most defensive set and focuses on wearing the opponent down and checking prominent threats. With a monstrous HP stat of 432 and Special Defense stat of 312 (with sandstorm active), Rhyperior will be an absolute pain to take down. The EVs are fairly simple: HP is almost maxed until the last obtainable Leftovers number, and then 16 EVs are put into Attack to get the stat jump. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense to take special hits better. Rhyperior will be able to take quite a beating from special attacks with these EVs and sandstorm.</p>

<p>Earthquake and Stone Edge (or Rock Blast, which can be used to hit Substitute users) give Rhyperior excellent coverage. Megahorn hits everything else that Rock and Ground don't hit, such as Claydol. Even with just 16 Attack EVs, Rhyperior will still hit hard with its 352 Attack stat. The move that works best for your team should be used in the last slot. Rhyperior is a great Stealth Rock user since it forces switches. This also makes it a great entry hazard abuser with Roar, meaning your opponent will take two rounds of residual damage if they switch. If you aren't using (Toxic) Spikes, and if you don't need a Pokemon to set up Stealth Rock, then Rest is a solid choice. Rest allows Rhyperior to heal and rid itself of any status ailments.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set really only functions with sandstorm support, which means Hippopotas is a necessary evil. With Roar, Rhyperior really benefits from Pokemon who can set up Spikes reliably. Cloyster is an excellent choice for this job since it resists Water-type attacks aimed at Rhyperior. Qwilfish is also an exceptional teammate for Rhyperior since it can set up Spikes and resists Water- and Fighting-type attacks. As a bonus, it also only takes neutral damage from Grass-type attacks. Rhyperior also benefits from Toxic Spikes, which both of the listed Pokemon can provide as well.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Stone Edge
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Megahorn
move 4: Rock Blast / Aqua Tail
item: Choice Band
ability: Solid Rock
nature: Adamant
evs: 92 HP / 252 Atk / 164 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to break down Rhyperior's usual counters with its Choice Band boosted attacks. Rhyperior can switch into many different attacks because of its impressive bulk, and it can OHKO many common walls such as Omastar and Steelix. On top of this, Rhyperior has immunity to Thunder Wave and shrugs off Pokemon like Registeel's attacks, unlike Aggron, for example, who is easily 2HKOed by Registeel's Earthquake. Unlike the other sets, this set uses Stone Edge as its main attack. This is because being locked into Earthquake usually ends up in a bad situation, considering there are so many Pokemon who are immune to it. Stone Edge has no immunities, and even Pokemon who resist it take quite a bit of damage from it. Aqua Tail and Rock Blast can be used in the last slot as situational moves. Donphan and other Rhyperior are hit by Aqua Tail harder than STAB Earthquake. Rock Blast is a great move for countering Substitute abusing Pokemon.</p>

<p>This set's EV spread is specifically made to outpace minimum Speed versions of Weezing and Clefable. Attack is then maximized and the remaining EVs are dumped into HP.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The option of Aqua Tail over Rock Blast is simply personal preference. Rock Blast allows you to absolutely destroy SubRoost variants of Moltres and Articuno, as well as nailing Pokemon such as Substitute Mismagius. Aqua Tail will hit Donphan harder than Earthquake (although Earthquake 2HKOes anyway) and will also do major damage to other Rhyperior.</p>

<p>While you may be tempted to fire off Earthquakes at every given chance, that is not the best plan when using Rhyperior. Rhyperior's main attack on this set is Stone Edge, especially for early in the game before you know your opponent's team. The reasoning behind this is that no Pokemon is immune to Rock-type attacks, and when you are in a metagame with Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Mismagius, Moltres, Swellow, and Scyther, you definitely don't want to be forced to switch out against them. This especially applies for Scyther and Swellow since Rhyperior is likely your team's only Flying-type resistance. Once you've taken out the Pokemon who can set up on Ground-type attacks, you are free to use Earthquake, which is always bad news for your opponent. This isn't to say that you should never use Earthquake before your opponent's Pokemon are fainted because hitting Pokemon who wall Stone Edge on the switch with a STAB Earthquake can turn the tide of the match as it will usually OHKO that Pokemon. Stone Edge is simply meant to be used as your main attack.</p>

<p>This Rhyperior set is an excellent early-game hard-hitter since very few Pokemon can stand up to its onslaught of powerful physical attacks. The fact that only a few Pokemon can take a STAB attack from Rhyperior makes it an excellent lure for bulky Pokemon. Rhyperior can also usually OHKO these Pokemon with its other STAB move. For example, Steelix can switch in and shrug off Rhyperior's Stone Edge. However, if it switches into Earthquake, it will be easily OHKOed. This helps Pokemon such as Swellow and Scyther, because without Steelix in their way, they should have a much easier time sweeping.</p>

<p>Rhyperior also greatly benefits from Gravity and paralysis support. With Gravity and paralysis support, Rhyperior can plow through most teams with its powerful STAB Earthquake, since no Pokemon are immune to it. Paralysis support in particular helps Rhyperior sweep late game, since otherwise it will likely be forced out by something faster. Pokemon like Clefable and Porygon2 work quite well with Rhyperior because they have access to both Gravity and Thunder Wave.</p>

<p>Rhyperior will also definitely need some defensive support since it is a Choiced Pokemon, meaning it will likely KO something and then be forced out. The two most obvious attack-types that will be used on Rhyperior are Water and Grass. This makes any sort of Grass-type Pokemon an excellent teammate for Rhyperior, especially since as a bonus, they can take Ground-type attacks aimed at Rhyperior as well.</p>

[SET]
name: Trick Room
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge
move 3: Megahorn
move 4: Swords Dance / Aqua Tail
item: Life Orb
ability: Solid Rock
nature: Brave
evs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 Def
ivs: 0 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set focuses on abusing Rhyperior's horrible Speed, monstrous Attack, and excellent coverage under the effects of Trick Room. After Trick Room is used, Rhyperior will usually be the "fastest" Pokemon on the field, meaning the opponent needs to survive a 100 Base Power STAB attack before counter-attacking. Additionally, since Rhyperior is so bulky, it can set up Swords Dance and boast an Attack stat of 832, OHKOing the entire metagame.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With horrible Speed and an immensely high Attack stat, it is no surprise that Rhyperior is one of the deadliest Trick Room sweepers. The fact that it has perfect coverage from Earthquake, Stone Edge, and Megahorn add to Rhyperior's sweeping capabilities. Swords Dance is a good move to use in the fourth slot since Rhyperior is likely to be bulky enough to pull one off and still have three turns to sweep. After a Swords Dance, Rhyperior will pretty much OHKO the entire tier, and it's no surprise since it will have 832 Attack under its belt. Aqua Tail can be used if you don't like losing a turn of Trick Room to set up Swords Dance, since it hits Donphan and other Rhyperior harder than your other attacks.</p>

<p>248 HP EVs ensures that Rhyperior can get an extra attack out of Life Orb while also giving it significant bulk. Attack is maximized to increase Rhyperior's sweeping potential, and the remaining eight EVs are dumped in Defense. A Brave nature is recommended since with a lower Speed, Rhyperior will be "faster" in Trick Room.</p>

<p>A couple reliable Trick Room set-up Pokemon are needed for this set to function. Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Slowking make great teammates for Rhyperior because of their ability to reliably set up Trick Room. Alakazam is also quite an effective teammate since it can set up Reflect and Light Screen before it uses Trick Room. It can even set up Gravity if you wish. Reflect and Light Screen are important because they allow Rhyperior to almost guarantee itself a Swords Dance, meaning it has up to four turns of straight OHKOing the opponent.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Toxic can be used over Stealth Rock or Megahorn on the sandstorm or Standard set. With Rhyperior's switch-ins never being Steel- or Poison-types, it will be able to spread Toxic quite effectively.</p>

<p>A RestTalk set is also viable if you want to counter Pokemon such as Arcanine who rely on Will-O-Wisp to cripple Rhyperior. With sandstorm support, Rhyperior will be especially hard to take down. However, this is better left to Pokemon such as Regirock or Registeel who don't have those brutal 4x weaknesses and can utilize Curse with more desirable results.</p>

<p>Most Rhyperior sets will want to have maximum Attack or at least close to it. The defensive set is an exception to this since it wants to boost its defenses as high as possible.</p>

<p>Rhyperior needs to run 128 Speed to outspeed Omastar, but you can drop down to 84 to just outspeed Donphan, Registeel, Tangrowth, and other base 50s. With max Speed and a Jolly nature, Rhyperior can outpace minimum Speed Blastoise and tie with the no Speed base 80s before a Rock Polish. After a Rock Polish, it will outpace the whole metagame minus Electrode and the faster Scarfers. A Brave nature with minimum Speed is ideal for Trick Room teams, however, since Rhyperior will be one of the "fastest" Trick Room sweepers with its Speed that low.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Blastoise can switch into most Rhyperior quite easily and OHKO it with Surf. Defensive Grass-types such as Meganium, Leafeon, and Tangrowth also work quite well, but they need to be wary of Megahorn. Claydol and Torterra are excellent counters as well, since they can easily switch into Rhyperior on any of its STAB attacks. However, similarly to Grass-types, they need to watch out for Megahorn.</p>

<p>After a Rock Polish, lots of would-be revenge killers such as Sceptile are outsped, so carrying a faster revenge killer is a good idea. Pokemon such as Azumarill, Kabutops, Blaziken, and Toxicroak are all viable revenge killers due to their super effective priority attacks. Choice Scarf users with Water- or Grass-type attacks also work quite well, as long as they are faster than neutral base 80 Speed Pokemon.</p>
