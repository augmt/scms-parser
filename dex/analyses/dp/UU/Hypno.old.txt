[Overview]

<p>No matter how hard Hypno tries to distinguish itself, it will always be compared to fellow Psychic-types such as Alakazam, Uxie, and Mesprit. The former has high base Special Attack and Speed stats, making it a superior attacker, while the pixies have Stealth Rock and U-turn in their arsenal, distinguishing themselves as better supporters. However, Hypno has some qualities that its competition lacks: Wish, Baton Pass, and Insomnia. Wish allows Hypno to be a great team supporter, while Baton Pass makes Hypno a deadly boost passer. Insomnia rounds out Hypno's advantages, allowing it to switch into sleep-inducing moves for free. Combine these features with an excellent movepool and great defensive stats, and you'll find that Hypno is a good support Pokemon that's capable of holding a team together.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its great support movepool, it is almost impossible to not use Hypno in a supporting role. Hypno's great defensive stats, resistances to Psychic- and Fighting-type moves, and immunity to sleep allow it to switch in rather easily. Wish is Hypno's main way of supporting the team, restoring the HP of Hypno and its teammates. Seismic Toss inflicts reliable damage, while Thunder Wave paralyzes any non-Ground-type sweeper that attempts to set up on Hypno. Finally, Protect allows Hypno to scout out the opponent, as well as providing Hypno the opportunity to safely recover HP with Wish. Psychic can be used over Seismic Toss or Thunder Wave to deal with Fighting- and Poison-types, although it won't hit too hard due to the lack of EV investment and Hypno's low base Special Attack.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs and nature give Hypno enough bulk to deal with both physical and special attackers, while Leftovers adds to Hypno's longevity. Clefable makes a great partner for this set, as it can absorb incoming status thanks to Magic Guard and remove status with Heal Bell. Additionally, Clefable is immune to Ghost-type attacks, and lures in Fighting-types for Hypno to switch in on. However, Taunters such as Ambipom render this set useless, leaving Hypno with no choice but to switch out. Mismagius is the most dangerous Taunter because it is immune to Seismic Toss and can set up with Nasty Plot or Calm Mind on a predicted switch. Also, Rhyperior can switch into Thunder Wave, easily set up a Substitute if Hypno lacks Psychic, and proceed to severely damage your team.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Nasty Plot / Calm Mind
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Baton Pass
move 4: Substitute
item: Leftovers
ability: Insomnia
nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With access to boosting moves and Baton Pass, Hypno can try to set up a teammate for a sweep. The first slot is up to you, as some Pokemon do better with Nasty Plot boosts than Calm Mind boosts, and vice versa. Psychic is the obligatory attacking move, and can dent opposing Pokemon when Hypno has enough boosts. Baton Pass allows Hypno to accomplish its main goal of giving its boosts to a teammate. Substitute gives Hypno time to boost up and use Baton Pass, and can even be Baton Passed to further support the team. You might believe that Wish would work as an option over Substitute; sadly, Wish and Baton Pass are illegal together.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Hypno's EV spread gives it enough bulk to successfully pass its boosts without getting KOed. A good partner for this Hypno is Houndoom, which can easily defeat Ghost-types that threaten Hypno. As an added bonus, Houndoom also appreciates being passed Nasty Plot or Calm Mind boosts. Lanturn and Mismagius also love Calm Mind boosts, and, if given enough boosts and the opportunity to do so, can sweep a team without much effort. However, this Hypno also has its fair share of counters. Spiritomb is immune to Psychic, threatens to KO Hypno with STAB Dark Pulse and Pursuit, and can use Will-O-Wisp on the switch-in. Absol also threatens Hypno with STAB Pursuit and Night Slash, while also being able to set up with Swords Dance on the switch.</p>

[SET]
name: Nasty Plot
move 1: Nasty Plot
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Grass Knot
move 4: Baton Pass
item: Leftovers
nature: Modest
evs: 168 HP / 220 SpA / 120 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Hypno's good defensive stats allow it to pass boosts effectively, it can also keep them for itself. With the right EV investment, Hypno can surprise many opponents that believe the boosts are destined for another Pokemon. Nasty Plot doubles Hypno's Special Attack, allowing it to quickly gear up for a sweep. Psychic is Hypno's main attacking move, gaining STAB on top of its decent Base Power. Grass Knot provides nice coverage alongside Psychic, hitting many of the Pokemon that commonly switch into Psychic for heavy damage. Baton Pass allows Hypno to escape quickly, while also giving its boosts to another teammate to sweep.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Houndoom makes a great partner for Hypno, as it has the ability to deal with Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Rotom, while also luring in Fighting-types for Hypno to switch into. In return, Hypno can pass Nasty Plot boosts to Houndoom and 2HKO Milotic with +2 Grass Knot. Donphan is another good partner thanks to its high Defense stat, access to Stealth Rock, and ability to defeat Registeel. Also, Stealth Rock lures in opposing spinners, most of which are easily handled by Hypno after a Nasty Plot. Unfortunately, Spiritomb is still an issue, although it does not like switching into a +2 Grass Knot. Registeel resists both of Hypno's attacks, while being able to cripple Hypno with Thunder Wave or wear it down with Seismic Toss.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hypno has a myriad of options thanks to its large movepool. Hypno can run a dual screen set, despite being outclassed by Uxie and Mesprit. Hypno also has access to Belly Drum, allowing it to possibly threaten opposing teams on the physical side; however, Belly Drum is illegal with both Wish and Baton Pass, and Hypno's physical movepool is a bit lacking. A safer alternative to Belly Drum is Meditate, but Hypno needs a couple boosts to inflict decent damage with its physical movepool. On the Offensive Nasty Plot set, Hidden Power Fighting is an option over Psychic or Baton Pass. With access to Trick and equal base Attack and Special Attack, Hypno would appear to be able to run a Choice set, but its low offensive stats make it hard for Hypno to sweep. A status platform set is possible, as Hypno can learn Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Hypnosis, while possessing enough bulk to pull it off. Trick Room is yet another option due to Hypno's low Speed and above-average bulk. Hypno can also act as a supporter on a weather-based team, as it has access to both Sunny Day and Rain Dance. Counter can screw up opponents that target Hypno's lower Defense stat, while Taunt can prevent slower opponents from setting up. Barrier can compensate for Hypno's low Defense, Magic Coat can prevent status, and Skill Swap, alongside Insomnia, can ruin RestTalkers.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Spiritomb is one of the best counters to Hypno, thanks to its immunity to Psychic and Seismic Toss, base 92 attacking stats, and access to STAB Pursuit and Dark Pulse. Registeel also takes little damage from all of Hypno's attacking moves, sets up Stealth Rock without trouble, and targets Hypno's lower Defense stat. Clefable can switch into the Support set easily thanks to Magic Guard, and can ruin Hypno's fun by Tricking it a Toxic Orb. Mismagius can Taunt Hypno and proceed to set up, while Absol threatens with STAB Pursuit and Night Slash. Finally, Rhyperior can switch into the Support set's Thunder Wave, set up Substitute, and proceed to sweep. However, Rhyperior does not like switching into the Offensive Nasty Plot set, as even an unboosted Grass Knot OHKOes it.</p>
