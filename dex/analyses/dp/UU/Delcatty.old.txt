[Overview]

<p>Normalize really is an interesting and unique ability, and it's only found on Delcatty and its pre-evolution Skitty. The problem with it though is that Normal attacks are already the go-to moves for generic high damage and interesting effects. Delcatty can do all sorts of things for less than average damage, though its support pool is about as good as it gets, between Sing, Thunder Wave, Heal Bell, AND Wish. It's not even listed but you have a moveset right there. If you're using Delcatty, note that you only have the first few turns for Delcatty to surprise anything, and once its moveset and true motives are discovered, it will be a lot harder to use.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This (or a variation of this) is likely going to be the most common form of Delcatty you will see, as Delcatty's best and most sensible moves lean it in the direction of Baton Passing. It's already a very frail Pokemon though, so don't get your hopes up. It can function as a Special Attack boost passer or as a Wish passer.</p> 

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Delcatty can also go for no attacks whatsoever, but beware of Substitute and Taunt.</p>

[SET]
name: Normalize
move 1: Thunder Wave
move 2: Sing
move 3: Heal Bell / Baton Pass / Wish
move 4: Return / Double-Edge / Fake Out / Sucker Punch
item: Leftovers
ability: Normalize
nature: Adamant
evs: 172 HP / 176 Atk / 160 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Normalize is an unusual ability which turns all of Delcatty's moves into Normal-type attacks, and for the most part this ability is a huge disadvantage as it kills any sort of type coverage Delcatty may offer. Fortunately or unfortunately, Delcatty isn't exactly a champ when it comes to offense, so it's not a huge loss. The main thrust of this set is the Normalize Thunder Wave, which trades its Ground immunity for a Ghost one. Watch as Dugtrio recoils in shock and horror as it waltzes right into a Thunder Wave. Ghosts walk all over this set, so Sing is your only unreliable counter-measure against one. Use the switches caused by Thunder Wave and Sing to find opportunities to use Heal Bell, or use Baton Pass to scout for those switches and send in a better Pokemon for the job. Wish is for some convenient team healing.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>In terms of offense, the real problem with Normalize is that the Normal type already has on average some of the strongest and most reliable attacks in the game, so turning other attacks into Normal-type attacks doesn't really help. That said, STAB Sucker Punches can deal some damage and spook faster Pokemon. Actually, this set works fine with Cute Charm too. Delcatty is using Normalize just to show some of the options available to it when it does.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Delcatty learns an absurd number of good moves that it cannot use that well due to low statistics. To give you an idea, Delcatty learns Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Shadow Ball, Zen Headbutt and Grass Knot. The only times Delcatty should be using any of these moves is if turns out that an opponent's Pokemon is 4x weak to it. Delcatty also learns Copycat which acts like a better Mirror Move, and the ever-reliable Toxic. It can also Psych Up stat boosts and Baton Pass them away, though the fact that the opponent still has those boosts will be a huge problem.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>In the upper tiers, Delcatty is countered by everything and its mother with the possible exception of Dugtrio. Outside of that venue of quick and painful death, Delcatty will have to deal with Persian and Hitmonlee whose Limber trait renders Thunder Wave useless. Aggron, Bastiodon, and Probopass's 4x resistance to Normal attacks will also completely neutralize any sort of offense that Delcatty tries to mount. The moves Taunt and Substitute in general will also end Delcatty's dreams of the big leagues. In the lowest tiers, it doesn't have any particular weaknesses, but it doesn't have any particular strengths either.</p>
