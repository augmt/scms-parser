[Overview]

<p>Chimecho has never been the best choice when it comes to choosing a Psychic-type for a team. It is an average Pokemon with average stats and a terrible defensive typing for a Pokemon that was designed to support its fellow fighters. What it does have, however, is a great support movepool, distinguishing it from its fellow Psychic-types; most notably, access to Wish and Heal Bell allow it to pass on health boosts and clear status with relative ease. It may not be the best choice for your team, but when played right, Chimecho can still make a splash in the lower tiers.</p>

[SET]

item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is Chimecho's best attempt at supporting its team, and it doesn't do a bad job at it either. Psychic is there as your main STAB move, and stops Taunt from completely ruining your chances at accomplishing anything. Heal Bell is standard on many support Pokemon, and Chimecho is no exception; it allows the wind chime to rid itself and its party of status. Wish is another great move on Chimecho, and allows it to heal its teammates and itself when required, though Recover can be used as a more instantaneous form of healing. The last move slot depends on which form of healing is being used. Wish should be used with Protect as it allows Chimecho to heal itself more reliably, but can also be used to scout the opponents team. If Recover has been chosen, then a suitable status move should be used instead.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs and nature have been chosen to bulk up Chimecho's weaker defense stat, whilst Leftovers are chosen for added survivability. Hypnosis is an option over Yawn to hit Ghost-types, but is not recommended due to its terrible accuracy. This set, when used in conjunction with either Thunder Wave or Yawn, can cause many switches, and therefore works very well with entry hazards.</p>

<p>Chimecho absolutely hates entry hazards chipping away at its health every time it switches in, so a Rapid Spinner is usually required. Pokemon such as Donphan, Hitmontop, and Blastoise are recommended due to their good synergy with Chimecho. Defensive Steel-type Pokemon such as Steelix and Registeel are also recommended due to their good synergy with the wind chime, and also because they can soak up most physical attacks that usually head in Chimecho's direction. Fast set-up Pokemon, such as Nasty Plot Houndoom and Mismagius, appreciate the way that Chimecho can cripple many of their usual counters, and Houndoom also has great type synergy with Chimecho.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Hidden Power Ground / Shadow Ball
move 4: Recover
item: Leftovers
nature: Bold
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes advantage of Chimcho's more offensive capabilities, and is the only offensive set that is not completely outclassed by Uxie. The aim of this set is to switch in on a resisted move, or a Pokemon that can do nothing to Chimecho, and set up a Calm Mind on the switch. Chimecho can then proceed to attack using one of its coverage moves. Chimecho's main attack is its STAB Psychic, which will deal great damage to anything that doesn't resist it. As for its coverage move, Hidden Power Ground is the primary option and allows the wind chime to hit Registeel and Dark-type Pokemon, such as Drapion, Skuntank, and Spritomb harder, though Shadow Ball is slashed as it allows Chimecho to hit a wider range of Pokemon. Recover is used in the last slot so that Chimecho is able to stick around longer, and hopefully gain more Calm Mind boosts.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs and nature are chosen to compliment Chimecho's weaker physical bulk, and allow it to tank both physical and special hits with Calm Mind. Leftovers are the chosen item to further add to Chimecho's survivability on the field.</p>

<p>As with the Support set, entry hazards are a threat as they limit the usefulness of Chimecho by disabling its ability to switch in and out of attacks as required. As such, Donphan, Hitmontop, and Blastoise are recommended due to their good synergy with Chimecho. Steel-type Pokemon are also recommended due to good synergy with Chimecho. This variation of the wind chime loves having entry hazard support, as they turn many 2HKOs into OHKOs.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Trick can be used in conjunction with Choice Specs to cripple physical sweepers, although there is usually a better Pokemon for the job. Reflect and Light Screen can be used with Light Clay, but again, there are better Pokemon for the job, most notably Uxie. Chimecho is one of the few Pokemon that can use Trick Room, and a set with a Speed lowering nature and a 0 Speed IV can be used to surprise foes. Energy Ball and Grass Knot are both options on either set and can be used to hit bulky Water-type Pokemon that usually wall Chimecho. Signal Beam can also be utilised to hit the Dark-types that Shadow Ball does not.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Insomnia Bannette can destroy Chimecho with Shadow Ball, as it is immune to both Yawn and Hypnosis. Hypno can also Shadow Ball it to death, but be should be cautious of starting a stall war. Spiritomb resists all of Chimecho's attacks and can set up on it easily, though it should be careful of either status move on the support set. Mismagius can set up Nasty Plot with great ease and tear Chimecho apart with Shadow Ball. Houndoom outspeeds and KOes Chimecho with Dark Pulse, but should be wary of paralysis on the support set. Chansey walls any move that Chimecho throws at it, but should be wary of any boosted move on the Calm Mind set (though it will take until +6 for Chimecho to deal any real damage). In a similar vein, Registeel walls the Calm Mind set but should be wary of a boosted Hidden Power Ground, although it can usually stall Chimecho out.</p>
