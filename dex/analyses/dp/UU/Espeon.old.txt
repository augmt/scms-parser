[Overview]

<p>Espeon has high Speed and Special Attack, making her an excellent sweeper and Baton Passer. Access to great support moves such as Wish, Baton Pass, Reflect, Light Screen, and Trick make her an excellent teammate, especially when she can easily lure in special walls onto whom she can Trick her Choice item. Synchronize deters status users from attempting to cripple Espeon, as the same status will also be inflicted on them. Espeon's major downfall is her horrible Defense, making her vulnerable to physical Dark-type moves, particularly Pursuit and Sucker Punch. Although Espeon faces stiff competition from Alakazam, Baton Pass and Wish make her a unique Psychic-type who can support the team while still dishing out powerful attacks. When using Espeon, just be sure to cover her weaknesses and avoid Pursuit users, and you'll find you have a powerful and useful Pokemon on your hands.</p>

[SET]
name: EspyJump (Baton Pass)

move 2: Psychic
move 3: Baton Pass
move 4: Substitute
item: Leftovers
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 40 SpD / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Espeon's signature set, featuring the factors that set her apart from other Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Uxie. Calm Mind and Baton Pass, combined with Espeon's excellent Speed, make her an ideal Baton Pass user. Substitute protects her from status, while Psychic offers a way to hit the opposing Pokemon with a powerful STAB move. The idea behind this set is to switch into a Pokemon whom Espeon can force out and proceed to set up a Substitute. If the opponent sends in a wall Espeon cannot damage, simply pass the Substitute to a teammate. When the opponent runs out of Espeon counters, either attempt a sweep with Calm Mind boosts, or pass the boosts to a sweeper with better coverage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>216 Speed EVs ensure that Espeon outspeeds positive-natured Scyther and Mismagius, allowing her to Baton Pass before taking a hit. Maximum HP is used to give Espeon more bulk, enabling her to sponge special hits more easily. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense, helping Espeon set up on weak special attackers such as Lanturn.</p>

<p>Ambipom and Drapion are both troublesome due to their high Speed, access to Taunt, and, in Drapion's case, immunity to Psychic-type attacks. Bulky Ground- and Rock-types such as Donphan and Rhyperior are good options to defeat these threats, as they can switch in with little difficulty and set up Stealth Rock; Rhyperior can even begin a potential sweep with Rock Polish or Swords Dance.</p>

<p>Chansey and Registeel are difficult to break through with this Espeon, making mixed sweepers and Fighting-types excellent partners. Magmortar and Blaziken can take advantage of Calm Mind, while Substitute grants them an easier time switching in. Fighting-types, such as Hariyama and Hitmonchan, appreciate Substitute, as it blocks status and helps them set up Focus Punch. Moltres is another good receiver of Calm Mind since it is unable to raise its own Special Attack, and its access to Agility turns Moltres into a dangerous threat who is difficult to revenge kill. Magneton is another option; it has great defensive synergy with Espeon, taking Dark-, Ghost-, and Bug-type attacks directed at her with ease.</p>

[SET]
name: Offensive Calm Mind 
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Hidden Power Ground 
move 4: Baton Pass / Shadow Ball / Signal Beam
item: Life Orb 
nature: Timid
evs: 40 HP / 252 SpA / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set also utilizes Baton Pass, though it's played much more offensively, foregoing Substitute for a second attacking move. Espeon has enough power to 2HKO Registeel with Hidden Power Ground after a single Calm Mind boost, although Spikes support is needed to guarantee this. Hidden Power Ground is mainly used to KO Drapion and Houndoom, two dangerous Dark-types who threaten Espeon. Psychic is Espeon's best STAB attack, dealing immense damage to most opposing Pokemon after a boost or two. In the final slot, Baton Pass is used to escape Pursuit users while also passing Calm Mind boosts to Espeon's teammates. Two alternatives in the last slot are Shadow Ball, which hits Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively, and Signal Beam, which hits Dark- and Psychic-types. Grass Knot is yet another option in the last slot and it deals more damage to heavy Pokemon, such as Milotic and Rhyperior.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>216 Speed EVs enable Espeon to outrun positive-natured Mismagius and Scyther, allowing her to hit them with a powerful attack or escape from them with Baton Pass before they can move. Max Special Attack is vital for a sweeper, making Espeon as deadly as possible. The remaining EVs are placed into HP to give Espeon a little more bulk. Espeon may use Substitute on this set, though she loses a valuable coverage move in doing this. If you do choose to go down that route, a spread of 8 HP / 248 SpA / 252 Spe with Leftovers instead of Life Orb is recommended, as it allows Espeon to make 5 Substitutes (provided she doesn't take any damage beforehand).</p>

<p>Entry hazards are helpful on this set, helping to weaken opponents and increase the chance of a KO. A good example of a target who is defeated more easily with entry hazard support is Registeel; with a single layer of Spikes, Espeon will 2HKO it with a +1 Hidden Power Ground. Stealth Rock is also helpful as it cripples Moltres and other Pokemon who are weak to it. Qwilfish and Cloyster are good choices to set up Spikes, while Donphan and Omastar are good options to supply Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>Although Espeon is boosting her Special Attack, she still has trouble with Chansey and her infinite fatness. Fighting-types, such as Hitmontop, are the easy answer to this problem because they hit Chansey super effectively with their STAB moves in her weaker defensive stat. Mixed sweepers are also effective, luring her in with special attacks and hitting her hard physically. Magmortar and Blaziken are both excellent mixed attackers who appreciate boosts from Calm Mind. Spiritomb is another dreadful counter to Espeon, as it is immune to Psychic and has access to Pursuit and Sucker Punch. To get past Spiritomb, Toxic Spikes may be set up to wear him down, while Fire-types can switch in rather freely, as they are immune to its Will-O-Wisp; Blaziken does especially well, as he even has a resistance to Dark-type attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: Wish 
move 4: Psychic / Baton Pass
item: Light Clay
nature: Timid
evs: 252 HP / 40 Def / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Espeon's high Speed and access to Wish make her a great dual screen user. Since she's a Psychic-type, common Brick Break users (mostly Fighting-types) will avoid Espeon like the plague, as they risk eating a super effective Psychic if they attempt to shatter the screens. Reflect is usually the first move Espeon should make, raising Espeon's average Defense and helping her against Pursuit users. After Reflect, Espeon should proceed with Light Screen, then switch to a teammate who can set up. Psychic is used as a reliable STAB move, while Baton Pass allows Espeon to scout and escape from Pursuit users without taking damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This Espeon runs enough Speed to beat positive-natured Mismagius and Scyther, hitting them or escaping from them with Baton Pass before they have the chance to attack. Maximum HP gives Espeon some much needed bulk, while the remaining EVs are placed into Defense, allowing Espeon to take physical hits better. Leftovers may be used in the item slot to restore health, though the extra turns of dual screens that Light Clay provides are preferred.</p>

<p>With dual screen support, a variety of frail sweepers now have an easier time to shine. With boosted defenses, you may run more risky strategies like Belly Drum Linoone and Charizard; make sure you have Rapid Spin support when using Charizard, though. Nasty Plot Mismagius is another good choice, as she appreciates the boosted Defense from Reflect when using Nasty Plot to make her Special Attack skyrocket to insane levels. Finally, Swords Dance Drapion is a dangerous threat after a boost or two, and even survives Dugtrio's Earthquake behind Reflect. Bulky Substitute users are also excellent choices, as their Substitutes will be almost impossible to break behind screens. Hariyama, Poliwrath, and Azumarill are all fine choices.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute + 3 Attacks
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Hidden Power Ground
move 4: Shadow Ball / Signal Beam / Grass Knot
item: Life Orb
nature: Timid
ivs: 29 HP
evs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Espeon is fast, frail, and hits like a truck, so a Substitute + 3 Attacks set is a natural choice. Having three attacks instead of two upgrades Espeon's type coverage substantially, which alleviates the need to boost her Special Attack in order to beat bulkier Pokemon. Since Espeon forces many Pokemon to switch out, setting up a Substitute should always be her first priority. Substitute also helps to ease prediction, allowing Espeon to fire off the optimal attack twice against slower Pokemon. Furthermore, Substitute shields Espeon from Dark-type switch-ins eager to trap her with Pursuit or nail her with Sucker Punch. While Spiritomb remains a threat, Drapion and Houndoom who lack HP or Special Defense investment will be OHKOed by Hidden Power Ground after Stealth Rock, and Skuntank is likely to meet the same fate.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Espeon has a number of viable attacks in her arsenal, but the combination of Psychic and Hidden Power Ground gives the best core type coverage. Unlike in the OU environment, STAB Psychic can steamroll many Pokemon in UU, where only a handful resist it. Hidden Power Ground 2HKOes Steelix, and scores OHKOs on Aggron and the aforementioned Dark-types after Stealth Rock damage. Shadow Ball is the preferred attack to round out the set, but Signal Beam is also a viable option depending on which Pokemon you want Espeon to hit. Shadow Ball roughs up Slowking, Uxie, and Mesprit, who would otherwise shrug off Espeon's attacks. It also allows Espeon to OHKO Mismagius, which she fails to do with Psychic even after Stealth Rock damage. Signal Beam allows Espeon to hit pure Dark-types such as Absol super effectively, though it doesn't have much use outside of that, as Shadow Ball covers all the same types. Grass Knot scores a very important 2HKO on all common Milotic variants, OHKOes Rhyperior and Donphan, and hits Spiritomb for 100 Base Power. All three options nail Slowbro and Claydol for super effective damage. As the above examples demonstrate, having Stealth Rock support is absolutely imperative for Espeon to achieve several key OHKOs.</p>

<p>In UU, this set struggles to avoid being overshadowed by Alakazam, whose higher Speed and access to Focus Blast give him an edge over Espeon. There are, however, several advantages to running this Espeon set. The most obvious difference is in defensive stats, as Espeon is significantly bulkier than Alakazam; however, this is strictly relative, since Espeon is still moderately fragile by objective standards. Another difference is that opponents will initially anticipate Espeon's trademark Baton Pass set, which may cause them to inadvertently put a Pokemon such as Encore Clefable or Haze Milotic in the line of fire. Additionally, using this set in tandem with Alakazam is also an option. Alakazam makes a great anti-lead whom can prevent entry hazards from being set up, and can also lure out Espeon's counters so that you can plot a way to destroy them before revealing Espeon.</p>

<p>Not many Pokemon can handle Espeon once she is hiding behind a Substitute; Registeel and Chansey are the two main exceptions to this. Standard Registeel avoids being 3HKOed by any attack, although it won't enjoy frequently switching in without reliable recovery, while Rest variants and Chansey can wall Espeon to Timbuktu and back with ease. Spiritomb can be added to the counters list under most circumstances, and is Espeon's most immediately threatening counter since it commonly carries Pursuit. However, Choice Band variants must be at full health to avoid a 2HKO from Grass Knot, and even then there is a small chance of it occurring. Specially defensive variants, especially those with Pursuit and a priority move, fare the best and will force Espeon to flee while she still has her Substitute up. Espeon's teammates should definitely aim to take advantage of these three Pokemon, as they are really the only three surefire counters to this Espeon in UU. Blaziken walks all over these Pokemon, and can set up with Swords Dance or Agility while Espeon's counter flees. Dugtrio makes an amazing partner as well, as he can trap and KO Registeel and Chansey, opening the door for Espeon to wreak havoc. Substitute Rhyperior can also set up on all three aforementioned counters and proceed to hammer the opposing team with its powerful STAB moves.</p>

<p>Between Substitute and Life Orb damage, Espeon won't be sticking around for long, so it is important to preserve what little health she does have. Entry hazards take their toll quickly, as do most attacks. Therefore, it is important to pair Espeon with Pokemon who can get her free switches. U-turn users, such as Scyther and Primeape, will lure out Pokemon like Weezing and Donphan, both of whom Espeon can set up on easily. If you can fit Wish support onto your team, do so by all means, as it will greatly increase Espeon's lifespan. Clefable can use Wish and torture Registeel and Chansey with Encore, making her a solid teammate.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice
move 1: Psychic
move 2: Hidden Power Ground
move 3: Baton Pass / Shadow Ball / Signal Beam
move 4: Trick
item: Choice Specs / Choice Scarf
nature: Timid / Modest
evs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Espeon's high Speed and Special Attack make her a perfect candidate for Choice sets. Psychic is Espeon's main attack, providing a nice source of STAB. Hidden Power Ground hits Steel-types such as Aggron and Registeel, while also scoring super effective damage against Drapion and Houndoom. Baton Pass is a good scouting move which allows Espeon to escape Pursuit users such as Spiritomb and Drapion. Shadow Ball hits Psychic- and Ghost-types super effectively, while Signal Beam smashes Dark- and Psychic-types. Trick allows Espeon to cripple walls by giving them her Choice item; this can cause major problems for your opponent late-game when one of your sweepers attempts to set up.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>252 Speed allows Espeon to outrun positive-natured Mismagius and Scyther, giving her the opportunity to smack them with a powerful attack before they can move. Max Special Attack is used to deal as much damage as possible, and the remaining EVs are placed into HP. If Espeon is holding a Choice Scarf, 252 EVs and a Timid nature allow her to outspeed Adamant Kabutops in the rain. A Modest nature tends to work better with the Choice Scarf set, allowing Espeon to outrun Choice Scarf Rotom and crush it with Psychic.</p>

<p>Being a specially-based Choice user, Espeon should have partners who can deal with Dark-types and special walls, especially Chansey and Registeel. Fighting-types such as Hariyama are good choices for teammates due to their super effective STAB moves against the aforementioned Pokemon and high Attack stats. Hitmontop is another good choice; he also has Foresight, enabling him to hit Spiritomb with his Fighting-type attacks. Dugtrio is a good option as well, trapping Chansey and Registeel with his Arena Trap ability and KOing them with Beat Up and Earthquake, respectively.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Most of Espeon's useful options have already been mentioned, though she can use a few other moves to some degree of success. Fake Tears is helpful for forcing switches, and Pokemon who stay in face a powerful hit from one of Espeon's coverage moves. Charm also forces switches, and lowering the opponent's Attack cushions Espeon on the physical side. Heal Bell may be used on any of the sets mentioned to remove status, though Espeon would have to sacrifice an essential move. Finally, Psych Up allows Espeon to steal the stat boosts of opposing Pokemon and then proceed to Baton Pass them to her teammates.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The best way to counter Espeon is with a Dark-type such as Spiritomb and Drapion, who are both immune to Espeon's STAB Psychic-type attacks and have STAB Dark-type moves like Pursuit at their disposal. Chansey and Registeel are both good options thanks to their huge Special Defense, good typing, and decent support movepools. If entry hazards are on the field, beware of boosted Hidden Power; in this case, a revenge killer such as Swellow is recommended to take out Espeon. Dugtrio can use its ability to trap Espeon and KO her with Night Slash, while faster versions of Espeon can be hit with Sucker Punch. Finally, Sucker Punch in general is a major problem for any Espeon, bypassing her Speed and hitting her super effectively. Common users of STAB Sucker Punch include mixed Houndoom and Absol.</p>
