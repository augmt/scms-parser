[Overview]

<p>Regice looks like the ideal choice for a special wall; its massive base 200 Special Defense, usable HP, and access to support moves such as Thunder Wave and Gravity all look appealing. However, when you look closer you'll notice that it has weaknesses to common attacking types such as Fire-, Rock-, Steel-, and Fighting-type attacks, a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, and a total lack of reliable recovery. With the correct support, Regice becomes an unequivocal special wall that can counter the likes of Rotom, Milotic, and Sceptile with ease, but just make sure to keep Regice away from super effective attacks and Stealth Rock.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set turns Regice into a good special sponge capable of taking on a variety of special attackers, crippling them with status and wearing them down with Regice's decent offenses. Thunder Wave slows down incoming physical attackers, while Toxic helps wear down bulky opponents, especially Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro. Ice Beam is used for STAB and comes off of Regice's useful base 100 Special Attack. Thunderbolt and Charge Beam provide excellent type coverage alongside Ice Beam, and Seismic Toss provides consistent damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Calm nature along with 252 Defense EVs make Regice extremely bulky, taking both physical and special attacks with relative ease. If you desire a more specially defensive spread, you may shift the Defense EVs into Special Defense, though you could also run a Bold nature for a more physically defensive set. Rest can be used in the last slot as it rids Regice of harmful status and fully restores its health; however, when Regice is using Rest, a cleric such as Clefable is recommended as Regice becomes setup fodder for numerous Pokemon. Explosion may seem unorthodox on a defensive set, but it deserves a mention because it allows Regice to blow up Fighting- and Fire-types such as Blaziken and Hariyama.</p>

<p>As this set lacks reliable recovery, Regice appreciates Wish support. There are a variety of Pokemon that can provide this, namely Clefable, Leafeon, and Chansey, all of which have good defensive stats and access to useful support options of their own. Due to Regice's mediocre typing, you'll need Pokemon that can switch into Fire-, Rock-, Steel-, and Fighting-type attacks. Claydol resists Rock- and Fighting-type attacks, Altaria resists Fire- and Fighting-type attacks, and Moltres resists Fire-, Fighting-, and Steel-type attacks. There are many more teammates to consider, though, as these are just a few examples. Regice is also weak to Stealth Rock, and the only way to remove it is by using a good Rapid Spin user. Claydol and Donphan both resist Rock-type attacks and have access to Stealth Rock themselves, while Blastoise can switch into Fire- and Steel-type attacks with ease.</p>

<p>Pokemon that can take advantage of Regice's stalling ability are good partners, particularly those with low Special Defense. As for offensive partners, Aggron can take advantage of Regice's high Special Defense and ability to switch into Water- and Ground-type attacks, while it can set up Rock Polish to pummel the opponent and appreciates the paralysis support Regice can provide against faster sweepers. Blaziken appreciates Regice as a switch-in to Water- and Psychic-types such as Slowbro, Milotic, and Alakazam, and Venusaur appreciates Alakazam taken care of as well. As for defensive partners, Weezing is an excellent choice because it only has one weakness, and Regice can switch into most common Psychic-type attacks with ease. Donphan is another good partner because Regice can take on the Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type attacks aimed at it, while Donphan can remove Stealth Rock and switch into Rock-type attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: RestTalk
move 1: Rest

move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Seismic Toss / Charge Beam / Thunderbolt

nature: Calm
evs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set attempts to patch up Regice's lack of recovery with the RestTalk combination, turning it into an excellent staller and status absorber; these attributes, along with STAB Ice Beam, make Regice one of the best Venusaur counters around. RestTalk helps recover damage accumulated from entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock. Ice Beam is used for STAB, and Seismic Toss provides reliable damage, while Thunderbolt or Charge Beam can be used to provide good type coverage with the vaunted BoltBeam combination. Toxic or Thunder Wave can also be used in the last slot, providing status and supporting Regice's teammates.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As this set is supposed to stick around for as long as possible, Toxic Spikes are a good option; they poison the opponent's Pokemon, allowing Regice to wear down and stall out bulky Water-types like Milotic as the damage increases to horrifying levels. Pokemon such as Cloyster, Drapion, and Nidoqueen are ideal options to set them up thanks to their good defensive stats and other support options.</p>

<p>Being an Ice-type, Regice comes with a large number of common weaknesses, most notably to Fire-, Fighting-, and Rock-type attacks, so a partner that can switch into these types of attacks is ideal. Rhyperior can switch into most Fire- and Rock-type attacks and set up with Rock Polish, while Slowbro can switch into Fire- and Fighting-type attacks and proceed to do the same with Calm Mind or Trick Room. Other good partners include Milotic, Kabutops, and Moltres.</p>

<p>Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Regice requires Rapid Spin support to be effective; Donphan and Hitmontop are reliable choices as they can switch into Rock-type attacks and pose a decent offensive threat with their STAB attacks. Snover is almost mandatory for this set as it wears down the opponent without damaging Regice; while Blizzard sounds appealing in the hail, the low PP isn't a good idea on a Pokemon that is supposed to be stalling. Finally, this set is stopped cold when Chansey and Registeel appear on the field, especially when Regice lacks Charge Beam to boost its Special Attack. Dugtrio is the best partner to defeat both of these troublesome opponents, since its Arena Trap ability stops them from escaping, while Earthquake completely annihilates them. Strong Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Hitmontop are other good options as they can create big holes in the opponent's team with their STAB attacks.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although it's primarily used as a wall, Regice does have a nice base 100 Special Attack and a pretty good movepool to boot. Ice Beam and Thunderbolt provide excellent type coverage that is only resisted by Lanturn, Shedinja, and Magneton in UU. Focus Blast is used to beat Steel-types like Aggron and Steelix, while Explosion decimates Chansey and Clefable. Alternatively, Rock Polish may be used in the last slot, as it makes Regice a fast sweeper; with Regice's solid defenses, it shouldn't be too hard to find the time to set up.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With 176 Speed EVs, Regice outspeeds Adamant max Speed Rhyperior and 0 Speed Hitmontop. More Speed can be invested if you decide to run Rock Polish, as 244 EVs allow Regice to outrun Jolly Swellow after a Rock Polish boost. 48 Attack EVs allow Regice to OHKO Chansey with Explosion after Stealth Rock damage, and the remaining EVs are placed in HP, making Regice a little more bulky while minimizing Life Orb recoil. Substitute may be used in the last slot to avoid status and ease prediction against switch-ins, while Thunder Wave may be used to cripple opposing sweepers. A Modest nature is preferred because it doesn't lower Regice's defenses, but a Mild nature can be run alongside Explosion to give it some extra power.</p>

<p>Stealth Rock and Spikes are helpful as they weaken opponents that switch into Regice; Chansey is a good example, as Explosion will score an OHKO when Stealth Rock is on the field. Spikes will damage grounded opponents, helping against Pokemon like Registeel that resist Stealth Rock. Uxie, Donphan, and Claydol can set up Stealth Rock, while Cacturne, Cloyster, and Qwilfish can set up Spikes. Toxic Spikes, which can be set up by Drapion, Nidoqueen, and Qwilfish, are also helpful as they wear down bulky Water-types such as Milotic.</p>

<p>If Regice isn't running Rock Polish, Fire- and Fighting-types such as Moltres, Houndoom, and Hariyama walk all over it. To overcome this problem, Slowbro may be used to take on physical attackers, while Slowking fares well against Moltres and Houndoom. Both Slowbro and Slowking have access to Slack Off and Thunder Wave, while STAB Surf and Psychic can deal with Fire- and Fighting-types, respectively. On the other hand, without Explosion, Regice faces problems with Chansey and Registeel, though this may be tackled by pairing Regice with Dugtrio and its Arena Trap ability, or even a powerful Fighting-type such as Blaziken or Hariyama.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Besides the moves listed, Regice can use any one of the following to some degree of success. Regice may use Blizzard if Snover is present, as it will become 100% accurate thanks to the consistent hail brought by Snow Warning. Amnesia may be used to raise Regice's already monster Special Defense, while Curse may be used on a physical set with Avalanche to raise its Attack and Defense. Block can be used alongside a stat boosting move or Toxic to trap the opponent. Focus Punch can be used with Substitute, while Hammer Arm can be used to hit Rock-, Steel-, and Dark-types super effectively. Icy Wind can be used to lower the opponent's Speed. Rain Dance is nifty with Thunder and Explosion, and Regice's solid defenses make it pretty easy to set up. Psych Up allows Regice to copy stat boosts from the opponent, which is especially helpful against Calm Mind users such as Slowbro and some Spiritomb. Gravity may also be useful with Earthquake-using teammates and low accuracy moves such as Thunder and Blizzard.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Slow Fighting-types such as Hariyama or Hitmontop are the best counters to Regice as Thunder Wave isn't too big an issue and they can smash Regice with their STAB attacks. Chansey and Clefable can take on any of Regice's sets with their excellent special bulk, but must watch out for Explosion. Lanturn resists the BoltBeam combination and is immune to Electric-type attacks such as Thunder Wave, while it can poison Regice with Toxic and stall it until it faints. Steelix is immune to Thunderbolt and Ice Beam only hits it neutrally, while Gyro Ball hits Regice super effectively. Stealth Rock is a big problem for Regice as it loses a quarter of its health each time it switches in, while Toxic and Toxic Spikes will make Regice's stalling attempts futile. Anything that can survive an Ice Beam or Thunderbolt from Regice and can hit it super effectively can probably be called a counter as well.</p>
