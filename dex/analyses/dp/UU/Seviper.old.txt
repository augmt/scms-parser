[Overview]

<p>Let's be honest here, Seviper isn't exactly everyone's first choice for a UU sweeper, but with two base 100 attacking stats and a hugely diverse movepool, the Fang Snake Pokemon can definitely cause some havoc and become a great wallbreaker. Seviper is somewhat frail defensively, but it can survive most neutral STAB attacks, and has resistances to common Grass-, Bug-, and Fighting-type attacks, making it capable of slithering into some niche roles on the average UU team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Seviper's excellent movepool provides it with a wide range of coverage and attacking options, making an all-out attacker set a natural fit for this wicked reptile. Poison Jab is the all-important STAB attack, capable of 2HKOing the pink nuisances Clefable and Chansey. Earthquake punishes Steel-types who think they can switch in for free on Seviper's Poison Jab. Sucker Punch is a nifty option on this set as it remedies Seviper's poor Speed, and is a great way to take out the Ghost- and Psychic-types that pervade UU. Aqua Tail hurts the Ground-types who are resistant to Poison Jab, especially Rhyperior; it's also a good way to eliminate Moltres, who might otherwise be tempted to switch in on Earthquake or Sucker Punch.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb is the obvious item for this set as Seviper appreciates the boost in power and the freedom to switch moves, meaning it can better take advantage of its coverage moves. 212 Speed EVs allow this hissing fiend to outpace Rock Polish Torterra and Rock Polish Aggron, Attack is maximized to capitalize on Seviper's offenses, and the rest is dumped into HP for some bulk. This Seviper is not meant to be played as your average all-purpose wallbreaker, but rather as a Pokemon who softens up the opponent's core in preparation for a teammate's sweep, so it's a good idea to pair it up with late-game sweepers such as Blaziken or Rock Polish Aggron. This Seviper also has trouble breaking through bulky Waters, so it's best to have Venusaur as a teammate to handle the ubiquitous Milotic.</p> 

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Poison Jab
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Crunch / Aqua Tail
move 4: Switcheroo
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Jolly
evs: 12 HP / 252 Atk / 244 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A fast Seviper is something your opponent won't see coming, and the Choice Scarf set accomplishes exactly that. The element of surprise is further aided by Seviper's wide movepool, making it difficult to predict what attack it's going to throw out next. Poison Jab is a fantastic STAB move that puts huge dents in fragile sweepers who think they can outspeed Seviper. Earthquake shuts down Steels and other Poison-types who like to switch in on a predicted Poison Jab. Crunch deals with Ghost- and Psychic-types, but most Psychic Pokemon are so frail they'll likely get knocked out by Poison Jab anyway. Alternatively, Aqua Tail provides good neutral damage on most foes, and is Seviper's best way of handling Rhyperior and Moltres. In the final slot we have Switcheroo, which passes the Choice Scarf onto the opposing Pokemon, so it's a fine way to ruin bulky walls such as Registeel and set-up sweepers such as Dragon Dance Feraligatr.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The Speed EVs, Jolly nature, and Choice Scarf allow Seviper to outspeed threats such as Dugtrio and Sceptile, so the venomous menace can eliminate them before they can get a hit in. Seviper's ability to cripple an opposing wall with Switcheroo is very unexpected and should not be underestimated, and it's a good idea to pair up this Seviper with Pokemon who can take advantage of a crippled wall and set up; prime examples include Dragon Dance Feraligatr, Dragon Dance Altaria, and Calm Mind Spiritomb.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Seviper has a decent special movepool so a Choice Specs set is viable, with Sludge Bomb, Giga Drain, Flamethrower, and Dark Pulse, but keep in mind that most targets in UU are hit harder by Seviper's physical attacks. X-Scissor is another decent physical move that Seviper has at its disposal, but it has redundant coverage with Poison Jab and Sucker Punch. Seviper has some decent support options, including Glare, Knock Off, Haze, Taunt, and Toxic, but its defenses are really nothing to write home about, so a support set on Seviper will always be inferior to just outright attacking.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Seviper has naturally poor Speed and defenses, so it's not too hard to switch your Pokemon in on a resisted attack and threaten to outspeed and KO it. Donphan and Rhyperior can switch in on a predicted Poison Jab and proceed to threaten with STAB Earthquake, but they must watch out for Aqua Tail. Registeel is immune to Poison Jab, and once switched in can begin to support its team or just take Seviper down. Powerful Flying-types such as Swellow and Moltres can switch in on Earthquake and eliminate Seviper with their respective STAB moves of choice; Altaria does likewise and can also choose to set up with Dragon Dance. Bulky Psychic-types, such as Mesprit, Uxie, and Slowbro, can survive Crunch or Sucker Punch and KO back with STAB Psychic. Milotic shrugs off Seviper's assaults with ease, and can wash its poisonous advances away with Surf.</p>
