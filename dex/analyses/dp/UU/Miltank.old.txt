[Overview]
<p>Miltank is an excellent Pokemon, boasting base 100 Speed and above-average defenses. Its ability Scrappy allows it to even hit Ghost-types with its STAB Normal-type attacks. Miltank can do a wide variety of things, whether it be slowly powering up with Curse or going for the all-out attack. Although it has a weakness to the best attacking type in UU (Fighting), this should not deter you from using Miltank on your team. Bolstering your team with teammates that can support it can be very much worthwhile, as a properly used Miltank can easily sweep entire teams.</p>

[SET]
name: Curse
move 1: Heal Bell
move 2: Milk Drink
move 3: Curse
move 4: Body Slam / Return
item: Leftovers
ability: Scrappy
nature: Careful
evs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>This is the most well-known Miltank set and one of the best pure sweepers of all UU. Although it seems as though Miltank would be slow to set up, access to both HP and status recovery moves, an attack with no immunities and only two resists, and above-average defenses give it all the time in the world to set up a few Curses and start cleaning up teams.</p>

<p>Milk Drink and Heal Bell give Miltank a reliable recovery engine that allows it to stand up to most Toxic stallers and physical attackers. With a few Curses under its belt (or udder), Miltank can begin to take even STAB Fighting-type attacks with ease and recover with Milk Drink. Body Slam becomes a much more powerful attack when Curse-boosted and has enough PP and an excellent secondary effect to allow Miltank to sweep with it. If Body Slam seems too weak on Miltank, Return is a very good substitution, reaching 48 more Base Power after STAB is factored in. Return gives no chance of paralysis, but the extra Base Power make it a fair price to pay.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>Miltank's Defense is boosted through Curse, so it is important to focus on boosting your Special Defense with the EVs. This allows it to set up on Pokemon such as Rotom or Milotic. It also allows it to serve as a counter to many specially-based threats, since the rest of your team should be dedicated to fending off many of Miltank's physical counters.</p>

<p>Hammer Arm can be used over Heal Bell, allowing Miltank to KO Registeel and Steelix much more easily than with Body Slam after Curse. Rest is another option to consider, providing both status removal and full health recovery in one move. In order to not waste turns, Sleep Talk can be used in the other free slot, or alternatively, you can use both Milk Drink and Rest.

<p>This Miltank is meant to clean up the opponent's team, so it should be used in conjunction with Pokemon that benefit it, not the other way around (although it can be a mutually beneficial relationship). Spiritomb can be a very valuable partner, switching in on Fighting-types and using Pursuit on them for small amounts of damage. Although this minor damage won't seem important at first, it will eventually add up and let Miltank set up more easily. Toxic Spikes support can wear down any potential counters as Miltank sets up, and also allow it to set up on Pokemon such as Milotic while poison slowly whittles down their health. It also allows Miltank to continuously Curse up and Milk Drink against Fighting-types while Toxic Spikes damage eventually kills them off.</p>

[SET]
name: Mootility
move 1: Heal Bell
move 2: Milk Drink
move 3: Body Slam
move 4: Stealth Rock / Rock Slide
item: Leftovers
ability: Thick Fat
nature: Jolly
evs: 240 HP / 84 Def / 184 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Miltank is a very bulky Pokemon that has access to Stealth Rock. That alone should make it a Pokemon to consider adding to your team. What separates Miltank from Chansey, however, is its base 100 Speed, as well as a more-than-decent Attack stat. This allows it to not only support your team, but to also deal consistent damage to opponents.</p>

<p>The main reason to use this set is the reliability of Miltank's Stealth Rock. With base 100 Speed, only one weakness, and good defensive stats, Miltank has almost no issue with setting it up. Its second trick is Heal Bell, which gives any statused sweeper on your team a chance to sweep again. Milk Drink gives Miltank durability, and Body Slam allows it to spread paralysis through the opponent's team. Miltank's useful Thick Fat ability also allows it to counter common UU Pokemon such as Moltres and Arcanine.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>184 Speed EVs allow Miltank to outspeed max Speed Moltres and Rotom, two huge threats that it may encounter. Since most opponents would expect Curse Miltank, you can very easily surprise and sometimes kill these weakened Pokemon. The rest of the EVs can be put into HP and Defense, allowing it to take attacks such as Scyther's U-turn much more handily. These EVs can also be transferred to Special Defense to create a makeshift Rotom or even Mismagius counter, although Rock Slide is required over Stealth Rock in order to hit them. Rotom cannot even rely on burning Miltank as it can just Heal Bell to cure the status.</p>

<p>As with any Pokemon using Stealth Rock, partnering Miltank with a sweeper that abuses entry hazards is recommended. Slower Pokemon that also benefit from paralysis would be ideal, as they are generally less frail than faster Pokemon. Pokemon that rely on Rest and Sleep Talk also benefit as partners, as they can sponge hits and have Miltank rid them of their sleep next time it comes out.</p>

<p>Miltank is a very effective wall, capable of taking hits from both physical and special attackers, but unfortunately, it doesn't have the special bulk of Chansey or the physical bulk of Regirock. Repeated hits from Pokemon such as Scyther or Venusaur will take it down and will force Miltank to keep relying on Milk Drink. Other walls, such as Milotic or Registeel, can make things very difficult for Miltank, as it has no way to boost its own Attack with this set. It is best to use this Miltank only as a pivot, switching in to Heal Bell or Stealth Rock and then trying to spread status a few times with Body Slam.</p>

[SET]
name: MooFensive (Life Orb)
move 1: Double-Edge / Return
move 2: Earthquake / Toxic
move 3: Heal Bell
move 4: Milk Drink
item: Life Orb
ability: Scrappy
nature: Jolly
evs: 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Although Miltank prefers to play more defensively with its sets, it still has offensive assets in its base 100 Speed, its respectable Attack, and a STAB attack with a Base Power of 120. It becomes a very powerful sweeper with a Life Orb, outspeeding and OHKOing many common threats.

<p>Double-Edge is Miltank's strongest physical attack (with the exception of Giga Impact), and it can easily 2HKO even the most bulkiest of threats. Earthquake provides coverage versus Steelix and Registeel, while Heal Bell can relieve Miltank of any status ailments it receives. Its base 100 Speed lets it outpace almost every Fire-type in UU, almost all of which can be OHKOed by Earthquake. With constant recoil from Life Orb as well as Double-Edge, Milk Drink is needed to keep Miltank healthy and able to sweep longer.</p>

<p>Return can be used over Double-Edge if recoil is too worrisome. However, the lack of power will make Pokemon such as Milotic and Venusaur much more daunting to face. Toxic can be used instead of Earthquake as a scouting device, allowing Miltank to scout for any common counters; however, Earthquake is the preferred option to do substantial damage to Pokemon such as Arcanine and Drapion.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>Entry hazards are very important for Miltank, letting it 2HKO some variants of Milotic as well as OHKO many more possible threats. Moltres is an excellent partner to Miltank, as it can easily wear down potential counters such as Milotic and Chansey and switch in on Fighting-type attacks directed at Miltank. Mismagius makes another good partner, as Miltank can often lure in and OHKO opposing Mismagius, as well as lure in counters to other sets such as Registeel. Although Miltank may not be able to KO Registeel, it will often force Registeel into either using Explosion or taking a loss of 70% HP.</p>

<p>The best counter to this Miltank is just keeping a faster pace. Miltank will slowly wear itself out with recoil from Life Orb or Double-Edge, allowing other Pokemon to simply pick it off later. Hitmontop can Intimidate Miltank, cutting its Attack, and use Mach Punch to deal plenty of damage. Rhyperior is not 2HKOed by Earthquake and can use the opportunity to set up a Rock Polish, or abuse Choice Banded attacks. Scarf Fighting-types will force Miltank out and slowly wear down teammates with Close Combat.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Miltank doesn't really have any other sets worth using. A Choice Band set can hit somewhat hard and has some unique options with the elemental punches and Zen Headbutt, but Kangaskhan outclasses it with Sucker Punch and a higher base Attack. Miltank's only other viable option is Counter, which it can use as is or alongside Curse. Chople Berry and Counter can help Miltank lure in Fighting-types and OHKO them back.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fighting-type attacks are generally the strongest type of attack in UU, and they happen to be Miltank's only weakness. Hitmontop, Primeape, Hitmonlee, Poliwrath, Toxicroak, and Hariyama all present huge problems for Miltank. Steel-types and bulky Rock-types are all big threats for Miltank as well, resisting its STAB attacks and usually dealing significant damage back to Miltank.</p>

<p>Encore and Taunt can stop any set-up or healing that Miltank might try and will generally force Miltank out. Haze Milotic can easily remove any Curses that Miltank might have gotten, and with Haze's massive PP, Miltank cannot hope to stall it out. Venusaur can be a serious obstacle for Miltank, using Sleep Powder on it and then proceeding to heavily damage it with Leaf Storm or set up Swords Dance or Leech Seed.</p>
