[Overview]

<p>Slowbro is a bulky and reliable choice for many teams in UU with his ability to check a large portion of the physical sweepers in the tier. He can fit well into frail, offensive teams in need of a little insurance against the likes of Azumarill and Fighting-types, while also providing useful paralysis support and doing reasonable amounts of damage with his own attacks. Slowbro's low Speed is made up for by his good defenses, and this also makes him one of the most reliable users of Trick Room in the game. While commonly seen only as a defensive threat, Slowbro can also very quickly go onto the offensive with Calm Mind or Choice Specs, making the most of his respectable Special Attack and wide movepool.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Slowbro is one of the physically bulkiest Water-types in the game, and his useful resistances to Fighting, Water, and Fire allow him to check a lot of UU's biggest threats. Instant recovery in the form of Slack Off means he has incredible staying power against physical sweepers, and his Psychic typing and ability to reliably spread paralysis with Thunder Wave set him firmly apart from other bulky Water-types such as Milotic. The combination of 95 base HP and 110 base Defense is very hard to break with neutral attacks, and when instant recovery is thrown on top of it, physical sweepers will struggle even more to bypass Slowbro. He brings a whole host of very threatening Pokemon, including Azumarill, Hariyama, Feraligatr, Hitmonlee, Hitmontop, Poliwrath, and Arcanine, to a grinding halt.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Slack Off is a great asset, with the reliable recovery it provides allowing Slowbro to wall physical attackers all game long. Many physical sweepers cannot do over 50% to Slowbro even with super effective attacks, meaning he has little trouble alternating between attacking and recovering to stall them out. Surf utilizes Slowbro's primary Water STAB and coming off his base 100 Special Attack stat can do a sizable chunk to those who don't resist it, making it an obvious move choice.</p>

<p>Psychic is an excellent choice as an auxiliary attack since it makes the most of Slowbro's secondary STAB, and more importantly, allows him to hit the myriad Fighting- and Poison-types of UU super effectively. A strong STAB Psychic makes quick work of Hitmonlee and Hitmontop, whose high Special Defense stats mean they can survive more Surfs than you'd care for, and it also allows you to break the Substitutes of bulkier Hariyama and Azumarill. In addition, it hits Venusaur very hard, ensures that physical Toxicroak doesn't threaten Slowbro in the slightest, and also enables him to actually damage other Water-types such as Milotic. Water and Psychic together have great neutral coverage, with the combination being resisted only by other Slowbro, Slowking, and Exeggutor in UU, whereas the Water and Ice combination used by many other bulky Waters lacks such good coverage.</p>

<p>A status move in the last slot provides a way of threatening the Pokemon Slowbro cannot hurt significantly with his attacks. Both Thunder Wave and Toxic are viable options, and which one is more beneficial depends on the rest of the team. Thunder Wave brings many opposing Pokemon down to around Slowbro's Speed level and is very helpful when playing with a team of other slower sweepers such as Torterra and Hariyama. It's also particularly effective since almost all of the Pokemon who are immune to Thunder Wave will take massive damage from Slowbro's STAB attacks (watch out for Torterra, though). Toxic, on the other hand, gives Slowbro a greater ability to take opponents out himself with less support from his team; with Slack Off and his high defenses, Slowbro can outlast the majority of UU. Light Screen is a helpful option as it patches up Slowbro's lower Special Defense while at the same time supporting the rest of the team temporarily. However, it's worth noting that without a status move, many Pokemon will see Slowbro as a non-threat and will simply use him as a free switch in.</p>

<p>While Slowbro's Water/Psychic dual typing does bring him many valuable resistances, it gives Slowbro quite a few exploitable weaknesses as well. Despite his bulk, which often allows Slowbro to survive even super effective physical attacks, you'll want to pair up Slowbro with a Pokemon who can take these hits more easily to take some of the pressure off of Slowbro. Venusaur, as well as being a big threat to Slowbro, also makes for a great partner with his ability to take the Grass and Electric attacks that Slowbro attracts. Venusaur also automatically absorbs Toxic Spikes upon switching in, which, despite their rarity, obviously destroy Slowbro's defensive potential. Specially defensive Clefable also has good synergy with Slowbro, possessing an immunity to Ghost-type attacks and the defensive stats to switch into threatening special attackers. If Clefable is already poisoned with Toxic Orb, she can come in on almost all Venusaur sets with ease due to her immunities to Sleep Powder and Leech Seed. She can also spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, and this defensive pairing makes a great backbone for teams based around slow attackers. Both these Pokemon can come into Toxic from defensive Milotic, who is a big problem for Slowbro if he isn't carrying Toxic himself, as he will be forced out by Milotic almost every time.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While Slowbro usually plays the role of a passive, defensive bulky Water-type, Calm Mind provides a way for him to gradually become a very real offensive threat, while at the same time patching up Slowbro's less than stellar Special Defense. With access to Slack Off for instant recovery and good coverage with his STAB attacks, Slowbro makes for a reliable and powerful tank after a few boosts.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Getting good coverage with only two attacks is of great importance on this set, since you will be heavily relying on them to do damage. Thankfully, Slowbro's Water and Psychic STABs pair up for neutral coverage on the vast majority of UU. When using Surf and Psychic, Special Attack investment is not really needed as Surf will 2HKO Chansey at +6, and Psychic will do the same to Milotic.</p>

<p>Although he looks hard to stop on paper, Calm Mind Slowbro can run into several problems in practice. The biggest one is status, in particular Toxic. Slowbro is very vulnerable to Toxic from the likes of Milotic and Chansey, both of whom can only be beaten by Slowbro after significant set up. Rest and Sleep Talk can be run over Psychic and Slack Off to greatly increase Slowbro's durability, but it would mean Slowbro is completely helpless against Toxicroak and other Pokemon immune to Water. Also, +6 Surf only manages 46% on average against Bold Milotic, and other Milotic might run even more Special Defense than that. Another problem is that strong Electric and Grass special attacks can OHKO Slowbro even after he has started to set up. The Special Defense investment helps this somewhat, and means that after two Calm Minds, Specs Sceptile Leaf Storm (the strongest special attack Slowbro will likely face) won't OHKO. Finally, Slowbro needs to be wary of Haze Milotic, since she can come in for free on 3/4 of Slowbro's moves and erase all his hard work in a single turn.</p>

<p>For these reasons, Venusaur makes an almost ideal partner for a Calm Mind Slowbro - he resists both Electric and Grass, comes with a very useful immunity to Toxic, and instantly threatens Milotic. Opposing Venusaur' Leaf Storms will do miniscule damage, while you can threaten a 2HKO back with Sludge Bomb. Chansey and Milotic fail to leave much of a mark, and Venusaur can use Leech Seed to drain their health (which can later be passed to Slowbro if need be) or even set up Swords Dance on them. Nasty Plot Houndoom with a Passho Berry and Beat Up makes a great partner as well, since he lures in Milotic like no other and 2HKOs with +2 Dark Pulse while surviving a Surf because of the berry. He also gets a quick surprise kill on Chansey with Beat Up. Slowbro and Houndoom have pretty great type synergy together too, with Houndoom resisting Ghost, Dark, and Grass, and Slowbro providing Fighting and Water resistances. Chansey and Clefable are also good teammates to have because they can use Aromatherapy to cure any unexpected status ailments Slowbro gets afflicted with. The RestTalk version greatly appreciates Toxic Spikes on the opponent's field to help it beat the likes of Milotic.</p>

<p>Encore users will ruin Slowbro's sweep, since he is so slow that they are almost guaranteed to outspeed him. Common Encore users include Clefable, Alakazam, Poliwrath, and Jumpluff. The best way to deal with them is to simply have a hard hitting teammate that can come in for free on the Encore and regain your momentum. Torterra works well with Slowbro here, his powerful Wood Hammer making short work of Clefable, Alakazam, and Poliwrath, and an immunity to Leech Seed helping him deal with Jumpluff. If you invest in his Special Defense, he makes an even more reliable check for Alakazam as well.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Slowbro and Slowking share a lot of things in common, and one of these is the ability to set up Trick Room. When opting for one of them on a Trick Room team, it is important to choose the right one for your team's needs, as both do a slightly different job well. There is little use trying to use Slowbro to both set up Trick Room and sweep during it, since Slowking has access to Nasty Plot, which allows him to become a threat much faster than Slowbro can with Calm Mind. Conversely, Slowbro is usually the preferable choice for a super bulky Trick Room supporter, as Slowbro's higher Defense stat makes the most of his resistances to common physical Fighting and Water attacks and allows him to do the job slightly better than his sibling.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Surf and Psychic once again make for the best two attack combination. Slack Off allows Slowbro to come in and use Trick Room multiple times, which is a great asset to have as a Trick Room supporter since the field effect lasts for such a short period of time. Good partners for this Slowbro set are Pokemon who can make the most of Trick Room - namely slow, powerful, and preferably bulky sweepers. Rhyperior and Marowak are both extremely threatening in this regard and have some limited type synergy with Slowbro in that they can come in on predicted Electric attacks for free. However, because of the rarity of Electric-type attacks, and because of the shared crippling weakness to Grass, it's highly recommended to run a Pokemon that can come into Grass-type moves with little trouble alongside them. Hariyama is also a great partner, with Close Combat, one of the strongest physical attacks in UU, at its disposal. It can also increase its firepower even further by deliberately activating Guts with a Toxic or Flame Orb, or by using Bulk Up. However, this can often be hard to pull off, as the former slashes Hariyama's longevity, while the latter may come to naught as Hariyama is forced to switch once Trick Room runs out. Hariyama does have useful resistances to Dark and Bug to come in on, though.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Slowbro's biggest advantages over other more powerful Specs users is his ability to cripple Chansey and other special walls with a Tricked Choice Specs, and the surprise value involved when a cute, defensive hermit crab hits with enough power to 2HKO Clefable. That, and Slowbro's considerable bulk even with just HP investment making up for its abysmal Speed, make Slowbro a slow but powerful Choice Specs tank.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Surf and Psychic get great neutral coverage in UU by themselves, and this is an excellent quality for any Specs user since prediction is much less of an issue when you can just choose between your powerful STAB attacks to throw out and catch the switch-in. Trick is a self-explanatory move, ruining the walling potential of any Chansey who come in to Toxic Slowbro. However, it should be noted that Tricking straightaway against an unscouted team is not advised at all - it's much better to hit an incoming Venusaur or Sceptile with Psychic than give them a power boost, especially in the case of Sceptile, who often wields Specs itself and will then gets a free attack against your team. In the last slot, Slack Off will let Slowbro function more like a wall once he has tricked his Specs away, and even while he is still holding them in a pinch. Grass Knot completes the attacking combination for perfect coverage, 2HKOing the most specially defensive of Milotic and giving you an attack to hit opposing Slowbro and Slowking with as well.</p>

<p>Using Pokemon who can take advantage of weakened and Choice-locked special walls maximizes the potency of this set. Since Clefable is 2HKOed by Specs Surf, and if predicted right, Chansey will be locked into a single move, a SubRoost Moltres can make for a deadly partner. Clefable is one of its biggest checks because of her pseudo-immunity to Toxic, and so once Clefable is weakened, she can be removed easily with a Flamethrower. Chansey will be unable to touch Moltres at all once she is locked into a single attack, and will be stalled out by Roost and Pressure. If you can keep Stealth Rock off the field, Moltres makes a good defensive complement to Slowbro, with the ability to come into both Venusaur's Leaf Storm and Scyther's Bug Bite with ease and pose an immediate threat. In return, Slowbro helps out against Azumarill, who can use a combination of Waterfall and Aqua Jet to break Moltres's Substitute and then subsequently take it out.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Slowbro has a very wide movepool for a bulky Water, but unfortunately most of it is of little use. In addition to Surf, Psychic, Ice Beam, and Grass Knot, Slowbro can use Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Shadow Ball, Focus Blast, and Signal Beam. The Fire moves' only target in UU that isn't hit as hard by Ice Beam or Slowbro's STABs is Registeel, and it poses a minimal threat to Slowbro because Registeel has a low Attack stat and no form of recovery bar Rest. All the other moves have no notable targets that aren't hit suitably as hard by one of Slowbro's STABs.</p>

<p>There are also several viable support moves that Slowbro can use and could be helpful depending on your team's needs. Yawn can cause a lot of switches, and Slowbro has the bulk to use it effectively. Counter is an interesting choice against Pokemon such as Scyther and Drapion, who will try to overpower Slowbro on the physical side with super effective moves, but it is quite unreliable as most players tend to prey on Slowbro's weaker Special Defense. Curse is quite a gimmicky option, and is better left to Slowking anyway, as his superior Special Defense allows him to pull it off more effectively.</p>

<p>With Slowbro receiving physical Water STAB in the form of Aqua Tail from Platinum move tutors, a set utilizing Trick Room, Belly Drum, Aqua Tail and Zen Headbutt could be attempted. A Sitrus Berry is a good idea as it effectively halves the cost of using Belly Drum and is more beneficial for the make or break type of sweep Slowbro attempts with this strategy as compared to Leftovers' more consistent recovery. Slowbro's other physical attacks include Earthquake and Drain Punch, the latter of which might still be viable alongside Aqua Tail, especially if a Chansey comes in expecting a Surf as you Belly Drum. However, the entire strategy is very risky and situational, and so should not be relied on.</p>

<p>Putting 252 EVs into Slowbro's HP should be the first step for almost all the sets, since it maximizes his overall bulkiness. Then the remainder of the EVs should be allocated into Defense for the more tankish sets, and Special Attack for the Specs set. Investing significantly in Special Defense is generally fruitless, as it detracts from Slowbro's physical hit-taking ability too much and because Milotic or Slowking perform better at special walling. For example, the standard Blaziken's Fire Blast followed by a Hidden Power Grass will beat Slowbro after Stealth Rock damage. Guaranteeing survival against this, taking into account the damage Slowbro sustains from Stealth Rock upon entry, would require you to run almost max Special Defense alongside max HP, at which point you're just better off using Slowking or Milotic.</p>

<p>Running max HP and max Defense allows Slowbro to survive quite a few super effective physical attacks - with this investment, a max health Slowbro is guaranteed to never be OHKOed by a Choice Band Rhyperior's Megahorn, letting Slowbro retaliate with a last-ditch Surf. Reducing the HP stat down to 212 EVs and using a Leftovers number is not recommended, as it detracts from Slowbro's overall bulkiness, and the difference in Leftovers gain is insignificant when taking into account Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>If you are particularly worried about Spiritomb, 44 Speed EVs allow Slowbro to outspeed minimum Speed versions. However, this is rarely a worthwhile investment because it is solely for Spiritomb, and Slowbro won't really be beating the ghost even if he is faster.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Venusaur can come in on Surf, Toxic, or Slack Off and pose an immediate threat to Slowbro with his powerful STAB Grass attacks. Sceptile fares similarly, and while it isn't quite as specially bulky as Venusaur, neither is it weak to Psychic. Torterra is immune to Thunder Wave, isn't hit super effectively by either of Slowbro's STABs, and has a high chance to OHKO with a Life Orb-boosted Wood Hammer after Stealth Rock. Ludicolo packs a 4x resistance to Surf and has a high Special Defense for taking Psychics as well. With his Grass STAB, he can use Energy Ball or Grass Knot to quickly dispose of Slowbro. Chansey and Clefable are both undaunted by status, Chansey because of Natural Cure and Clefable because of Magic Guard and her tendency to hold Toxic Orb. Both have very high Special Defense and threaten Slowbro with Toxics of their own. If Slowbro is carrying Thunder Wave over Toxic, Lanturn can come in without much trouble and threaten with a super effective STAB Thunderbolt.</p>

<p>Spiritomb doesn't mind Toxic unduly since he often carries Rest, and threatens to come in on his Psychic immunity. Calm Mind versions are particularly dangerous to Slowbro as Spiritomb has 5 higher base Speed, and so can Calm Mind up to take less and less damage from Surf before he hits back with his own STAB super effective Dark Pulse. As long as Mismagius avoids Thunder Wave, she can take a weak hit with her base 105 Special Defense and OHKO Slowbro with Shadow Ball. Specially defensive Drapion can come in on a Psychic, prevent Slowbro from healing or statusing Drapion with Taunt, and then Swords Dance up and beat Slowbro with Crunch. Curse Registeel also sees Slowbro as nothing but setup fodder.</p>
