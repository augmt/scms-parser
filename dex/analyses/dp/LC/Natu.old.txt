[Overview]

<p>While it tends to be a little outclassed by Abra in the attacking department, Natu is quite unique when it comes to supporting the entire team. Believe it or not, Natu does bring some valuable resistances to the table despite its mediocre defenses; x4 resistance to Fighting-type moves and x2 resistance to Grass-type moves can come in handy. As an added bonus, it also has a Ground-type immunity. With these resistances, Natu has an ample amount of opportunity to support the team with the right prediction and support. Last but not least, U-turn gives it a slight advantage over Abra as it lessens the prediction needed to keep Munchlax and Stunky from potentially trapping it. Overall, Natu is definitely an interesting Pokemon and should not be overlooked.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Natu can function as an effective Choice user with its good Speed and Special Attack stat. The choice between the items depends on what you're planning to do with Natu. Choice Specs allows Natu to hit as hard as possible, while Choice Scarf boosts its Speed to 25 - an excellent Speed benchmark to hit the Little Cup metagame. This ensures that Natu is not outpaced by the likes of Mankey and Houndour. Psychic and Heat Wave provide optimal coverage alongside each other, while Hidden Power Fighting deals with the pesky Munchlax. U-turn is the crux of the set, allowing Natu to escape from Stunky's grasp.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Natu's STAB options are pretty mediocre to begin with, since there are a number of Pokemon that resist both Psychic- and Flying-type attacks. In the absence of a decent Flying-type option, Natu can only muster Psychic for its main STAB move, which allows it to strike Fighting-types for super effective damage, as well as Munchlax for a 3HKO. With Choice Specs equipped, Heat Wave will always 2HKO Bronzor on the switch -- a common switch-in to this set, with a 2.56% chance of OHKOing Bronzor with Stealth Rock down. Shadow Ball could be used over Heat Wave to hit Psychic-types for super effective damage, along with Bronzor for neutral damage. However, Bronzor and Steel-types in general are far more common than Psychic-types. Hidden Power Fighting is Natu's more reliable move against Stunky, as Heat Wave's accuracy is shaky. Hidden Power Fighting also smacks Munchlax much harder than Psychic would, as it deals 42.42% - 54.55% on standard Munchlax. The final slot is U-turn, and can used with both Choice Specs and Choice Scarf, as it allows Natu to escape from a possible Stunky trap.</p>

<p>Natu pairs well with Substitute Diglett, as Natu can use U-turn on a predicted switch to Stunky or Munchlax and buy a free switch to Diglett, who can then use Earthquake to take them out. Substitute ensures Diglett won't die from Stunky's Sucker Punch. Natu also appreciates Stealth Rock support because it has a slim chance of OHKOing Bronzor with Heat Wave otherwise.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Reflect
move 2: Light Screen
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Wish / Roost
item: Light Clay / Oran Berry
ability: Synchronize
nature: Timid
evs: 116 HP / 36 Atk / 76 Def / 76 SpD / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Natu's unique typing and access to dual screens allow it to become a valuable addition on any team that requires dual screens support. Despite its mediocre defensive stats, Natu boasts impressive resistances to Grass- and Fighting-type attacks, along with an immunity to Ground-type moves. This gives Natu an ample number of opportunities to set up dual screens on many Choiced Pokemon, with a particular emphasis on Fighting-types, in the metagame. Wish and U-turn make an excellent combo, as it allows Natu to Wish-pass with ease. Roost is optional if you prefer to heal yourself instantly.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The basic idea of the set is to set up dual screens on a predicted switch-out by the likes of Mankey or Machop. After that, Natu can use U-turn to safely bring in a set-up Pokemon that appreciates dual screens support such as Dratini, Buizel, and Krabby. Natu also has Wish in its arsenal, and is one of the few Pokemon who can use Wish in conjunction with U-turn. With dual screens, Wish and U-turn, the next switch-in is almost bound to get at least a single boost in. If you're looking to focus on Wish alone, then Psychic could go over Light Screen or Reflect so Natu has a chance against Taunt users. Roost could go over Wish in order to heal off Natu's nasty weakness to Stealth Rock in one turn. Roost generally keeps Natu's health in mint condition and ensures Natu can set up dual screens once again in later stages of the match.</p>

<p>Set-up Pokemon are the best offensive partners for Natu, as they can easily take advantage of eight turn dual screens on the field. Dratini is a prime example of a Pokemon who excels with dual screens support, as it can wreak havoc after getting two Dragon Dance boosts. Krabby gets a special mention as well because it can set up both Agility and Swords Dance with its already high Defense stat, in conjunction with Reflect and Light Screen support. Basically, any set-up Pokemon can fit in with this particular set because most set-up users benefit from dual screens support.</p>

[SET]
name: Calm Mind
move 1: Calm Mind
move 2: Psychic
move 3: Substitute
move 4: Baton Pass / Heat Wave
item: Salac Berry
ability: Synchronize
nature: Timid
evs: 116 HP / 196 SpA / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Instead of the usual "hit-and-run" strategy, this set aims to take advantage of the move Calm Mind. The purpose of this set is twofold: support the team with Baton Pass or sweep with a pure attacking set. The choice ultimately comes down to the final move of the set. If you're planning to use Natu as a support passer, then Baton Pass is the obvious choice. However, if you're planning to sweep with Natu, then Heat Wave is more desirable.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Calm Mind is the most obvious move in this set, as it boosts Natu's Special Attack and Special Defense stat. Psychic is Natu's STAB move and can hit quite hard after a single boost. Substitute is a key move in this set that benefits Natu for two reasons. Firstly, it shields Natu from the common priority moves in the LC metagame. Secondly, it helps run down Natu's HP to a point where Salac Berry activates. As an added bonus, Natu can pass a possible Speed boost along with a Substitute to another teammate. As mentioned before, Baton Pass supports another teammate by passing along boosts while Heat Wave provides optimal coverage in conjunction with Psychic if you're planning to sweep with Natu.</p>

<p>Much like the Choice set, Substitute Diglett helps remove Munchlax and Stunky. Thankfully, Baton Pass can help bring in Diglett safely because Baton Pass can be used to escape Pursuit. Although, if Natu is planning to use Heat Wave over Baton Pass, then it requires a fair amount of prediction to get Diglett in safely on Munchlax and Stunky.</p>

<p>Pokemon who benefit from a Calm Mind boost and a possible Speed boost are considered good partners alongside this particular set. Houndour shines really well with Natu because it values the possible Speed boost along with the Calm Mind boost which help it sweep. As an added bonus, Houndour can make a safe switch in on Dark-type moves directed at Natu. Mixed Dratini doesn't mind the Calm Mind boost as well, as it makes Draco Meteor's damage output much stronger. Dratini can make an entrance on Electric-type attacks aimed at Natu. If Natu is looking to pass on a Speed boost and Substitute without the Calm Mind boost, Machop seems like the perfect partner. With a resistance to Dark-type moves, the opponent won't be able to break Machop's Substitute. Furthermore, Machop is extremely dangerous behind a Substitute and a Speed boost because it can juggle an entire team with Dynamic Punch.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Attacker
move 1: Zen Headbutt
move 2: Sucker Punch
move 3: Drill Peck / Pluck
move 4: U-turn / Heat Wave
item: Choice Band / Life Orb
ability: Synchronize
nature: Adamant
evs: 116 HP / 196 Atk / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>A Choice Band or a Life Orb helps Natu inflict damage from the physical side. While Natu's Attack stat isn't exactly superb, it does have a couple of physical moves to catch its typical counters off guard. For example, Stunky would suffer a 2HKO from Drill Peck while Munchlax will always fall under a 2HKO from Zen Headbutt. It's bittersweet that Natu doesn't even OHKO the two, but it still makes an excellent Stunky and Munchlax lure. U-turn allows it to scout the opponent.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Zen Headbutt is the STAB of choice here, which can 2HKO Munchlax. The additional 20% flinch can come in handy at certain times. Sucker Punch is a nifty move to catch Gastly off guard. The third slot is a tough choice between Drill Peck and Pluck. Drill Peck is preferred on the Choice Band set if Natu is looking to grab the 2HKO on Stunky. However, Pluck is the better alternative with Life Orb. Pluck's special side effect allows it to steal the opponent's Berry. Natu could grab a possible Speed boost from Salac Berry, or restore some health with Oran Berry in the process. The final slot is for U-turn which helps Natu scout incoming switches. If you decide to run Life Orb over Choice Band, Heat Wave is the desirable choice over U-turn so Natu actually stands a chance against Bronzor. However, Natu would need a Naughty nature over Adamant in that case.</p>

<p>Since Natu will lure in Munchlax and Stunky for the most part, Choice Scarf Gastly can take advantage of their removal from the match. Elekid makes a great partner as well due to its ability to sweep late game. Furthermore, Elekid can take advantage of Natu's ability to possibly steal Oran Berries, which makes Elekid's sweep significantly easier.</p>

<p>Bronzor will always trouble this particular set even with Heat Wave, as Bronzor will eventually bypass Natu's mediocre defenses with Flash Cannon. Natu can't afford to waste its time trying to take down Bronzor with Heat Wave's unreliable accuracy, while Bronzor sets up. As such, Magby or Ponyta should be around to scare it off with their Fire-type moves. A defensive Gligar doesn't mind coming in on this set as well, and it can use a free turn to set up Stealth Rock or take Natu down with Stone Edge. Pair Natu with Wynaut in order to bring down Gligar with Counter or bring a Bronzor of your own to check Gligar.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Natu has a couple of sweet support moves: Trick Room, Thunder Wave, and Psycho Shift. Natu could set up Trick Room with ease, and then employ U-turn to safely bring in your attacker. Thunder Wave could cripple Natu's common switch-ins. A set with Psycho Shift / Baton Pass / Calm Mind / Psychic could work well in theory. Natu with Flame Orb can pass a burn to Stunky, Munchlax, and other Fighting-types, and Natu can set up Calm Mind in front of Stunky and Munchlax once their physical prowess have been drastically reduced. If you're looking to weather the physical hits that are dished at Natu, it can run an EV spread of 196 HP / 236 Def / 76 SpD.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>On the Choice (Special) set, Bronzor is the safest switch-in as it resists Psychic and it can use a free turn to set up Stealth Rock, or take Natu down with Flash Cannon. Munchlax and Stunky also switch in with impunity, although U-turn can bring about their demise if they are lured in, trapped and subsequently executed by Diglett. Munchlax can use Pursuit to take Natu down, while Stunky has a Psychic immunity, allowing it to safely come in and trap Natu, it also has STAB on Pursuit. Houndour can cause problems if it switches into Heat Wave.</p>

<p>Gligar and Bronzor can handle the physical set quite well. Bronzor can take Heat Wave from Natu and strike back with Flash Cannon or set up Stealth Rock. Defensive Gligar works in a similar fashion to Bronzor, as it can shrug off any attack and strike back with Stone Edge or set up Stealth Rock.</p>
