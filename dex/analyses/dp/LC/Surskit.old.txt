[Overview]

<p>Surskit is a cute little pond skater, but sadly that is pretty much the highlight of its merits. It can Baton Pass Agility, but there are better options that can do that as well. Its attacking skills at times can also seem lacking. It can work in rain, but isn't nearly as strong as other Rain Dance abusers such as Omanyte. However, what it has over its fellow special Rain Dance sweepers is that it hits 32 Speed in the Rain, allowing it to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, including Scarfed Diglett, Elekid, and Voltorb. Its unique typing means that it resists many common attacking types, namely Fighting, Ground, and Water, giving it a distinctive niche in the metagame, allowing it to outclass Omanyte when it comes to resistances. Its ability to beat Croagunk and Gligar, two major threats in the metagame, with 4x super effective attacks is something Omanyte normally would not be able to do. Don't let this little guy fool you, because with the right support around him, Surskit can be a complete monster.</p>

[Set Comments]

<p>This is the best set Surskit has to offer, despite being a touch outclassed by Omanyte. The general idea is that you bring Surskit in while it's raining, and proceed to hit as many things as possible. Hydro Pump is the main method of attack, mainly because Surskit needs power and doesn't learn Surf. Hidden Power Electric puts an end to Mantyke that think they can switch in, and STAB Hydro Pump in the rain hits Chinchou just as hard as a super effective Hidden Power Grass would. Psybeam is the weakest attack, and is mainly used as a coverage move against Croagunk, who is immune to Water and doesn't get hit very hard by Hidden Power Electric. Signal Beam is really just a filler move, but it can be useful as a secondary STAB. Quick Attack is a nice option to give Surskit a priority move in the rain. If getting another Pokemon to set up Rain Dance isn't an option, you can always drop Signal Beam and replace it with Rain Dance.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>Aipom, Bronzor, Mantyke, Meowth, and Voltorb all work extremely well alongside this Surskit. Aipom, Meowth, and Voltorb have the Speed needed in order to set up a quick Rain Dance, and the offensive ability to take something to the grave in the process. Bronzor and Mantyke are two rather bulky Pokemon, and said bulk allows them to take hits with ease, and still manage to set up Rain Dance.</p>

[SET]

move 1: Baton Pass
move 2: Agility

[Set Comments]

<p>You may think Surskit is a Pokemon who is only good in the rain, but that is not entirely the case. Surskit can effectively Baton Pass an Agility to your slower, heavy-hitting sweepers, and allow them to outpace everything but priority attacks. Hydro Pump is for powerful STAB, so you're not totally useless on your own. The final move and the item are up to personal preference. Endure can be combined with a Pinch Berry, such as a Petaya or Liechi Berry, to pass something other than just Speed. Substitute can do the same, but also allows you to pass a Substitute in order to ensure that the pass goes through. Ice Beam, although giving Surskit inferior coverage as opposed to Hidden Power Electric, prevents Dragon Dance Dratini and Bagon from setting up. Oran Berry can provide a little more bulk, though Surskit is hard-pressed to survive most attacks. Focus Sash can help ensure the pass, though Stealth Rock makes it harder to use unless Surskit is leading.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>Cubone and Porygon make two effective partners for this set. If Surskit decides to only pass a Speed boost, Cubone can make the most of the added Speed. If Surskit chooses to pass both Special Attack and Speed, then a Special Attacking tank such as Porygon would make the best option to pass to. You could even start a chain of Baton Passing, and pass to a Pokemon such as Gligar, who then can stat up on Attack and pass to a sweeper.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Surskit really doesn't have all too great a movepool, so its sets are rather limited. However, it still gets some good stuff. Bug Bite can be used on the Baton Pass set, possibly allowing it to eat an Oran Berry carried by a foe, and gain extra health to allow it to survive longer and pass on more boosts, and its Attack is only 2 points lower than its Special Attack. Shadow Ball can also be used to hit Ghosts harder than Psybeam, although Surskit does then lose coverage on Croagunk. Hidden Power Ground is viable, enabling it to hit both Croagunk and Chinchou, but an extra 4 SpD EVs are necessary. That's fine, because Surskit has plenty of EVs to spare. Unfortunately, Mantyke walls any set without Hidden Power Electric. A Choice Scarf looks appealing at first sight, but Surskit performs better in the rain. Ice Beam is a nice option, giving it "BoltBeam" coverage, only resisted by Magnemite. It is not mentioned on the Rainskit set, however, because Hydro Pump will be doing more damage to most Pokemon, except for pure Dragons such as Dratini and Bagon.</p>

<p> Maxing out Special Attack and Speed are two of Surskit's main priorities. In order to get the most out of Surskit's remaining EVs the following EV spread should be used: 36 HP / 200 SpA / 236 Spe / 20 SpD. This spread allows you to get 1 extra point in your HP and Special Defense stats, while maxing out you Special Attack and Speed stats. If using HP Ground, add an extra 4 EVs into Surskit's Special Defense.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Munchlax is the best counter around for Surskit; its defensive stats allow it take whatever Surskit throws at it, then hit back with a Return for the OHKO. Chinchou can take Surskit's hits pretty well, has a STAB Thunderbolt to strike back at Surskit with, and only fears Hidden Power Ground. Mantyke and Croagunk absorb his Hydro Pump, but Surskit will almost always carry a 4x super effective move to hit them with in the form of Hidden Power Electric and Psybeam respectively. Doduo and Taillow can outspeed Surskit without rain and revenge kill it with Brave Bird. Snover puts an end to rain and can switch in on Surskit's Hydro Pump, but needs a Choice Scarf in order to outspeed Surskit, and can't switch in on a Signal Beam.</p>
