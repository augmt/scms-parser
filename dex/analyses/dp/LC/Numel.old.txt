[Overview]

<p>Numel has decent offensive stats, which are just enough to allow it to function well as a mixed attacker. Thanks to a unique ability, Simple, it can also become quite the terrifying sweeper as the receiver in a Baton Pass chain. It also has access to Howl, which doubles its Attack thanks to Simple. However, while Numel is no slouch offensively, it does have low defenses, meaning it is quite easy to knock out. It is also weak to Water- and Ground-type attacks, which are incredibly common in the LC tier. Nonetheless, Numel, when given the correct support, can be beneficial to your team.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Overheat

move 3: Earth Power
move 4: Hidden Power Electric
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Oblivious
nature: Timid
evs: 240 SpA / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Numel is not the fastest Pokemon around, but it reaches 14 Speed, meaning that with a Choice Scarf, it will outspeed every Pokemon in the tier who are not holding a Choice Scarf themselves. Overheat is its most powerful STAB attack, and it should be used early-game to hurt and scout your opponent's switch-ins, even those who resist it. Fire Blast provides consistency, and is very useful for sweeping late-game when most of the opposing Pokemon are at low health. Earth Power provides secondary STAB, and hits Rock-type Pokemon that resist Fire Blast super effectively. Finally, Hidden Power Electric allows Numel to hit Mantyke for super effective damage, and also provides good general coverage alongside the other moves.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast which exchanges power for accuracy, though the power drop is very noticeable and can often be disastrous for Numel. Simple is not used in this set because Numel is not taking advantage of it with stat boosts, and it results in -4 Special Attack each time Overheat is used. The EV spread maximizes Numel's Special Attack and Speed, with an extra 4 EVs in Special Attack to counter Hidden Power Electric's imperfect IV for it. Bulky special walls such as Munchlax will enjoy switching into Numel, and either damage it hard with Pursuit, or hit its switch-in hard with a STAB Return. Therefore, a powerful Fighting-type would benefit Numel. A good example is Choice Scarf Mankey, being able to scout with U-turn, as well as OHKOing Munchlax with Close Combat.</p>

<p>Mantyke is a good teammate and has great synergy with Numel; Mantyke absorbs any Ground- and Water-type attacks aimed at Numel, while Numel is immune to Electric-type attacks which may be aimed at Mantyke. Mantyke and Numel are also great offensive wallbreaking partners. Gligar is also a great teammate, thanks to its ability to set up Stealth Rock, as well as scout the opponent's team with U-turn. Finally, Wynaut allows Numel to come in easier as Encore will force the opponent to repeat moves that do not threaten Numel in the slightest.</p>

[SET]
name: Trick Room Mixed Attacker
move 1: Fire Blast / Overheat
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Hidden Power Electric
move 4: Return
item: Life Orb
ability: Oblivious / Simple
nature: Quiet
evs: 36 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 240 SpA
ivs: 0 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs, Numel hits 7 Speed, outspeeding almost every Pokemon in the tier under Trick Room. Fire Blast is its main STAB attack, and will hurt any Pokemon who does not resist it or not named Munchlax. Overheat is an even more powerful and accurate option, and is useful if you don't plan on keeping Numel in for too long. Earthquake is another powerful STAB move, and it gets great coverage alongside Fire Blast, resisted only by Mantyke and Wingull in the tier, both of which are weak to Hidden Power Electric hits. Finally, Return offers good neutral coverage, and hits most Pokemon who resist Fire Blast.<p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EV spread maximizes Numel's Attack and Special Attack, with its HP and Defense stats increased by one extra point. Slowpoke has good synergy with Numel, and can also set up Trick Room, making it an ideal teammate. Slowpoke also has access to Slack Off, allowing it to set up Trick Room multiple times throughout the battle. Bronzor is also a good teammate, having the bulk to set up Trick Room as well as Stealth Rock. Eevee is a good sweeping partner, because after Numel has heavily weakened the opponent's core, Eevee will be able to come in and sweep with STAB Return or Quick Attack. Howl may be used instead of Hidden Power Electric, because once set up, Numel is very hard to stop, and the power boost can be very useful to ensure the KO on bulky threats, especially Munchlax.</p>

[SET]
name: Howl
move 1: Howl
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Overheat
item: Life Orb
ability: Simple
nature: Naughty / Naive
evs: 196 Atk / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Simple multiplies any stat boosts or drops by two, meaning Howl is equivalent to a Swords Dance boost. After Howl is used, Numel reaches 30 Attack, ready to destroy every opposing Pokemon; unfortunately, Numel will usually be let down by its mediocre Speed. To make matters worse, Numel does not receive a physical Fire-type attack. Lucky for Numel, it does have a saving grace in STAB Earthquake, and when combined with Numel's other moves and the power boost provided by Howl, Numel can deal good damge to most of the Pokemon of the LC tier, even if the opposing Pokemon resists it. Rock Slide combined with Earthquake forms the infamous QuakeEdge combo, hitting all Pokemon in LC for neutral damage except for Bronzor. The last slot, which is left to Overheat, allows Numel to hit Bronzor for super effective damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb allows Numel to hit as hard as possible, since the loss in HP is not a big deal as Numel is frail anyway. A Naughty nature allows Numel to hit as hard as possible, while Naive allows it to hit 14 Speed, tying with other common Pokemon such as Snover, Machop, and Adamant Dratini who hit 14 Speed. Its EV spread maximizes Attack and Speed, Numel's two most important stats for this set. Wynaut is a good teammate, being able to Encore an opponent, allowing Numel to set up Howl much easier. Mantyke also pairs up well with Numel, having great synergy together, as well as defeating physically bulky Pokemon such as Hippopotas.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Double-Edge is an option over Return to allow Numel to hit harder at the cost of recoil. If no Pokemon on your team have Stealth Rock, Numel can carry it over one of its coverage moves. Numel also has access to Yawn and Will-O-Wisp, but Numel's defenses are too low to make use of those moves. Finally, Lava Plume can be used for burning incoming switch-ins, though in such a fast paced metagame, Numel will almost always appreciate the extra power more.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Numel is quite frail, so any Pokemon with a somewhat decent offensive stat can take on Numel. Pokemon such as Chinchou and Mantyke can easily switch into anything but Earth Power or Hidden Power Electric respectively, and begin firing off powerful STAB Hydro Pump. Water-types with Aqua Jet can easily come in on a Fire-type attack and take out Numel before it can attack. Gligar can easily switch in on a Ground-type attack, outspeed Numel, and OHKO it with Earthquake.</p>
