[SET COMMENTS]
<p>By substituting its leaves for blades and rustling them in the best way that it can, Sunkern can perform a Swords Dance, which allows it to reach an astonishing 26 Attack after just one boost. Seed Bomb and Return together form a fearsome combination that will have many Little Cup Pokemon retreating back to the Day Care. Hidden Power Fire is there to eliminate annoying Steel-types like Magnemite who dare defy Sunkern's might. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ice can be used to remove Gligar, the bane of Little Cup's battalion of physical sweepers. Life Orb is the preferred item to add an extra kick to Sunkern's attacks in exchange for its health, but that's okay, Sunkern isn't one to stick around, it dies on the battlefield like a true fighter.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]
<p>2 Speed IVs are used in an ingenious plan to simultaneously maximize the damage output of Sunkern's Hidden Power and make its Speed the lowest possible. Slaves who will set up Trick Room at Sunkern's bidding are obviously important, and Porygon and Slowpoke make fine choices since they are easily manipulated by Sunkern's devious charm. Bronzor is especially good since it can set up Trick Room, Stealth Rock, as well as dual screens, all things that please Sunkern to no end. Chlorophyll's Speed-boosting qualities would be counterproductive on a Trick Room set, so Solar Power is the ability of choice to transform Sunkern into an offensive titan in the sun.</p>

[Other Options]
<p>Sunkern can use its Chlorophyll ability to become a vital member of a Sunny Day team, but its evil Grass-type brethren, such as Bellsprout and Exeggcute, are always conspiring behind the scenes to stop Sunkern from landing a spot on anyone's team.</p>

<p>Sunkern is an absolute beast when it comes to the Pokeathlon, if you're not satisfied with its performance in battle, why not try your luck there?</p>

[Checks and Counters]
<p>Electrode, Diglett, Nidoran, Mankey, Venusaur, Rattata, Fearow, Pidgey... pretty much everything in every iteration of the Pokerap, which means every Pokemon, in case you didn't know.</p>
