[Overview]

<p>Wailmer fills two somewhat unique niches in Little Cup: the ability to use Water Spout and the ability to use Self-Destruct.  Wailmer is one of three Pokemon who can use Water Spout in Little Cup, and its decent Speed with a Choice Scarf attached and its overall bulk makes it a good user of the move. Relying on Water Spout, however, means that Wailmer needs to be at full HP to be effective, so it cannot switch in very often.  Self-Destruct can help remedy this problem, and with a Choice Scarf Wailmer usually has a chance to use it.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Wailmer is one of the few Pokemon in Little Cup who has access to Water Spout, which can be the strongest Water-type attack depending on Wailmer's remaining HP. But with Wailmer's mediocre Speed, Water Spout loses a lot of its usefulness, since Wailmer could very well be low on health by the time it uses it. Equipping a Choice Scarf on Wailmer is the easiest solution, allowing it to outspeed every Pokemon in Little Cup who do not have a Choice Scarf or have raised their Speed in some other manner.</p>

<p>Water Spout can OHKO many of the fragile Pokemon in Little Cup, and will usually be the attack of choice for Wailmer. However, Stealth Rock, priority, and opponents attacking can really eat up a lot of Wailmer's HP. Surf or Hydro Pump is therefore used as the second attack, ensuring that Wailmer will continue to hit hard even after its HP is low. Hydro Pump has plenty of power, but also has an accuracy of 80%. In such a fast paced metagame, accuracy can make all the difference. If you choose Surf, you do lose a lot of power, but you have perfect accuracy; the choice comes down to preference. Ice Beam allows Wailmer to take out Paras (who boasts an immunity to Water-type attacks) but it can also hurt other Grass-types, such as Treecko. In the last slot, Hidden Power Electric can be used to hit Mantyke, who is immune to Water attacks, and other Water-types. Hidden Power Ground can be used to try and KO Croagunk, who also has an immunity to Water Spout, and Chinchou. However, Hidden Power Ground does leave Wailmer helpless against Gligar, who can take that opportunity to set up. Self-Destruct is a great way to finish off a Wailmer counter, especially if Wailmer has taken too much damage and can't effectively use Water Spout any longer. However, if you are going to run Self-Destruct, move the HP EVs into Attack and go with a Hasty nature.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Pokemon who are holding a Focus Sash are a major concern for Wailmer as it will not be able to OHKO them with Water Spout, allowing them to hit back and take away some of Wailmer's health. Having Stealth Rock support in conjunction with Wailmer is the best solution to this problem, as Stealth Rock also weakens other Pokemon and puts them into OHKO range. Snover is also a problem for this set since it can switch into all of Wailmer's attacks. Bronzor can handle Snover and set up Stealth Rock. Paras and Croagunk, who are both immune to Water-type attacks, can prove to be very big problems for Wailmer. A Diglett with Earthquake, Aerial Ace, and Sucker Punch can be a great way to trap and eliminate these Pokemon. Wynaut can also trap and eliminate Croagunk. Porygon makes a fantastic partner for Wailmer, as it can Ice Beam or Thunderbolt any Water- or Grass-types who resist Wailmer's STAB attacks.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Wailmer only has one viable set and that is the Choice Scarf set. Rest has potential with Wailmer's huge HP and can boost Water Spout back to full power, but relying on Sleep Talk and hoping not to take a hit while sleeping is a big risk. A Choice Specs set can have some merits, but Wailmer is too slow to pull it off well. Wailmer can try to bluff Choice Scarf or Choice Specs by holding Wise Glasses, but once your opponent figures it out, Wailmer is nearly useless. Wailmer can also attempt try to abuse its mediocre speed in a Trick Room team.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Croagunk, Wooper, and Paras all have an immunity to Water-type attacks, making them immune to half of the set. Other Choice Scarf Pokemon can really dent Wailmer by taking away its powerful Water Spout and forcing it to use its weaker Water-type attacks. Focus Sash, priority, and resistances are always a big problem for the whale, since it will be locked into one move. Snover resists Wailmer's most powerful attack and can fight back with STAB Grass-type moves. Wynaut can revenge kill Wailmer easily.</p>
