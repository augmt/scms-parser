[Overview]

<p>Grimer's poor typing, coupled with its imbalanced stat distribution, makes it seem a bit underwhelming at first glance, and this might drive some people away from using it. However, Grimer's fair amount of bulk and great Attack stat actually allow it to be an effective offensive Pokemon. Its extensive movepool allows it to help break down walls or even sweep late-game with its great type coverage. No matter what Grimer's job is, it will be a great asset to any team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set utilizes Grimer's great Attack stat to deal huge amounts of damage to the opposing Pokemon. Gunk Shot is Grimer's main STAB move, and despite having poor coverage and accuracy, provides raw power. Poison Jab is a good alternative if you want a more reliable STAB option; however, the drop in power is very noticeable. Shadow Sneak provides Grimer with priority, and allows it to pick off weakened Pokemon. Fire Punch aids Grimer in dealing with Steel-type Pokemon that wall the rest of the set, while Ice Punch lets Grimer nail Gligar on the switch. If Grimer has Poison Jab instead of Gunk Shot in the first slot, Ice Punch also provides a strong, reliable answer to Dratini, but otherwise it is unnecessary for that purpose, as a neutral Gunk Shot packs more power than a super effective Ice Punch. Finally, Explosion allows Grimer to go out with a bang, dealing huge amounts of damage even to Pokemon that resist it.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As any choice of move in the third moveslot leaves Grimer vulnerable to certain Pokemon, partnering it with a solid counter to those Pokemon greatly benefits Grimer. If Ice Punch is used, Steel-types completely wall this set; therefore, Choice Scarf Magnemite makes a good teammate, trapping them via Magnet Pull and taking them out with a STAB Thunderbolt. If Fire Punch is used, there are no Pokemon that resist all of Grimer's attacks, but Gligar can easily come in and set up a Swords Dance without fear. Pairing Grimer with Choice Scarf Snover can remedy this, as it can take down Gligar with Blizzard, while taking little damage from Earthquake. Oran Berry can be used in lieu of Life Orb to restore Grimer's health, but the extra power will be sorely missed.</p>

<p>Choice Scarf Magnemite is a great teammate if Grimer lacks Fire Punch, beating all Steel-types who would wall this set otherwise. A Pokemon that can counter Gligar is helpful. Bronzor would do well in this case, being immune to Earthquake and able to shrug off all of Gligar's auxiliary moves reasonably well. Bronzor can then retaliate with Hidden Power Ice. Bronzor also beats most Ground-types that hit Grimer hard.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Grimer has the ability to run a special set consisting of Sludge Bomb, Thunderbolt, Fire Blast, and Hidden Power Ice, but Grimer's sub-par Special Attack stat greatly lowers its viability. Substitute can be used in the third slot to scout for Pokemon that counter Grimer, but it loses out on coverage as a consequence. Grimer has a couple of other moves that it can successfully utilize. Payback can be used to hit Ghost-types harder, while Rock Slide can be used to deal more damage to Flying-, Bug-, and Fire-types.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Steel-types such as Bronzor counter Grimer very well. Unless Grimer carries Fire Punch, it cannot hurt Bronzor much, and Bronzor can proceed to set up Stealth Rock before hitting Grimer hard with Psychic. Gligar can also switch into any move bar Ice Punch and proceed to Earthquake, or U-turn to scout the switch-in. Diglett cannot switch into any move, because a combination of Grimer's STAB move and Shadow Sneak has a chance of knocking it out. </p>
