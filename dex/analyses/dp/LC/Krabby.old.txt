[Overview]

<p>Krabby's great Attack and Defense can make him very difficult to handle. In spite of his vulnerability to special attacks, proper team support can make Krabby a very formidable sweeper. If Krabby manages to get both a Swords Dance and an Agility boost, the opponent's only real hope is to chip away at Krabby with priority attacks. Krabby also has a great ability in Shell Armor, which means that a critical hit will never put an end to his sweep.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Krabby is blessed with a great base Attack, but his middling Speed and subpar Special Defense hinder his ability to pull off a sweep without a boost. Krabby attains perfect coverage through the use of two moves, Crabhammer and Return, so he can use the two remaining move slots to set up for a sweep. With an Adamant nature and after a Swords Dance, Krabby reaches an astronomical 44 Attack, which has a chance to OHKO every Pokemon in Little Cup, with the exception of Slowpoke. Krabby can also be effective without Swords Dance, however. X-Scissor is the recommended replacement, since, with a Life Orb, Krabby has a chance to OHKO Slowpoke if Stealth Rock is in play.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The idea of this set is to come in on a Pokemon who cannot threaten Krabby, like Bronzor or a weak physical attacker, and Agility on the switch. With the boost, Krabby reaches 28 Speed, which is surpassed only by Choice Scarf variants of Elekid, Diglett, and Voltorb. Fortunately, these are very rare sights in Little Cup.</p>

<p>Oran Berry is the recommended item so that Krabby can still get a boost off even if your opponent does not switch. Life Orb can also be an effective item, as it provides the extra oomph to turn some 2HKOs into OHKOs. If you go with Life Orb, dual screen support is recommended to preserve some of Krabby's durability. The EVs maximize Krabby's Attack and Speed while gaining a point in HP and Defense to help with his survivability. Shell Armor prevents a critical hit from prematurely ending his sweep, though Hyper Cutter can be used if you are worried about Intimidate users like Ekans and Snubbull.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Crabhammer
move 2: Return
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Brick Break / Superpower / X-Scissor
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Shell Armor
nature: Adamant
evs: 36 HP / 36 Def / 236 Atk / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although a maximum Speed of 14 is mediocre at best, Krabby outspeeds all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup with a Choice Scarf attached. Krabby also has a great Attack stat, allowing him to do substantial damage even without help from Swords Dance or a Choice Band. The combination of Crabhammer and Return will hit every Pokemon in Little Cup for at least neutral damage, while the other moves provide for additional coverage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Crabhammer and Return are the primary attacks on this set, since they provide unresisted coverage. Rock Slide will hit Mantyke who expect to absorb a Crabhammer for super effective damage. Brick Break provides further coverage, and it can also break any screens that your opponent has set up. Superpower can be used if you want to hit harder, but the resulting Attack and Defense drop means that Krabby cannot stay in for long. Additionally, X-Scissor can be used if Grass- and Psychic-types give you trouble.</p>

<p>The EVs are relatively simple, allowing Krabby to hit a sky-high 22 Attack and 21 Speed. Krabby also gets an extra point in both HP and Defense, providing him with more survivability. Shell Armor should be used to prevent a critical hit from ruining your day.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Krabby does not have many other moves to work with. He learns Flail, which can be used with a Focus Sash to net a surprise KO. However, Krabby's subpar Speed stat makes it unlikely that you will score more than a single KO. Krabby could run a Choice Band set with the same moves as the Choice Scarf set, but his mediocre Speed remains an issue.</p>

<p>Double-Edge is illegal with Agility but can be used over Return on the Choice Scarf set to add a bit more attacking power, though the recoil damage often outweighs the boost. Krabby learns Iron Defense to boost its already sky-high Defense stat, but his vulnerability to special attacks makes it gimmicky at best. He also learns Knock Off, which can be used to get rid of pesky Oran Berries, but Krabby is often better off trying to KO through them.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any bulky special attacker can beat Krabby in most cases. Chinchou can switch in on either of Krabby's set-up moves and either outspeed him or survive an unboosted Return and OHKO with Thunderbolt. Mantyke is immune to Crabhammer and can threaten Krabby with a super effective Hidden Power. Croagunk is a great counter to Krabby, since he can come in on Crabhammer unscathed and inflict massive damage with Vacuum Wave.</p>
