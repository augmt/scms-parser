[Overview]

<p>At first glance, Slugma comes off as an extremely poor Pokemon. Its only above-average stat is its base 70 Special Attack, and a horrid 20 Speed means it won't be outspeeding many Pokemon. Due to this, it is easy to see why many people think Slugma follows in its older sibling Magcargo's footsteps.</p>

<p>However, if you look deeper, Slugma is actually one of the most underrated Pokemon in all of Little Cup, and in the right hands it can be devastating. It is one of the two Pokemon that possess both screens and Memento, making it a very potent screener. It also has access to two different recovery moves and the ability to spread status with Yawn and Will-O-Wisp. In terms of offense, Slugma's low Speed makes it great in Trick Room, with good coverage and the ability to blow up when done. While Fire-typing and average stats hold it back defensively, the lava slug makes up for this with the ability to support the team uniquely. When used under the right circumstances, Slugma can be a useful addition to most teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Slugma is a great example of a Pokemon with a movepool that doesn't match its typing. It has access to some of the best supportive options, but being a pure Fire-type with bad stats screws it up. However, with this set, Slugma can be a huge asset to any sweeper by making its setup easier. It can be hard to pull off, but if you do, it will be worth it.</p>

<p>Setting up Light Screen and Reflect should be your first priority, since it benefits the whole team while also making up for Slugma's rather humble defenses. Memento is the move that makes this set so deadly, as it lowers both the foe's Attack and Special Attack two stages. That means with screens up, the opponent's attacks are only doing one-fourth of the damage they would normally be doing. When you use Memento, the user automatically faints, which is why it is always recommended that you set up screens before you use Memento. Self-Destruct is also an option if you want to bring down an opponent with Slugma. While most of the time Memento is the superior choice, it is still a fine option. Be aware that Self-Destruct is illegal with Recover and Memento, though. Slugma's last move slot is completely up to personal choice. Recover gives Slugma a viable way of healing and can be used if you want to keep Slugma alive for late assistance. Yawn is a great way to force switches, and it can also put the foe to sleep. Either way, it gives you time to set up screens while the foe switches or is asleep. Flamethrower keeps Slugma from being completely shut down by Taunt and packs decent power when coming off a base 70 Special Attack, even with no investment.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs and nature are designed for Slugma to get the most out of its mediocre defenses. With the given spread, Slugma reaches 23 HP, 13 Defense, and 13 Special Defense with a Careful nature, though screens make these defenses seem a lot better than they actually are. A Calm nature should be used if you are running Flamethrower. The choice between Light Clay and Oran Berry is a tough choice indeed. Light Clay allows screens to last eight turns, and this is great since Slugma probably won't be around to set them up again. Oran Berry provides a higher guarantee that you will be able to get your screens up and Memento, since Slugma can't take many hits.</p>

<p>The good news is that Slugma doesn't need much support from its teammates, since it will be doing the supporting and typically won't be around for long. Slugma is weak to Water-, Ground-, and Rock-type moves, so setup sweepers that resist those types are its best teammates. Mantyke and Poliwag can easily switch in on Water moves thanks to Water Absorb and can then set up Agility and Belly Drum, respectively. Croagunk can switch in safely thanks to Dry Skin and use Nasty Plot. Krabby and Totodile are also great options, since they resist Water-type moves and absolutely adore screen support. Gligar, Drifloon, and the previously mentioned Mantyke can switch in on Ground-type moves without fear, since they are completely immune. Swords Dance Snover can switch in on Ground and Water moves without fear and threaten the users with Ice Shard and Wood Hammer. Barboach and Aron can shrug off Rock-type attacks with ease and set up Dragon Dance and Rock Polish, respectively. Larvitar can also switch in and set up either Dragon Dance or Rock Polish.</p>

<p>While the aforementioned Pokemon are the best partners for Slugma, almost any setup sweeper works well. Dratini and Bagon greatly appreciate Slugma's support since it often allows them to get more than one Dragon Dance in. The rare, but extremely deadly Nasty Plot Houndour loves Memento support, as it allows it to set up safely, which is usually hard for it. Cacnea and Seedot can use Swords Dance, Nasty Plot, or Substitute safely behind screens. Rock Polish or Swords Dance Cranidos typically has trouble setting up, but not with Slugma's Memento support. While Belly Drum Magby may seem like a gimmick, it can be a huge threat with assistance from Slugma. The list can go on and on, but these are some of the best examples.</p>

<p>If you are saving Slugma for mid- or late-game, Rapid Spin support can help. Squirtle is great option as a spinner, since it resists Water. Baltoy is another great spinner, since it can easily switch in on two of Slugma's weaknesses, and it resists Stealth Rock. Pineco can use Rapid Spin as well and lures Fire-type moves, thus providing Slugma with an easy switch-in. Lastly, Sandshrew deserves some mention, since it resists Rock, and is weak to Grass. STAB Grass-type moves are some of the best moves for Slugma to switch in on since most Grass-types will switch out of it, allowing the blazing slug to set up Reflect or Light Screen. Slugma has very low Speed, which means this set can function great in Trick Room. If you are using this set in Trick Room, be sure to change the nature to Sassy and give it 0 IVs in Speed to make it as slow as possible.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Slugma is really slow, making it a perfect candidate for Trick Room. With a meaty base 70 Special Attack, Slugma can certainly put a dent in most foes. While Slugma is nowhere near the power levels of Cubone and Azurill in Trick Room, it is still a strong option. Fire Blast is Slugma's main attacking move, since STAB Fire Blast coming off of base 70 Special Attack is going to be hitting anything that doesn't resist it hard. Flamethrower is a decent replacement, thanks to higher accuracy. Since Trick Room puts you on a timer, a miss from Fire Blast can be devastating. Hidden Power Electric hits Water-types for super effective damage, including the ever-so-common Mantyke. Slugma has access to Earth Power, which not only hits Chinchou for super effective, but Rock- and Fire-types as well. Self-Destruct is a powerful suicide move, which can be used when Trick Room is about to end as a safe switch to a Pokemon that can set up Trick Room, or if Slugma is low on health. It also does a ton of damage to Munchlax, who would otherwise wall this set.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>You are going to want to make Slugma as slow as possible, so a Quiet nature is a must. The IVs may seem odd, but 30 Special Attack IVs and 3 Speed IVs allow Slugma to be as slow as possible while achieving 70 Base Power Hidden Power Electric. With nature and IVs combined, Slugma reaches a sluggish 6 Speed. The 36 EVs in Attack, Defense and Special Defense give Slugma one extra point in each stat. Life Orb is the definite item to use, since it provides a boost in power as well as the ability to switch between moves, which is extremely important in Trick Room.</p>

<p>Having someone to set up Trick Room is needed, because Slugma has little hope of sweeping without it. Slowpoke is a great option since Slugma can switch in on Grass-type moves aimed at Slowpoke. Furthermore, Slowpoke resists Water and can bring down Rock- and Ground-types with Aqua Tail. Baltoy is an even better option. Even though Baltoy is also weak to Water, it resists Rock and is immune to Ground. Most importantly, it can use Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock, which plagues Slugma. Bronzor can also switch in on Rock- and Ground-type attacks and set up Trick Room. Smoochum can also work well, since Slugma can shrug off Fire-type moves.</p>

<p>Aside from Trick Room, Slugma benefits from the same things most sweepers do. Stealth Rock is always appreciated. Bronzor and Baltoy are good options for setting it up since they can set up Trick Room too. Bronzor can also set up screens to support Slugma. Turtwig is another good option since it can set up screens, and Slugma can switch in on the Fire- and Ice-type moves directed at Turtwig with ease. Turtwig is also slow enough to take advantage of Trick Room. Ledyba is also a fine screener to support Slugma, since it can use Encore.</p>

<p>Even though this set can hit Dragon-types for neutral damage with Earth Power, they still cause Slugma trouble. Due to this, most Steel-types are a great partner for Slugma. Bronzor gets mentioned again, since it is immune to Ground and resists Rock. Aron also deserves attention, since it can switch into Outrage thanks to its high Defense. Magnemite can use Hidden Power Ice to subdue the dragons, especially Gible. It can also hit Water-types hard with STAB Thunderbolt. Shieldon can use Ice Beam to take down Dragon-types, and set up Stealth Rock. Most importantly, Shieldon is slow, meaning it can take full advantage of Trick Room.</p>

[SET]
name: Double Status
move 1: Yawn
move 2: Will-O-Wisp / Lava Plume
move 3: Recover
move 4: Memento
item: Oran Berry
ability: Flame Body
nature: Careful / Sassy
evs: 196 HP / 196 Def / 118 spd

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set isn't as good as the previous two, but it is still a solid option. Sadly, Slugma misses out on Stealth Rock, which would make this set better. Of course, if that is the trade off for not being part Rock- type, like its evolution Magcargo, we should accept the lack of Stealth Rock with open arms.</p>

<p>Yawn is a great move for any support Pokemon since it can often force switches. This allows you to use Will-O-Wisp on whatever switches in, burning them. If the opponent does keep their Pokemon in, it falls asleep, which is also great. There are also two ways to inflict burn on this set, three ways if you include Flame Body. Will-O-Wisp guarantees that you are going to burn the foe, unless it misses. Lava Plume, on the other hand, inflicts damage and has a 30% of inflicting burn. While this is not as reliable, the ability to inflict damage is always nice, no matter what the set is. Recover is your main way of keeping Slugma alive. Memento is a great move for the final moveslot, since Slugma can sacrifice itself when it is done spreading status in order to provide ample set up time for a teammate.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>You want to run Careful nature, unless you are running Lava Plume instead of Will-O-Wisp. If that is the case, then a Sassy nature is the best option, since Slugma doesn't really need Speed. The EVs give Slugma the ability to take both physical and special hits. Oran Berry is the best choice for this set. Combined with Recover, Slugma is bulkier than it appears.</p>

<p>Slugma supports Pokemon that have low Defense the best, since burn lowers Attack. Houndour, Elekid, Carvanha, and Staryu are all great examples. Houndour may be tricky to switch in, though, since most of the Pokemon that counter Slugma do great against it too. Mantyke's Defense may not below, but with burn support, it is a monster, and because Mantyke also has extremely high Special Defense, taking it down is extremely difficult for the opponent.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>If you are using Slugma as a lead, Protect can be used to stop Fake Out and scout. Pain Split is an option as a healing move over Recover, but it is only superior when facing an opponent with a high HP stat. Curse and Stockpile can be used as ways to bolster Slugma's defenses; however, it is tough to find a moveslot for them. Also, Slugma has trouble taking advantage of the Attack boost from Curse, since it lacks physical STAB. Overheat is an option, but Slugma will despise the Special Attack drop. Ancient Power has great coverage with Earth Power, but its low Base Power makes it unfavorable.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Tentacool is the single best counter to the Suicide Screener and Status Support sets. Not only does Tentacool have STAB Surf to severely damage Slugma, but it also has Clear Body, which prevents Memento from harming it. Tentacool also has a large Special Defense stat, which helps it sponge up Flamethrower and Lava Plume. Krabby and Gligar's Hyper Cutter and super effective STAB make them decent counters to Slugma, but both of them must watch out for Will-O-Wisp and Lava Plume. It should also be noted that anything with Taunt shuts down Slugma completely, aside from rare ones with Lava Plume or Self-Destruct.</p>

<p>Munchlax outspeeds the Trick Room Sweeper in Trick Room and can OHKO Slugma with Earthquake. Its amazing Special Defense and HP allows it to come in on any attack aside from Self-Destruct easily. Trapinch can also outspeed Slugma in Trick Room, use Arena Trap to trap it, and finish it with Earthquake. Slugma also has trouble with Aqua Jet users, such as Totodile and Carvanha, due to its lack of priority.</p>
