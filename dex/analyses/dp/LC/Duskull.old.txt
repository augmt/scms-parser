[Overview]

<p>With excellent defenses, Ghost typing, and access to Will-O-Wisp, Duskull is one of the premier walls in the Little Cup environment. Duskull still has a few shortcomings though, namely his small HP stat and extremely shallow movepool. Still, Duskull can be employed to provide the coverage and support many offensive teams in Little Cup lack.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Duskull's main job is to check a plethora of physical sweepers with ease in the Little Cup environment. Access to Will-O-Wisp and a semi-reliable recovery move makes Duskull extremely difficult to take down, so it can wear down the opposing team rather quickly. With Will-O-Wisp, Duskull can shut down physical attackers such as Gligar, Munchlax, Aron, and Krabby. Shadow Sneak helps revenge kill frail Pokemon like Gastly, and comes with the added bonus of STAB and decent neutral coverage. Return may look odd on such a weak Pokemon, but it prevents things like Carvanha and Houndour from setting up Substitutes on Duskull. Ice Beam can be used over Return if you want the quick KO on Gligar, but Return and damage inflicted by a burn burn damage can also whittle Gligar down, thus making Ice Beam the inferior choice. Pain Split is necessary on this set to keep Duskull healthy and ready to wall physical attackers when needed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs on this set prioritize Defense while still leaving Duskull with a potent Attack stat. When using Ice Beam, an extra 36 EVs can be placed into Duskull's Special Attack to will increase it by one point.</p>

<p>Duskull is best paired with Pokemon that can cover his weaknesses. For example, Munchlax makes an excellent partner because it can switch into special attacking threats like Houndour with ease. Conversely, Duskull can switch into Physical attacking threats that Munchlax dislikes. The typing that is provided by Duskull and Munchlax is also beneficial; Munchlax possesses an immunity to Ghost-type moves while Duskull is immune to Fighting attacks.</p>

<p>However improbable it may seem, Duskull can excel in the lead position due to access to Will-O-Wisp and priority moves. Duskull excels against many common leads in Little Cup, including Snover, Aipom, Diglett, Chimchar, and Machop. With the usage of Hidden Power Fire, Snover can be removed early from the match, which can be extremely beneficial to many teams. With a combination of Will-O-Wisp and Duskull's coverage moves, it has an easy time taking care of the aforementioned leads. Duskull also has midgame utility, as it is able to come in and burn the threats to your team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>While Duskull does beat many common leads, it does have its shortcomings. Houndour and Ponyta, for example, can switch in on two of Duskull's Fire-type moves and either KO Duskull, or hit the switch-in extremely hard with a boosted STAB move. Kabuto also has a favorable matchup against Duskull, setting up Stealth Rock, as well as hitting Duskull with any move followed by Aqua Jet.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>On the Support set, Trick Room with 0 IVs in Speed can be used to great success. Confuse Ray can annoy opponents, but then users of Substitute can easily set up on Duskull. Rest can also effectively be used instead of Pain Split for a more reliable source of recovery, however; the two free turns could allow the opponent to set up. Apart from that, Duskull has an extremely shallow movepool. A Hidden Power of choice can be used to lure specific Pokemon your team has trouble with, but Duskull has weak attacking stats, so it won't be hitting hard.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Duskull's biggest counters are easily Fire-types, such as Growlithe, Houndour, Magby, and Ponyta. They are all immune to burn damage and can easily dispose of Duskull with boosted STAB moves. Wynaut can also remove Duskull from the match by either Encoring a support move, or using Counter as Duskull uses Shadow Sneak. Substitute users like Carvanha can also scare Duskull out and set up a free Substitute.</p>
