[Overview]

<p>Wooper has mediocre stats all across the board, but this is somewhat remedied by its fairly large movepool. However, even though it has perfect coverage, it is still very weak, and will not be hitting hard even with super effective attacks. With the correct support, Wooper can perform well to an extent, and ultimately is not completely useless.</p>

[SET]
name: Trick Room Sweeper
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Waterfall / Aqua Tail
move 3: Return
move 4: Ice Punch
item: Life Orb
ability: Water Absorb
nature: Brave
evs: 76 HP / 236 Atk / 76 Def / 76 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its usable Attack stat, along with its extremely low Speed, Wooper can function decently as a Trick Room sweeper. Earthquake is its most powerful attack, gaining STAB, and hitting most Pokemon reasonably hard. Waterfall is Wooper's secondary STAB, and when paired up with Return, hits every Pokemon in the tier for at least neutral damage. Ice Punch is utilized to hit its only weakness, Grass-types, and also to hit Flying-types hard.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Using Life Orb is a necessity, since it secures certain OHKOs and 2HKOs. A Brave nature increases Wooper's mediocre Attack while allowing it to outrun almost all Pokemon under Trick Room. The EVs maximize Wooper's Attack, and increase its HP, Defense, and Special Defense by one point. Aqua Tail can be used instead of Waterfall for more power, but the loss of accuracy is a let down, and Waterfall's chance to flinch may come in handy. Water Absorb is a good ability to use since this means that Wooper gets an added advantage when switching into Water-type Pokemon and receives more opportunities to switch in</p>

<p>A Steel-type, such as Bronzor, could come in handy as it resists Wooper's Grass-type weakness; in return, Wooper resists Fire-type attacks, Bronzor's lone weakness.</p>

[SET]
name: Utility
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Ice Punch / Stockpile
move 3: Toxic
move 4: Recover
item: Oran Berry
ability: Water Absorb
nature: Impish
evs: 236 HP / 76 Atk / 156 Def

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set attempts to utilize Wooper's resistances and immunities to make it function as a defensive Pokemon. STAB Earthquake allows Wooper to hit many Pokemon in LC hard, and is a useful move to have in general. Ice Punch hits Gligar hard, and gives Wooper a good amount of coverage. This is useful for a defensive Pokemon like Wooper. Toxic is extremely helpful in crippling a majority of the Pokemon in the tier, slowly eating away at the opponent's HP. Recover lends Wooper more survivability, and allows it to stall out Pokemon in conjunction with Toxic.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Stockpile can be used over Ice Punch to further boost Wooper's bulk, but Wooper will then miss out on hitting threats such as Gligar. An Impish nature maximizes Wooper's bulk and helps it function well as a defensive Pokemon. The EVs maximize Wooper's Defense and HP, and increase its Attack stat by 1 point. Oran Berry gives Wooper more staying time, allowing it to stall out more threats.</p>

<p>Pokemon which can provide Stealth Rock and Trick Room support are great teammates for Wooper, since Trick Room allows it to outrun all Pokemon in LC, and Stealth Rock turns some 2HKOs into OHKOs. Bronzor thus makes a great teammate, as it can set up both Stealth Rock and Trick Room with ease thanks to its wonderful bulk.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Moves such as Encore, Counter, Curse, and Yawn are all viable options for Wooper, but are generally not worthwhile because Wooper's defensive stats are average at best. Encore prevents Pokemon from setting up right in front of Wooper; however, most Pokemon will then just 2HKO it. Counter is also slightly viable, but you need to predict extremely well so that the opponent doesn't set up right in front of you. Curse is also a bad option since Wooper is so frail that by the time it sets up even one Curse, it will be KOed on the second turn. Yawn is not a good option either, since it takes a turn to put the opponent to sleep, and Wooper just doesn't have the defenses to wait a turn doing next to nothing.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Counters include all Pokemon that can take a hit from Wooper and hit reasonably hard. When Trick Room is not in effect, any hard-hitting Pokemon can put an end to Wooper's misery due to its abysmal Speed and low defenses. Thanks to its 4x weakness, Wooper will always fall to Grass-type blows, though frail Grass-types must be wary of Ice Punch while switching in.</p>
