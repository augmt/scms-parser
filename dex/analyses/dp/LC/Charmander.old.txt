[Overview]

<p>Though Charmander is outclassed in many ways by its Fire-type brethren in Little Cup, it has a perk that sets it apart from the other sweepers in the tier. Charmander's access to Dragon Dance, which raises the lizard's average Attack and Speed stats makes Charmander a ferocious sweeper in LC when given the proper support.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although Dragon Dance Charmander is a fearsome threat in its own right, it seems outclassed by other Dragon Dance sweepers with better offensive stat layouts, most notably Dratini. However, what makes Charmander a decent user is its ability to take down Bronzor, which Dratini struggles to do.</p>

<p>Flare Blitz is Charmander's STAB attack and primary attacking move, being able to even 2HKO the likes of Bronzor after a single boost from Dragon Dance. Brick Break allows Charmander to hit Pokemon who resist Flare Blitz, such as Houndour. Thunder Punch rounds off the set by providing Charmander with a reliable attack to strike Water-types with.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Priority attacks are Charmander's bane, especially from Pokemon who have Aqua Jet, such as Carvanha, Totodile, Kabuto, Buizel, and Squirtle. Substitute can be used over Brick Break or Thunder Punch as a way to shield Charmander from priority attacks but if Charmander does run Substitute it won't be sweeping for long, as Life Orb, Flare Blitz recoil, and Substitute will quickly deplete all of Charmander's health.</p>

<p>Wynaut can be a valuable partner to Charmander, as it is able to trap and remove many of the Choice item priority users who can end Charmander's sweep. Also, Wynaut can Encore a resisted attack or a support move, allowing for an easy set-up by Charmander. Dual screens courtesy of Bronzor can be very useful, as they also allow Charmander to set up much easier. Munchlax can switch into and defeat Chinchou, who completely walls Charmander. Also, Dratini can benefit from Charmander's presence on its team, as Charmander can heavily weaken Dratini's checks and counters, allowing it to have a much easier time sweeping.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A Substitute + Dragon Dance set with a Liechi or Salac Berry can be used; however, even though the boosts gained through this combination are very useful, the sweep will often be ended before it can even start if the opponent has a Pokemon packing a priority move. Similarly, a Swords Dance set can be utilized, but due to Charmander's average Speed and lack of a priority move, it isn't very viable. Though it's not recommended, Charmander can opt for a Choice set, but this is largely outclassed by the likes of Ponyta and Houndour.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p> Any Pokemon who runs a priority attack can easily stop Charmander in its tracks and even if it runs Substitute, it is still very susceptible to being revenge killed by other Pokemon with a priority move or Choice Scarfed Pokemon. Aqua Jet gets a special mention here, as it will always eliminate Charmander (unless it has a Substitute up), due to super effective damage.</p>
