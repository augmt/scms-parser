[Overview]

<p>Lotad is a cute baby sombrero, but that's really all it has going for it. Lotad has abysmal stats, can barely KO anything even with the pseudo-STAB of rain, and can take a hit with about as much rigor as a toothpick. If you're thinking about using Lotad, do yourself a favor and don't. Maybe you could throw your opponent off or something by using this Pokemon, but you're really only crippling your team in the long run.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Lotad excels at sweeping on a Rain Dance team thanks to its ability Swift Swim, its access to a super effective STAB type against Water-types, and its ability to reach 26 Speed in the rain, letting it outspeed all non-Choice Scarfed Pokemon. Lotad has Surf and Energy Ball for STAB and can hit Grass-types that resist Surf and Energy Ball with Ice Beam. Rain Dance is probably the most useful move in the last slot to both support the team and speed up Lotad itself. You can, however, run Hidden Power Rock as it allows you to hit Mantyke, who would otherwise wall your other attacks, for super effective damage. Hidden Power Rock can also rough up Snover on the switch, which is a pain for Rain Dance teams to face. Lowering the HP IV stat to 2 allows Lotad to reach 19 HP, which is a Life Orb number, and still maintain a 70 Base Power Hidden Power. The EVs are designed to max out Speed and Special Attack while the rest is dumped into Defense and Special Defense to add bulk.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Lotad can potentially play two different roles on a team: late-game sweeper or wallbreaker. Lotad can damage many common Rain team counters like Croagunk, Munchlax, and Snover, but don't expect it to take retaliation well. Lotad can also easily sweep once a few walls are removed. Hidden Power Psychic is an option to hit Croagunk, who can damage Lotad severely, on the switch. Rain Dance can also be used in the last slot but Lotad is so slow and fragile that it will be KOed by most attacks before it can set up Rain Dance. Voltorb is the ideal lead to set up Rain Dance because of its excellent Speed. Bronzor is another Pokemon that can help set up rain for Lotad; it can also take on Snover, who is a pain for Lotad and Rain Dance teams in general.</p>

<p>Bulky Pokemon, like Munchlax and Snover, and priority users, like Croagunk, cause Lotad pain. Chople Berry Kabuto helps to deal with these Pokemon. Kabuto hurts Munchlax badly with Waterfall in the rain and can crush Snover with Rock Slide. Kabuto also lures out Croagunk, survives a Vacuum Wave, and hit Croagunk back with Aerial Ace.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Lotad can run Leech Seed, Protect, Substitute, and either Rain Dance or Surf to cause annoyance to the opponent's team. However, Lotad's low defenses doesn't allow it to set up often. Lotad can attempt to make use of Swords Dance , but lacks a physical Water-type STAB. Lotad also gets Synthesis, which helps it recover HP, but its effectiveness is hampered by rain. It can also run Icy Wind instead of Ice Beam to slow down enemies.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Snover causes huge problems for Lotad. It can switch in and stop the rain, then outspeed Lotad and hurt it with STAB Blizzard. Munchlax can switch in and take even STAB Surf from Lotad without fearing a 2HKO, and KO back with Return. Swift Swim Mantyke can come in on any move besides Hidden Power Rock, outspeed Lotad, and then KO it with Hidden Power Flying.</p>

<p>Once the rain has stopped, Lotad is quite vulnerable to powerful sweepers like Gastly, Elekid, Gligar, and Houndour. Pokemon wielding Choice Scarf that reach over 26 Speed can easily revenge kill Lotad in the rain. Common Pokemon that meet this criteria are Gastly and Gligar, all of whom can tear Lotad apart with their STAB moves.</p>
