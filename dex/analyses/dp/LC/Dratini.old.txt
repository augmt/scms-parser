[Overview]

<p>Dratini has definitely found its place in the Little Cup metagame. Dratini will always have competition from Bagon thanks to its higher Attack, but Dratini often overshadows Bagon because of Extreme Speed. Gible, the other little Dragon, has a nice STAB Earthquake, but the lack of Dragon Dance, a respectable Special Attack, and priority means Dratini is often seen as the better choice.</p>

<p>Thanks to it's great movepool and all round passable stats Dratini is one of the more versatile Pokemon in Little Cup, and is capable of running a large number of quite different sets effectively. Because of this, Dratini is very difficult to predict, and in Little Cup, one wrong move could mean the end of the battle. With Dratini's powerful offensive options, impressive movepool, decent defensive stats, and excellent typing, Dratini is definitely worth considering for your team, and always something to prepare for.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Dragon Dance Dratini is one of the most dangerous Pokemon in Little Cup thanks to its excellent movepool, solid Attack, and good Speed after a boost. After a Dragon Dance, Dratini reaches a whopping 25 Attack and 21 Speed, making it faster than every Pokemon in the metagame not carrying a Choice Scarf. With 25 Attack, STAB Outrage is terrifying for all but the most physically bulky Pokemon, and those with a resistance to Dragon. Basically, the only Pokemon who can avoid being 2HKOed by Outrage are Bronzor, Shieldon, and Aron (to demonstrate Outrage's raw power, other than Steel types, only max HP / Def Onix with a nature boost and Oran Berry has any chance of surviving two +1 Life Orb boosted Outrages. And Onix won't last against Water attacks.). Waterfall is used to OHKO Aron and Shieldon after a Dragon Dance, and it also hits Bronzor for a solid 3HKO with Oran Berry factored in; however, Waterfall can 2HKO if it has a low damage roll followed by a high one since this avoids Oran Berry being activated. Without Life Orb, Dratini can't OHKO Aron with Waterfall. This means that if you opt for Oran Berry, Aqua Tail is the preferred option since it is able to OHKO Aron most of the time, and it's a guaranteed OHKO if Aron has switched into Stealth Rock once before.</p>

<p>Dratini's true strength lies in its fourth move: Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed on a Pokemon with Dragon Dance is extremely difficult to stop, as the normal methods of revenge killing with priority or fast Choice Scarf users aren't as effective. Many of the most popular hard-hitting Choice Scarf users in Little Cup are vulnerable to being OHKOed by Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock. Also, priority is not an option to revenge kill Dratini since it's faster than every other common priority user, will hit first with Extreme Speed, and can OHKO some of the main priority users, such as Croagunk, Diglett, and Houndour, after Stealth Rock.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Adamant nature is recommended as the extra power comes into play more often than the boost from 21 Speed to 22 Speed. With Jolly, you have a significantly lower chance to OHKO Aron with a +1 Waterfall, and miss out on the chance to OHKO Gligar with a +1 Outrage without Stealth Rock. Oran Berry can be used over Life Orb, but Adamant should remain as Dratini needs all the firepower it can get.</p>

<p>Dratini's biggest problem is finding the time to set up, even with its decent defenses and great defensive typing. What helps Dratini set up most are Pokemon like Wynaut and dual screen users such as Abra or Bronzor. After dual screens, many Pokemon are essentially turned into set-up bait, and Dratini can safely come in and set up on them. Wynaut is great at getting Pokemon free turns with Encore, and Dratini appreciates this more than most, since with just one free turn of set up, Dratini can plow through a team.</p>

<p>Dratini has problems with Choice Scarf Pokemon who can take an Extreme Speed and are faster than 21 Speed. Choice Scarf Magnemite and Gastly are perfect Pokemon to stop a Dratini sweep. Neither can quite OHKO Dratini (barring Explosion), but Magnemite's Hidden Power Ice and Gastly's Sludge Bomb will both do well over 70% to Dratini, which is generally enough to stop a sweep. Munchlax helps Dratini against both of those Pokemon, taking little damage from either Pokemon, while Pursuit and Earthquake take care of Gastly and Magnemite respectively.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set focuses on Dratini's excellent coverage and utility with Extreme Speed. Due to Substitute, this set is much more versatile than the other sets that Dratini can use. For example, similar to the Dragon Dance set, it can take advantage of the opponent's switches. It also can lure in and destroy Pokemon like Bronzor in the same way as the mixed set. It also works as a decent revenge killer with Extreme Speed.</p>

<p>The EVs given allow Dratini to outpace many of the Pokemon who don't invest in Speed due to being bulky or having priority while also retaining enough power to deal with Bronzor. Outrage takes out Pokemon such as Munchlax, and will most likely OHKO whatever comes in, unless they outpace Dratini. Draco Meteor is a decent alternative, however, because it doesn't lock Dratini into one move and avoids confusion.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With a Substitute up Dratini is quite dangerous, meaning Pokemon who aid Dratini's set up are recommended. For example, this set works quite well with Wynaut because of its ability to get Dratini an easy Substitute with Encore and Tickle. Mantyke is another good example of a Pokemon who Dratini benefits from because it lures in Pokemon such as Chinchou who practically give Dratini a free turn.</p>

<p>Since Dratini makes such a good Bronzor and Munchlax lure, Pokemon who are countered by these two defensive Pokemon greatly appreciate Dratini's presence. With Bronzor out of the way, Pokemon such as Bagon, Taillow, and Gligar will have a much easier time sweeping. Munchlax walls many special attackers such as Gastly, so they will have an easier time functioning with Munchlax gone.</p> 

[SET]
name: Mixed Priority Attacker
move 1: Outrage

evs: 244 Atk / 116 SpA / 116 Spe
ivs: 0 HP

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With three coverage moves and a powerful priority attack, Dratini can make an excellent mixed priority attacker. The basic strategy of the set is to pick off Steel-types and bulky Rock-types with Fire Blast and Surf, while hurting any Choice Scarfer that comes in. If you hit something relatively frail with Fire Blast or Surf, Dratini can usually finish them off with Extreme Speed. Once these Pokemon are out of the way, and your opponent has nothing that can take a powerful Dragon-type attack, use Outrage and watch your opponent's team crumble.</p>

<p>The mixed priority sweeper uses purely offensive EVs, as it needs to do as much damage as possible. First, it maximizes Attack to do as much damage as possible with its two main attacks, Outrage and Extreme Speed. 116 Special Attack EVs guarantee that Fire Blast 2HKOes Bronzor, and as a bonus, Surf followed by Fire Blast (but not vice versa) always KOes as well, as it avoids activating Oran Berry.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This Dratini works well as a wall breaking sweeper, making offensive support unnecessary; however, Dratini does need some serious defensive support. As Ghost-types like Drifloon and Gastly can switch into Extreme Speed, using a Pursuiter like Munchlax or Stunky is helpful as they can trap and KO Ghost-types with Pursuit. If a bulky Choice Scarfer who can survive an Extreme Speed comes in to revenge kill Dratini, having something to soak the hit will stop you from having to sacrifice. Machop is a very common bulky Choice Scarf Pokemon, and nothing stops Machop better than Slowpoke due to its ability, Own Tempo. Slowpoke's opportunities to spread paralysis helps Dratini in the long run.</p>

<p>This set also makes a great Baton Pass recipient, benefiting from any Attack, Special Attack, and Speed boosts passed to it, while also having great coverage.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band

evs: 28 HP / 244 Atk / 36 SpA / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to bypass Dratini's usual counters and sweep late-game with its boosted Extreme Speed or Outrage. Outrage from Dratini's impressive Attack stat will OHKO almost anything that doesn't resist it, but it must be used with caution unless Steel-types and faster Pokemon are gone so that Dratini doesn't get trapped and revenge killed. Waterfall (or Aqua Tail if you prefer power to accuracy) will OHKO almost every Rock-type in the game, while Fire Blast hits Bronzor and Magnemite hard.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This Dratini can only really function well with Ghost-types out of the way, because Extreme Speed is a key move on this set. Pursuit users, such as Munchlax and Stunky (the "Ghost Busters" of Little Cup), help to remove these threats. Dratini will often find itself locked into a move that lets your opponent set up their own Pokemon while taking no damage. For example, using Waterfall to OHKO Geodude only to have a Paras come in and put one of your Pokemon to sleep with Spore, or using Extreme Speed against an Aron who will then use Rock Polish and threaten to sweep your team. To counter Pokemon like this, a Choice Scarf Mankey can come in and OHKO a +2 Aron with Close Combat, while being immune to Paras's Spore thanks to its ability, Vital Spirit.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Dratini has the rare ability to 2HKO almost every Pokemon with a STAB move followed by a priority attack. Against the top leads, all Dratini needs to do is Protect versus Fake Out leads like Chimchar and Meowth, then use Draco Meteor followed by Extreme Speed. Against Meowth specifically, Dratini has an advantage due to Shed Skin, giving it the ability to occasionally bypass the already unreliable Hypnosis. Surf 2HKOes Phanpy, meaning it needs to pick whether to set up Stealth Rock or KO Dratini with Ice Shard. Leads such as Kabuto and Gligar also find themselves in a similar situation with Aqua Jet and Quick Attack respectively. Hippopotas has a chance to OHKO Dratini with Earthquake and sandstorm damage, but Dratini 2HKOes with Surf meaning it will not be able to set up Stealth Rock if it attacks. Fire Blast hurts Bronzor and easily OHKOes lead Snover, but hail and its Blizzard will KO Dratini at the end of the turn.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>At first glance, Dratini may seem like an inferior Houndour, but its true strengths lie in Extreme Speed and its typing. Unlike Houndour, Dratini's priority attack doesn't rely on the opponent using an attack for it to work, so Pokemon like Diglett will have trouble with Dratini even though they have none with Houndour. Dratini is also fast enough to outpace lead Houndour and Phanpy.</p>

<p>Once Dratini has KOed the opponent's lead with Draco Meteor, it is extremely vulnerable to Substitute sweepers, especially ones that resist or are immune to Extreme Speed. Drifloon is the most obvious example. If Drifloon uses Substitute until Dratini has very little Special Attack left, it will likely get to keep its Substitute after your second or third attack. Drifloon is definitely something you don't want behind a Substitute, so packing a Ghost-type switch-in like Stunky is a good choice. Keeping Wynaut around is a good idea because it can come in and Encore on a set up move from the many Pokemon who will try to set up against a -2 Special Attack Dratini.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Dratini packs an excellent special movepool, but only has a mediocre base 50 Special Attack stat to work with. However, Dratini still has enough power to OHKO many Pokemon with either a super effective attack or STAB Draco Meteor, allowing it to be an effective revenge killer. Draco Meteor severely damages almost anything that doesn't resist Dragon-type attacks, even from only 15 Special Attack, while Fire Blast will stop Bronzor and Magnemite from being comfortable switching in. Ice Beam takes care of Swords Dance Gligar in case it manages to set up, while Outrage fits into the last slot to hit specially bulky Pokemon hard. Surf can be used over Ice Beam if you want to always OHKO Aron; however, you miss the guaranteed OHKO on Gligar.</p>

<p>This set uses a specially oriented EV spread, as the main attacks are special. After Special Attack and Speed are maximized with 196 EVs each, 84 EVs are put into Attack to give Outrage a little extra kick. The remaining EVs are put into HP to give Dratini better overall defenses.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Offensively, this Dratini set really helps out Pokemon like Gligar who want Bronzor gone because of its ability to lure out and deal major damage to it with Fire Blast. It also helps Pokemon like Machop and Mankey who want Ghost-types removed from battle, because they will often switch into Dratini expecting a Dragon Dance, only to be met with a Draco Meteor. Drifloon might try to set up after the Special Attack drop, but with Choice Scarf it will be outsped and 2HKOed by Draco Meteor.</p>

<p>Dratini will require a good amount of defensive support because of the downside of using Draco Meteor. The Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor allows many bulkier sweepers to come in and set up, meaning some counters are needed for these Pokemon. An example of a particularly threatening bulky sweeper is Gligar, who can set up Rock Polish on Dratini after the Special Attack drop. Gligar can be easily taken care of by Duskull, who can burn it and hit it with Ice Beam. Drifloon can come in and set up Substitute on Dratini, which can be very dangerous if you don't have a Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Houndour or Stunky to switch in and revenge kill it.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Dratini has quite a diverse movepool, and some decent options have not been listed above. First off, Dratini can run a pretty threatening Agility set. With Agility, Outrage, Aqua Tail, and Fire Blast, Dratini can pose a major threat to Pokemon like Gastly who switch in, expecting a slower Dragon Dance Dratini, only to be met with an OHKO. While Agility is viable, it does have problems competing with physical Dragon Dance because Extreme Speed makes the extra Speed boost less important, and without the Attack boost from Dragon Dance, Dratini's damage output can be disappointing.</p>

<p>Dratini can just about pull off a decent Choice Specs set, if only to lure and KO Bronzor. However, Dratini's Special Attack is too low to be an effective user of Choice Specs. A physical Choice Scarf set could be also be used, but Bagon pulls that set off better thanks to its higher Attack. It's also worth nothing that Light Screen is illegal with Extreme Speed which reduces Dratini's usefulness significantly.</p>

<p>Dratini has decent defenses, some good support moves, and great typing, so it can use a general support set. With Light Screen and Thunder Wave, Dratini could cause some annoyance to your opponent. However, Dratini is almost always better off attacking because of its vast offensive movepool and solid Attack and Special Attack.</p>

<p>On the Dragon Dance set, a bulkier EV spread can be used. A simple spread of 28 HP / 164 Atk / 156 Def / 116 SpD / 36 Spe will go a long way, especially with Reflect and Light Screen support. This may allow Dratini to set up more than one Dragon Dance, increasing Dratini's chance of sweeping. The main setback is that Dratini essentially needs more than one Dragon Dance to sweep and it loses a bit of immediate power. The Speed is helpful for revenge killing Pokemon such as Croagunk who only reach 13 Speed most of the time.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Dratini is one of those rare Pokemon who has very few safe switch-ins, if any. Bronzor is probably your best bet, resisting Dratini's STAB Dragon-type attacks and Extreme Speed, while not taking much from Dratini's Water-type attacks, though Bronzor does need to avoid Fire Blast. Against the special attacking Dratini, Munchlax does a great job of walling it.</p>

<p>After Dratini has a Dragon Dance under its belt, it is one of the hardest Pokemon to stop in Little Cup. Extreme Speed eliminates most of the options that rely on priority or use a Choice Scarf. The only possible revenge killers are really Choice Scarf Ghosts, Choice Scarf Magnemite, Choice Scarf Gligar, and certain Choice Scarf Rock-types. Every other Pokemon will probably be OHKOed by Extreme Speed or outpaced and destroyed by Outrage or Waterfall.</p>

<p>The best way to reliably beat Dratini is to not let it set up. If you need to sacrifice a Pokemon to keep Dratini from setting up, you should probably do it. After that you can send something in that's faster than 14 Speed and bulky enough to take an Extreme Speed to take care of Dratini before it can set up.</p>
