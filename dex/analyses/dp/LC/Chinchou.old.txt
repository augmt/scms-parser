[Overview]

<p>Chinchou is one of the premier Water-types in Little Cup, thanks to its solid typing and the ability to switch in often and deal significant damage to a large portion of the Little Cup metagame. To cap it off, it also has a great special movepool. However, Chinchou's weakness to Ground-type moves, such as the omnipresent Earthquake, and a bad Defense stat hold it back. Using Chinchou also requires a lot of prediction to be effective, especially with Diglett on the loose.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Out of all the sets Chinchou can run, this set has arguably the most sweeping potential. Chinchou can come in freely on Electric-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks and quickly set up as the opponent is forced to switch. Chinchou also sports great resistances to common priority moves, including Aqua Jet, Ice Shard, and Bullet Punch, meaning that most priority will not dent Chinchou. After an Agility, Chinchou reaches a blazing 32 Speed, outrunning the entire Little Cup metagame. Combined with its high Special Attack stat, which lets Chinchou hit as hard as Timid Staryu, Chinchou can easily sweep through weakened teams. If possible, bring Chinchou out during the late-game, after counters such as Munchlax have hopefully been worn down, to ensure a better chance of sweeping.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choices between Hydro Pump and Surf, between Ice Beam and Hidden Power Grass, and between Life Orb and Oran Berry all come down to personal preference. Hydro Pump gives Chinchou the ability to 2HKO standard Munchlax after Stealth Rock damage 100% of the time with Life Orb, but its shaky accuracy can be frustrating. Ice Beam is a good move to use alongside Thunderbolt because it gets rid of pesky Ground-types, such as Gligar, and Grass-types, such as Turtwig and Chikorita, while Hidden Power Grass strikes other Chinchou, Wooper, and Barboach, who are immune to Thunderbolt. If using Hidden Power Grass, make sure to give Chinchou 232 Special Attack EVs to compensate for the IV lost by the Hidden Power. Life Orb gives a great boost to Chinchou's attacking power, but it wears down faster. Oran Berry is an alternative to give Chinchou more survivability.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Chinchou makes a decent Choice Scarf user that excels at being a hit-and-run attacker. With a Choice Scarf, Chinchou reaches 24 Speed, easily outrunning the 20 speed tier and most other Choice Scarf users. Its high Special Attack allows it to punch holes in bulky Pokemon such as Munchlax, easing the load on other specially oriented sweepers. The only downside to running Choice Scarf Chinchou is that prediction becomes more crucial. Mantyke and Croagunk can neutralize Water-type attacks, while Gligar can easily switch in on Thunderbolts and use Chinchou as setup fodder. Ice Beam allows Munchlax and Water-types to come in freely.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p> When running Choice Scarf Chinchou, a Modest nature is preferred to increase Chinchou's firepower. However, a Timid nature can be used to tie with other Choice Scarf users, such as Gastly and Mankey.</p>

<p>Flying and Levitating Pokemon go hand in hand with Chinchou, because only strong Ground-type moves can OHKO Chinchou. Bronzor is a great companion for Chinchou, as it can set up Stealth Rock and has an immunity to Ground moves; additionally, Fire-type attacks aimed at Bronzor can be absorbed by Chinchou. Gligar is another Pokemon that enjoys Chinchou support, as it can lay down Stealth Rock, has immunity to Earthquake, and can U-turn out to Chinchou. Chinchou can absorb Water- and Ice-type attacks aimed at Gligar as well, and can wear down threats so that Gligar can sweep late-game. Other interesting partners include Snover, who can lure out Munchlax and KO it with Wood Hammer, clearing the way for Chinchou to sweep. Along with this, Chinchou can come in on Fire-type attacks aimed at Snover, while Snover resists Earthquake and scares off many of Chinchou's counters, such as Gligar and other Ground-type Pokemon.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Chinchou's excellent defensive typing, which allows it to resist many common moves such as Surf, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Flamethrower, coupled with its good HP and Special Defense makes it an effective special sponge. This set has an aptitude to force switches with Thunder Wave. Thunderbolt and Surf provide STAB, while Ice Beam completes the BoltBeam combo.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Some players might prefer a parafusion set that combines Confuse Ray and Thunder Wave. When confused and paralyzed, the opponent has a 63% chance of doing nothing. This often gives you time to make safe switches while neutralizing fast, dangerous Pokemon. Discharge is an alternative to Thunderbolt that provides a higher chance of paralysis if you choose not to use Thunder Wave.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Chinchou makes a reliable Rain Dance user. With Rain Dance, it has the opportunity to run a powerful STAB Thunder, which has a high paralysis rate as well. Chinchou can run Blizzard on the Choice Scarf set if it is teamed up with Snover. The partnership can rip through teams not prepared for strong Ice-type attacks. Chinchou can run Choice Specs over Choice Scarf, but this leaves it even more prone to being revenge killed by Diglett. Once again, prediction is key.</p>

<p>Chinchou actually has a decent physical movepool, but its poor base Attack puts a damper on physical sets. Signal Beam is usable to hit Grass-types, but Ice Beam is more powerful, and is hence superior unless you fear Snover. If you want to boost Chinchou's stats, you could probably find use for Amnesia and Charge, but these are for specialized cases. Finally, Shed Shell is an option for escaping Diglett.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Chinchou has a mediocre Defense stat and a weakness to Earthquake. Any set lacking Hidden Power Grass promptly loses to Wooper or Barboach, who are immune to both of Chinchou's STABs as well as Thunder Wave, which prevents Para-fusion. Any faster Ground-type Pokemon, such as Gligar, can come in on Thunderbolt and OHKO. Primarily, Diglett can trap Chinchou and OHKO with Earthquake, but is OHKOed by Surf on the switch and may be surprised by an Agility set. Grass-types serve as good counters to Chinchou, but all but Snover must be wary of Ice Beam.</p>

<p>Offensive Chinchou is walled by Munchlax; although Munchlax gets worn down after repeated Hydro Pumps, Munchlax will win one-on-one thanks to its strong Earthquake. Ironically, other Chinchou can wall it when it lacks Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Ground.</p>
