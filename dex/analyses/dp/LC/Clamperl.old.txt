[Overview]

<p>Clamperl used to be one of Little Cup's biggest terrors, hitting 36 Special Attack with DeepSeaTooth. However, it faded into obscurity when DeepSeaTooth was banned. Clamperl can still wreak havoc in Little Cup with its other item, DeepSeaScale. When the doubled Special Defense from DeepSeaScale is factored in, Clamperl has the highest overall defenses of any Little Cup Pokemon. Combine this with its still respectable Special Attack, and Clamperl can still work in Little Cup.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its exclusive item DeepSeaScale, Clamperl has unparalleled 23/19/24 defenses without any boosts. Using the combination of these stats and the recovery from Rest and utility of Sleep Talk, Clamperl can wall just about every Pokemon in Little Cup who cannot hit it super effectively. Its ability, Shell Armor, also helps by preventing Clamperl from critical hits.</p>

<p>Rest provides Clamperl's only source of healing. Even with massive defenses, almost all Pokemon will at least 4HKO. Therefore, without RestTalk, Clamperl will be worn down quickly and be unable to wall. Surf runs nicely off Clamperl's decent 15 Special Attack. Hidden Power Electric hits Mantyke, who can be an annoyance, especially with Water Absorb.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Dragon-types usually can snag free Dragon Dances off Clamperl. Therefore, Ice Beam is viable to prevent them from setting up and even OHKO them in some cases. Another option to use in the final spot is Toxic. While it is best to provide Clamperl with Toxic Spikes support, Toxic can hit Flying-types, such as Mantyke, who do not care about Surf. It is also a good backup in case Toxic Spikes are never set up or are spun away.</p>

<p>The EVs boost Clamperl's physical defense as much as possible so that it can take physical hits well. No Special Defense EVs are needed due to the incredible boost from DeepSeaScale. The remaining EVs go into Speed and Special Attack to slightly boost Clamperl's offensive capabilities.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Clamperl has few other options of note in its small movepool. Confuse Ray can annoy Pokemon even more and hopefully cause damage in the process. Iron Defense or Barrier can boost both of Clamperl's defenses to incredible levels, making it almost untouchable. A Life Orb set could be viable under Trick Room with Clamperl hitting a maximum of 18 Special Attack.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>As previously stated, Pokemon with a STAB super effective move are big problems for Clamperl. Chinchou, Elekid, and even the rarer Grass-types can easily KO Clamperl. Strong physical attackers do massive damage to Clamperl and can usually win despite Rest. Set-up Pokemon, such as Dratini and Mantyke, can make life miserable for Clamperl if it does not have the proper move with which to hit them. In general, any Pokemon who can damage Clamperl faster than it heals from Rest will be a problem for Clamperl.</p>
