[Overview]

<p>Although Chimchar has poor base stats, it can still act as a reliable lead. This comes from its unique ability to use both Fake Out and Stealth Rock on one set. Unfortunately, that is the extent of Chimchar's abilities, as it suffers from poor Speed and a reliance on Overheat to score important KOs. As a result of these drawbacks, Chimchar can be both easily revenge killed and set up on. Nonetheless, Chimchar is a solid lead, and can be quite disruptive when used correctly.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Chimchar is one of the better leads in the Little Cup metagame, due to the major centralization around the 15 Speed mark. With a Hasty nature, Chimchar outpaces other leads running 15 Speed and KOes most of them with Fake Out followed by Overheat or Hidden Power Grass. Because of this, it can prevent Stealth Rock from being set up without having to sacrifice a moveslot for Taunt, something no other lead can do. This gives Chimchar room for its own Stealth Rock, which it often gets the chance to use either after it KOes the opposing lead or if the opposing lead switches out. While Chimchar doesn't beat every lead, it will rarely be at a big disadvantage. Against Diglett, for example, it can still get Stealth Rock up and possibly disable Diglett's Focus Sash.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As mentioned above, Chimchar is generally troubled by Diglett. This makes both Gastly and Gligar great partners for Chimchar, as either one can come in on the revenge kill and set up, quickly taking the momentum from the opponent. Chimchar also has trouble with Meowth, since it is faster and can use Fake Out to break Chimchar's Focus Sash. However, Meowth, unlike Diglett, does not prevent Chimchar from switching out. Therefore, Rock-type Pokemon such as Geodude and Rhyhorn also make great teammates for Chimchar, since they can easily switch into Meowth and hit the switch-in with a STAB Earthquake or Stone Edge. On the offensive side, Chimchar is a good partner to Pokemon who can take full advantage of Stealth Rock not being set up, such as Taillow.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Chimchar has access to both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, along with a big enough movepool to support the two, allowing it to gain some much-needed punch for its attacks. Unfortunately, its Speed does not allow Chimchar to take full advantage of these boosts, since it can be easily revenge killed. To make up for its poor Speed, Chimchar can use a Choice Scarf along with U-turn for some scouting. Unfortunately, Chimchar is still quite weak and is easily set up on.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Faster Fake Out leads, such as Meowth, Aipom, and Glameow can all negate Chimchar's Focus Sash and proceed to KO it with a STAB attack. Diglett is a problem since it can negate Fake Out with Protect and OHKO Chimchar with Earthquake.</p>

<p>Once Chimchar has done its job, a large amount of sweepers can set up on it, especially with its Special Attack drop. In particular, Dratini, Mantyke, Chinchou, and Gligar can take advantage of Overheat's Special Attack drop and set up on Chimchar with ease, while all packing moves that can easily take it out. Munchlax can easily sponge Chimchar's attacks and OHKO it with Earthquake.</p>
