[Overview]

<p>With decent mixed attacking stats, two moves with high Base Power, and Intimidate, Growlithe can make a great Choice Scarf user in the Little Cup environment. While this set may seem to be outclassed by Ponyta, Intimidate alone warrants the use of Growlithe.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set's primary goal is to switch into a physical threat, weaken their attack with Intimidate, and hit hard with the appropriate move. Growlithe does an excellent job of forcing physical attackers out, as well as hitting extremely hard with his two high-powered STAB moves.</p>

<p>Flare Blitz and Overheat are Growlithe's primary STAB moves, and hit almost everyone, bar Munchlax and Flash Fire Pokemon, extremely hard. The two coverage moves are for anything Growlithe's Fire-type moves can't hit hard. Hidden Power Ice is used primarily for Dragon-types. It helps Growlithe revenge kill Dragon Dance Dratini, Bagon, and Gible. Reversal, on the other hand, hits Munchlax and Houndour hard when Growlithe is at low  health. While Reversal may not seem too viable, Growlithe will often find himself at low health due to Stealth Rock damage and Flare Blitz recoil. Return or Crunch could be used for neutral coverage or to hit Ghost-types, but Reversal and Hidden Power Ice are usually the better choices.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set has a lot of trouble with bulky Water-types, so pairing him with an Electric-type is a good idea. Elekid and Choice Scarf Chinchou make great partners. Chinchou can come in on any Water-type attack aimed at Growlithe, then proceed to set up an Agility. Elekid, on the other hand, can clean up with his Speed stat of 20 after Growlithe has broken down walls with his powerful STAB moves. Munchlax also makes a great teammate, as he can wall Choice Scarf Houndour, who loves to switch in on Growlithe's STAB moves. A status absorber is also nice, because being paralyzed almost completely nullifies Growlithe's effectiveness.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>While Growlithe doesn't have a particularly impressive movepool, Crunch can be used to OHKO Gastly and 2HKOes Duskull without having to deal with recoil, poor accuracy or a Special Attack drop. Any Hidden Power of your choice can work, including Hidden Power Rock or even Hidden Power Grass to hit Chinchou on the switch. Other than these few moves, there aren't many other viable ones in Growlithe's shallow movepool.</p> 

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Growlithe's biggest counters are bulky Waters who can set up on him, such as Agility Chinchou and Mantyke. Practically any Water-type be able to defeat Growlithe, and can use the turn on which Growlithe switches out to set up or simply attack the switch-in. Houndour can freely switch in on every single one of Growlithe's moves, bar Reversal, and can proceed to damage your Pokemon with his powerful STAB Fire-type attacks. Faster Choice Scarf users, such as Gastly, can deliver a strong hit to Growlithe with their STAB moves. However, most of these Pokemon will struggle to switch in on Growlithe thanks to his powerful attacks.</p>
