[Overview]

<p>At first glance, Cyndaquil appears to be an inferior Houndour or Ponyta. While this is true in most cases, Cyndaquil does have something that the other common Fire-types do not: Eruption. With one of the strongest Fire-type moves in existence backed by STAB, Cyndaquil has quite literally burnt itself a place in the tier.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Cyndaquil's main advantage over other Fire-types in Little Cup is his access to Eruption, an extremely powerful STAB move. Since Cyndaquil has a rather mediocre base Speed stat, giving it a Choice Scarf helps make up for it by allowing it to fire off STAB Eruption without being outpaced by opposing threats. Also, with the boost obtained from Choice Scarf, Cyndaquil reaches a Speed stat of 24, which is enough to outpace common Choice Scarf Pokemon who cap at only 21 Speed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice of which Hidden Power to use is based solely upon the battler's personal preference; Hidden Power Grass has the ability to hit most Water-types for super effective damage, while Hidden Power Electric can hit Mantyke hard. This is important, as Mantyke would otherwise wall this entire set. Double Kick must be used with some prediction, as after Stealth Rock damage it will OHKO Houndour, who will often switch in expecting to sponge a Fire-type move. Though it may seem odd to use two Fire-type moves on Cyndaquil, if Cyndaquil has taken too much residual damage, Eruption will become very weak while Fire Blast and Flamethrower will always do the same damage, regardless of how much damage Cyndaquil has taken. It is worth noting that the given EVs make up for the stat loss due to the use of Hidden Power.</p>

<p>Munchlax is a huge roadblock for Cyndaquil due to its immense bulk and ability, Thick Fat, effectively giving it a resistance to Fire-type attacks. Gastly can be used to beat Munchlax, as it is capable of luring and KOing it. Entry hazards, preferably in the form of Stealth Rock, can be quite useful to Cyndaquil as they break the Focus Sash of Pokemon who choose to carry it. Also, Pokemon who benefit from Cyndaquil blowing holes in the opponent's team are the best teammates for it. Examples of these Pokemon include fast late-game sweepers such as Rock Polish Gligar and offensive variants of Elekid.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Since Cyndaquil is generally outclassed by other Pokemon, there isn't much you should change when using it. A physical Life Orb set can be used with Flare Blitz as the STAB move, but it is outclassed by Ponyta due to its significantly higher Attack and Speed. A SubSalac set utilizing Reversal has potential, but with the prevalence of priority attacks in Little Cup, it'll be very difficult to use. Finally, Cyndaquil can be used as a lead with Quick Attack, but it is outclassed by Ponyta, who boasts better base stats.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>As mentioned before, Munchlax with its colossal HP, defensive stats, and ability, Thick Fat, will stop Cyndaquil. Mantyke can easily switch into any of Cyndaquil's attacks bar Hidden Power Electric and threaten it with a STAB Hydro Pump or Surf. Chinchou is in the same boat as Mantyke, as it can switch into any attack excluding Hidden Power Grass. Houndour and Ponyta not only outclass Cyndaquil in many ways, but they can also switch into a Cyndaquil locked into a Fire-type move and begin setting up courtesy of Flash Fire. Finally, faster Pokemon and users of Aqua Jet can revenge kill Cyndaquil with relative ease. </p>
