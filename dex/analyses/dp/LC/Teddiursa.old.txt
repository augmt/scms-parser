[Overview]

<p>Teddiursa is one adorable ursidae, but don't be fooled; he's smarter than the average bear. With a base 80 Attack stat and an awesome movepool, this cuddly critter is, in fact, one beastly attacker, being one of only two Pokemon in Little Cup blessed with the rare Quick Feet ability, which allows him to overcome his otherwise poor Speed stat, as well as effectively make use of a consistent 140 Base Power STAB move. Teddiursa is not without his fair share of checks, though, as priority and faster Choice Scarf users that run rampant around the tier are major issues for the feisty furball, preventing him from achieving true stardom. Nevertheless, this marvelous mammal can be a devastating weapon in the right hands, and should, under every circumstance, be treated with caution.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Quick Feet is an awesome ability, and Teddiursa can take advantage of it to become a very effective transitioning mid-game revenge killer / late-game sweeper. Facade is a given on any status abuser, packing insane power after all the boosts are factored in. Close Combat destroys Rock- and Steel-types that resist Facade, while Crunch gets the Ghost-types who are immune to it. With perfect coverage from these three moves, Teddiursa has room in his last slot for a set-up move. While Protect is the safer option, allowing Teddiursa to activate his status orb in complete safety, Swords Dance is worth a look; despite being the "riskier" choice, if it is pulled off successfully, Teddiursa will have enough power to OHKO even the bulkiest of Gligar with Facade, and that's saying something.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Attack and Speed are maximized as per the traditional sweeper spread, with one extra point added to each defensive stat with the remaining EVs. A Jolly nature is required for Teddiursa to reach the magic 14 Speed stat, allowing it to outpace every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame after its status orb activates, which is, of course, very important. An excellent partner for Teddiursa is Gligar, whose wonderful bulk allows it to absorb stray Mach Punches and Vacuum Waves, as well as set up Stealth Rock, with ease. Gligar can also pass Teddiursa stat boosts that would even further facilitate his sweep. Slowpoke is another good teammate, with its ability to paralyze faster Choice Scarf users with Thunder Wave. Finally, Wynaut can also be useful in taking out Choice Scarf users with its extremely specialized movepool and ability.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A Choice Band set is viable, but Teddiursa is slow, and unfortunately lacks the bulk to make up for it. The same can be said for a Bulk Up set. Moveset-wise, most options give rather redundant coverage because of Facade's absurb Base Power. Earthquake can go over Close Combat if you find the defense drops unappealing, but keep in mind that it is significantly weaker, and that a resisted Facade is more powerful than a neutral Earthquake. Cross Chop is a similar case. In general, the moves already given are simply the best.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Few things can stand up to repeated assaults from Teddiursa's punishing paws, but Bronzor stands out as the best counter; it is only 4HKOed by an unboosted Close Combat, and can do whatever it pleases in that time, including set up screens, which allows it to deal with Teddiursa with even greater ease. Faster Choice Scarf users can revenge kill Teddiursa rather easily, as can priority abusers, especially after a few defense drops from Close Combat. Mankey, Gastly, Diglett, Croagunk, and Magby are all good examples of Pokemon that can effectively revenge kill Teddiursa. Other than that, well, you're pretty much screwed, but it's your fault for not packing a good Teddiursa check.</p>
