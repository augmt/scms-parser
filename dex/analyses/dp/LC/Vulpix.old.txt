[Overview]

<p>Vulpix is quite an underrated threat in Little Cup. It can reach a maximum of 17 Speed, outpacing a good portion of the metagame. While Vulpix often faces fierce competition with its Fire-type brethren for team positions, it does possess some notable advantages, such as having access to Energy Ball and Hypnosis. Play with Vulpix's key points to their peak and you will surely have a frightening fox in your hands. </p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Scarf Vulpix is an unexpected and powerful Pokemon. With a Choice Scarf, Vulpix reaches 25 Speed, outspeeding dangerous Pokemon such as Jolly Choice Scarf Cranidos and Machop. On the first moveslot, Fire Blast is the main option since it is powerful and at least somewhat reliable, but Overheat can be used instead to deal even more damage at the cost of -2 Special Attack, which is great for hit-and-run tactics. Energy Ball complements Vulpix's Fire-type STAB well, hitting Water-types that would otherwise wall this set super effectively. Hypnosis sets Vulpix apart from its Fire-type rivals, allowing it to sleep otherwise threatening Pokemon. Hidden Power Ground is the best option for the last moveslot, as it allows Vulpix to take out opposing Fire-types. However, Hidden Power Ice is a good alternative that can be used to deal with Dragon-types.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Will-O-Wisp can be used to burn physical sweepers, rendering them useless for the rest of the match. Flamethrower is a viable option if you want more accuracy, although power is usually more important since Vulpix's Special Attack is unboosted. IVs of 30 Special Attack and Special Defense are needed for Hidden Power Ground, while IVs of 30 Attack and Defenseshould be used if Hidden Power Ice is chosen.</p>

<p>Rapid Spin really helps Vulpix do its job better by removing Stealth Rock, allowing Vulpix to switch in more freely. Staryu can serve this purpose well thanks to its relatively high Speed stat. It can also help take on Water attacks aimed at Vulpix, while Vulpix can eliminate Grass-types for Staryu. Choice Scarf Mankey is a great teammate that is able to beat Vulpix's number one counter, Munchlax. Mankey can also use U-turn to gain momentum for the team. Pineco is a good teammate because of its ability to set up Spikes, which really help Vulpix sweep; it also tends to attract Fire-type attacks, which Vulpix can switch in on for a Flash Fire boost. Paras, like Pineco, sports a large Fire weakness, but is immune to Water thanks to Dry Skin and also resists Ground, making it another good partner for Vulpix.</p>

<p>Pokemon with Aqua Jet, such as Carvanha and Totodile, can easily pick off Vulpix. Choice Scarf Gligar can also beat all types of Vulpix with Earthquake, outspeeding even Choice Scarf Vulpix and OHKOing with Earthquake. To remedy these problems, Pokemon such as Paras, Surskit, and Mantyke can be used to defend Vulpix from Water and Ground attacks and retaliate back with super effective moves.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With this set, Vulpix can take advantage of the switches it causes with Substitute and deals massive damage. Switch in on a Pokemon that does not threaten it, such as a weak Fire- or Grass-type, Substitute as the opponent switches, and proceed to either hit the switch-in hard or inflict status. Hypnosis is again used because it allows Vulpix to incapacitate its counters. Will-O-Wisp is a good alternative if you don't like Hypnosis's shaky accuracy, and helps a lot against physical sweepers. Behind a Substitute, Vulpix will usually get two shots at using Hypnosis, so it can usually put a Pokemon to sleep, and then do damage with Energy Ball or STAB Fire Blast.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Life Orb is the best item choice, as it offers almost as much power as Choice Specs, but allows you to change moves. However, Wide Lens is also a usable item option; with Wide Lens, Fire Blast reaches 93.5% accuracy, Will-O-Wisp increases to 82.5%, and Hypnosis gets a slight boost to 66%. Wynaut can help Vulpix set up a Substitute through Encore, and can also take on some of Vulpix's counters with Counter and Mirror Coat.</p>

<p>Substitute Vulpix is a great cleanup Pokemon, finishing off any Pokemon on the opponent's team late-game when most Pokemon are weakened. Flamethrower is again an alternative option because it is more reliable than Fire Blast, but if Vulpix is behind a Substitute, Fire Blast misses are more tolerable. Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Ground are also options for the fourth moveslot, as they provide greater coverage.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Quick Attack is an option to pick off weakened Pokemon. Hidden Power Electric and Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Mantyke. Hidden Power Rock has the added bonus of hitting other Fire-types, but Hidden Power Electric hurts Mantyke much more. Pain Split can be used on the Substitute set to make it easier to beat walls, but you lose out on valuable coverage or a status-inflicting move. Choice Specs can be used instead of Choice Scarf to obtain more power, notably gaining a higher chance of OHKOing 0 HP / 0 SpD Chinchou at full health with Energy Ball.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Munchlax is a great counter to Vulpix, being able to take four Fire Blasts from the Life Orb set and hit back hard with Earthquake or STAB Return. Mantyke is a big problem unless Vulpix carries Hidden Power Electric or Hidden Power Rock, due to its high Special Defense stat. Gligar cannot come in directly on Vulpix, but can switch in after a teammate faints, and either U-turn to scout the switch, or outspeed Vulpix and use Earthquake to OHKO. Opposing Fire-types and Dragon-types counter Vulpix if it does not carry the appropriate Hidden Power. Dratini gets a special mention because it not only resists both Fire Blast and Energy Ball, but also has Shed Skin to heal itself from Hypnosis and Will-O-Wisp.</p>
