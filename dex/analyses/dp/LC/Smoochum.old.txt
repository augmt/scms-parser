[OVERVIEW]

<p>On paper, Smoochum looks horrible. Terrible base stats (aside from a good Special Attack and decent Speed) along with two near-useless abilities make her an oft-overlooked Pokemon. However, Smoochum can fight back with an extremely strong Blizzard. If priority users and a few walls are taken down, Smoochum can easily sweep entire teams with Blizzard coming off a maximum of 19 Special Attack.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With Choice Scarf, Smoochum attempts to circumvent her horrible defenses and rip through teams with a STAB Blizzard coming off of 18 or 19 Special Attack as well as 24 or 25 Speed.</p>

<p>Blizzard hits amazingly hard, OHKOing everything from Gligar to Gastly. Only a few Pokemon, such as Bronzor, Munchlax, and Water-types will avoid being 2HKOed by Blizzard. Psychic is a backup STAB move, hitting Water-types that resist Blizzard for massive damage. Hidden Power Ground hits Houndour, who otherwise walls Smoochum. Finally, Ice Beam is used in case Smoochum needs to perform a revenge kill in unfavorable weather.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Trick is an option to cripple Munchlax and Bronzor. However, Smoochum despises losing her Scarf, as without it, Smoochum is easy bait for anything faster. The EVs on this set give Smoochum maximum Special Attack and Speed; it is useless to put EVs anywhere else on Smoochum because it's too frail to take a hit.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Aside from a Choice Scarf set, Smoochum has few options. It can attempt to run a Nasty Plot set with Salac Berry or Speed-passing, but it is easily killed by priority. Smoochum has a plethora of other special attacks; however, they have redundant coverage with her main moves. Smoochum can set up Trick Room and sweep effectively under it, though priority hurts it just like any other Smoochum set. Finally, Smoochum learns Fake Out and can attempt to lead with it, but has almost nothing to favor it over other Fake Out leads.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Smoochum, being the fragile Pokemon that it is, has many counters. Munchlax and Bronzor utterly laugh at any attempts from Smoochum to hurt them besides Trick. Houndour walls Smoochum outside of Hidden Power Ground, and can use Sucker Punch to pick Smoochum off; Stunky and Croagunk can do the same. All three of them also learn Pursuit, which will easily KO Smoochum if it decides to run. Weather changers like Hippopotas or Rain Dance Mantyke will make Blizzard unreliable and render Smoochum essentially useless. Finally, priority users (especially Fake Out users) will kill Smoochum quite easily.</p>
