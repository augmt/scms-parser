[Overview]

<p>Turtwig is an interesting Grass-type to use in Little Cup. Thanks to its relatively unique attribute allocation and move pool, Turtwig manages to be a stand-out amongst the pure Grass types of Little Cup. When compared to its fellow Grass-types, it plays well in Trick Room, lacks any real status options, has a significant physical move pool, and has access to a few unique moves like Earth Power and Stealth Rock. Whether or not its strengths are enough to merit it a slot on your team, however, is up for debate. Turtwig is incredibly slow, boasts no priority, and is easily taken out with super effective attacks or worn down over time by repeated assaults. Using Turtwig to the best of its abilities can be problematic, although it often manages to be decent competitor regardless.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set attempts to play Turtwig as a defensive Stealth Rock lead. Utilizing this Turtwig is rather simple. This set easily equips Turtwig with the tools necessary to combat numerous opposing leads, assuming it is played correctly and with decent prediction.</p>

<p>Turtwig needs Stealth Rock to destroy Focus Sashes and provide support for a team member trying to sweep. Protect is almost required to deal with Fake Out users, to scout, and to work against Explosions from the likes of Voltorb and Gastly, who are both common leads. Seed Bomb is Turtwig's most powerful STAB attack and primary means of causing damage. The fourth move is up for grabs, as Turtwig's coverage will be flawed either way. Crunch nails Gastly and Drifloon and is great for consistent, neutral coverage, whereas Superpower can be a surprise blow against certain leads that attempt to set up on you. The EVs provide Turtwig with strong durability and a free Speed point. Oran Berry adds extra bulk for Turtwig to take an extra hit or two and greatly increases this set's worth.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Against Taunting leads, Turtwig should generally attack on the predicted Taunt, and save the ability to Protect for later. If the lead is, say, a Voltorb, one may save Turtwig from dying to an Explosion with a well-timed Protect instead of simply losing him and his potential Stealth Rock altogether. Against other bulky leads, unless Turtwig is capable of directly hurting them, it should just lay down use Stealth Rock and allow for a more directly threatening teammate to come in afterward.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that Turtwig is not Superman, and that certain problem leads, like Houndour, are out there. Houndour, of course, is a threat to lead Turtwig and may be remedied by using a Houndour of your own with Flash Fire, or a Fire-type resist to take the attack. Chimchar, though uncommon, can also cause problems for Turtwig by using its Fire-type STAB. This can also be remedied by a Fire-type resist or immunity. Meowth also causes some problems, but all it can really do to hurt you is a super effective U-turn.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Seed Bomb
move 2: Superpower
move 3: Crunch
move 4: Double-Edge / Return
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 236 HP / 212 Atk / 4 Def / 28 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although slow, bulky Choice Banders are rarely ideal in the Little Cup metagame, Turtwig is a fine choice for one nonetheless. Turtwig's stats and moves make it perfect for the job of a wallbreaker. Turtwig is slow, sturdy, strong, and blessed with an outstanding physical move pool for a Grass-type. Although bulky, it is still easily revenge killed. As such, Turtwig is best utilized as a team's wallbreaker; it hits just about anything hard if you predict correctly, and then goes down fighting. Considering the great coverage that its movepool provides, it is very capable of doing this effectively.</p>

<p>Seed Bomb is a strong, reliable STAB attack for Turtwig to use as its main attack to rip holes with. The other moves help with coverage. Superpower hits just as hard as STAB Seed Bomb on a neutral hit and provides valuable Fighting coverage against Steel-types, while Crunch cripples any Ghost-types you'll encounter. In the fourth slot, Normal-type attacks provide excellent neutral coverage and Double-Edge is the stronger choice, and plays well with Turtwig's aforementioned role as team "wrecking ball." However, without STAB, the difference in power between Return and Double-Edge is rarely significant, but the recoil can be. The above EVs provide Turtwig with max Attack and HP, with the remaining EVs going into the only areas they can round out: Speed and Defense.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As mentioned above, this Turtwig can be easily revenge killed due to its pitiful Speed and inability to change attacks. The revenge killer will usually resist your Turtwig's attacks and threaten with a super-effective attack of its own. All you can do is predict that attack and switch out to a Pokemon with resistances to Turtwig's weaknesses. One example of a Pokemon with these resistances includes Munchlax, which effectively resists Fire- and Ice- type attacks thanks to Thick Fat. Fire-types like Magby, Houndour, and Cyndaquil also have great synergy with Turtwig, since they cover each others' most glaring weaknesses. All of these Pokemon can switch in on an Ice-, Fire-, or Bug-type attack aimed at Turtwig and threaten your opponent. Bronzor also makes a good partner with Turtwig, with resistances to Ice and Flying and an immunity to Poison.</p>

[SET]
name: Dual Screens
move 1: Light Screen
move 2: Reflect
move 3: Seed Bomb
move 4: Crunch / Stealth Rock
item: Light Clay

evs: 236 HP / 52 Atk / 84 Def / 76 SpD / 28 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Turtwig is the only Grass-type Pokemon capable of learning Reflect, Light Screen, and Stealth Rock, allowing it to fill a valuable niche as a supporter. The goal is to bring Turtwig in on something that it resists, and set up both Stealth Rock and the dual screens. Crunch allows Turtwig to hit Ghosts for super effective damage and Bronzor for neutral damage if you already have something to set Stealth Rock up. The given EVs are the same as on the Lead set, and for the same reasons; bulk is essential, and little else is useful anyway.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Turtwig's role here is to set up in order for other Pokemon to sweep. Mantyke makes excellent use of screens, notably Reflect, and is resistant to Fire and neutral to Ice. Drifloon greatly appreciates screens, as it allows them to set up Calm Minds for a sweep. Gligar also benefits from screens greatly, going from bulky to nearly impenetrable. There are plenty of other setup sweepers in Little Cup to use in tandem with Turtwig, but the ones mentioned are the most notable.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Seed Bomb
move 2: Earth Power
move 3: Hidden Power Fire
move 4: Crunch
item: Life Orb
nature: Quiet
evs: 216 Atk / 4 Def / 240 SpA
ivs: 30 Atk / 30 SpA / 2 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Turtwig's low Speed makes it very dangerous with proper Trick Room support, as it reaches a sluggish 7 Speed minimum. This set is built to abuse Trick Room by turning Turtwig into a speedy, offensive Juggernaut while Trick Room is active. By using a mixed set, Turtwig is able to take advantage of its well-rounded coverage when using both physical and special moves, as well as its freedom to invest in both of its offenses. Many things are hit either super effective or for a strong neutral hit by this set's offenses. Life Orb is a must on this set in order for Turtwig to hit as hard as possible.</p>

<p>Seed Bomb is a strong and reliable STAB and is Turtwig's main move on this set. Earth Power is one of Turtwig's two special attacks and hits Steels that could cause harm to this Turtwig. Hidden Power Fire allows Turtwig to hit opposing Grass-types for super effective damage as well as Bronzor who would otherwise wall this set. Crunch, in the final slot, hits Ghosts such as Drifloon, Shuppet, and Gastly and has excellent neutral coverage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Having a good Pokemon to set up Trick Room is essential for optimal use of this set. Without Trick Room, this set pales in comparison to the Choice Band set, as it hits softer, is even slower, and is frailer. Some Pokemon who can help Turtwig out immensely by setting up Trick Room include Slowpoke, who resists both Fire- and Ice-type attacks and Bronzor who resists every one of Turtwig's weaknesses but Fire.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Turtwig's physical options are limited at best and everything usable has already been covered above. For special attacking options, Turtwig could use Hidden Power Ice, Electric, or Psychic over Hidden Power Fire, in order to deal 4x damage to Gligar, Mantyke, or Croagunk, respectively.</p>

<p>Turtwig's supporting move pool is excellent. Outside of the several supporting moves above, Turtwig has notable access to Leech Seed and Synthesis. Unfortunately, neither of these are useful enough to warrant a move slot. Leech Seed is probably the best option of the two, as it improves Turtwig's stalling power and allows it to force switches. Turtwig, though sturdy, just isn't bulky enough to use Synthesis effectively in the exceedingly offensive Little Cup metagame.</p>

<p>Turtwig has plenty of set-up moves to offer in Amnesia, Curse, Growth, Swords Dance, Rain Dance, and Sunny Day. Unfortunately, sets utilizing Amnesia and Curse are generally too easy to take down before they accomplish anything significant. Sets running Growth or Swords Dance would also run into a similar issue and could only reach 13 Speed at best, which is very slow. Turtwig is easily outclassed by other Pokemon who can set up weather.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for Turtwig, three of its base stats end in 5, which limits the number of EVs it is able to effectively distribute. However, Turtwig's 64 Defense does grant it a Defense point with an investment of only four EVs. Being so slow, Turtwig is best off investing in HP and defenses on the defensive sets, and HP and its chosen attacking stat on the offensive sets. Defensive sets can choose between being mostly physically defensive, slightly physically defensive, balanced, or slightly specially defensive; just configure the EVs and nature according to what types of attacks you want Turtwig to take. If you have some EVs left over, keep in mind that Turtwig can invest 28 EVs in Speed to gain a +1 bonus, which is better than nothing and could assist it in outrunning other slow, bulky Pokemon such as Aron, Nosepass, and Shieldon. Turtwig's inability to reach 19 HP means that Life Orb will always do 2 damage to it; keep this in mind if you're using Life Orb.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>With the right move from the right set Turtwig is capable of hurting just about anything in Little Cup. This, however, is common in Little Cup and as such, Turtwig is perfectly counterable by a number of Pokemon. Bronzor is Turtwig's best switch-in as it resists most of its attacking moves and can deal with Crunch. It fares particularly well against the physical sets, although it would be wise to watch out for Hidden Power Fire. Against the physical sets, Gligar is an outstanding switch-in unless Turtwig is running Hidden Power Ice, and Turtwig lacks anything with which to significantly hurt Gligar. Gligar can in turn threaten Turtwig with STAB Aerial Ace, but an Aqua Tail/Earthquake Gligar cannot do much against Turtwig. Other Grass types, if they avoid Hidden Power Fire, only have Crunch to contend with. Faster Grass/Poison types with Sludge Bomb can often switch in fine and threaten Turtwig with an OHKO.</p>

<p>Taunt can shut down a support Turtwig, as it stops any non-attacking moves. Considering how slow Turtwig is, landing a faster Taunt is easy for just about anything who knows the move. Also due to its low Speed, Turtwig is incredibly easy to revenge kill by anything faster with a powerful super-effective attack. Turtwig can be quite the threat under Trick Room. Pokemon who are even slower than Turtwig, like Munchlax and Trapinch, can attempt to hold it at bay or KO it by getting the initiative. Protect stalling also works quite well when applicable. Priority attacks other than Aqua Jet can also be great against a Trick Room Turtwig, as it lacks any priority whatsoever. Ice Shard works particularly well.</p>
