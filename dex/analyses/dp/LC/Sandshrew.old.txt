[Overview]

<p>Sandshrew is truly a versatile Pokemon in Little Cup. Not only is it able to abuse its massive physical bulk to support its teammates with both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, but it is also able to utilize its above-average Attack stat along with its decent base Speed and passable offensive movepool to abuse Swords Dance to boost its Attack and present a formidable offensive threat in LC if given a sufficient amount of support from its teammates. Sandshrew can easily be classified as one of the most efficient, though overlooked Pokemon in the tier of Little Cup.</p>

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>With massive natural bulk and excellent utility, Sandshrew makes a fine supporting Pokemon. Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin are both staples on this set, as they are the best support options Sandshrew is able to muster from its movepool. Earthquake and Rock Slide are both advised on this set as they provide Sandshrew with attacking options coming off an impressive base 75 Attack stat, ensuring that Sandshrew is not completely vulnerable to Taunt users or set-up bait for sweepers; the two aforementioned moves also have great offensive coverage with each other, forming the infamous "EdgeQuake" combination.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>The given EV spread has been designed to maximize Sandshrew's defensive prowess by heavily investing in HP, Defense, and Special Defense while also making the mouse Pokemon slightly offensive through EV investments in Attack and Speed. An Impish nature further complements the EV spread by making Sandshrew more bulky and durable, allowing it to provide support during various points in a battle, such as when it switches into a resisted physical attack. Lastly, an Oran Berry is the recommended item as it allows Sandshrew to remain at a passable level of health throughout the course of a battle.</p> 

[SET] 
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Night Slash / Substitute
item: Oran Berry / Life Orb
nature: Adamant 
evs: 40 HP / 236 Atk / 36 SpD / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS] 

<p>With passable Attack and decent Speed, along with an impressive amount of bulk and access to Swords Dance, Sandshrew is perfectly capable of playing an offensively-oriented role as a sweeper. Earthquake is used as a strong, reliable STAB attack, while Stone Edge is paired with Earthquake to provide coverage. Night Slash rounds out the set by giving Sandshrew unresisted coverage in Little Cup, although Substitute can be used over Night Slash to ease prediction when Sandshrew is performing a sweep. Additionally, Sandshrew's ability, Sand Veil, when used in conjunction with Substitute, will make landing an attack on Sandshrew harder in sandstorm.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>The given EVs maximize Sandshrew's offensive prowess while simultaneously making it quite bulky and durable by investing in HP and Special Defense; an Adamant nature is recommended as it helps further increase Sandshrew's Attack, thus making it more effective as a sweeper. An Oran Berry is highly recommended as it will prolong Sandshrew's sweep while also making it easier to set up a Swords Dance, although if you're intent on emphasizing power on this set, a Life Orb can be utilized.</p> 

[Other Options] 

<p>Outside of the above sets, Sandshrew unfortunately doesn't have many other options to choose from, as many of them are largely outclassed by other Pokemon. A RestTalk set can be utilized, but the stall-ish nature of said set isn't very suitable for the fast paced, offensively inclined Little Cup metagame. In terms of possible move changes, Sandshrew has a couple to choose from: X-Scissor, Brick Break, and Gyro Ball are all viable, but when compared to the sheer power and coverage that Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Night Slash give, they aren't smart choices.</p>

[Checks and Counters] 

<p>Water-types spell doom for Sandshrew, as it's quite vulnerable on the special side. Mantyke, Chinchou, and Staryu can all easily dispose of Sandshrew with simple STAB attacks; even Totodile, who is usually physically inclined, can cause major problems for Sandshrew because it has a strong STAB that hits Sandshrew for super effective damage. Croagunk and Dratini are also troublesome if they pack strong, super effective moves, but both must beware of switching into boosted attacks. Also, both Bronzor and Baltoy are able to check the defensive set, but must beware of Night Slash from the Swords Dance variant, as Sandshrew will usually carry that move in its arsenal. Lastly, Gastly and Duskull are immune to Sandshrew's STAB attack and can easily dispatch of it with their STAB attacks or simply start to set up on it.</p>
