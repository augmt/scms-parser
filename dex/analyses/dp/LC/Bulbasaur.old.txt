[Overview]

<p>Seeing as it's the #1 Pokemon in National Dex order, you might expect Bulbasaur to be the best Pokemon in the history of forever. Unfortunately, this is not so, and Bulbasaur would need a lot of work on its stats and movepool before it has a chance at the top. As it is though, Bulbasaur can still work very well under the right circumstances, and, at least in Little Cup, actually make good use of what it already has.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The purpose of this set is to function as an effective revenge killer and a good late-game sweeper. Sleep Powder may seem a bit odd on a Choice set since Bulbasaur has to switch out as soon as it uses it. However, with a Choice Scarf, Bulbasaur outspeeds all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup, practically guaranteeing that it cripples an opposing Pokemon on a consistent basis. Sludge Bomb is a very strong and reliable STAB attack, and it is the preferred attacking option on this set. Leaf Storm is an even more powerful STAB, but it gets much weaker each time it's used, which can leave Bulbasaur open to being set up on. Together, Bulbasaur's STAB moves have less than ideal coverage, so Hidden Power is there to round out what Sludge Bomb and Leaf Storm can't hit. Hidden Power Ground is used to hit Steel-types, such as Aron and Magnemite, while Hidden Power Fire is almost exclusively for Bronzor. A Modest nature gives a bit of an extra pop to Bulbasaur's attacks, and this can be crucial in securing KOs in many different situations. Due to the abundance of Choice Scarf users in Little Cup, however, a Timid nature is fine to outpace a great deal of them.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>One Pokemon this set works excellently with is Houndour, thanks to the near perfect defensive and offensive synergy it shares with Bulbasaur. If you really don't like the Special Attack drop from Leaf Storm, then Energy Ball is usable; however, unless you are keeping Bulbasaur in for more than 3 turns, Leaf Storm is always the better option. Hidden Power can also be changed around to suit what threats your team needs to have covered. Keep in mind, however, that STAB neutral Sludge Bomb is just as powerful as a super effective Hidden Power, so make sure there is no overlapping coverage.</p>

<p>Bulbasaur really isn't the kind of Pokemon to base a team around, but it appreciates the support of Water-types, such as Mantyke and Chinchou, as well as Fire-types, like Ponyta and Houndour, because they all share excellent defensive and offensive synergy. Bulbasaur generally enjoys entry hazard support to guarantee certain KOs it would not normally achieve. Good teammates to set up entry hazards include Bronzor, Sandshrew, and Cacnea.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Bulbasaur can actually run a decent Curse set thanks to its access to Sleep Powder, a strong physical STAB in Power Whip, and an above-average Special Defense. A physical or mixed Choice set can also be viable. Growth could possibly make a decent option on Bulbasaur; however, it's very difficult to set up, and Bulbasaur just doesn't have enough Speed to make good use of it. Finally, thanks to Bulbasaur's above-average defenses and typing, it can potentially make a good SubSeeder.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Thanks to Bulbasaur's Sleep Powder, almost nothing can come in with no potential consequences if Sleep Clause has not yet been activated. Because of this, the best way to counter Choice Scarf Bulbasaur is through prediction. Try to switch Grass- and Fire-types in on Leaf Storms, and when you think a Sludge Bomb is coming, Water-, Ground-, and Steel-types are the best switch-ins. Factoring out Sleep Powder, Bronzor is Bulbasaur's best counter, being immune to Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Ground and resisting Leaf Storm.</p>
