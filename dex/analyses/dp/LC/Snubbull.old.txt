[Overview]

<p>Snubbull may be nothing more than a pink Fairy, but he has enough attacking power to 2HKO every Pokemon in Little Cup, and his excellent type coverage only compliments his great offensive power. Snubbull also has usable defenses; with Intimidate backing them up, he becomes quite the tank. Unfortunately, Snubbull was cursed with terrible Speed, though this can be remedied with Trick Room or Thunder Wave.</p>

<p>With a Brave nature and no investment, Snubbull reaches a pitiful 7 Speed, which, in terms of Trick Room, is outstanding. His high Attack and great type coverage helps him plow through the opposing team. Return is Snubbull's most reliable STAB attack, Crunch is used to hit Ghost-types such as Duskull, and Earthquake is used to hit Steel-types such as Aron. In the final slot, the choice between Ice Punch or Fire Punch depends on which opponent you would like to hit harder; Ice Punch has the benefit of hitting Gligar super effectively, while also dealing huge damage to Grass-types, while Fire Punch can hit Levitate Bronzor, along with Grass- and Ice-types, super effectively. Intimidate is a great ability as it goes hand in hand with Snubbull's bulk and extra defensive EVs.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are tailor-made to make Snubbull a powerful, yet defensive, sweeper. Max Attack ensures that Snubbull is dishing out a lot of damage, while max HP, along with extra Special Defense EVs, gives him extra bulk. The item choice is down to personal preference; Life Orb provides extra power, although the recoil damage is a turn off, while an Oran Berry can be used to restore some of Snubbull's HP. A Choice Band can be used for even more damage output, but it restricts Snubbull to a single move.</p>

<p>Snubbull appreciates Stealth Rock on the field as it weakens the opponent's team, allowing Snubbull to sweep more easily. Phanpy and Bronzor are great options to set them up because of their high defenses and access to numerous support options. Of course, keeping them on the opponent's side of the field is important too; a Ghost-type who can block Rapid Spin is a great teammate. Duskull is great for this role because of his good defenses and access to other support moves.</p>

<p>Pokemon who can set up Trick Room are helpful as well. Bronzor and Duskull are the best options as they have good defenses, along with access to other support moves such as Stealth Rock or Will-O-Wisp; Duskull can also switch into Fighting-type attacks aimed at Snubbull. Pokemon who can take advantage of Trick Room are also good options. Munchlax and Cranidos both have low Speed and have the ability to break down the opponent's team for a sweep.</p>

move 2: Return

<p>Snubbull can also take advantage of his good defenses and access to Intimidate. The idea is to switch into a physical attacker, lower its Attack with Intimidate, and proceed to cripple them with Thunder Wave. Return is used for STAB, Crunch hits Ghost-types such as Drifloon, and Fire Punch deals super effective damage to Bronzor. Ice Punch can be used to hit Gligar super effectively, while Earthquake hits Fire- and Steel-types such as Magby and Aron super effectively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Max HP and Defense, along with an Impish nature, make Snubbull bulky and harder to knock out. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense for extra bulk, though they can be placed into Attack for more power as well. As for other move options, Snubbull may use Heal Bell in the last slot to remove status and support his teammates.</p>

<p>Without Earthquake, Aron can set up on Snubbull with Rock Polish and sweep. Choice Scarf Mankey, Hippopotas, or Croagunk can take on Aron with ease. However, without Fire Punch, most Steel-types will cause problems for Snubbull; Magnemite and Magby are both great partners to deal with Steel-types, as well as Hippopotas and Gligar. Ghost-types are also good partners as they can switch into Fighting-type attacks aimed at Snubbull; Duskull is an excellent option as he can use Will-O-Wisp to weaken physical attackers, while Slowpoke has good defenses and Calm Mind to set up. Finally, hard-hitters who can set up against a crippled team are good teammates; Swords Dance Gligar is a good example, and SubPunch Machop also works well.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Snubbull has a wide movepool, and he also has the stats to abuse it. A SubPunch set can be used, though it won't be as powerful as other Pokemon in Little Cup since he lacks STAB. Superpower, Close Combat, and Low Kick are all good Fighting-type attacks which can be used over Earthquake or Fire Punch, but these moves either lower Snubbull's stats or depend upon the opponent's weight. Overheat may be used to blast Steel-types, as the Special Attack drop doesn't affect any of Snubbull's other moves. Taunt can be used to stop an opponent from setting up, Roar can phaze the opponent's team to rack up damage from entry hazards, and Reflect can be used to support Snubbull's teammates. Finally, Bulk Up can be used to raise Snubbull's Attack and Defense by one stage.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bronzor is one of the biggest counters to Snubbull as it resists Return, is immune to Earthquake, and has enough Defense to survive Crunch; Fire Punch is the only move he has to worry about. Gligar is immune to Earthquake and has high Defense and Speed, though he needs to watch out for Ice Punch. Slowpoke can tank Snubbull all day and restore its health with Slack Off, though repeated hits from Crunch may cause problems. Duskull can burn Snubbull, is immune to Return, and has enough Defense to survive Crunch. All of Snubbull's counters have to be careful as he'll almost always have a move that can hit them super effectively. Priority users such as Croagunk can hit Snubbull before it has the chance to attack, and Pokemon who are slower than Snubbull in Trick Room are also good; Munchlax is a good example.</p>
