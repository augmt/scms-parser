[Overview]

<p>Aside from being Little Cup's cutest Pokemon, Mantyke has two fabulous abilities in Water Absorb and Swift Swim, making it a dangerous Pokemon on the field. With base 120 Special Defense, Mantyke boasts one of the highest Special Defense stats in Little Cup. Furthermore, Mantyke with an Agility or Swift Swim boost has the ability to Speed tie with the likes of Choice Scarf Diglett, making it very hard to revenge kill if you do not have a priority move. Mantyke is one of the most threatening sweepers in Little Cup, thanks to its combination of bulk, powerful STAB, good type coverage and, once boosted, brilliant Speed. 

<p>Fortunately for opposing Pokemon, Mantyke must make a choice between the nearly unstoppable power that rain grants or the reliability, duration and immunity to Water that Agility has. Additionally, Mantyke suffers from a weakness to Stealth Rock, making it extremely easy for priority users, such as Croagunk, to take Mantyke out. Even so, it is wise to pack several Pokemon capable of revenge killing Mantyke.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With recovery in the form of Water Absorb and base 120 Special Defense, as well as the ability to double its Speed with Agility, Mantyke has the potential to become a very threatening sweeper. This set has important advantages over other Agility sweepers, such as Chinchou, because of its Ground- and Water-type immunities and higher special stats. With Life Orb, Mantyke can OHKO a variety of frailer Pokemon (such as Elekid) with a STAB Hydro Pump.</p>

<p>Hydro Pump is Mantyke's main move for this set. Coming off of 16 Special Attack, Mantyke can rip holes through its opponents (providing they do not resist it). Ice Beam allows Mantyke to hit Grass-types and score an easy OHKO against Gligar. With Hidden Power Electric, Mantyke can switch in on common Rain Dance sweepers, such as Buizel, Kabuto, Squirtle, and other Mantyke, and OHKO them. Hidden Power Flying is useful against opposing Snover and Fighting-types, particularly Croagunk, and receives STAB due to Mantyke's part Flying-type.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Unlike the Swift Swim set, which is timed on a set amount of terms, Agility Mantyke has the ability to sweep until it faints. Without needing to use Swift Swim, Mantyke makes a more effective Water-type switch-in thanks to Water Absorb, rejuvenating 25% of its health upon switching into a Water-type attack. The EVs on this set account for Hidden Power Electric, so if Hidden Power Flying is chosen, take four Defense EVs and put them into Speed due to the IV drop that comes with the change.</p>

<p>Even though Mantyke hits like a champ with 16 Special Attack, it can only 3HKO Munchlax with an Oran Berry, while Munchlax 2HKOes Mantyke with Return. This issue may be remedied by using Machop, who OHKOes Munchlax with Dynamic Punch. Mantyke is also easily revenge killed by mixed priority Croagunk with a combination of Fake Out and Sucker Punch, although one may try to PP stall Sucker Punch out. Having a Ghost-type like Duskull or Gastly on your team can help remedy this problem greatly, as Fake Out does not affect them and they can take advantage of Sucker Punch with non-offensive moves. Before setting up, Mantyke sits at 14 Speed, and thus is easily outsped by Elekid, KOing it before it can retaliate. Chinchou can also take a hit or two from Mantyke and OHKO back with Thunderbolt. To solve these problems, using a Ground-type Pokemon, such as Diglett, to switch in on the Electric-type attack and defeat them with Earthquake is recommended. Other Mantyke with Hidden Power Electric can also be troublesome; therefore, Munchlax can be used to check them, making it a good partner for this Mantyke.</p>

[SET]

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Using its ability, Swift Swim, Mantyke can be one of the most dangerous special sweepers in Little Cup under the rain. This Mantyke relies heavily on Rain Dance and a rain-boosted Hydro Pump to score KOs. With the rain active, Mantyke reaches a Speed of 28 with a Modest nature, and can rip holes through Little Cup with its extremely powerful Hydro Pump. This allows Mantyke to easily outrun any Choice Scarfer barring Diglett, Elekid, and Voltorb, almost always making it the fastest Pokemon on the battlefield. With a Timid nature, Mantyke hits 30 Speed, which allows it to at least Speed tie with Diglett, Voltorb, and Elekid, assuming they are holding Choice Scarf.</p>

<p>In a similar vein as the Agility set, Mantyke's moves allow for perfect neutral coverage. Hydro Pump and Surf are the the main choices for attacking due to the STAB. Hidden Power Electric hits other Water-types for super effective damage, specifically other Mantyke, while Hidden Power Flying offers the ability to hit both Croagunk and Snover, who can both stop this set in its tracks. Finally, Ice Beam OHKOes Gligar and hits Dragon- and Grass-types for super effective damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The choice between Hydro Pump and Surf as your STAB is up to personal preference. With Hydro Pump, you have a 120 Base Power STAB move to fire off, and if it is used under rain, Mantyke has a shot at OHKOing Munchlax, if Mantyke is carrying a Life Orb and is using a Modest nature. The drawbacks of Hydro Pump are the advantages that Surf brings. Surf sacrifices 25 Base Power for perfect accuracy and 10 more PP than Hydro Pump, which may end up being crucial during the match.</p>

<p>This set also allows Mantyke to be able to use many alternative items well. Life Orb offers raw power at the expense of HP every turn, while Damp Rock allows Mantyke to set up rain for eight turns, allowing it to continue sweeping longer and avoid Protect stalling. When EVing Mantyke, it should be noted that the EVs account for Hidden Power Electric, but if Hidden Power Flying is chosen, you must take four EVs from Defense and add them to Speed to make up for the loss in IVs.</p>

<p>As with all Mantyke sets, Chinchou causes the most problems, as does Elekid when rain is not up. Both of these threats can be remedied by switching a Ground-type in on their respective Electric-type attacks and then KOing with Earthquake. Diglett in particular does a good job at this because of its Arena Trap ability. Croagunk causes Mantyke problems if it has Fake Out and Sucker Punch, while its Dry Skin ability heals its HP every turn. Munchlax can still cause problems, especially without rain up. Croagunk can be checked by a Ghost-type such as Drifloon or Gastly, and Munchlax may be checked by Machop.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes advantage of Mantyke's great bulk to give it more chances to set up Rain Dance and sweep. Mantyke can set up on what would normally be a counter or check to it. Two notable Pokemon who are set-up bait here are Munchlax and Croagunk. The standard Croagunk is not able to hurt Mantyke enough to be a problem, and Mantyke easily sets up Rain Dance on it. Munchlax's Return is either a 2HKO or 3HKO depending on its Attack investment. This set even provides support for other Rain Dance sweepers by giving them seven turns under rain to sweep with.</p>

<p>As with Mantyke's other sets, Hydro Pump works as its main STAB and strongest move on the set. If the accuracy of Hydro Pump is a concern, however, Surf is an option with its perfect accuracy. Ice Beam gives Mantyke additional type coverage, hitting Grass-types and Gligar super effectively. The choice of Hidden Power all depends on who you want to hit. Hidden Power Electric allows Mantyke to hit Waters and other Mantyke, while Hidden Power Flying hits Snover and Croagunk.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Like the above sets, this set is EVed for Hidden Power Electric. If Hidden Power Flying is chosen, however, the set must be given a very minor tweak, since the change in IVs lower the Defense and Speed stats. Four EVs from the Defense stat must be transferred to Speed to make the change of Hidden Powers.</p>

<p>Chinchou and Elekid cause problems, as they can exploit Mantyke's weakness to Electric-type attacks. Both of these threats can be remedied by switching a Ground-type in on their respective Electric-type attacks and KOing with Earthquake; Diglett in particular does this well, as it can trap and fire off a super effective Earthquake against both threats. Croagunk causes problems for Mantyke even if you can set up on it, as it can hit you with Fake Out and then KO with a prioritized Sucker Punch. Croagunk's Dry Skin ability also heals its HP every turn when under the rain, giving it added survivability. One of this set's goals is to set up rain for its teammates, so you will be switching out often, and because of this, Stealth Rock could be a problem. To remedy this, Rapid Spin support can be employed.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Hidden Power Grass may be used over Hidden Power Electric or Hidden Power Flying to 2HKO opposing Chinchou and keep coverage against Water-types. Similarly, Hidden Power Ground also hits Chinchou hard, but serves more use in the Swift Swim sets than Hidden Power Grass does. This is because a rain-boosted Hydro Pump has similar power to that of a super effective Hidden Power Electric, so using Hidden Power Ground allows Mantyke to be safer against both Chinchou and Croagunk.</p> 

<p>Wacan Berry may be used to help the 4x Electric weakness that plagues Mantyke, and earn a surprise KO from its benefits. In an attempt to stall, Aqua Ring may be used for its constant supply of free HP. Unfortunately, the offensive nature of Little Cup makes adding the move quite costly. Mantyke can take advantage of its monstrous Special Defense to become a wall with defensive EVs. Unfortunately, a huge amount of Pokemon in Little Cup can take advantage of its typing and poor Defense stat, taking away from the set's effectiveness.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Mantyke can be a very difficult Pokemon to counter once it has set up, but Pokemon such as Chinchou can easily counter it, taking little damage from virtually everything Mantyke can throw at it and OHKOing in return with a STAB Electric-type move. Munchlax, the dominant special wall in Little Cup, can check Mantyke by 2HKOing it with Return. Without Hidden Power Flying, Mantyke has trouble against Pokemon such as Croagunk and Snover, and without Hidden Power Electric, Mantyke can be stopped by most Water-types and even opposing Mantyke, providing they have it. Before it has set up, most Pokemon in Little Cup can take Mantyke out if they have a super effective move and can survive a hit.</p>
