[Overview]

<p>While Bonsly is certainly not a top-tier Little Cup Pokemon, it at least has good Attack and Defense stats, and it gets Rock Polish to boost its absolutely terrible Speed. Bonsly does not have an amazing movepool, but it gets just enough for a basic Rock Polish set. However, Bonsly's main problem is that Geodude gets every move Bonsly gets and more. Although Bonsly is slightly bulkier, this is not enough to differentiate it from Geodude and other Rock Polish users. Nonetheless, Bonsly has the tiniest of niches by being pure-Rock type. While that alone may not make it better than Geodude, it is not entirely outclassed.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the best set that Bonsly can run. After a Rock Polish, Bonsly hits 22 Speed, and outspeeds all unboosted Pokemon in the tier. Rock Slide is Bonsly's best STAB attack, as it does not get Stone Edge. Sucker Punch is nearly unique to Bonsly among Rock-types, with Geodude being the only other viable user. Since Bonsly cannot outspeed many Choice Scarf users even after a Rock Polish, most notably Choice Scarf Gastly, Sucker Punch can help to take out these threats. With the Speed boost from Rock Polish, Bonsly can usually get an Explosion off. Explosion will OHKO most Pokemon that do not resist it, although Bonsly must be aware of switches to Ghost-types. Double-Edge is an alternative as it hits harder than Rock Slide, but it lacks the sheer power of Explosion.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs give Bonsly as much Attack and Speed as possible. A Jolly nature is required to hit 11 Speed, which means that Bonsly will outspeed all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup after a Rock Polish. Life Orb gives Bonsly some much-needed power, but Oran Berry can make setting up a Rock Polish much easier.</p>

<p>Since this set is walled by Steel-types, Magnemite is an amazing teammate, as it traps Steel-types with Magnet Pull and obliterates them with Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fire. Like all sweepers, Bonsly appreciates entry hazards. Chimchar not only sets up Stealth Rock, but also roasts Steel-types with its STAB Fire-type attacks. Wynaut creates opportunities for Bonsly to set up with Encore and also removes faster Choice Scarf users, such as Mankey. Lastly, Chinchou packs STAB Thunderbolt to remove Water-types such as Staryu which would otherwise threaten Bonsly.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Aside from the listed moves, Bonsly has few other usable options. While Bonsly can set up Stealth Rock, there are much better users of the move. Dig can hit Steel-types, but the charge turn makes switching to a Flying-type or a Pokemon with Levitate easy. Low Kick too gains super effective coverage on Steel-types, but as most Pokemon in Little Cup are light, it has little utility. Bonsly gets Flail, which can be used with Rock Polish and Focus Sash for a powerful set. However, it is susceptible to priority and faster Choice Scarf users.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The easiest way to deal with Bonsly is to simply not let it set up. Most super effective moves, especially from the special side, will easily OHKO Bonsly. If it does get a Rock Polish boost, it can be easily revenge killed by a faster Choice Scarf user, such as Mankey or Chinchou. Priority users, such as Croagunk, can also take out Bonsly regardless of its Speed. Ghost-types, while fearing Sucker Punch, can switch into Explosion to prevent your team from taking damage from the move. Many bulkier Pokemon, such as Gligar, can tank Bonsly's hits even without packing a resistance. Finally, Steel-types completely wall Bonsly outside of a stray Low Kick or Dig.</p>
