[Overview]

<p>Chikorita possesses decent bulk thanks to its base 65 Defense and Special Defense, making it a good candidate for various roles on a team. Although it might be lacking in the offensive department, being one of the few pure Grass-types in Little Cup has its merits. Despite this, it is almost entirely outclassed by other Grass-types such as Bulbasaur.  Chikorita does, however, have the ability to set up dual screens and it has access to Aromatherapy, making it worth using.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a shallow offensive movepool to choose from, supporting the team is sadly the only role Chikorita plays well. This set utilizes its bulk and helps the rest of the team by setting up dual screens. Both Reflect and Light Screen are very useful tools in Little Cup, and with them set up, fellow team members will find sweeping much easier. The idea is to bring Chikorita into bulky Water- or Ground-types, such as Chinchou or Sandshrew, and set up. Alternatively, it can hit back with Leaf Storm, packing 140 Base Power, which is sure to make a huge dent or even KO frail Pokemon that don't resist it. Worry Seed definitely deserves to be on this set, helping Chikorita escape from Pokemon such as Diglett and Wynaut by changing their ability to Insomnia. Oran Berry is a real asset to Chikorita since it increases its longevity substantially, although Light Clay is an alternative that can give your team those vital extra turns of dual screens.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Chikorita does not need to invest at all in its offensive stats, mainly because it lacks good coverage and should stick to its role as a team supporter. Synthesis can be used instead of Worry Seed if you feel the need to preserve Chikorita for longer periods of time, although very rarely does Chikorita get a safe switch in. When it does, setting up screens should be its primary goal. Toxic can put pressure on the opponent's team, limiting the amount of time they can stay on the battlefield, although it is worth noting that Chikorita's most common switch-ins, Bronzor and Croagunk, are both immune to Toxic.</p>

<p>Pokemon that can take Fire- and Poison-type attacks aimed at Chikorita are of great use as teammates. An example of this is Houndour, which can absorb incoming Fire-type attacks for a Flash Fire boost and proceed to sweep, while Chikorita can easily switch into bulky Water-type Pokemon that threaten Houndour. Gligar can take a Poison Jab aimed at Chikorita from Croagunk and KO back with Earthquake. Choice Scarf sweepers such as Machop and Mankey make full use of the screens set up by Chikorita and can survive for longer, enabling them to fire off more attacks.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Leech Seed is an alternative way to gain recovery; it can be very rewarding when Pokemon with massive HP stats are seeded, such as Munchlax and Chinchou. Hidden Power Ground can be used to severely dent the likes of Houndour and Croagunk, two of the most common switch-ins, but it will not OHKO either. Aromatherapy is a viable option to pack on a bulky Pokemon like Chikorita, enabling it to heal itself and its teammates.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Since Chikorita is a supporter and is by no means a threat to any team directly, Poison-type Pokemon annihilate it, resisting Chikorita's STAB Leaf Storm and being immune to Toxic. There is nothing Chikorita can do apart from switch out, giving them a free turn to set up. Gligar can survive a Leaf Storm and Taunt Chikorita, rendering it useless, although it cannot Roost-stall, since upon Roosting it becomes weak to Grass-type attacks. Bronzor has nothing to fear and hence can switch in with comfort, and then set up entry hazards or dual screens of its own. Fire-types such as Growlithe and Houndour nail a solid KO on Chikorita with Flare Blitz and Fire Blast, respectively, and resist its primary STAB move, although avoiding Hidden Power Ground variants is advised. Pokemon such as Wynaut can wall Chikorita provided it is not carrying Worry Seed. In general, Pokemon with Taunt and sweepers that resist Chikorita's Leaf Storm make viable counters, as stopping Chikorita from setting up dual screens or using Worry Seed leaves it useless.</p>
