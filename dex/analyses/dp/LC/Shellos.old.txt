[Overview]

<p>Believe it or not, Shellos is a lot better than it appears to be. It's got a decent Special Attack stat, bulk, and only two weaknesses. It doesn't have much of a movepool, but it has enough for it to pull through. One of its most obvious flaws is that it is outclassed by almost all other Water-types, and it doesn't get access to Hydro Pump. Its resistance to Water-type attacks shouldn't be underlooked either. Overall, this cute little slug can come in handy as a revenge killer due to its nice coverage and few weaknesses.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the best (and only) set that Shellos can run. It has average Special Attack and reaches 21 Speed with Choice Scarf. Its STAB Surf hits other Pokemon fairly hard, while the other attacks are for coverage. Ice Beam hits Flying- and Grass-types hard. Earth Power provides coverage against Electric-types such as Chinchou. Hidden Power Grass nails Water-type Pokemon, particularly Water / Ground-types such as Barboach. Hidden Power Electric can be used to hit Mantyke, but Hidden Power Grass is the recommended option. The given EVs are really just to increase Shellos's Speed and Special Attack stats as much as possible.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set needs Stealth Rock support so that less Pokemon will be inclined to switch into Shellos. Good partners for Shellos include those that can remove Munchlax, its number 1 counter. Fighting-types such as Mankey and Machop can carry out this task with relative ease. If Shellos isn't running Hidden Power Grass, it will lose to Water / Ground-type Pokemon badly. Both Snover and Shroomish can take care of all of the aforementioned Water / Ground-type Pokemon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Shellos gets Curse, but not Waterfall or Aqua Tail, or even a decent physical STAB. It can make use of Icy Wind if lowering the opponent's Speed is of priority. Amnesia is there, but not recommended as it does get Recover , which is better to tank hits with, which it might use if the correct amount of EVs are put in. Rain Dance is another option. To counter Mantyke, Ancient Power could be used because of its seconday effect, but Hidden Power Electric gets the job done better.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Munchlax is arguably the best counter to Shellos. It can hit Shellos with a STAB Return and sponge all of its attacks. Mantyke can come in on anything but a Hidden Power Electric, which hits for hard damage especially if Stealth Rock is up. Grass-types easily beat up Shellos if it is not locked into Ice Beam. Snover deserves special mention here for its neutrality to it, although it must watch out for the rare but possible Hidden Power Fire.</p>
