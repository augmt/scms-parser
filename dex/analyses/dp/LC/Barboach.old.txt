[Overview]

<p>Barboach can be a very dangerous Pokemon in Little Cup with access to Dragon Dance, excellent STABs, very good defensive typing, and decent defensive stats. While its attacking stats are rather low compared to other sweepers in Little Cup, it can still sweep effectively with a very nice attacking movepool, over 21 Speed with Choice Scarf, and Dragon Dance.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Despite Barboach's low Attack stat, it has a way of boosting it, along with its Speed, in what is arguably the best set-up move in the game: Dragon Dance. After a single Dragon Dance, Barboach's Attack is increased to a respectable 21, and its Speed is boosted to 22 with an Adamant nature or 24 with a Jolly nature, outpacing all unboosted Pokemon in Little Cup. Barboach has two great STAB moves in Earthquake and Waterfall, hitting most Pokemon in Little Cup for at least neutral damage, bar Grass-types and Mantyke. Return provides neutral coverage on all the Pokemon whom Waterfall and Earthquake can't hit. Oran Berry is the preferred item for this set, giving Barboach the bulk that it needs to set up consistently, without sacrificing too much HP in the process. However, Life Orb is also a viable option for the added power, particularly late-game with Wynaut support. When choosing between Adamant and Jolly nature, you must consider whether you prefer added power or higher survivability. While Adamant gives you one extra point in Attack, Jolly allows you to outspeed more Choice Scarf users after one Dragon Dance, such as Bagon and Krabby, and lets you outspeed or tie Choice Scarf Cranidos and Wailmer, depending on their natures.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Barboach is definitely not the best Pokemon in the world to be switching into strong attacks due to its lack of resistances and merely decent defenses. Therefore, it is a good idea to avoid switching Barboach into strong attackers whenever possible. That being said, if Barboach is able to get into battle while taking little to no damage, such as after a KO or on an Electric- or Rock-typed attack, it can be very difficult to stop after setting up. This is largely because it has just one weakness, to the very uncommon Grass-type attacks. Barboach also has better defenses than many sweepers, such as Gastly and Houndour, and has comparable defenses to its fellow Dragon Dance sweeper, Dratini.</p>

<p>Barboach greatly appreciates dual screens, which aid in its setup and allow it to sweep more easily. Because of this, Abra and Bronzor both make good partners to Barboach, as they can set up screens. Barboach also likes having Wynaut support, because if it can Encore the right move, such as an Electric-type attack or a non-attacking move, Barboach can get a free Dragon Dance.</p>

[SET]
name: Physical Choice
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Waterfall
move 3: Return / Double-Edge
move 4: Spark
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Anticipation
nature: Adamant
evs: 36 HP / 212 Atk / 12 Def / 28 SpD / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set's main selling point is that Barboach has excellent dual STAB moves, shared only by Wooper in Little Cup. Barboach's two main physical STAB attacks, Earthquake and Waterfall, provide near-flawless coverage in Little Cup and are good options on a Choice set. Return provides coverage on the Pokemon Earthquake and Waterfall miss out on, such as Mantyke and Snover. Double-Edge is an interesting option on this set, especially very late in the game, when it can nab some hard-to-get KOs. Keep in mind that if you opt to use Double-Edge, however, that Barboach must have the ability Oblivious. Spark hits most Water-types super effectively and has high chance of paralysis.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set requires a lot of prediction to use it effectively, as there are many common Pokemon in Little Cup that have immunity to Barboach's attacks. Levitators, such as Bronzor and Duskull, and Flying-types, such as Gligar and Mantyke, are all immune to Earthquake. Mantyke also has an added bonus of gaining 25% of its health from Waterfall due to Water Absorb, which means it is fully resistant to both of Barboach's STAB moves. Croagunk also sports an immunity to Waterfall, but is OHKOed by Earthquake. Ghosts, such as Gastly and Duskull, are immune to Return and Double-Edge. All of these immunities makes Barboach tricky to play with.<p>

<p>Bronzor is one Pokemon that makes a good partner to this set as they cover each other's weaknesses. Bronzor can run an effective special set, which can provide good coverage with Barboach, who hits physically. Snover is another solid partner to this set, because it resists Grass, which is Barboach's only weakness. Barboach covers Snover's Fire-type, Poison-type, and Rock-type weaknesses as well.</p>

[SET]
name: Special Choice
move 1: Earth Power
move 2: Hydro Pump
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Hidden Power Fire / Hidden Power Electric / Hidden Power Rock

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set takes advantage of Barboach's good Speed, decent Special Attack, and unique special STAB moves. While this set seems inferior to other Scarf Water-types, such as Staryu and Chinchou, the one advantage that Barboach has over them is its access to STAB Earth Power. Earth Power gives good coverage on Pokemon whom Water-types often miss out on, such as Croagunk and Chinchou, while providing a more reliable option against other Electric-types. Hydro Pump is another obligatory STAB move, and with 120 Base Power, it is very powerful. Ice Beam provides coverage for the Pokemon on whom Earth Power and Hydro Pump can't hit, such as Mantyke. Ice Beam also hits Gligar, one of the most commonly used Pokemon in Little Cup, for 4x damage. While Hydro Pump, Earth Power, and Ice Beam provide neutral coverage on every Pokemon in Little Cup, bar Surskit, Hidden Power Fire can come in handy against Snover who can otherwise counter Barboach. Hidden Power Electric is also a good option because it can hit the otherwise troublesome Mantyke for 4x damage, while Hidden Power Rock can hit both Snover and Mantyke super effectively, albeit for less damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>One obvious thing about Barboach is its lack of power compared to other common Scarf Water-types. Because of this, Barboach is best used in a late-game scenario, as it does not have the power to bring down many Pokemon who are at full health.</p>

<p>Because of Barboach's lack of power, Pokemon that can effectively weaken the enemy team partner well with it. Cranidos and Swords Dance Gligar tend to work well with their offensive prowess. Bronzor and Barboach also work well together, as they cover each other's weaknesses. Additionally, Bronzor can hit hard on the physical side while Barboach hits specially, forming a potent offensive duo.</p>

<p>You will need to adjust EVs on this set according to which Hidden Power you use. The EVs given are optimal for Hidden Power Fire and also work for Hidden Power Electric. However, if you choose to use Hidden Power Rock, you will want to take off 4 Speed EVs and 4 EVs to both Defense and Special Defense.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>On the Physical Choice set, running a Jolly nature instead of an Adamant one is an option; however, in most cases Barboach prefers the boost in power to the boost in Speed. The same principle applies for the Special Choice set, which can run a Timid nature as opposed to a Modest one. On the Special Choice set, there are a variety of other Hidden Power types to use, such as Electric, which hits Mantyke harder than Ice Beam; Fire, which hits Snover 4x super effectively; and Rock, which hits both Mantyke and Snover super effectively at the cost less damage on one. For Barboach to be an effective Choice sweeper early-game, Choice Band and Choice Specs can be used on the Physical and Special Choice sets respectively as they provide much more power than Choice Scarf; however, in the Speed-centralized metagame that is Little Cup, Choice Scarf is nearly always the better option.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>There are few Pokemon that can counter all of Barboach's sets effectively. One that does a very good job would be Mantyke, as it is immune to Barboach's dual STABs and can hit it back hard with a STAB Hydro Pump. Other good counters are Choice Scarf users that are faster than a Barboach at +1 Speed, such as Mankey (who can OHKO Barboach with Close Combat), Gligar, and Gastly.<p>
