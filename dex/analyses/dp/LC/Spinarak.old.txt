[Overview]

<p>Around 70% of people are arachnophobic, and when you look at cute little Spinarak, it's hard to understand why. Although Spinarak has a sizable movepool, it lacks many useful moves and its average stats usually make it fall behind its competition. However, Spinarak has some interesting quirks that can give it the edge over some of the other Pokemon in Little Cup.</p>

<p>Spinarak is the only Pokemon in Little Cup that can Baton Pass a trapping move, something which can set up a match winning sweep. It is also one of the very few Pokemon with access to Toxic Spikes. Add in access to one of the better abilities in the game, Insomnia, and you have yourself a scary little creepy crawly ready to fight.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Spinarak holds the title as the only Pokemon in Little Cup that can trap pass, and this set is designed to make the most of it. Spider Web traps the opponent and allows Spinarak to Baton Pass to a counter who can set up on the victim, possibly resulting in a match winning sweep. This set can sometimes be hard to pull off, but is really quite rewarding when it works.</p>

<p>In the other moveslots, moves aimed to help Spinarak get the trap pass off are used; Bug Bite is the preferred option in the third slot as it can help Spinarak steal the opponent's Berry, either an Oran Berry to restore health, or if you're lucky, a pinch Berry to give Spinarak an extra boost to pass on. Protect should be used over Bug Bite if you use this set as a lead, as it will keep your Focus Sash intact. The last slot is designed to make Spinarak's job easier; Agility is preferred as it lets you get enough Speed to outspeed your opponent, and gives you something useful to pass if you're threatened by the switch-in. Substitute gives Spinarak protection from status and something useful to pass, but nine times out of ten Agility will work better.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EV spread optimizes Spinarak's chance of getting its Baton Pass off successfully. The extra Speed point puts Spinarak at 10 Speed, which is enough to outspeed almost every unboosted Pokemon after an Agility, and allows you to safely pass it. Spinarak has its defenses weighted towards the physical side because there is only one special priority move, Vacuum Wave, which Spinarak 4x resists. This spread also helps Spinarak set up on the ever present Fighting-types in Little Cup. With an Oran Berry attached, Spinarak is never 2HKOed by any move used by Fighting-types in Little Cup, bar two Machop Rock Slides with high damage rolls. Focus Sash should be used if you plan on leading with Spinarak.</p>

<p>Spinarak doesn't get many other options; Endure may be used with a pinch Berry and Agility to Baton Pass +2 Speed and +1 in an attack stat simultaneously. If you choose to do so, Endure should be used in third slot. Be warned, however, that doing so will result in Spinarak being vulnerable to Taunt.</p>

<p>This set has difficulties with any Pokemon that can KO Spinarak before it can pass its boost. Of these, Fire-types are generally the best bet as they can hit Spinarak super effectively as well as having a resistance to Spinarak's Bug Bite. Choice Scarf users are also a problem as they will outspeed Spinarak even after an Agility and can stop Spinarak from doing its job with Trick. For these reasons, Staryu makes a great partner to Spinarak; it can come in on both Fire-types and Trick without much worry and can even use Rapid Spin to get rid of the opponent's Stealth Rock. The prime candidate for a recipient is Gligar; Gligar resists the Fighting-type moves Spinarak will be setting up on, is neutral to Rock-type attacks, and can set up on trapped Pokemon with Swords Dance or even continue a Baton Pass chain.</p>

[SET]
name: Toxic Spikes Lead
move 1: Toxic Spikes
move 2: Protect
move 3: Bug Bite
move 4: Sucker Punch / Shadow Sneak

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>There aren't many Pokemon in Little Cup that have access to Toxic Spikes, which gives Spinarak a niche. Almost every Toxic Spikes user is outclassed by Tentacool, which has significantly higher bulk and added access to Rapid Spin; however, Spinarak finds itself with some interesting options and quirks that set it apart from the jellyfish.</p>

<p>The moves and EV spread given ensure that Spinarak will win as many lead matchups as possible. Toxic Spikes are a given, as otherwise there is little reason to use Spinarak. You will always get at least one layer down, as you can't be put to sleep, while Protect plus Focus Sash means you will never be OHKOed by anything short of a multi-hit move. The only common lead that threatens Spinarak is Shellder, due to its access to Rock Blast. Bug Bite shortens the lifespan of bulky leads, such as Phanpy and Hippopotas, by stealing their Oran Berries, and with the set's bulk, you should be able to get a layer of Toxic Spikes down too, unless they are carrying a Rock-type move. The last move can be used to take out Gastly who is always OHKOed (or 2HKOed by Shadow Sneak) and can't put you to sleep. Shadow Sneak should be used if you are worried about Substitute and want a more reliable move.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs are designed to make Spinarak's job easier; there is enough bulk so that Spinarak will never be 2HKOed by Lead Machop's Ice Punch, as well as enough Attack to sometimes OHKO lead Snover with Bug Bite, while always getting the knockout on Gastly. You will still be slower than Machop to avoid the stronger Payback, while still outspeeding Bronzor so you can put a layer of Toxic Spikes down before stealing its Berry.</p>

<p>Spinarak's options are too sparse to try and do anything else with the set. It does get novelties in Bounce and Dig to increase Toxic stalling damage, but as a lead it won't be surviving long after its done its job. Its subpar defenses result in other options, such as Agility, from really helping more than the moves already on the set. Poison Jab can be used in the last slot to ensure a definite KO on Snover and attempt to spread more poison, but you will find yourself wanting the priority move more often than not.</p>

<p>This set has a specific job of setting down a layer or two of Toxic Spikes. Not much can stop this, but some leads do give it trouble. The most notable of these is a Scarfed Shellder who can KO Spinarak through Focus Sash with its ability Skill Link. In addition, it won't be overly successful against Pokemon that will be setting up strong Substitutes. Bronzor and Phanpy get special mentions as great teammates for Spinarak as they can set up alternate hazards in the form of Stealth Rock, while taking little damage from Shellder and other common leads such as Gligar and Aipom.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Spinarak has a quite good movepool, but it lacks the stats to use most of its other moves effectively. It could work on a Trick Room team with its priority moves and a moveset consisting of Bug Bite, Poison Jab, and Double-Edge. In most cases, however, Spinarak's mediocre Attack will let it down. Spinarak also gets some interesting options such as Body Slam, Poison Jab, Thief, and Swagger, but for the most part you will not get the chance to use them and there are more reliable Pokemon that can perform similar tasks with actual status moves.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Anything that can stop Spinarak from setting up make good counters; first off, Taunters shut down almost any set that Spinarak will be running. Almost any user of the move will work thanks to Spinarak's low Speed. Grounded Poison-types will ruin the Toxic Spikes set's efforts, as can Rapid Spinners. Staryu gets a special mention, as Natural Cure will remove its poison status after spinning the Toxic Spikes away. The previously mentioned Shellder will be able to force out any Spinarak set that leads. As for the Baton Pass set, you should concentrate more on beating Spinarak's target than stopping Spinarak itself. As it will most often be passing a Speed boost, your best bet is to use priority users or a Pokemon with Thunder Wave. Phanpy can take most unboosted physical attacks, while Ice Shard will hit recipients like Gligar for super effective damage. Croagunk is known for its amazing amount of priority options, even Seel does well as it can hit most of Spinarak's likely Baton Pass targets for super effective damage.</p>
