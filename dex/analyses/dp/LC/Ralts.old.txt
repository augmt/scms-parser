[OVERVIEW]

<p>Ralts is one of the worst Pokemon in Little Cup. However, it can set up Trick Room somewhat effectively, and it has access to useful moves in Destiny Bond and Encore. Trace is also a great ability, allowing it to set up on Pokemon like Choice Scarf Chinchou locked into Thunderbolt. Ralts's terrible stats, however, prevent it from doing much of anything else though.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the only role that Ralts can do somewhat well. It is also a unique set for Ralts, as no other Pokemon has the ability to learn the combination of Trick Room, Destiny Bond, and Encore.</p>

<p>Trick Room takes advantage of Ralts's low Speed. If you lead with this set, or if you are able to keep entry hazards off of the field, then Ralts is guaranteed to set up Trick Room thanks to its Focus Sash. From there, Ralts can use Memento, Destiny Bond, or Encore to great effect, as it outspeeds almost every Pokemon in Little Cup under Trick Room. Memento will allow you to set up a very powerful Trick Room sweeper. If the opponent attacks, Ralts can use Destiny Bond to take the opponent down with it, thus scoring a free switch in for your Trick Room sweeper. Encore is there to make your opponent avoid using a non-attacking move, as doing so will also give you a free switch in for your Trick Room sweeper of choice.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Ralts really has nothing else going for it, so this is all it has. Reflect and Light Screen could be used to support your team, but good luck finding time to use them. The IVs, EVs, and nature are all geared toward using Trick Room to its fullest extent.</p>

<p>Ralts cannot function effectively without its Focus Sash. Therefore, if you are not using Ralts as a lead, it is necessary to use a Rapid Spinner or Taunter to prevent your opponent from setting up entry hazards on the field. Trick Room sweepers are obviously necessary to take advantage of the Trick Room that Ralts sets up, as it cannot do damage effectively by itself. Some examples of these sweepers are Cubone, Munchlax, and Clamperl. Other Trick Room set-up Pokemon, such as Bronzor, are recommended to help set up Trick Room again after the initial Trick Room wears off.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Ralts has a very shallow movepool, so it cannot do very much. Hypnosis could be used to cripple one Pokemon, but its shabby accuracy makes it an unpopular choice. Shadow Sneak has potential to break Focus Sashes, although it is very weak otherwise. Wish could be used to support the team, but Ralts will have trouble finding time to use it. Ralts has Calm Mind, but its terrible Special Attack and Speed makes the move almost worthless. Finally, Ralts can use Will-O-Wisp, which could be used for a double status set in conjunction with Hypnosis.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Taunt users will force Ralts to Struggle or switch out, so Taunting Ralts is an effective strategy to neuter it. Entry hazards will break Ralts's Focus Sash and allow it to be OHKOed by almost any attack in Little Cup. Priority users can kill Ralts before it can use Memento or Destiny Bond. Finally, Pokemon that can deal with Trick Room sweepers counter not only Ralts but an entire Trick Room team in general. These include opposing Munchlax, defensive Gligar (for physical sweepers), and Wynaut.</p>
