[Overview]

<p>While Aron was non-existent in its initial appearance in LC, the latest addition to its movepool, Head Smash, suddenly made it rise in usage. Rock is a fantastic attacking type in LC, where Ground-type Pokemon are barely used. This allows Aron to utilize an exclusive, no-recoil 225 Base Power move. First and foremost, this gives Aron a deadly weapon to hurt unprepared teams in LC. Aron's base 100 Defense and Steel typing are an added bonus as they cushion certain priority hits. All in all, with the right support, Aron poses an immediate threat to many LC teams.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is Aron's trademark set because it uses Rock Polish to patch up its middling Speed. With good Attack and a 225 Base Power Head Smash, Aron becomes an offensive force and is incredibly hard to revenge kill. Furthermore, Rock Head ensures that Aron will not be taking any recoil damage from Head Smash, making Aron even harder to beat. Earthquake and Iron Head broaden its type coverage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Rock Polish boosts Aron's Speed to 24 or 26, depending on the nature of choice. At certain times, Rock Polish might be a bit difficult to pull off because of Aron's terrible typing and low Speed. Its best bet is to come in on Pokemon such as Meowth or Snover, and proceed to use Rock Polish as they switch out. It can switch in on Munchlax as well to grab a Rock Polish, but Aron has to watch out for Earthquake. Aron can space in three attacks, which provide it with excellent coverage, only resisted by Bronzor. Head Smash is Aron's main form of attack and can 2HKO everyone in LC. Earthquake complements Head Smash by hitting Steel-types like opposing Aron and Shieldon, who will attempt to wall Head Smash. Iron Head is a safe STAB move to use if Head Smash's accuracy is making you nervous, but the power Head Smash holds is death-inducing. It also hits defensive Rock-types such as Onix and Rhyhorn, who resist Head Smash. </p>

<p>There are other options Aron can run in the item slot besides Life Orb. Chople Berry is an interesting option to survive Vacuum Wave from Croagunk. Oran Berry helps by giving Aron more survivability. However, take note that without Life Orb, Aron will lose certain 2HKOs and OHKOs on Pokemon like Phanpy and Gligar.</p>

<p>The EVs are designed to yield at least one point from each department, except for Special Attack. Maximum Attack and Speed is needed to help Aron pull off a successful sweep. An Adamant nature will allow Aron to hit 24 Speed after one Rock Polish, but it leaves Aron open to an easy revenge-kill from Choice Scarf Jolly Mankey. Jolly is always another option to outpace and hit Mankey without switching out.</p>

<p>Aron can sweep more efficiently with Stealth Rock down, as the floating rocks help increase the chances of OHKOing Pokemon like Gligar. Another way to help it sweep efficiently is pairing it with Wynaut. Since Aron lures in Mankey's Close Combat, Wynaut can switch-in to OHKO it with Counter, allowing Aron to use Adamant nature instead of Jolly. Wynaut also acts as a check to Croagunk if Aron isn't running Chople Berry. Gligar works in the similar fashion as Wynaut (in terms of checking Mankey and Croagunk). In addition to that, Gligar has access to Stealth Rock and a Ground-type immunity to safely come in on hits directed at Aron. Finally, paralysis support is always welcome to allow Aron to threaten faster Pokemon, which could lead to an easier Rock Polish sweep.</p>

<p>Offensively, Elekid works well with Aron, despite sharing similar weakness to Ground-type attacks. With Aron severely denting everything, it leaves Elekid to clean up the job late-game. Gastly works exceptionally well with Aron as a way to lure in Ground- and Fighting-type hits, allowing Gastly to get a free turn to use Substitute.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Band
move 1: Head Smash
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Iron Head
move 4: Superpower
ability: Rock Head
item: Choice Band
nature: Adamant
evs: 36 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpD / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>The purpose of this set is to deal immediate damage with a Choice Band equipped. Aron makes a good Choice Band user despite its low Speed, because it has good Attack and a no-recoil Head Smash to threaten a large portion of the LC metagame. Nothing in LC will enjoy switching in on a boosted Head Smash coming off 24 Attack. Earthquake rounds off the coverage, providing a way to hit Steel-types like opposing Aron and Shieldon. The final two moves are Iron Head and Superpower. Iron Head is a nice STAB move to hit defensive Rock-types like Onix and Rhydon for super effective damage, while Superpower is used to hit Bronzor, because it otherwise walls Aron's other attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Aron requires extensive support to function as an effective Choice Band user. Firstly, paralysis support is needed for Aron to outspeed faster threats. Aron has a difficult time scaring anything with such low Speed and poor typing; therefore, packing a Pokemon like Paras (who provides paralysis support) could help. Secondly, Stealth Rock is needed to increase the chances of OHKOing certain walls. Lastly, dual screen support is always welcome to take unboosted physical hits from the opponent, allowing Aron to smash them with a selected move after surviving their assault.</p>

<p>When using Choice Band Aron, make sure to pack something to take on faster set-up sweepers. Aron's Speed is quite low, and popular setup sweepers like Gligar need to be checked. Choice Scarf Machop can check Gligar. Snover can check Gligar as well if the need arises. Having one's own Gligar and Wynaut alongside Aron is a nice way of checking Scarf Mankey and Croagunk. Gligar in particular can provide a helpful support package for Aron by setting up Stealth Rock, coming in on Ground-type hits, and Scarf Mankey and Croagunk.</p>

<p>Hippopotas and Phanpy are good checks to this set, as they can survive a boosted Head Smash and OHKO Aron in return with Earthquake.Mantyke is a nice way to check these threats, as it can come in on Earthquake,threaten the aforementioned, and use Agility as they switch out.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Aron can run a support set using the moveset Stealth Rock / Head Smash / Earthquake / Iron Head with heavy EV investment in Defense. However, Shieldon completely outclasses Aron in terms of walling threats, because it has the bulk to take both physical and special hits. The 28 point difference in Attack is the only difference between Aron and Shieldon. If you're looking to support and dish out good damage, Aron can fill in that job over Shieldon. Aron can run an alternate EV spread of 196 Atk / 116 Def / 196 Spe to take super effective priority hits from Pokemon like Totodile or Squirtle better.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Due to Aron's poor typing, anything that sports Fighting- and Ground-type attacks can be considered as counters. Mankey is good check to Aron because it can outpace Aron with a Choice Scarf slapped on them. Croagunk is a good check to the Rock Polish set because it can OHKO it with Vacuum Wave.</p>

<p>From a defensive standpoint, Phanpy and Hippopotas who invest EVs heavily in Defense can check the dreaded Choice Band set. Hippopotas and Phanpy can survive a boosted Head Smash and OHKO back with Earthquake.</p>
