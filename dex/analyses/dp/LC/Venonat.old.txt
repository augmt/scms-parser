[Overview]

<p>Venonat is not intended to be the star of the show or the centerpiece of a team. However, he is, with proper support, a very valuable niche Pokemon who can help a team immensely by providing paralysis, sleep support, or Speed boosts for his teammates. Venonat does have some useful resistances, most notably quadruple resistances to Fighting- and Grass-type attacksIf you manage to get Venonat in safely, the threat of Sleep Powder gives you the opportunity to swing the momentum back in your team's favor. Venonat may not have stellar stats, but he must be played around carefully since he can easily cripple multiple Pokemon with status.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Baton Pass
move 3: Agility
move 4: Sludge Bomb / Psychic / Protect
item: Focus Sash / Oran Berry
ability: Compound Eyes
nature: Timid
evs: 196 HP / 36 Def / 36 SpA / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Venonat's main role on a team is to pass Speed boosts to a slower sweeper. Compound Eyes is a great asset for Venonat, giving his Sleep Powder an almost perfect accuracy of 97.5%. Putting an opponent to sleep allows him to get an Agility in for free and sometimes even get the recipient of the Speed boost in without harm. The final slot provides Venonat with a reliable attack in case he is hit by Taunt.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With the given EVs, Venonat hits 30 Speed after an Agility, which is enough to outrun almost all of the metagame, at worst tying with max Speed Choice Scarf Voltorb. This enables Venonat to put any Pokemon who comes in to sleep without taking a hit, bar a priority move.</p>

<p>The fourth move has many different options to choose from. Sludge Bomb gets STAB and allows Venonat to hit opposing targets relatively hard. Psychic hits the most popular sleep-immune Pokemon, Mankey, for super effective damage, as well as hitting opposing Poison-type Pokemon hard. Protect can be used if Venonat is leading so that Aipom and Meowth don't break his Focus Sash, but it will leave him completely vulnerable to Taunt leads such as Gligar and Voltorb.</p>

<p>Sweepers such as Cranidos, Cubone, Gligar, Machop, and Houndour and all work well after they receive a Speed boost from Venonat. Cranidos and Cubone are on the same boat; both of them are heavy hitters who unfortunately lack the Speed to threaten anything, so passing an Agility to them can really turn the tables. Machop and Gligar can both receive a boost and continue to stat up, or, alternatively, just take the boost and start sweeping with their good Attack stats. Lastly, Houndour is a good Pokemon to pair with Venonat because his Flash Fire ability allows him to freely switch into Fire-type attacks directed at Venonat while boosting his own Fire-type attacks.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Sludge Bomb
move 3: Psychic
move 4: Hidden Power Ice / Hidden Power Fire
item: Choice Scarf
ability: Tinted Lens
nature: Timid
evs: 36 HP / 36 Def / 196 SpA / 196 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Venonat is not exactly an offensive powerhouse, but a Choice Scarf set is a viable alternative since he possesses the ability to stop sweepers with a fast Sleep Powder. This set can be used as a lead to give you an advantage from the get-go or to take care of a sweeper later in the game with Sleep Powder or Sludge Bomb. If you're using Venonat as a lead, Compound Eyes is the preferred ability in order to neutralize the opponent's Pokemon 97.5% of the time.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Venonat's movepool isn't particularly broad, so the best special attacking options are used. Sludge Bomb is Venonat's main and strongest attack when factoring in STAB and Tinted Lens. Psychic hits Poison- and Fighting-types for super effective damage. The fourth move depends on what he needs to hit; Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Gligar, Taillow, and Diglett while Hidden Power Fire is Venonat's best bet against Bronzor, although Bronzor will shrug off Hidden Power Fire without too much trouble.</p>

<p>The ability comes down to personal preference. Compound Eyes ensures that Venonat's Sleep Powder will hit most of the time, making it the desirable choice on the lead slot. Tinted Lens will give Venonat more power, since resistances still take the same amount of damage as they would if they were neutral.</p>

<p>Having Stealth Rock is always a good idea, as Choice Scarf Venonat will cause a lot of switches. Stealth Rock helps by chipping away HP every time a Pokemon switches in. Also, having Pokemon who can stat up, especially behind a Substitute, is not a bad idea since the opponent's Pokemon will be asleep, allowing for a free switch to a sweeper. Magnemite or Machop good partners to use with Venonat, since they can beat most Pokemon who commonly switch into Venonat, such as Bronzor and Munchlax, respectively.</p>

[SET]
name: Double Powder
move 1: Sleep Powder
move 2: Stun Spore
move 3: Bug Bite
move 4: Baton Pass / Hidden Power Fire
item: Oran Berry / Focus Sash
ability: Compound Eyes
nature: Jolly / Naive
evs: 196 HP / 76 Atk / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Thanks to Compound Eyes, Venonat's Stun Spore's and Sleep Powder's accuracy skyrockets to 97.5%, making Venonat an ideal double powder user. Taking advantage of this, Venonat can attempt to cripple the opponent by using the successful double powder strategy: sleep one opponent and paralyze another when he switches in.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Bug Bite can help Venonat steal Berries, most notably Oran Berry, from assorted foes. (unbold this period) Venonat can use Baton Pass to scout whether the foe has an Insomnia user waiting in the wings, or to see what Pokemon the opponent is willing to sacrifice as a sleep absorber. Another option is Hidden Power Fire, which can hit both Bronzor and Croagunk relatively hard.</p>

<p>Slow Pokemon such as Cranidos, Cubone, Houndour, Machop, and Wailmer all work exceptionally well with this set. Venonat can put a counter to sleep and start spreading paralysis to the other Pokemon, allowing slow, heavy hitters to have an easier time in the match. If Venonat runs Baton Pass, it makes switching in your Pokemon a lot easier; you don't have to run the risk of a double switch, and if the opponent decides to stay in, (comma) you can generally tell what he is going to do.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Signal Beam can be used on attacking sets as a secondary STAB attack, but its Base Power is less than desired. An accurate Disable can stop Choice users in their tracks and force them to switch or Struggle; however, Venonat, bar Choice Scarf variants, is too slow to use it effectively. Toxic Spikes and Morning Sun could be used, but Venonat's poor defenses make the moves' usefulness questionable. Also, Venonat generally has better things to do than heal his HP. Zen Headbutt can replace Psychic if you decide to go down the physical route.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Shuppet and Mankey get in for free if Venonat uses Sleep Powder since they are immune to sleep. Aron, Bronzor, and Shieldon resist most of Venonat's attacking arsenal; however, they are slow and run the risk of being put to sleep. Munchlax also stops the sweeping version cold, and a RestTalk set shuts down every Venonat variant that there is. You can use a Pokemon with Roar to phaze Venonat away on the turn he Baton Passes, wasting his efforts. Focus Sash versions are picked off by priority users such as Bullet Punch Machop, Aqua Jet Squirtle and Kabuto, and Fake Out users. Venonat is rather slow and frail, so switching in a Fire- or Flying-type who is faster than him before he uses Agility will scare him away. Taunt shuts down most of Venonat's support sets.</p>
