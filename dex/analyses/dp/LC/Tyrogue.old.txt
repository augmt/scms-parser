[Overview]

<p>There's really not much to say about Tyrogue, except that it is likely the worst Fighting-type in the game. It has neither the Speed nor the power that other Fighting-types enjoy. Its defensive stats are poor, and its movepool is quite weak. Although it does have access to Guts and High Jump Kick, its low Attack prevents it from having any potential in Little Cup. Quite frankly, there are always much better options than Tyrogue.</p>

[SET]
name: Trick Room Physical Attacker
move 1: High Jump Kick
move 2: Facade
move 3: Rock Slide
move 4: Bullet Punch
item: Toxic Orb
ability: Guts

evs: 236 HP / 236 Atk
ivs: 0 Spe

[Set Comments]

<p>This is the best set that Tyrogue can run. With absolute minimum Speed investment and a hindering nature, Tyrogue hits 8 Speed, which allows it to outspeed many Pokemon under Trick Room, including Bronzor with 12 Speed EVs and a neutral nature. Although Tyrogue has low Attack, it is made usable with Guts and the powerful STAB High Jump Kick, which is a powerful STAB attack. Facade makes good use of Toxic Orb by hitting many Pokemon for neutral damage off of 140 Base Power. Rock Slide hits Flying-types that resist High Jump Kick, and finally, Bullet Punch gives Tyrogue priority, which is always good. Toxic Orb is preferred over Flame Orb because it costs Tyrogue less HP over two turns than Flame Orb, and Tyrogue generally won't be in longer than two turns anyways. The EVs maximize HP and Attack, giving Tyrogue as much power and bulk as possible.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>The best teammates for this set are Trick Room supporters. Bronzor, Duskull, and Slowpoke all have good defenses and can set up Trick Room with ease. Other good partners for Tyrogue are ones that can remove Gligar, a dangerous counter to Tyrogue, from the field. Bronzor once again receives a mention as it is immune to Earthquake, resists Stone Edge, and can easily OHKO Gligar with Hidden Power Ice. Bulky Waters like Mantyke also fare well against Gligar, and can easily OHKO it with their STAB attacks. Brick Break is a possible option over High Jump Kick, as it has higher accuracy, no potential recoil, and can break screens set up by the opponent. However, it is significantly less powerful than High Jump Kick.</p>

[SET]
name: Priority Attacker
move 1: Fake Out
move 2: Bullet Punch
move 3: High Jump Kick
move 4: Rock Slide / Facade
item: Toxic Orb
ability: Guts
nature: Adamant
evs: 236 Atk / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Since Tyrogue has both Fake Out and Guts, it can potentially pull off a decent sweep with this set. Fake Out should be used first in order to flinch the opposing Pokemon and safely activate Guts via Toxic Orb. Bullet Punch gives Tyrogue a nice priority attack with great neutral coverage, hitting many threats for solid damage. High Jump Kick is Tyrogue's strongest STAB attack. The last move comes down to preference. Rock Slide is the preferred attack as it will do the most damage to Ghost-types, who are immune to both Fake Out and High Jump Kick. However, Facade hits all other Pokemon who resist High Jump Kick harder than Rock Slide in most cases. The EVs and an Adamant nature give Tyrogue maximum Attack and Speed, allowing it to outspeed a few Pokemon while increasing its damage output.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The best teammates that can help Tyrogue sweep are Pokemon who can remove physical walls, especially bulky Ground-types such as Hippopotas and Gligar. Snover is the best teammate for this reason, as it can easily use Blizzard to dispose of the ones who don't switch out. Unfortunately, Snover's hail will cause Tyrogue to lose extra health per turn. Staryu can beat both Hippopotas and Gligar with a Water-type STAB move. Pursuit users, such as Munchlax and Stunky, are also good teammates, as a Pursuited Ghost-type means Tyrogue will no longer have to worry about losing health from an evaded High Jump Kick.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Outside of this set, there really aren't a lot of other options for poor ol' Tyrogue. It has access to Fake Out, which would guarantee a safe status orb activation, but is too slow, frail, and weak to utilize it effectively. It also gets Rapid Spin and Foresight, but doesn't have the bulk to use them effectively at all. Vacuum Wave is a decent substitute for Bullet Punch, as Tyrogue does have equal Special Attack. Bulk Up raises Tyrogue's Attack and Defense, and Mach Punch and Bullet Punch make up for Tyrogue's dismal Speed.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>It's rather difficult to not be a counter to Tyrogue, as long as it's not weak to Fighting-type attacks. Pokemon not taking super effective damage from High Jump Kick can usually switch in with ease, and can, at the worst, 2HKO Tyrogue with a neutral STAB attack. Physical walls take little damage from its attacks, and most Pokemon should be able to take a neutral hit or two. Bronzor, Hippopotas, Gligar, and many others stop it cold, and revenge killing Tyrogue is very easy, especially if Trick Room is not in play.</p>
