[Overview]

<p>Whismur, though forgotten often, actually has decent offensive stats and relatively high base HP. It also has a good movepool with plenty of options, but unfortunately suffers from a low Speed stat. Due to that low Speed, it can only thrive in one environment -- Trick Room. Thankfully, once Trick Room has been set up, Whismur becomes quite the wallbreaker.</p>

[SET]
name: Trick Room Mixed Attacker
move 1: Return
move 2: Thunder Punch
move 3: Ice Beam
move 4: Shadow Ball / Fire Blast
item: Life Orb
nature: Brave / Quiet
evs: 4 HP / 188 Atk / 92 Def / 188 SpA / 12 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the best and probably only set that Whismur can run efficiently. Return is its strongest STAB attack, capable of dealing large amounts of damage to anything that doesn't resist or isn't immune to it. Thunder Punch and Ice Beam give Whismur "BoltBeam" coverage, resisted only by Magnemite and Chinchou in Little Cup. This combo is also effective because Thunder Punch hits Water-types on their typically lower Defense stat while Ice Beam hits Ground-types on their weaker Special Defense stat; this allows Whismur to become a powerful Trick Room wallbreaker. The final slot is purely a matter of preference: Shadow Ball smacks Duskull and other Ghost-types for super effective damage, while Fire Blast allows Whismur to beat Bronzor and Magnemite -- two Pokemon that can otherwise wall this set. Life Orb is necessary so Whismur can deal as much damage as possible while still having the ability to change attacks at will. Whismur's nature can vary - a Brave nature will boost its physical moves further, while a Quiet nature will enhance Whismur's special moves. The EVs maximize Attack and Special Attack, and the remainder adds two points to Defense, one to Special Defense, and the other to HP. Since Whismur can't get down to 19 HP, the extra HP might come in handy.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The most obvious support for this Whismur will be from Trick Room. The best Trick Room supporters are Ghost-types -- Drifloon, Duskull, and even Gastly are good for this. Ghost-types are important because they have good defensive synergy with Whismur. Stealth Rock support is also nice, so less Pokemon will be inclined to switch around on Whismur, especially if they mispredict. Pineco resists Fighting-type attacks, can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes, and use Explosion to possibly remove a wall before it goes down. If Whismur isn't using Fire Blast, Bronzor walks all over this set. Magnemite will help a lot in that case, but it shares a common weakness to Fighting with Whismur. Since Munchlax also gives this set some trouble, Fighting-type partners are very useful. A bulky Machop is great, since it can also take advantage of Trick Room with its low Speed.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Whismur doesn't have a lot of other moves, but it does have some stuff worth mentioning. It can run a pure special set consisting of Hyper Voice, Ice Beam, Flamethrower, and Hidden Power Electric, but then it would lose too quickly to Munchlax. Flamethrower may be used in lieu of Fire Blast for its better accuracy, but Whismur needs all the power it can get. Whismur has access to Rest, Sleep Talk, and a boosting move in Howl, but its weakness to Fighting and low defenses prevent those moves from being viable. It can also run Hidden Power Ground to take out Magnemite, Stunky, Houndour, and others.

[Checks and Counters]

<p>If Trick Room is not up, Fighting-types walk all over Whismur. If Whismur lacks Shadow Ball, Gastly beats it regardless if Trick Room is in play. If Whismur doesn't have Fire Blast, Steels laugh at its attacks. Magnemite would resist its entire moveset and can do a lot of damage in return with Thunderbolt. Duskull can take a Shadow Ball and burn Whismur before having to switch out. The best thing to do is to catch Whismur outside of Trick Room and hit it with powerful attacks since it won't be taking numerous hits any time soon.</p>
