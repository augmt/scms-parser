[Overview]

<p>Voltorb is very similar to its older brother Electrode. It has a decent Special Attack stat and blinding Speed. Voltorb is one of the three Pokemon in the tier that can reach 20 Speed, meaning it outspeeds all Pokemon that aren't holding a Choice Scarf. Combine that fact with a wide movepool and Voltorb can deal quite a lot of damage. Unfortunately, Voltorb is rather frail, and will lose a lot of health to relatively weak attacks. Overall, Voltorb is a Pokemon that can almost always accomplish its task, whether it is setting up weather or sweeping.</p>

<p>With its combination of high Speed, good coverage, and useful utility moves, Voltorb can succeed at disrupting and destroying popular leads. Defensively weak leads get hit by a STAB Thunderbolt from Voltorb's decent Special Attack stat. Hidden Power Ice is used for near perfect coverage alongside Thunderbolt, and gives Voltorb a chance against Gligar and Diglett leads (though in order to beat Diglett, Sucker Punch must be used), although Phanpy will barely be scratched by it. Taunt stops weather and Stealth Rock leads from fulfilling their objectives, but watch out as many Stealth Rock leads carry Earthquake. Protect and Sucker Punch beat the common Fake Out leads, such as Meowth and Chimchar, by avoiding their Fake Out or breaking their Focus Sash, respectively. Finally, when Voltorb's usefulness comes to an end, Explosion is devastatingly powerful even from only 10 Attack, often knocking a Pokemon out along with it.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Protect may seem like the best option against Meowth as Fake Out will do far more damage than Voltorb's Sucker Punch. However, Thunderbolt will never OHKO Meowth, so with Protect, Meowth will get a chance to use one of its stronger attacks, Hypnosis, or U-turn. Sucker Punch will break Meowth's Focus Sash first turn and force Meowth to switch or get knocked out next turn. The same goes for Chimchar, although you have to watch out for a priority move of its own. </p>

<p>Lead Voltorb functions best with Pokemon that can comfortably switch into Ground-type leads, which Voltorb has the most problems with. Aqua Tail Gligar can switch into Onix, Hippopotas, and, as a bonus, Choice Scarf Machop without much problem, though by switching, you give the Ground-type Pokemon a turn to set up Stealth Rock.</p>

<p>Voltorb can usually do its task by itself, so it has relatively little need for team support. However, the ones that can support Voltorb will greatly help it. Flying-type Pokemon are great teammates, being able to switch in to Ground-type attacks, which Voltorb attracts. In return, Voltorb has access to a fast Taunt, which will prevent all leads bar Diglett from setting up Stealth Rock. Good choices for Flying-type teammates include Mantyke, which can wreak havoc without losing one-fourth of its health from switching in.

<p> Thanks to its high Speed, Voltorb can act as a great Rain Dance supporter. Even with Voltorb's frailness, it has decent enough bulk to avoid being OHKOed by most opponents. It has access to a powerful STAB Thunder, which is granted perfect accuracy in the rain. Thunder also has a 30% chance to paralyze that is useful for slowing down Choice Scarf users. The best part about Voltorb is its access to Explosion, which can deal with Pokemon that are too bulky and give a free switch-in to a Swift Swim sweeper. Taunt stops opponents that try to set up on the same turn as Voltorb, which is especially important against Trick Room teams as they give most rain teams trouble. Light Screen is an option to help your rain-abusing sweepers last longer, and gives Voltorb something useful to do when given free turns; for example, it is useful against Protect users that try to stall out the rain. Hidden Power Ice can be used over Taunt or Light Screen to hit Gligar and Diglett. However, a fast Taunt is almost too good to pass up because of how badly Rain Dance teams are countered by Trick Room teams. If your team has troubles with Snover, Hidden Power Fire is an option to eliminate the tree, but it doesn't have much use outside of that.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As Rain Dance Voltorb is mostly a support Pokemon, it needs little support of its own. However, having Pokemon that can safely switch into Earthquake can be a benefit to Voltorb. Swift Swim Mantyke works especially well as it threatens them with STAB Water-type moves and can effectively abuse rain if Voltorb sets it up. Rain teams in general greatly benefit from the removal of Snover and Hippopotas, but an opponent who knows she is facing a rain team will do everything in her power to keep her weather setter alive. Wynaut traps both of them, can avoid being 2HKOed by most Snover and Hippopotas, and can use a combination of Encore, Mirror Coat, and Counter to knock them out. Swift Swim sweepers such as Omanyte, Buizel, and Kabuto are all great partners to Voltorb, all benefiting from Rain Dance. Voltorb will greatly benefit from Wynaut, which can trap Snover and Hippopotas, and dispose of them with the appropriate move. Wynaut can also defeat Choice Scarf users, and with them removed, Voltorb will be the fastest Pokemon, being able to easily sweep late-game.</p>

<p> Because of its average Special Attack stat, Voltorb appreciates having the ability to boost its Special Attack stat via Charge Beam. This, in conjunction with great Speed, can allow Voltorb to sweep through a weakened team. The strategy is quite simple. Substitute should be used first, enabling Voltorb to scout the opponent's switch-in, avoid being hit by Sucker Punch, and judge what to do next. If Voltorb can KO a Pokemon with Charge Beam, then do not pass up the opportunity to get a Special Attack boost. If Voltorb can KO the Pokemon with a +1 Thunderbolt, use Charge Beam once, then hit it hard with a boosted Thunderbolt. Proceed to sweep your opponent's team with Voltorb's boosted Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice, which cover every Pokemon bar Chinchou.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p> You can use a Petaya Berry or Salac Berry to respectively hit even harder or outspeed every Choice Scarf user in Little Cup, barring Elekid and Diglett. Keep in mind that Voltorb does not have the highest Special Attack around, and can definitely use the extra kick that the Petaya Berry offers. Entry hazards in the form of Stealth Rock can help Voltorb a lot, since it will be forcing switches. Bronzor is a great candidate, being immune to Voltorb's only weakness, and having enough bulk to set up Stealth Rock.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Both Choice Scarf and Choice Specs can be used, but there are several threatening and common Ground-types that would just love the free turn a Voltorb locked into Electric attacks provides. Choice Scarf Voltorb can outpace almost every Pokemon in Little Cup, but with Voltorb's merely average Special Attack, it lacks the raw power to threaten many Pokemon. Choice Specs brings a welcome boost to Special Attack, allowing Voltorb to hit hard immediately, as opposed to Charge Beam which takes a turn of setup; however, losing the ability to switch moves is a heavy price to pay.</p>

<p>Magnet Rise and Thunder Wave are decent moves, but Voltorb will usually be better off attacking right off the bat. Magnet Rise helps against Ground-type leads since Voltorb can outspeed them all, and they will have trouble knocking it out without their super effective STAB attacks. Thunder Wave can be used to slow down incoming Pokemon, but Voltorb will rarely benefit from this itself as it is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier.</p>

<p>Hidden Power Ice can be replaced by Hidden Power Grass or Ground to hit Pokemon such as Chinchou for super effective damage. Hidden Power Ground hits Magnemite, while Hidden Power Grass obliterates Pokemon such as Wooper, who is hit for an easy OHKO. On the Rain Dance set, Hidden Power Water is viable; it strikes most targets harder when rain is up, but loses the invaluable OHKO on Gligar.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Diglett can come in safely on Thunder Wave or a STAB attack and OHKO Voltorb with Earthquake, but has big problems with a super effective Hidden Power and Speed ties with Voltorb. Bronzor can sponge any of Voltorb's attacks and KO it with Earthquake. Priority attacks such as Houndour's Sucker Punch, Meowth's Fake Out, and Dratini's Extreme Speed can put a massive dent in Voltorb. Gligar is immune to Electric, doesn't mind being Taunted, and OHKOs Voltorb handily with STAB Earthquake, though it needs to watch out for Hidden Power Ice. Munchlax and Chinchou both counter Voltorb pretty well, but Voltorb can Explode on them. Rock- and Ground-types such as Rhyhorn and Geodude have high Defense, resist Explosion, and are immune to Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave, but can't take a super effective Hidden Power unless sandstorm is in effect. Magnemite can easily counter any Voltorb (bar Hidden Power Ground variants) because of its resistances to Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Ice and Grass, Explosion, and Sucker Punch. However Magnemite cannot really do much in return if it doesn't carry Hidden Power Ground.</p>

<p>The best revenge killers are those that have a high offensive stat, are immune to Electric, and carry a Choice Scarf. Gible is one great example as it can easily outspeed Voltorb by one Speed point and KO it with STAB Earthquake. Likewise, Diglett can use a Choice Scarf to outspeed, trap, and KO Voltorb quite reliably, though it must beware of switching in on a Substitute.</p>
