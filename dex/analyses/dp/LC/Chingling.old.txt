[Overview]

<p>Despite having a relatively varied support movepool, Chingling is often left in the shadow of its fellow Psychic-types. Bronzor, Slowpoke, and even Natu are better choices in the majority of cases due to their superior typing and bulk. Chingling's defenses and offenses alike leave a lot to be desired, and its Speed is also below average. Due to these shortfalls, a double status set is pretty much Chingling's only shot at getting onto a team.</p>

[SET]

move 2: Thunder Wave
move 3: Heal Bell / Substitute
move 4: Psychic

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set attempts to make Chingling as useful as it possibly can be, and in some ways, the set succeeds. With its passable defenses, Chingling can take hits and strike back with its array of support options. Hypnosis and Thunder Wave are the two status moves on this set. After hopefully surviving an attack, use Hypnosis to put the opposing Pokemon to sleep. The opponent will hopefully switch out to another Pokemon, which can then be paralyzed by Thunder Wave, unless it is immune to Electric-type moves, such as Chinchou and Ground-type Pokemon. With two Pokemon of the opposing team afflicted with status, Chingling's teammates should have an easier time setting up and sweeping.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Heal Bell can remove any inconvenient status afflicting Chingling's teammates, whereas Substitute eases prediction on a switch&mdash;Chingling often only gets one chance to inflict status, so it would be unfortunate to have this chance rendered useless by Mankey or a Ground-type. It also helps Chingling avoid the ubiquitous Sucker Punch, allowing it one more shot at inflicting the opponent with status. Psychic ensures that Chingling does not become useless when Taunted, however unlikely an occurrence that may be. Knock Off is an option over Heal Bell if Scarfed Pokemon particularly threaten your team. However, Heal Bell is usually the superior support option.</p>

<p>As Chingling's defenses are not particularly stellar, it should be switching in only on resistances or immunities. Thankfully, Ground is a relatively common attacking type. Any Choice-locked Ground-type attack provides a free switch-in to Chingling and an opportunity to inflict status upon the opponent. Switching in on Fighting-types is also an option, but some Fighting-types, such as Machop, are powerful enough to break through Chingling's defenses regardless of resistance. Additionally, some opponents possess other threatening options that can easily take down Chingling; one example is Croagunk with Dark Pulse.</p>

<p>Houndour makes a fantastic partner to Chingling. Chingling is not only resistant or immune to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, two of Houndour's most common weaknesses, but it also benefits from Houndour's ability to severely damage the opponent. Carvanha works in a similar fashion, but does not lure the Ground-type attacks that Chingling craves. While not having the typing synergy that Houndour possesses, Dratini can run amok against statused teams, especially after a Dragon Dance.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Chingling has some interesting offensive options, but is outclassed offensively by Natu, who has better typing and coverage, and Abra, who dwarfs Chingling in power. The yellow bell also gets Trick Room, but has neither Slowpoke's bulk nor the suicide lead potential of Shuppet. Chingling has access to Calm Mind and Charge Beam, but is too slow and too frail to make use of the boosts.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Unfortunately, anything with a relatively strong attack can OHKO Chingling, or at least come very close to doing so. While the Double Status set can be a nuisance, one needs to worry more about Chingling's potential partners than about Chingling itself, Houndour and Dratini in particular. A combination of Scarf Mankey and Scarf Gligar can outmaneuver any of Chingling's statusing attempts, while also knocking seven bells out of it with U-turn. Most Pokemon are powerful and fast enough to outspeed Chingling and dispatch it with their most powerful attack.</p>
