[Overview]

<p>With its combination of powerful attacks, Choice Scarf, and U-turn, Mankey can be insanely threatening when used correctly. In addition, the small niche provided by Vital Spirit can be very useful when dealing with rogue Meowth or Shroomish. All in all, Mankey makes a great choice for most teams lacking revenge killers or late-game sweepers.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]
<p>Mankey's main move is Close Combat, thanks to STAB and the move's sheer power. Unfortunately, many common threats such as Gastly and Mantyke are able to laugh off the attack. Furthermore, the defense drops it brings hinders its ability to stay in. To combat this problem, U-turn is used early in the game to scout for trouble. When facing Ghost-types, Payback hits for super effective damage, and is especially helpful on a predicted switch. Punishment may be used over Payback if you use Mankey primarily as a revenge killer, especially on Ghost-types that set up, such as Drifloon. Ice Punch OHKOes Gligar, along with hitting other Flying-types super effectively.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS] 

<p>Though it hits incredibly hard, Pokemon who are either immune or resistant to Close Combat pose huge problems for this set's effectiveness as a whole. The biggest threats are Ghost-types who gain free set up turns by switching into the set's main attack. Fortunately, both Munchlax and Stunky can take care of them reliably. Wynaut poses a problem, coming in on Close Combat or Ice Punch, as Counter can quickly dispatch Mankey. A Houndour can mitigate this by using Dark Pulse and its immunity to Mirror Coat. Mankey's biggest problem is being revenge killed, as no Pokemon can cause it immediate problems.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Unfortunately, Mankey doesn't have a very good movepool, but there are a couple attacks worth mentioning. Earthquake can be used if Poison-types, most notably Croagunk, give your team trouble. Rock Slide can be used to hit Mantyke, while still hitting other Flying-types as Ice Punch does. Mankey is one of the best Beat Up users in Little Cup, but proper team support is of the utmost priority.

<p>With the switches that Mankey can cause, a Substitute and Focus Punch combination can open up holes for your sweepers. Unfortunately, due to Mankey's unimpressive Speed, once your opponent realizes that you are using a SubPunch set, they can easily prevent you from setting up for a second time and leave you without your STAB. A Substitute Salac set may be used to abuse the move Reversal, but faces the same problem as a SubPunch set.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Mankey's best counters are those who can exploit its attacks with immunities and resistances. Ghosts can switch in with ease on Close Combat and proceed to set up on their own; they are the most common threats to Mankey. Slowpoke is one of Mankey's best switch-ins and can wall any of its attacks other than U-turn. Once in, it can use either Zen Headbutt or paralyze it. Wynaut is similar to Slowpoke and can take Mankey out with Counter. When locked in on anything not named Ice Punch, Gligar walls you easily. Mantyke can cause problems, as it is able to set up on anything Mankey can throw at it. Croagunk is a threat with its plethora of priority moves and its resistances to all of Mankey's attacks other than Ice Punch. Ekans resists Close Combat, weakens Mankey with Intimidate, and can cripple Mankey with Glare.</p>
