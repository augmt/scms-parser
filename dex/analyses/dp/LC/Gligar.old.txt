[Overview]

<p>Gligar is considered to be one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the current Little Cup metagame for a few reasons: a solid offensive and defensive typing, a wide movepool that allows sets to be easily be customized, and the ability to reach 19 Speed. He is also bulky enough to take some hits and has the ability to run a plethora of different sets. So why isn't he banned from the standard Little Cup metagame? Firstly, he is weak to Ice- and Water-type attacks, which are two of the most common attacking types in Little Cup. Additionally, each type features a strong priority attack in Ice Shard and Aqua Jet. He also has quite a few checks and counters. That isn't to say he can't play around them, but they make it difficult for him to sweep teams effectively. Once said Pokemon are gone, however, it is easy for Gligar to rip teams apart.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>One of the more common sets Gligar runs is the Choice Scarf set, which boosts his already impressive Speed to incredible heights. The idea is simple: scout with U-turn to see what your opponent brings in to counter Gligar and wear it down. Earthquake is Gligar's main STAB move, but several common Pokemon are immune to it. As such, it is best used sparingly until all of the opponent's Ground-type immunities are gone. The last two slots are dependent on your team. Aqua Tail hits other Gligar as well as Phanpy, while Night Slash hits Ghost-types such as Duskull and Gastly. Be wary, because Duskull will need to have taken some prior damage to KO him, otherwise his Ice Beam will OHKO Gligar back. Stone Edge allows Gligar to hit Mantyke and Paras hard, though it doesn't OHKO Paras without Stealth Rock. Aerial Ace is useful for always OHKOing Paras and reliably hitting other Pokemon for great neutral coverage. It should be noted that Aqua Tail and Night Slash provide the greatest coverage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Due to the nature of Choiced Ground-type attacks, Gligar needs some defensive support. Gastly and Drifloon can easily switch in, set up a Substitute, and possibly sweep if your team is unprepared. This makes Munchlax an excellent teammate because he can trap and KO these Ghost-types with Pursuit. Offensively, many Pokemon appreciate Gligar's ability to lure in Bronzor and U-turn out. With this in mind, Substitute Houndour makes a great teammate for Gligar since he can set up on Bronzor.</p>

[SET]
name: Agility
move 1: Agility
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Aqua Tail / Roost
item: Life Orb / Oran Berry
ability: Sand Veil
nature: Adamant
evs: 156 HP / 236 Atk / 76 Def

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to raise Gligar's Speed to 30 after a Agility, so his usual Speed EVs are not necessary. Instead, the remaining EVs are invested into HP and Defense. With the additional bulk, this Gligar can come in on Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mankey and Gastly and set up. The only Pokemon that cause trouble for this set are Ice- and Water-type Pokemon that use priority, such as Snover, Kabuto, or Carvanha. It is recommended that you know your opponent's team and remove these threats before you attempt to sweep. After an Agility, Gligar outruns every unboosted Pokemon besides uncommon Choice Scarf variants of Elekid, Diglett, and Voltorb who tie with this set. The difference between Life Orb and Oran Berry is a matter of personal preference. Life Orb adds a handy power boost and the recoil damage is usually inconsequential to Gligar, while Oran Berry makes sure that your Gligar stays in good health even if priority users try to wear him down.</p>

<p>Earthquake and Stone Edge provide the widest range of neutral coverage, while Aqua Tail allows Gligar to hit opposing Gligar harder. Night Slash can be used in the last spot to hit bulky Ghosts such as Duskull, or Roost can be used to attempt to tank Pokemon such as Bronzor who usually wall Gligar.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>For this Gligar set to sweep, Bronzor needs to be removed. One of the best ways to get rid of Bronzor is to use Substitute Magnemite with Magnet Rise. If Bronzor comes in on Gligar, Magnemite can switch in on any move but Earthquake, set up Magnet Rise, and use Substitute. It can then KO Bronzor with Thunderbolt. Magnemite also resists Ice-type attacks that may be aimed at Gligar, so it will help Gligar even if Bronzor isn't present.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance

move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Stone Edge
move 4: Aqua Tail / Quick Attack
item: Oran Berry / Life Orb
ability: Sand Veil
nature: Jolly
evs: 236 Atk / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set aims to weaken Gligar's counters, then sweep late-game. The strategy is fairly simple: send Gligar in on a resisted attack and use one of his three attacks to weaken his counters. Once they are in KO range of a boosted attack, Gligar can use Swords Dance and sweep from there. Earthquake and Stone Edge provide excellent coverage, while Aqua Tail OHKOes any other Gligar attempting to wall yours. Quick Attack can also be used in the last slot to hit priority-users such as Snover, Carvanha, and Houndour before they hit Gligar.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>One of the downsides of using this set is that Gligar ties with all other 19 Speed Pokemon, often leading to many Speed ties. Elekid will beat Gligar 100% of the time, as most run 20 Speed and carry Ice Punch. You also run the risk of losing to Choice Scarf users, such as Chinchou and Houndour, who can OHKO Gligar with their powerful STAB moves. If you are worried about Choice Scarf users, a simple solution is to use Wynaut. He can usually take a hit as he switches in, use either Mirror Coat or Counter, and kill the Choice Scarfed Pokemon effectively. Furthermore, he is able to deal with Elekid. Wynaut is also useful for Encoring Ground- and Electric-type moves to give Gligar a chance to switch in freely and use Swords Dance.</p>

[SET]
name: Baton Pass
move 1: Swords Dance / Taunt
move 2: Agility / Taunt
move 3: Baton Pass
move 4: Earthquake
item: Oran Berry / Yache Berry
ability: Sand Veil
nature: Impish
evs: 156 HP / 76 Def / 236 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Gligar makes one of the best Baton Pass users in the metagame because of his bulk and Speed. With his diverse movepool, Gligar can choose to Baton Pass Attack and/or Speed boosts to another Pokemon that needs it. Taunt can be used in the place of a boosting move to shut down other stat-uppers or phazing Pokemon. Earthquake is used in case the boost-receiving Pokemon can't switch into the Pokemon Gligar is setting up against.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This set works especially well if Gligar is behind Reflect and Light Screen, because they allow Gligar to set up more easily. With this in mind, Magnemite is a great teammate for Gligar. Magnemite can switch in on an Ice-type attack, set up Reflect and Light Screen, and then lure in Ground-type attacks for Gligar to switch into.</p>

<p>Once Gligar has set up, he needs partners to take advantage of his boosts. Water-types such as Poliwag, Carvanha, and Totodile make great candidates since they resist Ice- and Water-type attacks aimed at Gligar. Generally, you will want to Baton Pass to a Pokemon that either has a strong priority move itself or resists most priority moves. Other options for Baton Pass recipients include Numel and Bidoof. Both of these Pokemon have Simple as their ability, allowing them to double their current stat boosts.</p>

[SET]
name: Life Orb
move 1: Earthquake
move 2: Stone Edge / Aerial Ace
move 3: Aqua Tail
move 4: Night Slash / U-turn / Substitute
item: Life Orb
ability: Sand Veil
nature: Jolly
evs: 236 Atk / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is relatively uncommon in the metagame, but it is one that can easily devastate most of the metagame. Instead of focusing on boosting Gligar's stats and sometimes being forced out by priority, this set keeps the pressure on your opponents and acts similarly to Infernape in OU. Each move hits Gligar's own counters, allowing him to break them down without much outside help. Earthquake is Gligar's main STAB move, Stone Edge hits Mantyke and Paras, Night Slash hits Ghosts such as Duskull, and Aqua Tail hits other Gligar. U-turn is another option that allows you to scout for incoming counters like Snover, who is KOed if Stealth Rock is on the field. The disadvantage to using this set is that you risk tying with other 19 Speed Pokemon, such as Staryu and Taillow, who can OHKO you. You also lose to Choice Scarf users, such as Chinchou and Houndour, who can OHKO you with their powerful STAB moves.</p>

<p>Another effective, similar moveset is Substitute / Earthquake / Aerial Ace / Aqua Tail. This set allows you to lure in opposing Snover who think you are using Earthquake, set up Substitute instead to avoid Ice Shard OHKOing Gligar, and OHKO Snover with Aerial Ace. Substitute is also useful for evading Sucker Punch. The problem with running Substitute with this set, though, is that Gligar may quickly get worn down which can cut back on his sweeping ability, especially when considering the fact that you are forced to only run three attacks.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With this set, Gligar doesn't need much offensive or defensive support; he only needs opportunities to switch in. For this reason, using Pokemon such as Mantyke to lure in Electric-type attacks from the likes of Chinchou for Gligar to switch in safely is recommended. Similarly, Magnemite lures in Earthquakes from Pokemon such as Gligar and Hippopotas, which also allows Gligar to switch in.</p>

[SET]
name: Substitute
move 1: Substitute
move 2: Roost
move 3: Earthquake / Aerial Ace
move 4: Toxic / Sand Attack
item: BrightPowder
ability: Sand Veil
nature: Impish
evs: 156 HP / 236 Def / 76 SpD

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is easily one of the most annoying sets in Little Cup due to a loop hole in the Evasion Clause. The set revolves around Sand Veil and BrightPowder, which increases Gligar's evasion by 28%. When you combine this with moves that lack 100% accuracy, such as Aqua Tail and Fire Blast, Gligar has a fairly decent chance of not taking any damage at all. After sandstorm is set up by Hippopotas, Gligar can stall out bulky Pokemon with Substitute, sandstorm damage, and Toxic, Roosting when necessary. You will want Gligar to use Substitute as often as possible to increase the chance of misses occurring. Earthquake is recommended as a powerful STAB and to make sure Gligar won't be completely defenseless against Taunt users, but Aerial Ace can be used to hit Gastly who otherwise walls this set. The last move slot, however, comes down to personal choice. Toxic is nice to hit bulky Pokemon, such as Gligar and Duskull, who can potentially kill Gligar. Sand Attack allows Gligar to cause even more switches as Pokemon become virtually unable to hit him after a Sand Attack or two.</p>

<p>The EV spread is a combination of bulk and reaching the 16 Speed mark. This is recommended because Gligar avoids KOs from other Gligar's Aqua Tails easily and still outruns 15 Speed Pokemon. However, other popular spreads are 236 HP / 236 Spe with Jolly or 156 HP / 76 Atk / 236 Spe with Jolly to force Speed ties with other 19 Speed Pokemon. It is your choice if you want the extra bulk or the ability to force Speed ties with Pokemon that can threaten you, such as Staryu and Taillow.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The most obvious partner for this set is Hippopotas. Hippopotas not only sets up a permanent sandstorm, but he also sets up Stealth Rock, which Gligar needs to be effective due to the amount of switches he forces.</p>

<p>While the set is annoying, it isn't without its proper counters. Bronzor is the hardest Pokemon to deal with because it can come in freely on Earthquake, Toxic while not taking any sandstorm damage, and nail Gligar with Psychic. Another solid counter is Snover, who can come in almost freely on either Earthquake or Substitute and stop Gligar's stalling cycle with Blizzard and Ice Shard. To deal with these Pokemon, it is recommended that you run a Fire-type Pokemon, as both Bronzor and Snover are weak to Fire-type attacks. Magnemite is also helpful since it can switch into Bronzor and trap it, while it also resists both of Snover's STAB attacks and can OHKO with Flash Cannon or Hidden Power Fire.</p>

[SET]
name: Lead
move 1: Stealth Rock
move 2: Earthquake
move 3: Quick Attack
move 4: Aqua Tail / U-turn
item: Focus Sash
ability: Sand Veil
nature: Jolly
evs: 236 Atk / 236 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Gligar makes an effective lead because he is able to OHKO most leads with Earthquake and finish off Focus Sash users with Quick Attack. Gligar also learns Stealth Rock, which he can reliably set up. Gligar has room for Aqua Tail in the final slot to deal with opposing Gligar and Ghost-type switch-ins; however, U-turn can be used to dent Bronzor as you switch out.</p>

<p>Gligar has to use many different tactics against most leads, but a majority of them can be beaten. Against Kabuto, Gligar needs to Earthquake and Quick Attack for the KO while Kabuto tries to Aqua Jet. When Chimchar or other slower Fake Out leads are seen, Gligar must use Quick Attack to break their Focus Sash as they use Fake Out, allowing Gligar to simply Earthquake for the KO. Meowth and Diglett won't be able to do much to Gligar, so you can bet that they will switch out (though Meowth will use Fake Out first), giving you a chance to use Stealth Rock. Against Aipom, Gligar has to win the second Speed tie in order to KO him, as both Aipom's Return and Gligar's Earthquake are 2HKOs. Phanpy and Hippopotas have Gligar beat, so it is recommended that you have Gligar set up Stealth Rock and switch out.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>With Phanpy, Snover, and Hippopotas being so common, Gligar will need some defensive support. Phanpy and Snover will almost assuredly use an Ice-type attack to hit Gligar, meaning Magnemite can switch in quite easily and set up Magnet Rise and Substitute. Hippopotas will be using Toxic, Roar, or Crunch after he sets up Stealth Rock, meaning Carvanha with Waterfall is a good switch-in; at worst he gets Roared away.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Gligar has a couple additional options that haven't been included yet. Gligar can run a decent physical wall set that checks most physical threats and sends them packing with Earthquake. Gligar can run Stealth Rock and Roost on this set to allow him to consistently set up Stealth Rock should it be removed. The downside of bumping up Gligar's Defense stat is that he loses out on Speed. This makes Gligar very easy to outpace and exploit due to his 4x Ice-type weakness. Gligar can also make a great Choice Band user with his powerful STAB Earthquake and ability to scout with U-turn. However, Gligar generally doesn't want to be locked into Earthquake, and with only 19 Speed Gligar, he isn't likely going to be sweeping very easily.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bronzor is probably the best counter to Gligar due to its excellent physical bulk and resistances. However, if you plan on using Bronzor to take out Gligar, Hidden Power Ice is definitely recommended. You don't want Gligar to set up numerous Swords Dances while Bronzor tickles him with Gyro Ball. Phanpy also works quite well since he has high Defense and HP while also having access to Ice Shard. He can't switch in as often as Bronzor, though.</p>

<p>Often the best way to get rid of Gligar is to revenge kill him. Choice Scarf users, such as Chinchou, Mankey, and Machop, can all easily OHKO Gligar with their super effective attacks. Gligar also despises certain priority moves, mainly Ice Shard and Aqua Jet. Pokemon such as Snover can switch in on either Earthquake or Aqua Tail and OHKO Gligar with Ice Shard. Water-types, such as Kabuto, Carvanha, and Buizel, can revenge kill a weakened Gligar with Aqua Jet as well.</p>

<p>Duskull is another wonderful counter to Gligar. He can switch into Earthquake since he has Levitate and threaten Gligar with Will-O-Wisp or Ice Beam. Be warned that, should Gligar carry Night Slash, Duskull will have a tough time switching in, especially if Gligar also carries Swords Dance.</p>
