[Overview]

<p>Even by Little Cup standards, Finneon seems like a below-average Pokemon. However, it can fill a very useful role, thanks to a very useful move rare among Water-types, U-turn. While it does not have the same raw power that Gligar and others have, U-turn allows it to perform a bait on switch which often will lure in Water-types.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Finneon is often overlooked in favor of other physical Water-types like Omanyte and Kabuto, but thanks to its access to U-turn, it is able to scout teams and help you gain an advantage early on or turn the tide late-game. The main goal of this set is to lure in Mantyke and Chinchou; once they come in, Finneon can act as a pivot to a counter like Elekid or Diglett. The moveset is fairly straightforward; much like Choice Band Scizor in OU, U-turn should be your primary move. Waterfall is a strong STAB move and Return offers pretty nice coverage alongside it. Surf or Ice Beam is the best move in the last slot, depending on your preference, as they fulfill different purposes. Ice Beam can take out opponents like Shroomish and will OHKO Gligar, but Surf is good for scoring bigger hits on more durable physical opponents and will do more to Bronzor.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Jolly nature will give Finneon 17 Speed without a Choice Scarf and 25 Speed with a Choice Scarf. The given EVs ensure an OHKO on Gligar with Ice Beam after Stealth Rock damage, provided Finneon is holding a Life Orb, as well as OHKOing Rock Polish Aron with Surf. Also, Waterfall will 2HKO standard Munchlax and U-turn will reach its maximum damage output. With the given EVs, U-turn will do around 50% to Shroomish with the given EVs.</p>

<p>The choice between Life Orb and Choice Scarf is entirely up to the user, depending on how you wish to use Finneon. A Choice Scarf will allow you to outpace other common Choice Scarf users such as Mankey and Carvanha, as well as Rock Polish Aron after a boost. However, forgoing a Life Orb will mean Finneon misses out on some vital 2HKOs on Pokemon such as Shroomish.</p>

<p>Obvious partners are for this set are Diglett and Elekid due to their ability to take out opposing Water-types. Other partners that pair well are Grass-types, particularly Shroomish for its ability to force out Water-types and start SubSeeding your opponent to death. Water-types on your team will also benefit from Finneon's ability to help lure and eliminate opposing Water-types, as do Fire-types. Wynaut can defeat this set with relative ease, assuming that Finneon is already locked in a move. Finneon is also rather frail, so most priority moves will take quite a chunk out of it. Faster Choice Scarf users are also a problem for Finneon since it has no form of priority to take them out.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Unfortunately, Finneon doesn't have many other options. Its somewhat decent movepool is ultimately let down by Finneon's poor stats. Aqua Tail is a viable option over Waterfall if you really want that 10 extra Base Power. Psybeam can be used to hit Croagunk for 4x super effective damage. Charm can also be used to force switches, as can Sweet Kiss, but they are both essentially gimmick options. Finneon does get Rain Dance, and so can fit on a Rain Dance team, but there are better users of Rain Dance in Little Cup.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Any strong priority move can knock out Finneon before it has a chance to do damage. If you are running a Life Orb, most Choice Scarf users will outpace you and be able to take you out. Entry hazards will wear Finneon down quickly. Snover can take Finneon's STAB moves and brings with it hail to do more residual damage and further wear down Finneon. Wynaut can trap and remove Choice Scarf variants that are locked into a move other than U-turn.</p>
