[Overview]

<p>Beldum is one of the more interesting Pokemon in Little Cup; its unique dual typing, impressive defenses, and decent Attack makes you ask yourself: "why isn't it more commonly used?". Unfortunately for Beldum, the lack of any support moves (and a narrow movepool in general) to make use of its bulk leave it with little it can do. Despite the aforementioned drawbacks, Beldum's decent stats and access to two solid STAB attacks give it reason enough to be considered as a member of your team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This is the best set that Beldum can run. Iron Head is Beldum's primary STAB attack, though it has mediocre coverage alongside Zen Headbutt; the combination is resisted by a number of common LC Pokemon, such as Houndour and Bronzor. The move in the third slot depends on how much you value the extra power Take Down has over Headbutt. When making your choice, however, keep in mind that Take Down's accuracy is unreliable, and that Beldum must suffer recoil damage from using it. Headbutt can be useful at times due to its 30% flinch rate. Iron Defense is Beldum's only option for its 4th moveslot, and with +2 Defense, rest assured that Beldum can take any physical attack thrown at it regardless of power and effectiveness. Oran Berry is the primary item choice as it allows Beldum to regain roughly 50% of its health instantaneously. Life Orb is a good alternative, although it's worth noting that Beldum can take a hit or two, so the Life Orb recoil damage probably isn't worth the boost in power, not to mention Beldum's poor Speed.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The given EVs maximize Beldum's Attack stat, as this is all Beldum has going for it. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense, adding to Beldum's already decent bulk, and Speed, allowing Beldum to outspeed other base 30 Pokemon. If you'd rather Beldum was able to take special attacks better, you could shift the Defense EVs into Special Defense.</p>

<p>Diglett makes a great teammate for Beldum, being able to trap slower Fire- and Electric-types, and then dispose of them with its STAB Earthquake, thus allowing Beldum to navigate the battlefield more freely. Paralysis support is useful, as Beldum is significantly lacking in the Speed department; good teammates to provide this include Nosepass and Chingling. Entry hazards support is also a necessity, as most of Beldum's counters are weak to Stealth Rock, most notably Fire-types such as Houndour and Ponyta. Phanpy and Baltoy can both set up Stealth Rock, and are able to remove the opponent's entry hazards with Rapid Spin.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Due to its extremely narrow movepool consisting of only 5 moves, there are no other options for Beldum. Regarding other set options, it lacks any support moves to play as an effective supporter, or any stat boosting moves to function as a set-up sweeper.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Due to Beldum's shallow and predictable movepool, it is not too hard to counter. Magnemite comes out as the number one counter to Beldum, resisting all its attacks and having the ability to trap it with Magnet Pull. STAB Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fire can be used to finish Beldum off (depending on Magnemite's set). Bronzor also takes a negligible amount from Beldum's attacks, thanks to its great resistances and impressive bulk, and can hit back with Earthquake, or even use Beldum as fodder to set up entry hazards or dual screens. Fire-types can deal with Beldum provided they steer clear of Zen Headbutt. Houndour has a secondary Dark-typing in addition to its Fire-typing, granting it an immunity and resistance to both Zen Headbutt and Iron Head, respectively. Ponyta, Houndour, and Growlithe all outspeed Beldum and can easily nail it with STAB Fire Blast or Flare Blitz, so having a safe switch-in for these attacks is important.</p>
