[OVERVIEW] 

<p>From the general Little Cup battler's viewpoint, Starly is seen as an inferior version of Taillow, as it has a useless ability along with a noticeably lower base Speed stat. But what allows Starly to be of any use in a Little Cup battle is access to two powerful STAB moves, Brave Bird and Double-Edge, that makes Starly a reasonable threat if given the proper support.</p>

[SET] 
name: Choice
move 1: Double-Edge 
move 2: Brave Bird / Pluck
move 3: U-turn
move 4: Heat Wave / Pursuit
item: Choice Scarf
nature: Naive
EVs: 236 Atk / 196 Spe / 36 SpA

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Due to Starly's meager defenses and average base Speed, it is unable to effectively play the role of a set-up sweeper; it must resort to using a Choice item instead to maximize its offensive capabilities. With a decent Attack stat and its Speed being boosted by a Choice Scarf, along with a decent physical movepool including U-turn, Starly is able to play the role of a revenge-killer or a scouting member on a Little Cup team.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Choice Scarf is absolutely necessary, as it gives Starly a much needed boost in Speed, which it needs in its role as a revenge-killer. The EVs given maximize Starly's Attack and Speed with a Naive nature, while the rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Attack to give Heat Wave a small power-up. Brave Bird and Double-Edge serve as Starly's STAB attacks, while Heat Wave and U-turn are used for coverage; the former hits Steel-types, and the latter is used for scouting. If you feel wary about the massive recoil Starly will take from its STABs, Pluck can be used instead of Brave Bird as a recoil-free alternative. Pluck also allows Starly to steal Oran Berries from opponents to recover HP lost from Double-Edge.  Also, if you want to be able to trap Ghost- and Psychic-types, Pursuit can be used over Heat Wave; if this decision is made, it will be beneficial to change the EV spread and nature to ones that benefit exclusively the Attack stat.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Starly's movepool doesn't contain many other options, though a set revolving around Agility can be used to remedy Starly's Speed; however, due to its meager defenses, this is not recommended. Similarly, a Tailwind or Feather Dance set can be adopted, though the chances of these sets succeeding are very low indeed. Also, a set using a Liechi or Salac Berry can be used, due to the recoil from Starly's STABs, but often Starly will be out of the skies before it can even start to sweep.</p> 

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Like all other Flying-types, Stealth Rock is Starly's bane; Starly can usually only switch in twice when Stealth Rock is up, after factoring in recoil from its STABs. Bronzor, Geodude, and Aron among others are excellent counters, as they all resist Starly's STABs and can switch in and start to set up immediately. Naturally, Pokemon that outpace Starly are also great counters, as even their weakest attacks will inflict good damage against Starly's weak defenses. They must be careful when switching into one of Starly's STABs though, as Starly is capable of taking a chunk out of even the bulkiest of switch-ins.</p>
