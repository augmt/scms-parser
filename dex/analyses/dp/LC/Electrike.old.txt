[Overview]

<p>Electrike has an interesting and unique niche in Little Cup, being the only specially-based pure Electric-type. While on paper, Electrike may seem outclassed by Chinchou, with its excellent defensive and offensive typing, Electrike does have its perks in the form of a higher Special Attack stat, Flamethrower, and Switcheroo.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Electrike can be a potent Choice attacker with its good Special Attack and decent Speed. Thunderbolt is Electrike's best STAB move, and is the main attacking option on this set. Being locked into an Electric-type attack can be trouble, however, particularly if your opponent has a Pokemon that is immune to Ground, such as Gligar. Flamethrower is a good option on this set mainly because it can hit Bronzor, one of the best defensive Pokemon in the game, for super effective damage. It also provides decent neutral coverage on the Pokemon that Thunderbolt can't hit. When choosing between Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Ground, you need to consider which Pokemon are a greater threat to your team. Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Gligar and hits other Ground-types who would otherwise be able to beat Electrike, such as Hippopotas and Phanpy, hard. Hidden Power Ground hits Electric-types, such as Chinchou and other Electrike, who could otherwise switch in on a resisted Thunderbolt. Note that if you choose to use Hidden Power Ground, Electrike needs 240 to maximize its Special Attack, so you have to sacrifice the extra point in HP.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Switcheroo is a fun move that can put the opponent in trouble if played correctly. If Electrike manages to switch items at the right time, it can give another Pokemon a free turn to possibly set up and sweep a team. An example of this would be if Electrike is about to take a Gligar's Earthquake, it could quickly Switheroo a Choice item onto it, locking it into Earthquake. This could give a free turn to your own Gligar to come in, use Agility, and sweep your opponent's team. Switcheroo is slightly less valuable with Choice Scarf because many Pokemon won't really mind; in fact, many Pokemon enjoy the boost in a Speed-centralized metagame such as Little Cup. However, it is possible to Switcheroo faster with Choice Scarf, which can be the difference between getting the Switcheroo off and not managing to do so. Switcherooing Choice Specs is nice because it can put physical attackers in a bad position, locking them into attacks while boosting their useless Special Attack.</p>

<p>One of the best checks to special attackers in Little Cup is Munchlax. But with Switcheroo, Munchlax is no longer a safe switch-in to Electrike. This means it is one of the few special attackers in the game that can beat Munchlax, which sets it apart from other special attackers out there.</p>

<p>Mantyke and Diglett used alongside Electrike can work very well. An Electrike spamming Thunderbolt is likely to draw out two types of Pokemon: Ground-types and Electric-types. Diglett does very well against the latter, trapping them and hitting them with STAB super effective Earthquake. Diglett can also trap and either kill or weaken Munchlax, who would stop a sweep by either Mantyke or Electrike. Once the Electric-type has been removed, this frees up either Mantyke or Electrike for a sweep. If a Ground-type is lured out, Mantyke can easily switch in and set up an Agility. If both Electric- and Ground-types have been removed, Electrike will have an easy time sweeping as well.</p>

<p>One sweeper that also benefits greatly from Electrike is Agility Gligar. Electrike can take out two of Gligar's primary counters, Mantyke and Snover, with Thunderbolt and Flamethrower, respectively. Electrike also invites Ground-type attacks, which can let Gligar get in for free if you predict correctly. Likewise, Electrike can give Gligar a free turn of set up if it Switcheroos on a Ground-type attack or non-attacking move.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Thunder is a viable option over Thunderbolt to help against Rain Dance teams. Rain Dance teams are one of the toughest types of teams to face in Little Cup, and Thunder can help against them because Thunder will never miss in the rain. Hidden Power Grass is also an option because it hits both Ground-types and Chinchou for super effective damage. Howl is another option on Electrike because it has decent Attack and above-average Speed, along with access to a physical priority move in Quick Attack and good coverage with the elemental fangs.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Chinchou is probably the best counter to Electrike because it can easily switch in on Electrike's two main moves, and Hidden Power Ground can be easily predicted and taken advantage of. Dragon-types, such as Dratini and Bagon, are also especially threatening to Electrike, as they also resist its two main attacks and can set up on Electrike by using Dragon Dance.</p>
