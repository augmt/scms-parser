[Overview] 

<p>To the experienced Little Cup battler, Skorupi seems like one of those Pokemon that is not particularly noteworthy, yet at the same time is not necessarily a bad Pokemon. Thanks to an excellent Defense stat, passable offensive stats, and most importantly, access to key stat-boosting moves such as Agility and Swords Dance, Skorupi is an excellent example of Little Cup's most overlooked and underestimated Pokemon. When it has been given the proper support, Skorupi can play a strong offensive role on any Little Cup team that is in need of such a Pokemon.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is probably Skorupi's best in terms of being able to pull off a late-game sweep. The use of Agility, along with its awesome ability, Sniper, helps remedy Skorupi's mediocre Speed stat and enables it to hit hard. Moves like Cross Poison and Night Slash, which greatly benefit from Skorupi's ability since they already have high critical hit ratios, maximize Skorupi's efficiency as a late-game cleaner.</p>

<p>Agility is a staple on this set, since it boosts Skorupi's less than impressive Speed. The given attacking moves are of the utmost necessity, so as to maximize this set's effectiveness. The former two, Cross Poison and Night Slash, benefit immensely from Skorupi's ability, Sniper. Aqua Tail is used simply for coverage, as Cross Poison and Night Slash are quite redundant together in terms of coverage. Aqua Tail provides unresisted coverage in Little Cup, barring Croagunk, whose unique typing allows it to resist all three of Skorupi's attacks; to remedy the Croagunk problems, you can use Aerial Ace over Aqua Tail.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The EVs given maximize Attack, so as to fully release Skorupi's potential; EV investments have also been made in HP and Defense so as to make Skorupi more durable, making sure that its sweep is not prematurely ended by priority attacks. An Adamant nature is advised, as Skorupi will scarcely need the Speed granted by a Jolly nature due to Agility; it basically needs all the firepower it can get its pincers on. Lastly, an Oran Berry is recommended as this will prolong Skorupi's sweep, although Scope Lens can be utilized if you wish to increase Skorupi's overall damage output.</p>

[SET]
name: Swords Dance
move 1: Swords Dance
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Cross Poison 
move 4: Aqua Tail
item: Oran Berry / Life Orb 
ability: Battle Armor / Sniper
nature: Adamant / Jolly
evs: 36 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 236 SpD 

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Unlike the previous set , which focused on Skorupi's ability to clean up late-game through the use of its ability and specific moves, this set revolves around sheer power granted through the use of Swords Dance. Due to its great bulk, coupled with its passable offensive prowess and Speed, Skorupi can efficiently play the role of a sweeper, in any phase of a battle, as long as necessary support has been provided by its teammates.</p>

<p>Just like the Agility set, this set utilizes a combination of moves that provides almost unresisted coverage in Little Cup, Croagunk being the only exception. However, unlike the previous set, this one does not emphasize Skorupi's ability, so instead of moves that benefit from Sniper, stronger alternatives are advised in this set. Crunch is recommended over Night Slash, and likewise Poison Jab over Cross Poison. In both cases, the higher Base Power is more lucrative than the increased critical hit chance. Finally, Aqua Tail was left on the set due to great coverage with the rest of Skorupi's moves in addition to its already good Base Power. Just like the previous set, Aerial Ace can be used over Aqua Tail if you want a way to deal with Croagunk.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>On this set, either an Adamant or Jolly nature can be utilized, with both having their merits. Although an Adamant nature greatly increases Skorupi's damage output, often the extra Speed granted by a Jolly nature is needed more. The EVs given are distributed to maximize Skorupi's offensive prowess while also investing in HP and defenses to prolong Skorupi's sweep in a battle. No Speed EVs have been suggested as there is nothing to boost Skorupi's mediocre Speed. Oran Berry is recommended once again in order to prolong Skorupi's sweep, but if you prefer the extra power given by a Life Orb, go for it. Lastly, the ability comes down to personal preference: usually, Battle Armor is the better choice on this set, although Sniper can be used if you like the elevated critical hit ratio. However, if you're going to use Sniper, it would probably be best to utilize Cross Poison and Night Slash, as they are the better moves in such a scenario.</p> 

[Other Options]

<p>Aside from what the sets suggest, Skorupi doesn't have many viable options. A Choice Scarf set could be used but isn't recommended due to Skorupi's mediocre Attack stat. Similarly, a Choice Band set could be used, but similar problems would arise due to Skorupi's mediocre Speed. To take advantage of Skorupi's bulk, you can run a defensive set, which is made more interesting by Skorupi's access to Toxic Spikes; Whirlwind is also an excellent option. Rain Dance and Sunny Day are also available, albeit limited, support options. In terms of other moves Skorupi can use, Bug Bite would definitely be a valid choice as it is not only boosted by STAB, but also eats the opponent's Berry, which is quite useful considering the prevalence of Oran Berry in Little Cup .</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Croagunk is probably one of the best counters to Skorupi, as it resists all of Skorupi's common moves bar Aerial Ace and can slowly chip away at its health while Skorupi can't do much back. Both Diglett and Gastly are also excellent counters as they can easily revenge kill Skorupi after it has taken some prior damage. Also, Fire-types like Houndour are able to KO even the bulkiest of Skorupi with their strong STABs; similarly, Flying-types like Taillow can also easily KO Skorupi with their STAB super effective attacks.</p>
