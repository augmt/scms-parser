[Overview]

<p>Stunky is one of the most unique Pokemon in Little Cup due to its typing, which grants it STAB on Sucker Punch and Pursuit and great defensive potential. Stunky is built to get rid of Ghost-types, which is greatly appreciated by many Pokemon in Little Cup. Stunky does receive competition from Munchlax, but Munchlax is only used over Stunky if the team needs to cover additional threats other than Ghosts, since Stunky is primarily a Ghost-type destroyer.</p>

<p>As a result of its typing, Stunky has only one weakness, albeit to a commonly used attacking type. Luckily for Stunky, Ground-type attacks are easily avoidable since there are so many Pokemon who are immune to them for it to fall back on, not to mention Stunky's ability to OHKO a good chunk of the Pokemon using them with Sucker Punch, such as Diglett. If you're having trouble with Ghost-types or in need of a great revenge killer, definitely consider Stunky for a slot on your team.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Stunky can use its high Speed and Attack stats to run an effective Life Orb set. Stunky can also revenge kill quite effectively with Sucker Punch, since with a Life Orb it can OHKO Pokemon such as Mantyke, Chinchou, and Staryu, whom Stunky would otherwise have trouble beating. At first glance, Life Orb Stunky might appear to be an inferior Houndour, since it lacks the sky-high Special Attack stat and Fire-type STAB that Houndour boasts; however, this is not the case, since Stunky has a higher Speed stat and a higher Attack stat. This means Stunky can tie with Pokemon like Anorith and Gastly, as long as they don't have any Speed boosts, and outpace Pokemon such as Carvanha.</p>

<p>Like most Stunky sets, there is a choice between Fire Blast and Hidden Power Ground. If you have a Pokemon like Croagunk who can easily take care of Rock Polish Aron, then Fire Blast is usually the better option in order to hit Bronzor. Fire Blast still 2HKOes Life Orb Aron if Stunky catches it on the switchin. If you want Stunky to trap Ghost-types more effectively, you can throw Pursuit over one of the other attacks, though ideally not over Sucker Punch.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This Stunky set really appreciates Stealth Rock support more than the other sets because it turns many 2HKOs into OHKOs, such as on Staryu, Chinchou, and Mantyke. It also benefits from Pokemon who can remove Choice Scarf Houndour, since it's one of the Pokemon who can actually revenge kill this Stunky set. Diglett&mdash;particularly a Choice Scarf variant&mdash;will easily trap Houndour and OHKO with Earthquake.</p>

<p>With a Life Orb boost and Fire Blast, Stunky makes a great Bronzor lure. This will benefit Pokemon, such as Gligar and Taillow, who don't function as well when Bronzor is around. Gligar and Taillow also have an easy time switching into Earthquakes that are aimed at Stunky.</p>

[SET]
name: Choice Scarf
move 1: Pursuit
move 2: Crunch
move 3: Explosion

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Stunky has a relatively high Attack stat and a decent Speed stat, so it's no surprise a Choice Scarf set is effective. The main advantage of running a Choice Scarf set is that Stunky doesn't need to rely on Sucker Punch to revenge kill. Pursuit allows Stunky to trap and KO its usual targets, such as Ghost-types, while also being able to hit them before they can move. This means that Drifloon and Gastly can't stall out Stunky's HP if it has been burned. Crunch gives Stunky a nice reliable STAB attack, as opposed to Sucker Punch, which is fairly easy to play around. Crunch will also catch many foes expecting Sucker Punch off guard. In the case that Gligar gets a Swords Dance or something else goes wrong, Choice Scarf Explosion makes a great revenge killing tool. Hidden Power Ground is for revenge killing Aron and enemy Stunky, though Fire Blast is a viable option to hit Bronzor and Snover.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>This Stunky set focuses more on sweeping than the above set, so teammates who remove physically bulky Pokemon, such as Bronzor, Gligar, and Phanpy, are recommended. A mixed Dratini would really help Stunky with these threats, as it has Fire Blast for Bronzor and Surf for Gligar and Phanpy, though it can only hit Gligar on the switch or with a Choice Scarf.</p>

<p>Stunky will often need to switch out of Pokemon who threaten it with a Ground-type attack, so any Pokemon who resists or is immune to Ground-type attacks will be greatly appreciated. Gastly and Gligar are both immune to Ground-type attacks and are both dangerous when given a turn to set up.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>A Choice Band set could work for the extra power, but then Stunky loses some of its effectiveness against Ghosts who lack Will-O-Wisp, since if Stunky lacks Oran Berry, more offensive Ghosts can 2HKO it. Stunky can use Snatch fairly effectively, as it would take care of the Pokemon relying on Substitute to play around Sucker Punch.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Stunky has a few counters worth mentioning, but many of the Pokemon who can OHKO Stunky will likely be OHKOed by Explosion first. Gligar is probably the best Pokemon to use as a Stunky counter since it outruns Stunky and OHKOes with Earthquake; Gligar also doesn't take much damage from Sucker Punch. Bronzor is arguably more effective since it can set up screens, but it needs to beware of Fire Blast. Essentially any Pokemon who can outpace and OHKO Stunky who doesn't take much damage from Sucker Punch makes a great revenge killer. Choice Scarf Houndour works quite well because of its resistance to Sucker Punch and ability to OHKO Stunky with Fire Blast.</p>
