[Overview]

<p>Gastly has all the ingredients needed to be a good sweeper: not only is it relatively fast, it also has a phenomenal Special Attack stat, a great movepool, and key immunities that give it many opportunities to switch in. However, Gastly is slower than many of the premier threats in the metagame, as it only reaches a maximum of 18 Speed. Despite this, Gastly still manages to hold its own as one of the most dominant forces in the metagame. Whether it is holding a Choice Scarf, hiding behind a Substitute, or spreading status, Gastly shows the world that even a ball of gas can cause mayhem.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Gastly is a perfect example of a Pokemon that really benefits from having a Choice Scarf; its fantastic Special Attack stat is often hindered by its inability to reach 19 Speed, meaning that it will be slower than many of the biggest threats in the tier. With a Choice Scarf, however, Gastly will be able to outspeed all unboosted Pokemon and many other Choice Scarf users as well, most notably Houndour, Chinchou, Machop, and Mankey. Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb are both powerful STAB moves, while Hidden Power Ground rounds off Gastly's coverage perfectly, hitting Stunky and Aron super effectively, two major threats to Gastly. Hidden Power Fighting also offers perfect neutral coverage alongside Gastly's STABs but it does not hit Stunky super effectively. Finally, Explosion can be used to take out a special wall, such as Munchlax. Hypnosis allows Gastly to incapacitate a counter, but its shaky accuracy makes it rather unreliable. Finally, Thunderbolt can be used to hit Water-type Pokemon, most notably Mantyke, which it OHKOes.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Normal-types can be a huge issue if you predict incorrectly, or if they come in on a predicted Shadow Ball. Taillow is especially troublesome as its Toxic Orb activates on the switch in, raising its Attack to monstrous levels and forcing you to switch. Aron is also a pest, being able to switch in on anything other than Hidden Power Fighting and set up, which can lead to a game-ending sweep. Hence, Croagunk is a great teammate because of its STAB Vacuum Wave, which can deal with both Normal-types and Aron.</p>

<p>Without a Life Orb, Gastly cannot 2HKO Munchlax, even with a Modest nature; for this reason, Timid is the better nature to use, as it allows Gastly to outspeed other prominent Choice Scarf users such as Mankey, Chinchou, and Adamant Gligar, and also allows Gastly to outspeed Aron even after a Rock Polish boost. Explosion is the preferred option as on a Pokemon as fast as Choice Scarf Gastly, it can easily take an opponent out. Hypnosis can also be used in the fourth slot, which, if it hits, can be more devastating than an Explosion, as the opponent doesn't get a free switch. Hypnosis can also be used over Hidden Power, immobilising targets such as Aron and Stunky as opposed to hitting them with a super effective move.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Although Gastly is not slow, it does not reach a Speed stat of 19, making it slower than many threats in the metagame. Substitute is one way for Gastly to sweep despite its lower Speed. With a Special Attack stat of 20 and a Life Orb equipped, Gastly can actually 2HKO Munchlax, Little Cup's premier special wall. Hidden Power Fighting OHKOes Aron, but in almost all other cases Sludge Bomb is the superior move, having both a higher Base Power and the benefit of STAB.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch is one of Gastly's more interesting options, giving Gastly priority and an unpredictability factor that it lacks if it doesn't carry the move. Even coming off of a base 35 base Attack stat, Sucker Punch can do a fair amount of damage, making Gastly a decent revenge killer for Pokemon such as Mantyke and Chinchou. Gastly is formidable but easily revenge killed, and Sucker Punch ensures that Gastly does a fair amount of damage before being taken down. Sucker Punch is, however, fairly weak, though priority is very important in such a fast-paced metagame. Gastly can also use Hypnosis to incapacitate a counter, allowing Gastly to cause even more chaos, or Explosion to quickly eliminate a troublesome Pokemon from the match.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>A Mild nature should be used if Explosion or Sucker Punch is present, but a Modest nature should be used otherwise. The EV spread maximizes Gastly's Special Attack and Speed stats, while also increasing its Attack by one point. Though Sludge Bomb provides Gastly with a very powerful STAB attack, using both Shadow Ball and Hidden Power Fighting means that Gastly has perfect neutral coverage, hitting every Pokemon in the tier for good damage, which is helped by its high Special Attack and the boost from Life Orb. Explosion is often unexpected, especially from behind a Substitute. Pokemon such as Munchlax may think they can come in and eliminate Gastly with Pursuit, only to get knocked out by Explosion.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>By utilizing both Hypnosis and Explosion, Gastly can effectively remove two Pokemon from the battle: one through Hypnosis, rendering a Pokemon useless for a few turns, and another with Explosion. Substitute and Hypnosis complement each other well; Substitute often gives Gastly two opportunities to use Hypnosis, giving Gastly a much better chance of incapacitating a foe, and in return, Hypnosis can often net Gastly a free Substitute, before firing off a powerful Sludge Bomb. If the switch-in is a specially bulky wall such as Munchlax, Explosion is a great way of eliminating it, allowing other special sweepers to wreak havoc with Munchlax gone.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Shadow Ball can be used instead of any of the moves bar Substitute, giving Gastly a secondary STAB attack and better type coverage. A Mild nature is used so that Gastly can hit as hard as possible with Sludge Bomb, while not sacrificing any power from Explosion. A Hasty nature can be used to outrun Pokemon who hit 17 Speed, such as Chinchou and Houndour, allowing Gastly to hit them with Hypnosis before they can KO Gastly. The EV spread maximizes Gastly's Special Attack and Speed, so it can hit as hard as possible and outrun most opponents, while the remaining EVs are put into HP and Attack, boosting both stats by one point.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Speed is usually Gastly's most important stat, as it needs to outspeed opponents in order to take them out. However, Gastly can lower its Speed down to 11 through the use of a Quiet nature and an IV of 0, with its frailty being a small issue thanks to the bulk being invested, which allows Gastly to take some weaker hits. This Gastly is more centered on supporting its teammates, rather than attacking straight off the bat. However, it can come back in late-game and sweep when most Pokemon are weakened. Trick Room allows Gastly to hit first against most foes after it is used, while Explosion allows Gastly to take a Pokemon out with it, if neither of its other moves will fare well. Shadow Ball gains STAB, and is the attack Gastly will be using most. Finally, Hypnosis allows Gastly to put a foe to sleep, meaning Gastly can defeat two opponents, one through the use of Hypnosis, and then the switch-in with Explosion.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Gastly is an effective user of Trick Room because of its ability to set up and cripple a Pokemon on the opponent's team, allowing the rest of your team to handle them much more easily. Though Gastly will almost always get off Trick Room, it still doesn't do well against certain leads who either carry Focus Sash, an ability that brings in weather, or priority moves. Examples of leads that Gastly can't beat include Kabuto, Snover, and Houndour. Kabuto can set up Stealth Rock, and then defeat Gastly through the use of Waterfall and Aqua Jet, while taking whatever Gastly throws at it and surviving thanks to its own Focus Sash. Snover can fire off a Blizzard, with the hail finishing off Gastly, while Focus Sash also saves it from a potential KO, if Gastly decides to attack. Houndour can defeat Gastly with a combination of Crunch and Sucker Punch, though it must watch out for Hypnosis. If Gastly opts for Hidden Power Fighting, a Speed IV of 2 should be used.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Gastly can run a Sub-Salac set, but priority is so common in the metagame that Gastly will be dispatched quickly by most competitive teams. Gastly has the credentials that make a good lead, either as a Trick-Scarf lead or a fast sleep lead, but it loses to the majority of common leads and almost always starts the match off poorly. Pretty much any combination of Substitute, Shadow Ball, Sucker Punch, Hypnosis, Sludge Bomb, Hidden Power Fighting or Ground, and Explosion can make a viable Gastly set. Gastly is strong and fast enough to use whatever combination of moves fits your team. Will-O-Wisp can be used along with Hypnosis, allowing Gastly to incapacitate a foe with Hypnosis, and then hitting the switch-in (often a physical attacker) with Will-O-Wisp, crippling them for the rest of the match. Will-O-Wisp can also be used along with Substitute, crippling Dark-type Pokemon such as Stunky, who love to switch in and defeat Gastly with its STAB attacks. Finally, Energy Ball can be used to hit Rock- and Ground-type Pokemon for super effective damage, but is otherwise outclassed by Thunderbolt, as they both hit Water-types for super effective, while Thunderbolt has a higher damage output.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Munchlax can come in on anything other than Hidden Power Fighting and threaten to trap and KO Gastly with Pursuit. Munchlax is entirely immune to Gastly's main attack, Shadow Ball, so it is a decent counter, especially for the Choice Scarf set. Teddiursa can also come in on a Shadow Ball and activate its ability, Quick Feet, making it faster than non-Scarf Gastly. Taillow functions in a similar manner to Teddiursa as a counter, being able to switch in, activate its status orb, outspeed, and do massive amounts of damage to Gastly.</p>

<p>Aron resists Ghost and is immune to Poison, making it an ideal counter to many Gastly sets. Aron also has a handy 4x resistance to Normal, making Explosion a non-issue. Without Hidden Power Fighting, Hidden Power Ground, or Hypnosis, Gastly loses to Aron entirely. Aron can easily set up a Rock Polish before striking back to OHKO Gastly with Head Smash.</p>
