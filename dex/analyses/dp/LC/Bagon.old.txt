[Overview]

<p>As far as offensive Dragon-types go, Bagon faces serious competition for a team slot with Dratini, who has the crucial advantage of priority. Of course, Bagon has selling points of its own. Its higher Attack stat makes Bagon more effective than Dratini in the middle of the game. This means that Bagon is a more solid choice for roles which do not involve setting up and sweeping. For example, when using a Choice Scarf, Bagon becomes a solid sweeper late-game. Unfortunately, Bagon's lack of priority means it will be easily revenge killed, and this is why so often it is Dratini who is lauded as Little Cup's best Dragon.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With a Choice Scarf, Bagon outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame and thus acts as a solid sweeper late-game. Outrage is a very powerful STAB move and Bagon's primary attacking option, but due to its effect of locking Bagon into the move and preventing it from switching out, it should only be used to sweep. Fire Fang allows Bagon to hit the Steel-types who resist its STAB Dragon-type moves. Hydro Pump is useful against both Gligar and Aron, who can take Bagon's physical attacks with ease. Dragon Claw gives Bagon a reliable STAB move that's useful early-game, so it isn't forced to use Outrage to pose a threat. However, Brick Break is a solid option instead if you do not trust Hydro Pump's shaky accuracy against Aron.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>While the options listed above are almost always the superior choices, there are a couple of changes worth noting should you want to beat specific threats or change Bagon's playstyle slightly. With a Choice Band equipped, Bagon becomes a valuable wallbreaker, and that added power can make a world of difference. However, the loss in Speed makes Bagon much easier to revenge kill. Lastly, Hidden Power Ice is a viable option as it can OHKO Gligar after Stealth Rock damage, but doesn't do much else.</p>

<p>While this set is effective on its own, with proper support Bagon truly becomes a force to be reckoned with. In order to give Bagon its best chance to sweep, Steel-types and Gligar need to be taken care of so that Bagon can unleash its Outrage. Houndour can easily take care of Steel-types, most notably Bronzor, while Snover is one of the best answers to Gligar in Little Cup. Stealth Rock support is also extremely helpful for Bagon due to the additional damage that can make the difference between a 2HKO and an OHKO.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>While not quite as effective as its evolution, Salamence, Bagon can use Dragon Dance in order to set up a sweep. Outrage is only resisted by Steel-types, and when backed by STAB, Dragon Dance, and Bagon's high Attack stat, it becomes a powerful sweeping tool capable of tearing apart weakened teams late-game. Fire Fang has great coverage alongside Bagon's Dragon-type STAB, since it hits the common Steel-types of Little Cup, such as Bronzor, for super effective damage. Dragon Claw allows Bagon to tear holes in the opposing team early in the game without being locked in as with Outrage, and is useful in its own right as a moderately powerful STAB move. On the other hand, Brick Break is a viable option if hitting Aron is a top priority, since it is not hit super effectively by Fire Fang.</p>

[Additional Comments]

<p>As Bagon is a sweeper, you will want to make sure that it is able to set up without taking much damage and to sweep successfully. Dual screen support from the likes of Bronzor or Magnemite is extremely helpful, allowing Bagon to set up Dragon Dance with little trouble and also giving it extra protection from priority attacks while rampaging. Both of these Pokemon are also useful teammates for other reasons, too; Bronzor can deal with Gligar using its natural bulk, immunity to Earthquake, and Hidden Power Ice, while Magnemite can trap and kill opposing Steel-types thanks to its Magnet Pull ability. Stealth Rock is also crucial to facilitate Bagon's sweep, increasing residual damage and breaking any Focus Sashes. For example, the extra damage allows Bagon to OHKO Munchlax with Dragon Claw after a Dragon Dance boost.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Bagon doesn't have much else in its physical movepool outside of what is listed in the above sets; however, it does have a wide special movepool, which can make a Choice Specs set appealing, but it would be largely outclassed by Dratini. With a minimum Speed of 9, Bagon can function effectively under Trick Room with a Choice Band.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>The easiest way to deal with Bagon is by revenge killing it with priority. Snover, Phanpy, and Swinub all have super effective priority attacks in Ice Shard, but other revenge killers who utilize priority attacks, such as Croagunk, can do the job equally well. Against Choice Bagon, the easiest thing to do is simply switch in a Pokemon that resists whatever attack Bagon is locked into. If Bagon is locked into Outrage, Steel-types are good responses thanks to their resistance to Bagon's STAB attacks. Bronzor in particular has high Defense and can use Hidden Power Ice to dispatch Bagon promptly.</p>
