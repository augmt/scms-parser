[Overview]

<p>Elekid is a very fast, strong Pokemon in the Little Cup metagame. It is arguably the best of the Pokemon with 20 Speed due to its superb coverage and access to reliable priority. With a little bit of support, Elekid can easily sweep through teams that don't have a Pokemon with Choice Scarf equipped. However, it is far from indomitable and has trouble with many common threats.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Elekid is one of Little Cup's premier physical sweepers. With access to a very wide variety of moves, Elekid is able to dispatch all but the most defensive of opponents in one or two hits. Munchlax falls to Cross Chop after Stealth Rock damage, Gligar is OHKOed by Ice Punch, and Mantyke cannot deal with Thunder Punch. Quick Attack allows Elekid to outpace Sucker Punch users and get a last-ditch hit in on Choice Scarf Pokemon. If Cross Chop's accuracy is too shaky, then Low Kick will easily dispatch of threats like Aron, Munchlax, and Onix with ease, while dealing less damage to Chinchou, Porygon, and other lighter foes.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As good as it is, however, physical Elekid does have quite a few shortcomings. Machop's superb bulk and powerful STAB Dynamic Punch presents an issue due to the fact that Machop often carries Choice Scarf, meaning it will typically outpace Elekid and OHKO with STAB Dynamic Punch.</p>

<p> Elekid likes a Pokemon who can scout for threats while also dealing damage to weaken your opponent's team. Choice Scarf Gligar can scout, weaken a team, and help Elekid switch in safely all in one, making it Elekid's best friend. Gligar is also able to come in on Elekid's Ground-type weakness with impunity. Scarf Mankey can also use U-turn quite effectively to slowly chip away your opponent's health for Elekid's endgame sweep. Anorith is a good user of Stealth Rock, as well as a good Rapid Spinner to allow Elekid and its U-turning partner to switch in without taking residual damage from entry hazards.</p>

[SET]
name: Mixed Attacker
move 1: Thunderbolt
move 2: Ice Punch
move 3: Low Kick / Cross Chop
move 4: Hidden Power Grass / Psychic
item: Life Orb
nature: Hasty / Naive
evs: 92 Atk / 160 SpA / 240 Spe

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Elekid is also perfectly capable of running a mixed set thanks to its wide movepool, high Speed, and good attacking stats on both ends. Thunderbolt's much higher Base Power affords it a stronger hit against most foes. Ice Punch again scores a nice KO on Gligar, and gets nearly-unresisted coverage combined with Thunderbolt. Low Kick can OHKO non-defensive Munchlax with Stealth Rock damage, but unfortunately misses out on the KO on Magnemite, which Cross Chop achieves. Hidden Power Grass allows Elekid another way to hit opposing Chinchou, while Psychic gives Elekid a sure-fire OHKO on Croagunk and Gastly.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>As strong as mixed Elekid can be, it has several downsides. The most significant of these is the power loss of Low Kick and Ice Punch as a result of EV splitting. It also lacks priority, meaning it can be revenge killed by weakened priority abusers that it would ordinarily be able to deal with easily. Moderately defensive Munchlax variants will also survive its Low Kick, get Oran Berry healing, and then KO back with Return or Earthquake.</p>

<p>Mixed Elekid's favorite partners are strong, Speed-boosting sweepers, such as Gligar, Mantyke, Chinchou, and Cranidos. Elekid's ability to weaken most foes into KO range lets these cleaners get an easy sweep later in the game.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Elekid can use Fire Punch to get better damage against Bronzor, who can threaten it with Earthquake. Meditate lets Elekid have reliable access to a boosting move, albeit a weak one. Screech lets Elekid OHKO most Pokemon with its wide coverage, though it does not like taking a hit to pull it off. Focus Sash is an option on any set barring SubKid to allow Elekid to revenge kill Choice Scarf users. Mantyke, Gligar, Gastly, and Mankey are all common users of Choice Scarf who can OHKO Elekid, but cannot beat it if it carries a Focus Sash.</p>

<p>Elekid's EVs are fairly straightforward. Its Speed should always be as high as possible, as it hits the magical 20 Speed number, reached only by itself, Diglett, and Voltorb. When using Life Orb, Elekid uses an HP IV of zero, as that allows it to take one HP of damage per use of Life Orb rather than two. If Hidden Power Grass is used, Elekid should use an HP IV of two to retain the Life Orb damage mitigation while keeping its Hidden Power type.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Elekid has difficulty with Bronzor, even when it uses its gimmicky Fire Punch, and is OHKOed by Earthquake. Physically defensive Munchlax is not OHKOed by Cross Chop, and gives variants lacking Substitute difficulty as it OHKOes Elekid back with Return or Earthquake. Pokemon who commonly use priority moves can also outpace and whittle down Elekid or bluff using priority and KO it outright, such as Croagunk and Houndour.</p>

<p>Wynaut can take advantage of Elekid to allow a teammate such as Gligar set up or KO it outright with Counter or Mirror Coat. Dratini can switch in on Thunder Punch and KO a weakened Elekid with Extreme Speed. Duskull has sufficient bulk to survive Elekid's attacks and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Additionally, virtually any Pokemon wielding Choice Scarf that can take one of Elekid's attacks will be able to defeat it. Chinchou and Gligar are particularly effective in that respect, both able to easily KO Elekid and survive the switch-in. Gligar must beware of Ice Punch of course, and Chinchou of Cross Chop.</p>
