[Overview]
<p>While its pure Ice typing will often lead players to look for other options, Snorunt is highly viable in today's metagame. Sporting decent stats across the board, strong STAB, as well as an interesting but shallow movepool, Snorunt has more than enough wherewithal to carve a place for itself in Little Cup. It may not be the one to sweep the opponent's team, but it certainly has the tools to help others do so, whether it be by weakening the opponent's team, or laying Spikes down for some crucial passive damage.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>When placed in the lead slot, Snorunt fares well against almost all other leads. Inner Focus renders Fake Out unable to flinch Snorunt, and the combination of Ice Beam and Ice Shard lands a 2HKO on many an opponent, most notably Hippopotas, Snover, and Voltorb, three prominent weather-inducing leads. Lead Diglett can also be defeated, but one must be wary of Sucker Punch after taking an Earthquake. Hidden Power Ground allows Snorunt to damage leads who resist its STAB, while Hidden Power Grass allows Snorunt to beat Omanyte, Kabuto, and Onix. Spikes is placed in the last slot for team support, and should be used to incite mind games against faster Sucker Punch users.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Hidden Power Ground can damage lead Houndour, which is usually resistant to Snorunt's main STAB attacks. Aside from that, Hidden Power Ground also provides good coverage. On the other hand, Hidden Power Grass is useful in killing Pokemon such as Onix, Kabuto, and Omanyte. This set can also run Crunch or Protect. Though Protect does not provide the obvious benefits of the current moves, it can be used to scout the opponent's moves, especially those of Choice users. Bulky Water-types, such as Buizel and Clamperl, that can check Fire-types can be good teammates for Snorunt. Slowpoke can be a good teammate too, as it covers most of Snorunt's weaknesses and deals with lead Machop well.</p>

<p>Snorunt's major advantage over other users of Spikes is its immunity to hail. With 15 Speed, Snorunt is much faster than Omanyte and Pineco, the other common users of Spikes, while retaining its decent bulk. Thus, Snorunt fits into offensive teams much more easily, since it can create many opportunities to set up Spikes. Snorunt's neutrality to most special moves, barring those of the Fire-type, means that it will only be 3HKOed at best with Oran Berry, enabling it to set up at least two layers of Spikes every time. Ice Shard and Crunch allow Snorunt to whittle down the opponent's HP once it has set up Spikes.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Snorunt's Speed is its major asset over other users of Spikes. However, if bulk is what you are looking for, then Snorunt isn't the ideal choice, as there are other Spikes users that outclass it in that area. Protect allows Snorunt to scout the opponent's team and see what move a Choice user picks. As with pretty much any Pokemon that sets up entry hazards, a Ghost-type will make a great teammate for Snorunt, as they can prevent its hard work from getting spun away. Flash Fire users and Fighting-types carrying a Choice Scarf also make good offensive teammates to Snorunt. A Stealth Rock user such as Gligar is also a good choice for a teammate considering how Spikes only affect grounded Pokemon.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Snorunt has a barren movepool, and has few other options it can considering using. Snorunt can use an alternative 36 HP / 196 Atk / 36 Def / 36 SpD / 196 Spe EV spread to counter Gligar. Aside from that, however, the given sets pretty much cover everything that Snorunt can do effectively in Little Cup.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Fast Fire-types are the best checks to Snorunt, as they can swiftly dispose of it with their STAB attacks. Fighting-types can also deal with it easily, as Snorunt lacks a way of taking them down quickly. Bronzor walls Snorunt completely, and can bring down Snorunt with Gyro Ball. In general, anything that outspeeds Snorunt, has a resistance to its STAB Ice-type attacks, and can KO it with ease makes a good counter.</p>
