[Overview]

<p>Geodude is often in the shadows of its fellow Speed-boosting Rock-types Rhyhorn and Larvitar. The ultimate proof of Geodude's distinction from its counterparts is when it uses Explosion on the many physically defensive Pokemon that Rhyhorn and Larvitar can't touch. In addition to this, Geodude also has Sucker Punch in its arsenal to check faster threats such as Gastly. Overall, Geodude has a few advantages over the other Rock-types that give it a comfortable niche in the Little Cup metagame.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>Geodude is capable of running a utility set thanks to its high Defense stat. The basic premise of this set is to come in on something that can't touch Geodude, like physical Meowth (watch out for the rare Water Pulse!), and use Stealth Rock on the switch out. After setting up Stealth Rock, the next set of turns depends on which attack Geodude uses. Sucker Punch lets it combat faster threats, while Explosion gives it a powerful move to use against physically-defensive Pokemon like Phanpy, Gligar, and Hippopotas. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>There are two moves that set Geodude apart from Rhyhorn: Sucker Punch and Explosion. Sucker Punch is an excellent move against frailer Pokemon who try to pick Geodude off at low health. Explosion makes a great finishing move after using Stealth Rock, that allows the next Pokemon to come in safely. Earthquake is Geodude's obligatory STAB move which allows it to hit Rock- and Steel-types for super effective damage. This includes Cranidos, Aron, and Shieldon. Stone Edge can be an option over Earthquake, but this leaves Geodude helpless when facing Aron.</p>

<p>Water-type threats such as Mantyke and Chinchou can threaten Geodude. A Chinchou of your own can handle these threats. As an added bonus, Chinchou's convenient resistances to Ice- and Water-type moves allow it to come in on hits directed toward Geodude. Duskull also works well alongside Geodude because it is immune to Ground- and Fighting-type hits. Duskull can cripple many physical threats like Gligar and Mankey with Will-O-Wisp.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>With its access to high-powered STAB moves, Explosion, and a high Defense stat to handle priority, Geodude can make for a dangerous Rock Polish sweeper that can plow through teams. While Geodude's Speed isn't remarkable to begin with, one Rock Polish brings it up to 22, which is enough to outrun every Pokemon who doesn't carry Choice Scarf. Geodude has multiple opportunities to use Rock Polish despite its middling Speed, as its typing and great defensive stats allow it to set up on many Pokemon. The moves are quite basic: Stone Edge and Earthquake are there for dual STAB and impressive coverage, while Explosion makes an excellent finishing move.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>Geodude is blessed with high-powered STAB moves to work with, as Rock- and Ground-type attacks provide near-perfect coverage, and are only resisted by Bronzor and Baltoy. Stone Edge deals huge amounts of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Earthquake compliments Stone Edge, as it hits Steel-types for super effective damage. The final slot is given to Explosion. It is often said that Larvitar and Rhyhorn greatly outclass Geodude as a Rock Polish user; however, Geodude's niche is dealing huge amounts of damage with Explosion, which provides Geodude with a powerful move to OHKO physically-defensive Pokemon such as Gligar, Phanpy, and Hippopotas. Take note that Explosion will miss out on OHKOing Hippopotas and Phanpy on the spot, however.</p>

<p>Oran Berry can be used over Life Orb to help Geodude set up much easier. However, 18 Attack without Life Orb will greatly hinder Geodude's sweeping capabilities. Chople Berry can be used over Life Orb to lure in Croagunk. The given EVs provide at least a single point in each stat, except for Special Attack.</p>

<p>Bronzor is one of the best Geodude counters because it resists both of its STAB moves and can take Geodude down with Flash Cannon. It is advised that Geodude pair up with a strong Fire-type like Magby or Ponyta in order to keep Bronzor at bay as much as possible. However, if one is looking to lure in Bronzor, Meowth makes a good partner as it can neutralize it with Hypnosis if Bronzor decides to come in. Dratini does an excellent job as well because it can take away a huge portion of Bronzor's health with a boosted Waterfall or Fire Blast.</p>

<p>The most common defensive Pokemon that switches in on Geodude is Gligar. Anyone who appreciates having Gligar removed from the match are considered excellent offensive partners to keep alongside Geodude, since it will usually lure and KO Gligar with Explosion. Most players rely on Gligar as a defensive backbone on their team, and once Gligar is removed, teams are usually open to threats like Choice Scarf Machop, Aron, and Croagunk. The former three make exceptional offensive partners as they take advantage of Gligar removed from the match.</p>

<p>Super effective priority moves will trouble Geodude and can OHKO it or leave its HP depleted. Croagunk, Snover, and Carvanha threaten Geodude with their respective priority moves. Wynaut, Gligar, and Munchlax can handle these Pokemon well. Wynaut does a flawless job of checking Choice Scarf Carvanha and Snover, as Wynaut can trap and kill them with Counter or Mirror Coat.</p>

[SET COMMENTS]

<p>This set is another testament as to why Geodude is not entirely outclassed by its Rock-type brethren. Despite its low Speed, Geodude can punch holes on many teams with its fantastic dual STAB moves, and utilize Sucker Punch to deal with faster foes. However, the tried-and-true strategy of this set is to lure in Bronzor, a common switch-in to Geodude. Bronzor will have to be extra cautious when switching in on Geodude, because a predicted Stone Edge followed up by Fire Punch will spell doom for it. Earthquake provides extra coverage and another STAB. Explosion can go over Earthquake if you'd prefer to guarantee yourself a free KO.</p>

[ADDITIONAL COMMENTS]

<p>The final slot ultimately depends on what benefits your team most. Earthquake smacks Steel- and Rock-types around for super effective damage, and provides optimal coverage alongside Stone Edge. However, Explosion is always a superb option over Earthquake to deal huge amounts of damage to bulkier Pokemon like Gligar, Hippopotas, and Phanpy on the switch thereby opening holes for fellow teammates to sweep. Including Explosion over Earthquake is not a significant loss, as Fire Punchalone provides decent coverage alongside Stone Edge.</p>

<p>Geodude is one of the best Bronzor lures out there, and as such, anyone who values Bronzor's removal from the match are considered good offensive partners. Tailow, Dratini, Gible, Bagon, Eevee, and Doduo benefit from Bronzor's removal, as it makes their sweeps sufficiently easier.</p>

<p>Gligar's high Defense stat and unique typing make it an ideal check to Geodude. Pairing Geodude with someone who can take Ground-type hits like Duskull and Gligar can be very accommodating for Geodude. Wynaut is also a possible partner who can dispatch Gligar from the match by trapping it. As an added bonus, Wynaut also covers a number of Fighting-type threats who also threaten Geodude. Water-types like Mantyke are a major threat to Geodude, and partnering it with Chinchou ensures they don't get out of hand.</p>

[Other Options]

<p>Geodude has a couple of nifty moves it can use, such as Thunder Punch, Curse, and Counter. Thunder Punch can fit in on the Rock Polish set to damage Water-types on the switch. Curse could further boost its already-high Defense stat and its Attack stat, but it doesn't have the Special Defense stat to constantly take special hits although Curse with Sucker Punch is possible to bypass the lowered speed brought on by Curse. Counter can work well if Geodude can load up on its HP and Defensive stats to grab a surprise kill. Geodude can run a Choice Band set as well with Sucker Punch / Explosion / Earthquake / Stone Edge. If Geodude is looking to increase its physical defense by two points, it can go with the EV spread 196 Atk / 116 Def / 196 Spe.</p>

[Checks and Counters]

<p>Bronzor is the safest switch-in to Geodude for the most part with the one exception of when Geodude packs Life Orb. Bronzor resists every single hit except for Fire Punch, and can 2HKO back with Flash Cannon. Geodude will switch out for the most part, and this will allow Bronzor to take advantage of the extra turn to set up Stealth Rock or dual screens.</p>

<p>Geodude's Speed is pretty discouraging and any faster Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-types can be considered counters (assuming Geodude has not set up Rock Polish yet). If Geodude lacks Explosion, bulky Ground-types like Phanpy, Hippopotas, and Gligar can check Geodude pretty well, and the former three can strike back with Earthquake for a possible OHKO. Mantyke and Chinchou can scare away Geodude with Surf, and can take advantage of the free turn to use Agility. Choice Scarf Mankey can outpace the Rock Polish set and threaten Geodude with Close Combat.</p>
