[smogon/scms](https://github.com/smogon/scms/) is apparently now defunct, and thus this repository has been cleaned out and will no longer be updated. It and its commit history will remain intact for the time being.

Smogon setdex files are available at [Zarel/honko-damagecalc](https://github.com/Zarel/honko-damagecalc/tree/master/js/data) and are updated sporadically.
